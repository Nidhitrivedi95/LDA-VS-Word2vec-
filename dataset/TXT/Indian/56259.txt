xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA After reading other people's raving reviews, I decided to try it myself. I'm not a roti fan and have had only a couple of them prior to my visit to Leela's. When I got there, there was only 1 other person waiting for his order, and I was wondering why it took so long to get my mini roti. For a grand total of $3.50 (including tax), I wasn't expecting much. I drove home and unwrapped the piping hot goodness. I ordered chicken (bone-in) roti, medium spice - I ate half and had to drink 2 glasses of water! The flavours were definitely all there and the portion was huge! I can't imagine what the full size order will be like. I'm excited to go back and try the other items on their menu.
