The food the past couple of times has been spot on and the service is getting better.  My first lamb dish was tough and almost inedible so I want to try that one again to see if there is any improvement. They still need to pay attention to the heat level so you may need to reiterate your spiciness choices to make sure you get what you want.  I ordered Tandoori chicken a 4 (out of 10) and my Aloogobi a 2.  It was reversed.  I have only tried the Indian selections so far but plan to go back and try some of the Nepalese dishes.  They also deliver so that is a plus for sure.  One more thing, they do NOT close mid-day like a lot of Indian restaurants to that is huge for me as I don't take a lunch until quite late in the day when most Indian restaurants have shut down for siesta.  Enjoy!
