Very modern inside, with limited seating, so definitely make a reservation. There was a beautiful lengha hanging, and the host told us that the chef was supposed to get married in that outfit, but left to pursue a career as a chef. 

We started off with cocktails, and I chose the whiskey tamarind. This was very refreshing, and garnished with ginger, which gave it a nice kick. The other drinks my friends had were OK but, the whiskey tamarind was a winner. 

For snacks, we had the naan kebab, pakora frites, roasted cauliflower, and a beef paratha taco. The mains were the shrimp, ismaili beef curry, and lamb. The pakora frites were mostly just tasting fried batter, which was disappointing. The taco was loaded with beef, but wasn't anything exciting. I loved the naan kebab and the cauliflower. Both flavoured so well, but not overly spicy. I really enjoyed my ismaili beef curry, especially the richness of the peanut flavoured broth. However the basmati rice we got on the side was hard,  which did not make it enjoyable. The lamb was also very delicious and cooked to perfection. 

The service was very slow, which made it a bit frustrating. The food just took too long to come out. The price is pretty much standard for queen west, and between the three of us it was 47 each, with tip. I'd like to come back and try their khao shay!
