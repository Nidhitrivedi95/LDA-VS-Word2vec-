YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q I've given this place three shots as I regularly work and go to class just a few blocks away.  Each time I was disappointed.  In all three cases, the rice was not fresh and the main disk was lukewarm.  If you want a good laugh, order the Chicken Tikka Masala.  Best of all, the owner will blow you off until you actively try to order.
