The curry itself was delicious. Had a nice flavour, the koftas were big and plump (I actually thought they gave me the potato one by mistake at first) and the spice is just right (if you prefer your curry spicier I'd recommend saying so when you order cause for indian this is on the milder side). The garlic naan however was disappointing...it barely tasted like garlic and I've had much better naan elsewhere in the city. If I'm paying almost $5 for naan, it better be amazing! Should also note that unlike some indian places, their curries do not include a choice of rice or naan automatically, so you are paying 4-5 bucks on top of the listed price for curry.
Portions are very big, but not unusual as most indian places I find you can easily get one curry and have it for two meals. 

The family who runs it seems very lovely though, attentive and had a warm presence. Unfortunately I think when you start charging almost $20 for indian food (no desserts or apps even for that price), you are really limiting the scope of guests who'd come on a regular basis (hence why there were barely any sit-in diners... considering you'd have to pay tip on top of that price).
