zI9XhdRLVkL9leCCIrLZ7w The Verandah is a great Indian restaurant for tasty food and friendly service.  I came here just last week with some friends and we all left satisfied that we had had a filling, value for money meal.  The interior decor of this place feels stylish and relaxing with plenty of neatly arranged and clean tables.  
The menu has an extensive range of authentic Indian dishes and, strangely, some European classics like roast chicken!  I went for the chicken Bhuna which, along with rice and a naan bread came to just over a tenner.  It didn't take long at all to arrive and tasted amazing when it did.  The chicken was obviously excellent quality and the sauce was creamy with a great range of flavours.  
For delicious Indian food and friendly service, The Verandah is the place.
