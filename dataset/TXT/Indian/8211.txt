7KKugTC6WXZpypifkf9i7Q This place does Hakka food--that is a fusion of Chinese & Indian, for those not aware.  In reality, they also do pure Chinese, Thai and other various random dishes.

Definitely not a superb dining place... decor is pretty blah, service is barely acceptable, but the hey.. there is always the ultimate upside--food is cheap!  Dirt cheap.  

Lunch only:  $5.95 -$6.95, for "something-on-rice"... 

What is that something?  Chicken & mixed vegetables, mango chicken, general whoever chicken, etc.. All in all, they had a choice of about 30 lunch dishes.

I recommend crispy ginger chicken.  It was breaded chicken pieces, deep fried, in a spice/sweet/sour sauce.  It had a lot of orange zest, which was a nice touch.  The bombay chicken was quite good too (sampled my friends'), which was quite spicy/garlicky/coriandory. 

Oh, and they also throw in a pretty bad spring roll and a can of soda (or in my case, a Nestle bottled water).

For you lazy asses who never pack lunch and eat out all the time, here is a good alternative. Cheaper than your $6.99 Wendy's salad and you still get a drink :)
