UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w Recently visited this place with my wife after a long time. Ordered chaat, Bhindi, and Daal Palak. Let me just start by saying this, if you want cheap, quick, non authentic out of the package food then this is your haven. Theres no real cooking here. Dirty tables. Half the employees dont speak english. Dont get me started on the restroom. You feel more dirty coming out of the bathroom even after washing your hands. Least they can do is clean up the restrooms. Oh well, Lets move on to the food. Bhindi was raw and hard. No spices what so ever. Daal Palak had 4 leaves of palak. Why call it daal palak, just say daal. 

Papdi chaat is out of the box and doesnt taste good. 

Worst part about the experience is their customer service. Rude, no gratitude what so ever. I dont understand how can they even be in business for so long with this kind of service? Or its just as Desis we dont expect service?
