_PKXarw3GjlbwbXhjdpUMA The tastiest Hakka Chinese food I've tasted in Canada. And their quality and quantity has been consistent for many years now. Only take out. Busy place but very efficiently run by some very pleasant people. Try their crispy ginger beef and Tangra villa specials. Food is always fresh and with generous portions of meat or seafood. Veggies are always done just right.
Worth a try and definitely worth going back for more.
