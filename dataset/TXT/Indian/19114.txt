f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I walked in as the restaurant opened with my friend who was just passing through for lunch. I just moved to the area and was hoping to find some great places to eat. I was full of hope when a man placing items on the buffet told us to have a seat. I wanted to see a menu and actually place an order. NOPE. I sat there for over 20 minutes talking to my friend. I had to get back to work and because they did not acknowledge our presence in that time span we left. SO sad.
