0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ This was my first time here and the food was quite good.  Between me and my friends, we ordered the butter chicken, the crispy beef, and the lemon chicken.  The butter chicken was my favourite dish - it was really creamy, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The crispy beef was delicious and had a hint of spiciness, but there was a pretty strong ginger taste, so it's not for everyone.  The lemon chicken was flavourful, but nothing spectacular.  

The price is reasonable for their portion sizes, which are huge.  We ordered three extra bowls of rice, which was a mistake because they pack these big bowls full.  Overall, a delightfully surprising find that I would definitely recommend.
