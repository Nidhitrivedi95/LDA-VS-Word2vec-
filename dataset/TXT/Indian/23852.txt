gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Deelish! My friend and  I went after finding the place on yelp when looking for Indian in Las Vegas. In an odd part of town, and not the best of areas- the food is really really good. 

We had the lunch buffet, and it was so good that we could not stop eating even though we were both full. The gentleman who greeted me was so nice and sat me right away. I never had to ask for a refill on my water as he was very attentive to that was well. The only negative thing I would even mention is that I wish that the dishes had an english description in addition to the indian names because there were many that I had no idea what it had in it. I like to try new things so it wasn't a huge issue, but it would have been nice to know what I was eating. 

Definitely worth a try, especially when you get eat for two people under $25
