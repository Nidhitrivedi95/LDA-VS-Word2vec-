gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Had dinner here tonight and we shared the chicken korma, tikka masala, and channa masala. All were delicious....even the small plates like garlic naan and samosas. The medium is fairly spicy so it is plenty of heat for anyone. I'd recommend any of our dishes, particularly the korma. The owner, Prakash, greeted us and showed true hospitality which is rare sometimes in Vegas. We look forward to our next visit!
