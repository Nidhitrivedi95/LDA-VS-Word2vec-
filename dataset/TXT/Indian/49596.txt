tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My visits to this little gem all started a few years ago before I went to grad school. I was very sad to leave the Phoenix area as I knew I would not have India Oven in my life for a while. But then when I found myself back in the valley after graduation I was SO pleased to see that nothing has changed. 

The quality is still excellent and the service is always welcoming and attentive. My favorite aspect about the buffet is that tea and mango lassis are included which is a welcomed treat, IMO. Lots of dishes to choose from for those of us who don't consume meat and lots of options for those who do. The atmosphere is cool and comfortable on a hot day. 

The only thing that keeps me from giving a full five star grade for this review has to do with variety. I think that the establishment could mix up 'the usual dishes' now and then to keep those of us who frequent the restaurant often enticed.

Bottom line, GO CHECK OUT INDIA OVEN. This local family owned restaurant will be glad you did!
