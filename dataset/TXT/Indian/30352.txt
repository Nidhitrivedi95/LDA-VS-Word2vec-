K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Food: went there for their lunch buffet. Pretty tasty food. For $10.99/adult and $6/child it's a steal! Butter chicken kids loved. Freshly made naan when you sit down. All the other curries were tasty. If I want my Indian food fix, this is a good place to go. Dessert bar also include fresh fruit. Papaya was very interesting for the kids. 

Staff: friendly and attentive. 

Def will come back again.
