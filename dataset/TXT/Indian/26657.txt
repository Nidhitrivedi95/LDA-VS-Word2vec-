Chicken manchurian was all dark meat, old, and not anything tasty. Blah.. I would not order again. My recommendation is for them to use fresher ingredients, cook fresh (plenty of places are able to do fresh buffet style serving on the cheap), and please provide options for white meat. 

I was so looking forward to some desi food tonight.
