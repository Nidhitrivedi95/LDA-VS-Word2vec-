GRIRHR35knxFo0qySwIysw This is a wonderful place to have lunch or dinner. It's a small family owned restaurant and the woman who owns it is just great. We were here on vacation, we love Indian food but don't have much of it back home. The owner was incredibly helpful with ordering and helping us pick food that we would enjoy. You can tell she truly cares. The food was phenomenal and the whole place smelled amazing. I would definitely recommend this place.
