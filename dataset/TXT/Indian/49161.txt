tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Yes! So excited to have found this place! The food is phenomenal! My husband and I were craving Indian and wanted something other than the South Indian place we usually go to... I looked in the area and was happy to see India Oven was so close to us. We ordered three dishes (I was hungry, what can I say) and we couldn't be happier with each and every one of them! My husband picked up the order and talked to someone there who said they had been in business for 33 years! You aren't in business for that long if your food isn't good! Not sure what the bad reviewers are talking about?? They must be competitors trying to get business. So happy to have found good Indian nearby!
