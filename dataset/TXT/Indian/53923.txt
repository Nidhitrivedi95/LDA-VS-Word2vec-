VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ Good home cooked authentic Indian food rivaled by none other that I have tasted! Love the Veggie Korma tried it a little spicier this time, they gave me about an eight (on the spicy) scale. It was amazing the atmosphere takes you out of this world, friendly staff are there to help you order to your taste. Can not say enough about the Guru Palace!
