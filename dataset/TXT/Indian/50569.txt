UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Hands down my favourite indian restaurant in Toronto. Solid, well rounded spice, available authentically hot. Good ingredients and variety on the menu, decent atmosphere and fair prices. I particularly like the okra and daal makhani. Fresh and not overly oily. It's not the best indian i've had in my life, but it's the best i've found in Toronto.
