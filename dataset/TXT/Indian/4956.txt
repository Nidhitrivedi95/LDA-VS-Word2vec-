2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw You get the smell of pungent non veg as you enter the resturant. .. nonetheless I can't say about the food as I was refused to be served coz I didn't make a reservation.

 It make sense to refuse if the resturant was full or there was any waiting. But there was none, it was more than 70% empty.   I had gone there around 6:30 pm and waited till 6:45 pm to see if anyone with reservation came...nobody came and I too decided not give them my business... this one resturant is off my list.
