O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg I actually used to eat here when it was Kashmir Palace.  Seeing it under new ownership I had to give it a try.

I ate buffet and I will always acknowledge that buffet isn't the best example of the made-to-order food from the menu.  Having said that, the previous ownership had an awesome buffet.  This buffet now isn't necessarily bad, but it's not great.  It's just kind of good.

What really ruined it for me is the dirty water glasses.  I tend to discredit the entire establishment when they can't serve clean water.  Makes me wonder about the conditions in the kitchen if the best glass you can give a customer has stuff floating in it.

I would not recommend this place.
