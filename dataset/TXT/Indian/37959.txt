This place definitely takes the cake.  My buddies and I were looking for a place to eat after a long night of drinking.  We figure, what else would be good but Korean BBQ for a hangover, but unfortunately, the Korean BBQ was closed and we settled for this place.

Upon being seated at this establishment, the waiter asked us if we would like to "supersize" our meals with lentil soup.  It sounded good, but the additional $6 cost for a small cup is unwarranted, and never mentioned by the waiter or the menu.  The waiter never even mention to us that the cup of BEAN MUSH was $6.  WTF?  You can buy a whole bag of beans for $6.  The management wanted to argue with us over this fact, so hence no tip and a bad review.  

The food is good, but the restaurant staff needs to tell their clients about ridiculous details of the "supersizes."  I can go for $2 or $3 dollar additional cost, but come on now.  We all know the restaurants in Vegas do this because they know you won't be back again.

Service, SERVICE, SERVICE!!!!!  We can eat anywhere, it's the service that makes us continue to come back.
