KXqOT3vyx8Ao7com4yST-g This place used to be so good. I would frequent about 3-4 times a week bc it was so good. Over the last 6 months they have hired in management that is more than incompetent. They constantly don't have ingredients made and are unwilling to make them upon request. They've cut their portion sizes in half including all of the sides. I haven't had a warm meal there in probably at least 4 months. It's always like warm and mushy and just feels gross in your mouth. Everything they have on their board for you to order from is wrong and typically doesn't display the correct prices either. I'm not even cashing in my 200 belly points for two free bowls bc I don't want to eat there again, it's gotten that bad. I had to wait over 35 minutes for them to fry 1 veggie cutlet even though the board says two and I was charged for 2 and told that they were sorry about my luck. Don't go here. Find an authentic Indian place because this is terrible.  I've also tried to reach out to the management personally with no response at all to my issues.
