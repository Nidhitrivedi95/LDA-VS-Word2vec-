ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg We love Indian food, so we were excited to try a new place. We were seated promptly, but then ignored for 10 minutes before even getting a drink. Our waiter was courteous, but never once addressed me or even looked at me. Everything was addressed to or presented to only my husband. This was infuriating to me. The food was good. A little different from other traditional menus, but very limited. We won't go back.
