TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA No frill attached-basic non fancy joint!Located in quite a run down plaza but the food ROCKS!!Quick service and outstanding nihari and brain masala with piping hot naan!!Its def a hole in the wall!All nihari lovers this is the place to eat!!I will be visiting here more often to enjoy the warm food in winters!The spice level is not too bad since I myself eat mild Pakistani/Indian food and I did ok here!!
