YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA Staff: Extremely friendly and helpful! :)

The food: Its average at best, and nothing to write home about. They use one base for all their curries and thats pretty evident! I ordered home delivery once from here, and found hair in my vegetable biryani -_- gross

Value for money: Definitely overpriced. Given the portion sizes, they charge waaayy too much. And the food isn't even that great for crying out loud.

Ambience: Its alright, nothing too great

My score is actually 2.5 stars
