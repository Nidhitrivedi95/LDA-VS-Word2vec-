E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw This is probably my favorite place to eat in C-U.  I come from Boston, the land of 100 Indian restaurants.  I fell in love with Indian there, and was very wary of moving to a tiny midwestern city.  However, Bombay definitely hits the spot.  I like the typical curry dishes, chicken tikka masala, samosas, naan - all are great here.  My husband is a bit more adventurous and he has never been disappointed.  Granted, it's not better than many of the places we've been to in Boston - but it's way better than I expected for around here!  On the down side, it's pretty small and very crowded around lunch time.  Good luck finding space for more than just 2 at noon!
