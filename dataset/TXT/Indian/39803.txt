P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg Hakka isn't my favourite food I have to say but stopping in for lunch I have no complaints at all about the China Cottage. The meal was well prepared although less spicy than I expected (I had the chilli chicken) and the service was brisk and friendly.

Great value at $6:50 for the meal which came with a choice of soup, egg roll or pop.
