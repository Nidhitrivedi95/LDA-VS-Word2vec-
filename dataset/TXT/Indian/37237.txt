Different curries are of different quality - I prefer the TIkka Masala over the signature Butter Chicken which has waaay too much butter.  You can eat inside, but it is pretty basic, most people do take out, especially for lunch hour.  Good to find one more good Indian place on West Queen West except Mother India at Lansdowne.
