dJfiXs0BwwkGKl0sXC3dzw So on a regular Wednesday, Me and my mom decided to try this new place out that we saw on Yelp, and citing that their lunch buffet for non-veg was $6.99....we thought why not ? 

We dropped by at around 1:45 PM....Their lunch buffet closes at 2:30 PM....to me we still had adequate time to enjoy the buffet. 

This is what we experience before we even ate...just by walking in, we saw that there was NO one there, it was REALLY hot (80+ inside while its 90 outside) Fans running at full speed...just throwing more hot air around the restaurant....

So we contemplated if we should stay or not...we said well, lets try this out regardless....

When we got to the food...it was COLD. I would honestly say that the room was actually ALOT hotter than the food. I asked the server/waiter why it was so cold and not hot ? His response was "it has been a slow day" I didn't know that due to being slow that the food would be cold ?

Besides that fact, There were some items missing from the buffet or in low quantities...this included the rotis and white basmati rice...both which they brought from the back for us which was fine. 

Food tasted really good, except it was almost ice cold. When we went to pay for the meal...we got charged $9.99 and not the $6.99...I asked the person why ? The printout they have is actually very misleading...the person at the register had this "we got ya !" smirk on his face the whole time, and it was not appreciated. 

I would like to go back again sometime, but this experience wasnt that great. It was SUPER hot, the food was COLD and we got mislead by their ad/print.
