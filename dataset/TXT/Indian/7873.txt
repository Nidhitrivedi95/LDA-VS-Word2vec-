6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w Worst experience ever, we booked ahead when we arrived the restaraunt was half empty and the owner insisted to sit us near the entrance when the door is opened all the time and it's very cold we were with kids and couldn't accept this. When we said we booked the table ahead and we would like to sit inside the restaraunt he told us take the place or leave. We turned around and left and this ruined our evening for Tonight. Thanks for nothing, very bad service will never come again to this terrible place!
