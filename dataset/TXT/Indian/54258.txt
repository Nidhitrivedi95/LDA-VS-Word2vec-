vwVoksbTKehDP8ZGUQaVfQ Food is ok but extremely overpriced.  Their takeout container isn't particularly big and costs $13 to fill with food.  One of the items I got was butter chicken which had about 7 chunks of chicken in it.  Basically paid $2 each! Yikes.  Service was not good.  The first girl I spoke with for help with the menu was less than helpful and the cashier barely spoke english.  There are alot of other places to go.  Do not go here just to overpay.  Again food was alright but who would pay $20 for rice and curry?
