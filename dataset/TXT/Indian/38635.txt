OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I've been here several times and I've never been disappointed! The butter chicken curry is my all time favorite dish here and I finally save some room for the gulab jamun this time. It was fantastic! The chef is very friendly and helpful in picking out dishes to try. I definitely recommend this location for authentic Indian food!
