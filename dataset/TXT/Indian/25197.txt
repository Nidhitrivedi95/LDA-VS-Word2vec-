HF-fLG3QaNepY151QKDNLA They open till late every day.  And staying open till late wouldn't be possible if you don't serve good food. 
Yes the food is pretty good.  Authentic Pind da taste. Everything tasted fresh and pure. If you love dhaba food from back home,  come here. 
I tried Baingan Bhartha and liked it. Their sweet lassi was awesome too.
Guess will keep coming back here at late nights.
