3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw So good !!!!!  The buffet option is my favourite because I like to try a little of everything.  Wonderful service.  The young men who work are very courteous and sweet, but sometimes forget to refill your drink.  Just kindly remind them and they will get you one.  I've even asked the server to change a static radio station and he did so with a smile.  

The food is great!  Lots of starter options like cooked vegetables, rice, and salads.  They even have a vegetarian section that is delicious.  The meat section is separate from the veggie section which is appreciated by vegetarians :).  Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb, and a seafood blend are in the meat section.  The naan bread is AMAZING, and they have a small bar to order cocktails, wine, or beer.

The place is always busy right from when they open so it is obviously a popular choice by locals.  Would definitely recommend.
