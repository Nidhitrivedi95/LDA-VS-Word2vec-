Pleasant setting in a strip mall. 
I had dinner buffet for $13,99 was tasty. Modest prices. Nice selection of meats and veggies. My wife ordered chicken off the menu for $9.99 and was happy. Service was good, but restaurant was not busy. Food took a little long to arrive, but I guess it was made to order. 

Would return.
