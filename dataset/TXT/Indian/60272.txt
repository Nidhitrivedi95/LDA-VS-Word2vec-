ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA This is a no-nonsense place. The food is normal, and reflects a typical restaurant in India: crowded, "prison-guard customer service" and bollywood tunes.

My two complaints: no separate bowls for curries (?) and fairly small slippery plates...like, watch out 'cause the pakora slides off. Ugh.

But for the great low price, I will give these guys a nod. 

If you have an extra few bucks to spend, check out Woodlands weekend buffet, too.
