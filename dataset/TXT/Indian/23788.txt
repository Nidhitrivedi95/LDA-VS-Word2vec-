The first time we came to Mount Everest was a year ago when we were in Vegas.  It was so good that when we came back to Vegas this year, we put it on our list of things to do.  I'm still trying to find an Indian place in AZ that's as good as this one. 

If you're a fan of chicken tikka masala, you have to try it at Mount Everest.  It's the BEST that I have ever tasted, and I'm just sad that I have to come all the way to Las Vegas to get it.  It was even better than I remembered and I ate way too much just because it tasted so good I didn't want to stop eating it.  The garlic naan is also delicious.  The service is friendly and attentive, and the location cozy (in a good way).  I wish I could buy the food in bulk and ship it to AZ!  

We'll be back, for sure.  If you're in the Vegas area looking for great Indian food, this is the place to be!
