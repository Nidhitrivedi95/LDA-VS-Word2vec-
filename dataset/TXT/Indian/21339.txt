I heard about Curry Corner from a friend who said that they heard about it on Food Network and that it was supposed to be fabulous.

I arrived there at 11:00, only to be told that they don't open till 11:30. No problem to wait and observe that they are currently under construction as they expand to two more stores next door.

Promptly at 11:30 the door opened and I was invited in. The current location is on the smaller side and being under construction is not what I would exactly consider to be highly inviting, however, taking this into consideration, I evaluated only on the food and service.

First on my order list was garlic naan. It came to the table still hot, bubbly and flakey on the edges and chewy in the middle. It was fragrant with the aroma of garlic.

Next, came a bowl of karahi. A dish composed of goat, slow cooked in ginger and spices, onions, yogurt and tomatoes. I love spicy food, and asked for it to be made that way, and the cook happily complied. The dish was excellent and filled with lots of meat that was beautifully tender. I was given a choice of it being served with rice or with naan, and as I had already ordered naan I opted for the rice which was perfectly cooked.

Service was reasonable and the tables were clean.

I am looking forward to coming back after the construction is finished and trying a much larger selection of dishes.

For the time being, I will give them 4 stars for the excellent food.
