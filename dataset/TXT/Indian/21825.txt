gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Food here was pretty tasty, by far it is the best chicken wing in Vegas... Don't expect the wing to be batter like KFC ... Full of flavor and very minimum batter, just the way I like it... 

note- must be buzz to enjoy it as much as i did otherwise the wings are a bit salty when eaten sober... =)
