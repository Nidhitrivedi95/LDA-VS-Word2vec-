RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Blue Taj is a classy, upscale but not unaffordable restaurant in the same area as Terrace Cafe. It's a little hard to find because it's tucked away in an alleyway of the shopping center and you can't see it from just walking on the sidewalk - literally a hidden gem. I love that you walk in and the entire eating area is hidden by a dark curtain. It sets you up for a pleasant surprise when you see the awesome decor behind it. 

I had the chicken tikka masala for lunch with a friend. It looked a little small but after I was finished, I was absolutely stuffed. The naan bread was to die for and I was ecstatic when the waiter asked us if we wanted more after our bread basket was empty. Also, we weren't too sure what spice was added to the rice but we weren't huge fans of it. But because the spice flavor is drowned out by the tikka masala sauce, I didn't mind it too much. 

Lastly, when your done you get a complementary mousse to cleanse your palate. Honestly, it tasted like my friend's room (funnily enough, she's Indian too) - mango and coconuts. If I didn't feel like I was licking the air of her dorm room, then I'm sure I would have loved it haha.
