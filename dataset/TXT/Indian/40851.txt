PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g I am not normally a fan of Indian food, but Kamasutra is absolutely delicious. I order the Chicken Madras every time. It is loaded with flavour and packs a spicy punch. The portions are large, so unless you are a big eater, get ready for leftovers. 

It is a bit pricey, but it's totally worth it. I frequently elect to take out my food as I live around the corner, but the restaurant is very nice for eating in as well.
