IfmSqAJ6_IeE1ffQ2AcxsQ Worst kabab and karahi:
What an absolute disgrace this place is for Pakistani food. We ordered seekh kabab, tikka and lamb karahi. The karahi was basically some curry with lamb pieces in it and they put cream in it, thus making it sweet. Who puts cream in karahi, this is the worst karahi I have ever tasted and I have had my fair share of karahis. Even calling this thing karahi should be a crime. Next the seekh kabab, they were burnt from one side and raw pink from the other, meaning only one thing, the dude making it never turned/rotated the skewers. The tikka was dry and hard.

Never ever going back to this place again.
