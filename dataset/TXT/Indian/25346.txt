HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Saffron patch catered an event for my residency program. We ordered naan, rice, and three entrees for 30 people.

First and foremost, working with the manager and the staff was wonderful. Each person we interacted with did a fantastic job of accommodating our needs, and the staff also helped us carry food out to my car, which was extremely helpful. The manager even allowed us to order shrimp vindaloo, which isn't even on the menu.

Moving on to the food itself, all of the dishes we ordered were absolutely delicious, and the quantities were enormous. About half of the food was left over by the end of the night, and I guarantee it will all be eaten by the end of the week. The shrimp vindaloo was spicy and flavorful, the chick pea dish we ordered was rich and well seasoned, and the rice and naan were well cooked and perfectly accompanied the other dishes (I don't eat meat, so I can't comment on the mango chicken dish, though it seemed to be quite a hit as well!)

I will absolutely recommend saffron patch for catering for events, and I am delighted with the experience we had. I hope the next batch of food is as good as this one!
