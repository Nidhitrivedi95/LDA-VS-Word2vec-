SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A One of my favorite places to eat Indian Food!  I've tried other places , but the Chicken Tekki Masala here is always the best.  Perfection is more like it and probably my favorite dish here. Of course you have to have the rice and some garlic and cheese nan.  Oh and to start the mango chutney is always a must aswell!  For sure this place remains my favorite place!
