UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw This is my favorite Indian restaurant ever! I have gone back several times in one week for just for the tandoori chicken and chicken biryani. Everything I have tried to date has been amazing, including dosas and curries. I have brought my friends, family, and coworkers here and they completely agree! I get thanked for recommending this place. The staff is very nice and accommodating, especially for large groups. The weekend buffets are also a must try, with new varieties every time and always fresh!
