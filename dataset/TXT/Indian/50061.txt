U8tIgXZ0T--8ZNEVoDap0g I ate a small meal, and was by myself, so my experience is limited, but I can say the tandoori fish I had was excellent-- good quality and cooked to perfection! So if I closed my eyes, this would be 5-stars. But the place suffers from rather dreary decor and feels a bit shabby, so that would make take-out a better choice. However, even then, the presentation of the food is a little bland-- the side salad was just a lifeless mix of a few greens.
