Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg I didn't have a particular craving tonight, but went with Indian. I figured I would try something new and so I went with Trimurti. 

Now, maybe it's better at the restaurant. I ordered in and I can't say that I enjoyed it all that much. 

The naan was rubbery and the food was a little gooey. I enjoyed the first few bites, and then I just got bored. When something says "hot and spicy" on the menu, especially Indian food, I expect tears to be flowing. And that just wasn't the case.

I had the Butter Chicken and the Lamb Vandaloo, pretty safe choices and a pretty bland result.

If you're in Queen West and looking for a good Indian restaurant, skip this one and travel a little further down the road to Apalla.
