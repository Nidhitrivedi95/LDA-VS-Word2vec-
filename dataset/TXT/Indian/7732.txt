6aDfalYZOkWzwtVRA2wYaA Read the review in Yelp! Stepped on the gas and it was worth a drive to this place for a lunch buffet. The lunch buffet is 14$, Though you don't get more varieties like indian restaurant,it is worth the money for the taste and quality of the food. 
Go here just for the food and ambiance is OK. you get the best naan and best chicken dishes here. I did not get a chance to try the lamb. I have not tasted such a good Chicken tikka here. Tender, juicy , perfectly cooked and perfect mix of masala for the taste.The Naan is damn soft and you can feel the freshness of the dough.It is worth a go if you are in phoenix .
