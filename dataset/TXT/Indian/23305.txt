gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I can't believe it...I've been working in an office for years now, less than 5 minutes away from Mount Everest, but it might as well have been a world away.  I've only recently discovered this hidden gem!

I'm not experienced in Indian food, run-ins with curry and the occasional purchase of naan from Costco were about all I knew.  But wow...what a flavor bomb Mount Everest is!  Very unassuming restaurant on the outside..BAM!  Get your taste buds ready!

If you're very new to Indian food I urge you, start off slowly.  The multiple (and I mean multiple) spices used to make a majority of the food can be very overwhelming.  Indians are not shy with spices and they will throw everything in the book at you!  That can be a very good thing!  Wake up your senses!  Tastes from everywhere will be making your brain go BOING!  To be honest there must be a dozen or more critical spices used in Indian cooking, all present here at Mount Everest, I'll just name a few:

*Cardamom
*Clove
*Black pepper
*Cumin
*Coriander
*Nutmeg
*Mustard seed
*Fenugreek
*Turmeric
*Saffron

Are you ready?  Thought I was but I really wasn't!  For your best options, go for the daily lunch buffet.  You get to try a little bit of everything that Indian food has to offer.  There are some definite familiar dishes along with a few that are great starting points for newbie Indian foodies.

Only a beginner?  Go for the tasty Chicken Tikka Masala over a bed of their Sweet Rice.  Sweet, spicy, but not too spicy!  Also go for the Tandoori Chicken, marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger & herbs then grilled over charcoal.  Delicious!

More experienced?  Go get it with their Chicken Curry or their Goat Curry (yep), try a Veggie Samosa or Pakora.  Don't forget the dipping sauces!  Raita, Mango Chutney, and Tamarind are ready to accompany all of your entrees!

Vegetarian?  The buffet also offers a few good options like Palak Paneer - homemade cheese cooked with fresh spinach & herbs.  Or the Aloo Kauli - potatoes & cauliflower cooked with tomatoes, peas, cilantro, roasted cumin & coriander.  

Please, please, please don't look a gift horse in the mouth - each table comes with a basket of freshly baked naan bread!  This is critical!  The curries, Hell just about everything goes excellent with the naan bread!  It's sooooo good!  Sop up all the extra goodness off your plate with a piece of naan!  If you get a chance order a basket of the garlic naan as well.  Carbs be damned!

Mount Everest is possibly the best Indian buffet around currently.  If you go for the lunch buffet be prepared to wait.  Tables are often full with regulars!  But it is totally worth it for the flavor explosion you will be receiving.  The price isn't bad either, $10.99 a person...what a deal!  Eat to your heart's content!

I've only been to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet, but I hear the dinner buffet as well as the regular menu is on fleek as well.  I will have to come back to give either of them a go.  But for right now I am happy with my lunch buffet for my Indian fix.  I will be back!

Everybody in the world....SPICE UP YOUR LIFE!!
