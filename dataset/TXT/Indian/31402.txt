ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw 9 bucks for that, never again! combos are not so cheap (what the hell did other reviewers had for 5 bucks that was a real meal?). Only the portion of rice was quite generous, not that of the meal/meat/veggies. The place in addition does not look so clean, so I ate my plate rapidly, almost only thinking of the GI issue I might have in the next days (and praying not to have food poisoning - which I did NOT). One good point = spicy food, but not very elaborated. you want indian food = try another one than this.
