UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I am not going to rate the delivery service - it was a disaster, took a long time - I felt bad for the girl because clearly they did not outfit her with google maps.  I think if they improve the delivery, this place could probably do really well.

The food was really good.  Ordered Chicken Vindaloo, Butter Chicken, Aloo Gobi, Garlic Naan, and Rice - it was about 40 bucks.  Portions were reasonable too.  

I will definitely order again, however I will probably either pickup or call at least and hour or so in advance.
