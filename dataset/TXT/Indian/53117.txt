VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw There is nothing special about Taj Mahal, except the Garlic Naan.  The food and service are okay, but I not good enough for me to want to go back.  The décor inside is exactly what you would expect from a strip mall restaurant, one big room with cheap tables and chairs, and lots of pictures and knickknacks.   

Here is a breakdown for the food: 

Chai tea:  Terrible! So bad I couldn't take more than one sip.  I didn't bother sending it back because the server already told me it was premade with the milk, so there is nothing they could have done to fix it.

Appetizer: vegetable somoas -Pastries filled with peas and potatoes.  These were okay but were begging for some sort of sauce or gravy.  

Entrée: Vegetable Korma - The sauce was pretty tasty, although the server described it as mild and it was spicy (and I'm no wimp for heat!).  A previous review mentioned that they obviously used canned veggies. I don't believe the veggies were canned, but didn't taste fresh either, I'm guessing frozen.  

Breads: Garlic Naan, and Roti - Garlic Naan was excellent (At least what I got of it , since BF devoured it). The roti was nothing special, tasted more like a wheat pita.  The sauces they served were also a little bland and watery.

All in all, I don't plan on going back for dinner, although trying the lunch buffet may be an option.
