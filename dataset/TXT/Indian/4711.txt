2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg I ordered take out from this place, and man, it is probably some of the best Indian food in phoenix. The chicken Tikka Masala was amazing to the last drop wiped up with my garlic naan...great portions,  I got 1 order of chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, 2 orders garlic naan, veggie samosas $40...fed 4 of us pretty well..
