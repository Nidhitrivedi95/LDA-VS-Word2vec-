DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Good food, bad service!! 

They are understaffed in the kitchen and they don't make food very quickly. Most orders seem to take over 30+ mins to cook. 
Don't use the website to place an order online, it will take 40 minutes or more. It's better to call and they will make it faster.

Chicken Makhani is good, nan is good too. 

Wish the service was better!!
