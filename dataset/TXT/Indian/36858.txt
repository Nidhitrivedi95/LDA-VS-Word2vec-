nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ The hype is real!! Amazing food for a very reasonable price. $25 for a prix fixe 3 course dinner. They are very generous with their portions and you will leave feeling like you just had a feast. Presentation of the food is also instagram worthy. However, the decor of the restaurant is sort of like a family owned diner so it is probably not the best place to go if you want to impress a date. But hey, who needs to impress a date when you can impress your tummy with food thats beautiful and delicious.
