TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Food was awesome, but this place is kind of expensive ($13 for a Vegetarian dish). We ended up paying $55+ for three Vegetarian dishes, garlic naan and a side of rice, plus a Mojito and a mango lassie (I will say that their mango lassie is a killer! Loved it.) But, in order not to pay so much, take advantage of Yelp's deal! ($15 for $30!). We've used it and the price came out reasonable.
