muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw I am a huge fan of the boneless chicken handi.  I have never seen it offered anywhere but here and it is delicious.  The naan bread is also the best around.  The chicken tikka (grilled chicken) is awesome too, anyone even less adventurous boring eaters would love this.

The chicken tikka masala was below average IMO.

The sunday buffet was not worth the price the one time I checked it out.  Stick with the menu options.
