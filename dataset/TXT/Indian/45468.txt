ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I really enjoyed this place. Came here for the lunch buffet on Sunday. The naan bread they serve to the table was excellent and I also enjoyed the curry was savory. What some might not know is that they also have self serve chai tea in the middle of the buffet. It was great way to end the meal with a side of kheer. All in all I really enjoyed myself. I paid around $14 and I would definitely come again.
