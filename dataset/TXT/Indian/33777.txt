LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw OM? More like NOM! Haha err..

I actually haven't had Indian food since I've moved here - there just aren't that many places and they aren't cheap like the Bay Area - so when I found a place in Vegas that had curries for as little as 3.49, I couldn't pass it up.

One could easily have a good meal here for around 6 dollars - an 8 ounce serving of curry and a naan or some rice. And if you go for a groupon/yelp/amazon deal, you could have meals for 2 for 3 whole days! The Amazon deal we used was a 20 for 10 deal and we got 3 different curries, 3 garlic naan, and a mango lassi and only paid about 3 dollars on top of the deal we got.

While the curries here aren't the most flavorful or original, they taste (to me) pretty authentic. The naan wasn't wrapped up in the best method - they just kind of stuffed 3 into one foil, but they still tasted very good anyway.

The truth is if I could just keep eating, I'd probably stuff my face with naan and curry until I burst, but then this food wouldn't be so economical...
