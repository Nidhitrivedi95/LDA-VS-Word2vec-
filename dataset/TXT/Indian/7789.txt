6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A Six Flavors is one of the best Indian restaurants in the Northeast Ohio. Their lunch buffets are really good and the one during long weekends are best in the town. The quality and service are consistently very good. Their takeout menu is good as well. I would definitely recommend this place especially breakfast items on the menu to anyone who likes to eat good South Indian food.
