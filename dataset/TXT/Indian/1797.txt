-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw A south Asian place serving the biggest hits of Indian cuisine, with some personal twist on it.

I've had the followings:

The Kebab wrap, which is excellent. The Kebab is moist, while spicy at the same time. I always pay the extra 1$ to get Butter Chicken sauce inside of my warp. The contrast between the Roasted meat and the sweet and salty sauce is absolutely magical.

The various curries in a thali:

Some of them, such as the butter chicken, the lentil/pea based curries, and the Goat curry are amazing and has quite a lot of layers of complexity. Other curries such as the Potatoes and cauliflower tends to be a bit blander. Test them to see which one you prefer ;).

The Biryani is actually pretty good, packing both spices, quite a lot of meat and rice. Really refreshing Raita too.

The samosas, while packing flavour, tend to be on the smaller side of things for 1$, and the Gulab Jamun is microwaved.
