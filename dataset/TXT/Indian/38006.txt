I was most looking forward to the vegetable nilgiri, as I'd never had an Indian green curry, but it turned out to be on the bland side, even though I'd asked for medium hot. In fact, there was very little spiciness to any of our dishes. I also had the yellow dahl, which was fine but also not terribly spicy. My accomplice for the weekend said the same about her chicken makhani (Origin's version of chicken tikka masala), but we both loved her mango beverage, which turned out to the highlight of an otherwise uneventful meal. 

I would use this place as an Indian back-up if the curry craving ever hit, or to introduce a curry neophyte to the cuisine, as it's a rather calm and beautiful decor.
