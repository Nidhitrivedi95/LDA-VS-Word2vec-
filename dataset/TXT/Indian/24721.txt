h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw I went during Restaurant Week since it was a perfect opportunity to try some Indian food in the area. I got a to-go box from the lunch buffet. The selection isn't large, but it's good--there's a small salad bar, galub jamun, naan, rice, and about six entree-style options. The food is good.

However, the person at the register seemed annoyed at me when I asked about their Restaurant Week special and when I paid. He left before I handed him the signed receipt and told me to leave it on the counter, which I didn't feel very comfortable doing. The second time I went, I was charged full price until I asked about the Restaurant Week special. I guess this is understandable, but I didn't feel comfortable paying for my food. However, this place is the closest Indian restaurant to where I live, so I'll probably be back when I'm craving some.
