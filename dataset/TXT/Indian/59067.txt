yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug We came here after seeing a picture of a person with dosa and weren't we glad we tried it out! We ordered a channa batura and a masala dosa as enterees and the gobi manchurian as starter. All the dishes were very authentic and tasty. The spice levels were exactly what we ordered too. The meal ended with a very nice masala chai. The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly. This place is on my list of places to eat at in Las Vegas!
