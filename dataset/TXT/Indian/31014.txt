We drove from Mooresville to try the food this afternoon. It was a huge disappointment.
The buffet was tasteless and not at all worth the 12.95.
To begin with, the butter chicken was no where close to what it should taste. Boneless chicken means good quality of cubed chicken and not chicken thighs less the bones.
The tandoori chicken was burnt and the chicken curry was just terrible.
The vegetables fanfare was another waste.
Twice I asked for mango lassi which is supposed to be offered free with the buffet but till the end it did not show up.
I am sorry but the food was an insult to Indian/Pakistani cuisine.
Not worth a visit.
