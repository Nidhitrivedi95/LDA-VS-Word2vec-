-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I usually stop by the kitchen area and get the Thali to go.

Last time I went, I forgot to tell the person putting the food on my tray that I wanted it to go until she had already put the rice and 1 item on a tray. She said "I would have put it in containers if you had told me earlier" and she just continued to put it onto the flat tray. She then foil wrapped the tray but I had to do my 20 minute drive home making sure to take corners slowly. 

The bottom line is that the staff need to take a little extra time to do things properly. At no time should a server say in essence "I would have done things properly but......"

They seem a little understaffed and the staff appear to be a bit undertrained.

Overall, I still like coming here because they have a good variety of Indian groceries and the food is good but customer service definitely needs to improve.
