The rice is overcooked and seriously lacking in aroma (where's the saffron? admittedly that's too much to ask for $3.99 I agree) and the chicken is negligible. While the portions are ridiculous and the price is so 1995 I would save my appetite for the many other good middle-eastern/indian joints in this area.
