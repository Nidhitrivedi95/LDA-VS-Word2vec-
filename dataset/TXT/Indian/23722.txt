gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Saw the yelp reviews and had an out of town visitor who loves Indian food best of any. It was shocking to see it had a drive thru window and the neighborhood is a bit sketchy but not scary. Once inside it was very small, dark and stuffy warm. We all three had the buffet and it was about 12:45 when we arrived so you'd think it would be well stocked. The chicken korma was all sauce, no chicken to be seen and of the rest of the dishes, some were sparse, some were old looking with sauces separated and the Tandoori chicken was only dark meat and not nearly crispy enough on the outside nor cooked well enough for me inside. The samosas were cold & too doughy and I didn't like the rice being sweet, I prefer savory with veggies in it. The chili chicken was tasty but also very greasy and the vegetable korma was good and I enjoyed the spiciness of the food, it packed a heat punch. Naan was just okay, I would have ordered garlic naan if given a choice but service was sluggish and we were fairly ignored. My daughter needed water since all of us had empty water glasses and no one refilling so I got up and poured all of us a glass of water from pitchers they had sitting nearby. The guy copped an attitude after that and did his best to completely ignore us. I'm shocked that yelp reviews this as the best Indian in LV because I'm definitely going to my favorite, Mint Indian Bistro, next time I want Indian food.
