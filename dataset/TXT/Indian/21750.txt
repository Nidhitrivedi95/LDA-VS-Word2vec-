A recent development that left me a bit underwhelmed was their menu redesign. The menu has been drastically cut and the star rating system has been scrapped. Now, you're left with merely three levels of heat, mild, medium and hot. I take heat relatively well and medium had me sweating in my seat. 

In case you're wondering, they also offer the Kismot Killer challenge for £20 (I think). It's a ridiculously hot dish that is 99% chilli seeds. Our friend from Bangalore was pressured into accepting the challenge, and he was less than thrilled to be eating it. After three big hulking bites he quit. 

The staff here is stellar. They are super nice, talkative, accommodating and knowledgeable. If they take a liking you may even meet auntie in the back!

The only reason this place is receiving 4 stars and not 5 is the loudness. The place is very open and conversations echo quite a bit. Therefore... if a stag or hen party is there then you may as well assume you won't be hearing much else than their banter. 

The place is BYOB!
