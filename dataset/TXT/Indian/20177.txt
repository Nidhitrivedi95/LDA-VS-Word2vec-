fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA India's Taste is an all day buffet serving vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, pastries, and sweets.  They're open seven days a week. They also service a la carte items too.

They bring you fresh naan bread to your table but sometimes you have to wave the server down for some extra naan or water at your table. It's a very casual restaurant and fit for families and gatherings.
