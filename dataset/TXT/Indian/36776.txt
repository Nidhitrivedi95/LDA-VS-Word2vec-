nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Don't  let the plain decor fool you.  The food is pretty spectacular. It's not exactly traditional Italian....more Italian fusian.

Octopus and lamb rolls appertizer have an Indian spin  to it. unusual yet tasty. The Halibut special was very moist.

Nicest couple. I wish them well.
