3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ We ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Dal Makhani and Vegetable fried rice with Chilly Paneer. All the dishes were very flavorful and delicious. The order took a little more than usual to be brought out. The Manager was apologetic and made up for it with his nice attitude. Will definitely go there again!
