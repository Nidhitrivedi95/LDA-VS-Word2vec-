gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We ordered Sikh kebab, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, lamb vindaloo, chicken korma, and garlic nann. The Sikh kebab was flavorful, but a little dry. I've had better. The tikka was ok, big chunks of tender chicken, but the sauce was too sweet. The palak paneer was very good, although I like it a little spicier. The lamb vindaloo was excellent. Big, juicy chunks of lamb perfectly spiced. I'm usually not a big fan of lamb, but i really liked it. The chicken korma was excellent as well. Again, big chunks, perfectly spiced, delicious. Garlic nann was perfect. Two pieces were plenty for the four of us (with all the rest we ordered.) 

The service was exceptional. Very prompt, polite, and helpful. No one at our table had ever tried goat, and my brother-in-law was asking our server about it. The server was a very nice young man and tried to describe the flavor, texture, etc. Anyway, we ended up with the lamb vindaloo instead. Later, the server came by with a sample of the goat curry. He didn't have to do that, it was very nice. And, I found out I love goat! Absolutely delicious. He also brought fresh rice to take home with our leftovers. I felt he went above and beyond. We'll eat here again next time we're in Vegas!
