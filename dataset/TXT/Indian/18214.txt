EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Worst food I ever had in Vegas. Initially I thought it's greek/persian food but after seeing the menu seemed more Indian/Pakistani. I was still keen on trying after a long walk from the convention center even though I was in mood to eat Persian Kebabs. I was super hungry so ordered the chicken and beef combo kebabs which was for $16.99 which eventually came out to be $21.15 after taxes and 15% tip. It's Vegas so I shouldn't be crying for it and won't mind shelling extra if the food is good. I've tasted far better Indian/Pakistani food in Vegas.
Food - Horrible
Service - 20 mins even though there was just 1 customer before me.
Water - I asked for a water cup and the answer was, we only keep bottles which are for sale.
I should have gone to the Taco place which had a long line or the other Indian restaurants in the same complex.
