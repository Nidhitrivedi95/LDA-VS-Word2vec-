vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw Oh Goddamn! I love their Naan Tokri (assorted Tandoor oven roasted naan) especially the one with lots of roasted garlic on it. Their Saag Paneer is TO DIE FOR & their Butter Chicken was a tad on the sweet side but it had big juicy chunks of chicken and I went with my sister who bought a voucher from WagJag ($40 worth of food for $20 excluding tip, taxes, etc). We almost wound up not using it on time because it expires soon but she is so busy with work, our playdates (or our plans for them) hardly ever materialize. 

Currently on the prowl for more vouchers but I would dine here again without! SO GOOD! Super full. The prices are crazy for some items (espesh the libations) but I still want to try everything. Might consider the Prix Fixe menu next time. I could never come here myself. I simply couldn't justify the expense. Then again, I rarely ever order anything outside the $1.39 Value Picks menu at McDonald's. It is beautifully dimly lit, the washrooms are clean, the paper towels are awesome... basically, the only thing I hated there were the sliding locks on the restroom doors that were fairly difficult to manoeuver without pinching my fat fingers/the constant looming threat of internal bleeding. 

The pre-warmed earthenware plates were a very thoughtful added touch. The waiters on duty at the time of my visit were cute as hell & I don't think I could ever eat instant/fake frozen supermarket-grade Indian food out of a box ever again! It's a pity their food court food leaves much to be desired. I didn't like their sister restaurant on Mt. Pleasant (Bazaar Global Food Bar... which probably closed down) AT ALL. However, THIS place is amazing! It almost made me join Instagram. I still have the mother of all regrets for not taking a photo of the colourful delicious food we inhaled/almost choked on-- & my sister is practically Instagram royalty. I guess we were both waaay too hungry!
