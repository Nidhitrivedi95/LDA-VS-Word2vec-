zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I should probably do this as two different reviews, but oh well, they get one.

I've come here for lunch many times with friends. They have some of the best tadka daal and I LOVE it (don't tell my mother in law). It's not a typical Indian lunch as they serve it with a fresh salad as well and in cute little bowls on your plate. It's good though perhaps a bit overpriced.

However, I work for a non-profit and when trying to use my purchasing card for a business meal they refused to refund the tax charged (we are tax exempt). This to me seems like bad business practices and hence why I will not give them 4 stars, only 3.
