0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Heard good things about this place from friends and finally decided to give it a try.

There were 5 of us, so we ordered 4 dishes (1 appetizer and 3 mains) along with noodles and friend rice. The noodles and rice were average, nothing to write home about. The dishes IMO were kind of hit and miss. We had the pepper chicken for an appetizer, and it was a unanimous vote that it was delicious.

Next came the main courses, which were spicy & sweet chicken, chili chicken (of course!) and crispy beef. Out of these 3, my favorite was the spicy & sweet chicken (or was the spicy & sour chicken?). The other 2 were not something I would order again, although other friends at the table liked the dishes - so I guess it is up to personal preference.

I have been back to this place multiple times now as it is my go to hakka food restaurant. Absolutely amazing food and everyone I introduce this place to absolutely loves it as well. It has earned the coveted 5 stars!

Overall, I was very happy with the food and value, and will definitely be going back here and recommending this location to friends.
