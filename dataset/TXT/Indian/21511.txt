gF6dg51wP6Rs9MXgZ-K12Q This is one of my "go-to" spots when in Toronto.

There is very limited seating inside (has only 3 or 4 tables) and so is mainly a take-out place in my opinion.

But the Indian food is 100% vegetarian and is CLEAN! There is a wide selection of traditional sweets, samosa's (which tend to be very popular here) along with all your north indian (punjabi) dishes. 

I usually get a Veg-Thali to go which consists of rice, naan, a few veg options and one dessert...it all can be had for about $7 which is great since the portions are perfect.

On certain days, they do have other items on their menu (i forget). But they are closed on Mondays which seems to be the norm for most Indian places I encounter in Toronto.
