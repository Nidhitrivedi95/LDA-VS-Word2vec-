TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw We went there on a Sep long weekend.

The interior is Ok. but the food is amazing. We had a chat with the owner she was really nice. She is an amazing singer. She even dedicated a song for us. We were there for 3 nights so night before this we had dinner in Gandhi's which is good to but this is better :) and the customer service is amazing. Will definitely recommend  it.
Ahhn and if you plan to go try the malai dish it is delicious.

Little expensive though.
