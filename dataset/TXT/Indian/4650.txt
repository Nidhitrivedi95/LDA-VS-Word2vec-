22nkIQ4BeSYwsyaPOczOeA Got to be a high five for Mother India. Myself and a few old workmates - having all four of us gone our separate ways from the Citi arena - now congregate monthly for a Tuesday Curry Club. The idea was to try a different place every month. We've been going for two months now.... this place both times. Now I'm worried we may never see another indian restaurant.

But in fairness if going to Mother India once a month is a worry, I don't know what I'm smoking! It's tremendous, setting itself up as an Indian Tapas deal, meaning you get to try a bunch of dishes at the same time, as opposed to the standard sit-down affair offered by other restaurants en masse.

Good thing about Tuesday Curry Club (besides the curry) is that it consists of 4 growing boys with healthy appetites. With so much on offer, it means we can get away with ordering a ridiculous amount of food, and with the tapas style we can order even more if we feel we've under-supplied ourselves.

What did we have, what did we have? There was....

- Lamb Karahi
- Chilli Garlic Chicken
- Chilli Chicken Dosa
- Baby Aubergine and Potatoes
- Vegetable Pakora
- Chicken Breast Curry
- Chilli King Prawns (so good we ordered 2 portions)
- Mutton Curry (Daily special, of which there are 5.... daily!)
- Peshwari Naan
- Garlic Naan
- Paratha
- Rice

We had so much food we couldn't see the table. We had so much food we had to admit defeat, leaving some pakora and aubergine to be returned while we hung our heads in shame.

Considering we got all the above plus soft drinks for £25 a head (3 people; 1 of us had to work late sadly), shows what a bargain Mother India is.

Always busy so book ahead. Staff are delightful, chatty and happy to leave you to it once your food's down.

A must try for lovers of Indian cuisine.

Tuesday Curry Club, December location?..... you guessed it!
