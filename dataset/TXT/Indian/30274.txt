K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g Alright my two stars is not about the food! Food rating would be a 3 because we were half way impressed.

We got inside and immediately sat down assuming it was a buffet because according to the homepage of their website it is a buffet style, yet if you don't research enough you find out that its only buffet during lunch. We decided to give it a shot even though we were expecting buffet. The vegetable curry was good but there was barely any rice with the dish. The garlic naan had so much garlic my stomach hurt a little as I kept eating it. We also got the cheese crepe dish and we just didn't like the flavor much. 

I also decided to adventure out on a sweet lassi which as the waiter explained is like a smoothie with yogurt and sugar mixed. Wrong! It is a yogurt drink with a pinch of sugar. It is like drinking a bitter yogurt drink and I wouldn't recommend. I didn't hate it but I love thai iced teas and it was an extreme sweet jump in my preference on a sugar scale. 

Lastly the menus! Ugh there is nothing more frustrating then coming to an Indian restaurant in America where half of the dishes are explained and the others aren't explained in a comprehensive way. Most of our menus had sharpie edits with dishes and prices crossed out and rewritten. Then as we ordered our waiter informed us about all the dishes that they did not have. I am sorry it is on your menu but you don't have it? It is just poorly done and very confusing. I have had Indian before and it was not this complex. I don't think we will be back.
