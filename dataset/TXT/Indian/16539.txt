DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg I ate at this location again the other day and had another pleasant experience.  The service was friendly, the food was very enjoyable and the price was reasonable.  

I had the Beef Vindaloo with Naan and it was excellent.  (I've previously had the Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala, both of which I also recommend.)  

I can't comment on authenticity either.  I was first exposed to Indian cuisine by a friend who brought me here.  I've always enjoyed the food, so I come back.  That's enough for me!
