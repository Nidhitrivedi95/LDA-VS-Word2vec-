GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw Nice people is the best thing about this place.

Sadly the butter chicken was too sweet, the Lamb Roganjosh was spiced unlike any I have had before, and not in a good way.

The eggplant dish was okay but very mushy like a dip.

Naan was burnt and had an off herb taste.

Rice was jasmine not basmati as ordered.  

Confetti candy that usually takes like black licorice ended up tasting like flowery soap.

Will not be back.
