I asked for recommendations on which curry to get with lamb, emphasizing that I didn't want anything spicy, and ended up with the South Indian style curry. I scooped up the curry to put on my rice, took a bite, and then followed up with a gulp of water because it was actually spicy! :( It had huge chunks of tender lamb, and it would have been great if it were mild. I ended up switching with my boyfriend's chicken tikka masala, which was a little too sweet compared to what I was used to. The garlic naan was fluffy and also crispy at the edges, but the garlic flavor was a bit faint. When we were done eating, we were asked 3 times if we wanted to box the food to go, but we didn't want to bring home two chunks of chicken and lamb with a little bit of curry and no rice to eat it with. We laughed about it afterward, thinking we would have just taken the food home to satisfy them if they had asked one more time.
