llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g We go on a fairly regular basis because the food is very good and affordable. We've tried a lot of food on their menu, and everything has been very tasty. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere. We've been many times, and we'll certainly be back!
