GmMZG6dsDqGVC275ZwD-cw This is my friend Noah's favourite place in all the land and you know what, he's pretty much right. The staff is funny and charming, the room is mellow and unfancy, and the chicken thali is massive and crazy delicious. There probably is no better deal in town for under ten bucks. My friend ordered the vegetarian and this was a bit of a disappointment to be honest, kinda tasteless compared to the bangin delight of the butter chicken. But the naan and lentils were still perfect and pleasing, and we had sour fresh lime juice that made the muggy outside world fade from memory just long enough for us to feel floaty and happy, and very lucky to be lunching at Sana on Jarry. Go!
