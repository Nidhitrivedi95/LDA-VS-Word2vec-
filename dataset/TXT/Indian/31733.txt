KXqOT3vyx8Ao7com4yST-g I use to like this place when they first opened. But my resent experience is what got them this review. They use to be fast and friendly now is a whole other story.
I went there for a quick lunch since I haven't eating all day and it was 12:30 I was desperately hungry I was kept waiting while the attendant took all the time in the world, I waited 15 minutes before she even started asking for my order she answered the phone and all the she started taking my order and another person came behind me she started attending to the woman before she was even done with my order no problem I am cool with that she is multi-tasking. Then after she had dished the food I close the check out the guy the said who is paying with cash and who is paying with card. I was paying with card? I mean who carries cash anymore? The he said "sorry our machine is not working" really! So 25 minutes of standing here was a waste are you kidding me my lunch break was over just standing here I walked out and trust me I almost cried cause I was so hungry, and due to my anger I just walked to work and downloaded yelp. Please chapati respect people's time.
