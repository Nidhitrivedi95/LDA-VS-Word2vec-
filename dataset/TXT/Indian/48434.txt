tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g I wanted to kill myself eating at this place.  The waitresses were absolutely retarded and did not know anything about Indian food.  I was quite surprised to find different ethnicities trying to pronounce Indian fare.  Call me old fashioned, but ethnic food has to be authentic.

We waited 30 minutes for the apps and 1 hour for the dinner.  Other tables got so pissed that they started making their own drinks at the bar.  

Stay away.  This place absolutely sucks.
