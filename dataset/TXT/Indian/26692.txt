iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I've been to Marigold Maison twice now, and I can understand why it's always packed... it is centrally located, offers a casual and friendly environment, moderate prices, quality Indian cuisine, and attentive service. 

On my first visit with a few girlfriends, we went on a weeknight and shared a few things family style: Masala Dosa, Shrimp Tikka Masala, and Chicken Kashmir Korma... with naan and rice as well.  I took a bite of one friend's Quinoa Salad too.  That night everything was divine!  

On my next visit, I went with my husband, and it was a Saturday night.  The place was beyond packed and the waitstaff beyond slammed, but still attentive and friendly.  Actually, Abraham was an incredible waiter, making suggestions upon request and chatting with us throughout the time we spent there.  However, the food was not quite as amazing as I remembered.  We had the Shrimp Tikka Masala, the Saag Spinach with Chicken, with naan and rice.  The Tikka was a bit too rich and buttery, and the Saag was lacking in flavor ironically.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't what I talked it up to be.  I'm hoping it was just an off night as I do hope to return again!

I specifically would like to return to try the Biryani Hyderabadi with lamb... I saw a few tables had it and it comes highly recommended!

Worth noting that this place serves beer, wine and natural refreshments... and they do take reservations.  They also offer delivery via postmates.
