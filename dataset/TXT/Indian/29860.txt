jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I ordered beef shawarma and a Chilli chicken with gravy. I also ordered naan bread. I had it delivered to my house. I ran to the store so my wife was home to give the guy the money. The guy was very rude to my wife. My wife has a disease called Diverticulitis and cannot eat seeds. The beef Shawarma had seeds in it. The naan bread was burnt and had no garlic. My chicken chili with gravy was very small and the rice was even smaller. I went back to the place with the food not even touched to get my money back. I was cursed out by a woman employee at the register. They wanted me to talk to the manager about getting my money back basically wanting me to beg. I refused and they didn't give me my money back. My wife could die from those seeds in her food so if they are shut down by a lawsuit don't be surprised. This was the worst customer service I've ever had in Las Vegas do not I repeat do not go to this place
