82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Absolutely delicious Indian food -- we were so glad to have the chance to eat here during our stay in Montreal. I went with one picky eater and one vegan and both were over the moon about the food. We had the Vegetarian Appetizer Platter, Channa Masala, Mattar Paneer, and Chicken Xacutti (along with rice and naan). On top of the food taste and quality, the service was excellent; I had accidentally made a reservation for Sunday instead of Saturday, so when we arrived Saturday night we were not in the list. The owner/manager took a few minutes to move things around and find a table to accommodate us, which was so appreciated. Highly recommended!
