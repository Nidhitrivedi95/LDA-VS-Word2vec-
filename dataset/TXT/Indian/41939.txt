Management is disorganized and the place is so filthy!

Came today and they only had 2 servers - how do they expect it to not be a full house (which it was) during Eurocup? And on a Sunday?

Food was atrocious (bland and rushed, our burgers were even put together properly) and on top of that, we waited over 30 minutes. I can understand the service might be abysmal on a day like today but... the place is absolutely disgusting and filthy and definitely not because of a day's operation. Pretty sure they don't have proper hygiene standards so... ya... save yourself and avoid this place!
