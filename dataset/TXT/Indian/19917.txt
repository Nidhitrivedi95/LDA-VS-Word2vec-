FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw This Indian restaurant is a bit more formal than many, with a storefront decorated in elegant gold and white.  It is also a little more expensive than some.  But that is due to both the superlative cooking and the enormous portions.

The chicken dishes, especially the stuffed ones are rich and sumptuous.  A biryani was not only expertly prepared and seasoned but so generous that the remains made a nice lunch the next day.  Even simple samosas were great.  As other reviewer mentioned, they have takeout too.   This is not a place for fast dining - last visit our food took a bit of time when they weren't too busy.  I took that as being positive in that evidently at least some of it was being prepared from scratch.

Since the staff asks how spicy you want the dishes, it's a good place to introduce someone to Indian food.  They seem to have a loyal following as the owner greeted a number of customers by name on our last visit.

The service is very friendly and accomodating.
