OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w Probably one of the "better" Indian restaurants in the area! And better in terms of: decor, service, and ambiance. Food wasn't too bad either. 
I came here on a Thursday night around 7 PM. The restaurant was pretty empty but my friend said people usually came a bit later for dinner, and she wasn't lying. By the time we left, there were several tables just getting set up/receiving their foods.
We ordered biryani and tandoori chicken. Our server opened our biryani once it arrived to the table. The chicken was juicy and hearing it "sizzle" on the plate made my mouth water!
We also had crispy papadum on the side. 
Overall, a good experience and great for business meals and/or a desire for "fancier" Indian food.
