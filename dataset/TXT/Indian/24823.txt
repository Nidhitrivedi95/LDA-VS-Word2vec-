I was definitely looking forward to my meal, and trust me it did not disappoint. The service was excellent and just the right amount of attentive and time spent away from the table. 

No one ever just refilled my water, they asked and then polity reached to get the glass. I was even offered more ice!

As for the food I bought Chicken Tikka Masala (medium spice) and garlic Nan. The rice that came with the curry was perfectly cooked. So was the Nan, which was simply delicious.

The curry was amazing. The sauce was rich, and flavorful. The spice level was perfect. The chicken was nicely cooked and tender. It was not dry. 

This was hands down the best Indian food I've had since I moved to Arizona.
