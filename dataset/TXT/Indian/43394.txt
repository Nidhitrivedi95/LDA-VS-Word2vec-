RNbGxVLDu6SBQXkq-7MBow This place is often a hit or miss, in fact, the only reason I come here is because of the close proximity to my house (I have probably been here at least 50 times). I actually think that Biryani King has potential to be a great place, however the customer service is SOMETIMES poor - having to wait a few minutes for someone to take my order; some dude talking to his friend on the phone and telling me to hold on a moment. 

Now, if you don't care much about customer service you may actually like this place!

- The boneless chicken biryani is actually very good (4/5) albeit quite pricey - they do have a regular biryani as well but I never liked it
- Their Chicken Kabab roll is AWESOME (4.5/5)
- Their Behari Chicken is pretty decent (3.5/5)
- I think they actually decreased the size of their naans this year, but they are just like any other restaurant's
- This may come as harsh but I have tried many of the curries (Haleem, Butter Chicken, Chicken Karahi) and have NEVER had a positive experience with ANY of them

To conclude, a select few items are good, but this place is more pricey than other restaurants within its league.
