IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw First time trying this place and it was an excellent experience. We got plenty of attention from the wait staff. They were friendly and prompt. I ordered the butter chicken which was great, the naan was great. My dad order aloo gobi (i think that's what it's called) It was wonderful too. You can request for it to be extra spicy if you like. The food was fresh and aromatic just like they promised and the pakoras and samosas were crispy and very tasty! Recommend for sure, especially since it's one of the only one's in this area. =)
