xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Had lots of expectations when i went there after reading fellow yelpian reviews. But i found food to be more on the average side rather than being good. Food was oily. Would not be repeating it as i have a restaurant near my home serving same cuisine and probably better than it. To conclude, I would say it is just an average eating joint.
