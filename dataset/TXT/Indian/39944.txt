pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw OMG amazing! I was pleasantly surprised to see a dinner buffet. And it was delicious! Tons of variety, everything was fresh - I was in flavor heaven! I've never had Indian this good in Atlanta where I am from. Chicken tikka masala, chili chicken, saag paneer, cauliflower, chickpeas, meatball korma, tandoori! I had two plates full and believe me, I wanted more but I was stuffed! No rice pudding though, which is what I like to finish off Indian food with, but that's ok. They had these deep fried milk balls covered in honey. 

OK so the service was a little curt, but I'll still give y'all 5 stars because the food was just that bomb.
