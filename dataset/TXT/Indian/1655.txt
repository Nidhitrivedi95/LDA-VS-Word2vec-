-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA I tried the lunch buffet today. I really liked the variety of both north and south indian food that they had. The food tasted delicious. My only critique would be that the staff should constantly monitor the food being served during the buffet to make sure that it does not get cold or too dry. This specially applies to the dosas, sambhar and chicken pieces. If the food is cold or dry, it does not matter how tasty it is -  I wouldn't like to come back to get more!
