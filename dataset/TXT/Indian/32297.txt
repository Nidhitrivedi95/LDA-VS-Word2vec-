LgqGDQsUurUh6qUocPeSsQ Malhi Sweets is a few blocks from the north west corner of Jarry Park, seats approx 20 on super clean simple wooden tables and chairs by wide windows. It's not fancy: some Indian art and TV's broadcasting hot Bollywood music videos at a pretty mellow decibel, lots of framed clippings of great reviews and celebrity guests. There's an attentive staff and diverse clientele and everyone is smiling. Today we started with the Aloo Tikki and Malhi Special rolls, both crispy but light and we loaded them with lots of yummy, spicy sauces. I had Aloo ghobi (crazy delicious cauliflower and potatoes) Shahi Paneer (amazing soft homemade cheese in a creamy, tomatoey, Indian spicy sauce) the man had the Goat Curry and declared it his new favourite food. We shared nan - thin, soft, hot, lightly buttery - perfect. We drank frothy sweet lassi's and an Indian beer called Taj Mahal on tap - light refreshing lager that goes great with curry, and they have some other local and Indian mircobrews I'd go back to try. When we could eat no longer we loaded up the to-go tray's, paid our 46$ bill (nice!) and walked off into the sunset.
