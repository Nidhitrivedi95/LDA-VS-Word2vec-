tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My husband and i are fairly new to Az. After being here about 2 weeks we when to Indian oven.  I will not be back. They stare at you the whole time you are eating. very uncomfortable.  I asked for more nann bread and i guess i committed a sin because i was given the dirtiest look.  Buffet is small, not many choices.
Only thing going for them, they have a dinner buffet, but thats not enough for me to be back.  I now go to Guru palace. They are Very friendly and they don't stare you down while you eat.
