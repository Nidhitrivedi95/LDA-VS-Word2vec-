gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Today was my second visit to this restaurant. and like my last visit , I was thoroughly impressed.  The cost of the all you can eat buffet is $8.99 and it's worth every penny.  I'd be willing to be a couple of dollars more, it would still be an excellent deal.
The decor is nice, nothing special, but it's white table cloth and clean.  The service and attention that your given is excellent.
The food is absolutely fabulouso.  The lamb will melt in your mouth, the curried dishes are absolutely delicious and there is a great deal of variety so if your a vegetarian you'll be very happy.  The food is hot and very fresh and Naan bread was quite tasty.

I'll be going back to this restaurant again and again.
