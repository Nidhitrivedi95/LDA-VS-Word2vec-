-aKf_aT5vnmF2XcNKfb0eA Really good asthetic looking food! I got the roles, vadais and mixed rice. The roles and vadais were perfectly circles I was really impressed with the details! 

The taste of the food was really good as well. The roles were crunchy and a good mix of spices. It was really good. The rice was okay, it was mixed with a variety of vegetables. 

Prices are high, altogether was 20$, for 4 roles, 3 vadais, and a small box of rice. 

I went around 1pm and it was pretty empty, only 2 other customers. 

They don't have a great variety of things, majority of their stuff is mixed. I just wanted simple rice but they didn't have since they had everything mixed. The person in front was really nice and soft spoken.
