cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA This is going to be a short review. We had the fixed price menu, which started out "good", and got increasingly better as it went on, culminating 
in desert: the Pistachio Kulfi.

And let me tell *you*. That Pistachio Kulfi? Best thing I've ever put in my mouth. For reals, yo.

I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. By God, I'm not, so stop thinking it.

It looked like a green hockey puck on the plate - a *pretty* green hockey puck, mind you. It had some sauces, too, drizzled in that pretty-drizzled-sauce kind of way. Might have been tamarind. Who can tell, 'cuz after I bit into the Kulfi,  well... mind = blown.

Of course, if you don't like Pistachio, you're up poop creek sans le paddle.

But if you do... well, you get the picture.
