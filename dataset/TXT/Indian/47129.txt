Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I realize I'm giving this place a 3 when the food warrants a higher rating- it's about the inside of the restaurant. Now, I'm no stickler for insanely clean restaurants and I don't moonlight for the Health Department. I'm down with eating in a hole in the wall, provided its some damn good food- and that's what's going on with this restaurant.

I came here on Monday and ordered takeout for the first time. Monday was hot as balls, at 90-some degrees outside, so the kitchen left the front door open (I'm assuming for air circulation) and I, being a dumb noob customer, mistakenly walked into the kitchen. Saying it was not clean is a gruesome understatement. I would be lying if I did not consider getting back in my car and going to a cleaner restaurant. However, it smelled delicious and I tried to put the sights I had just witnessed out of my mind and only think of the impending Indian food.

I went into the actual restaurant, not the kitchen, which was a step above in terms of cleanliness, but not by much. This restaurant definitely warrants takeout more than dining in (however, I understand there is a killer Indian buffet that may sway my opinion, keep reading). 

I received my order: Chicken Tikka Masala, Palak Paneer, Channa Masala and 2 orders of garlic naan. Holy shit, it was amazing. Chicken tikka masala was far superior to India Garden; scratch that, everything was far superior to India Garden. A tad more expensive, but I ate the leftovers for about 3 meals (split between 2 people, which made it rational for me). I realize the beginning of my review makes the restaurant sound disgusting and I don't mean it to, as I was considering going back and ordering more food today. 

Now that you have a full understanding of what goes on in the back of the kitchen, know that I would still definitely recommend eating there. Especially due to the fact that the average household kitchen contains more germs than a toilet. You're welcome.
