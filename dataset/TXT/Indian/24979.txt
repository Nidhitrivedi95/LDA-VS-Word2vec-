H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ I tried the lunch buffet with my family and felt the food was pretty good, and service was average. 
The positive aspects of this restaurant are the mix of south indian food and north indian food, an abundance of non-vegetarian dishes, and the lunch buffet. 
The not so postive aspects are the weird flooring I noticed when I walked in, the lack of fresh naan or idli/dosa at your table (you have to just get the idli, dosa, naan at the buffet station...this is not a standard I have seen at other indian lunch buffets), and the price is quite high for the level of options and services (the above mentioned naan/dosa issue and the extremely low variety for vegetarian dishes). If they keep up or improve the food choices, and keep working on the interior's atmosphere, customers will be happier when they walk out and more likely to return. I on the other hand will likely not return. 
The dosa and sambar were my favorite on the entire menu, along with the chicken 65 and gobi manchurian. The kerala fish curry was also delicious. 

However, some reasons I won't return for the buffet: 
1) We had to request the sambar to be warmed up separately....it was barely lukewarm. and the rasam was the same but we felt bad already having had to ask about the sambar. 
2) My standards of a buffet have already been set with fresh naan and fresh tandoori chicken being served at the table....and the prices are the same in Los Angeles restaurants. 
3) Unnecessary items on the buffet: chickpeas in spices in the salad, goat curry (noone really eats that in my opinion), and the weirdly sweet paneer makhani dish.
4) Another thing I thought was annoying was that there was dosa on the buffet, but no masala filling to put into it....maybe some simple aloo, or even a spinach dish could be used both with naan and in the dosa! 

I hope this restaurant can take these suggestions and work on improving the whole experience.
