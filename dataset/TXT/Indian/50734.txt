UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Everyone my girlfriend and I talked to before we went to Toronto raved about this place.  My experience with it was just so-so.  We both got combination platters which are a great idea and I wish more Indian restaurants did something like it.  Each came with a meat or veggie dish, rice, naan, daal curry, aloo gobi, veggie pakora and rice pudding.  It was a very nice selection and you could choose from any main dish on the menu.

The big problem was that the main dishes were not that great.  We asked for one spicy and one medium.  Neither came out spicy at all.  So if you like heat, you should make sure you specify that.  I got the goat vindaloo because I have liked vindaloo in other restaurants.  It was a completely different sauce than anywhere else I've been.  I opted for the goat because I had never had it before.  That was sort of a mistake too because there were a ton of bones.  I've been told that they leave them in to increase the flavor but it seemed to me that there were way more bones than meat.  Also, we had to ask several times for our naan.

The restaurant was pretty busy but the service was not that great even considering that.  It was the second time that I've seen an Indian place take orders using iphones.  And it was the second time that waiters and waitresses didn't seem too interested in being speedy or really that helpful.  It also seemed to be commonplace that they would seat people inside if there was no room outside and then move them when a table opened up.  I'd never seen that before.

It could be that we just didn't order that well, so it would be worth going back to again if we lived in that area.  But if I were to go back to Toronto just for a visit I would try somewhere else.
