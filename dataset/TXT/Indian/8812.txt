7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg It's been 14 hours since I visited Tandul for the first time and I can't stop raving about it. When we tasted our food we both said oh my this is so delicious. We said it after we were done. We said it again driving home and when we woke up this morning. Seriously the most delicious, well prepared, true to the dish Indian I have ever had ....We chose Tandul based on the recent article in the CLE Scene.
That said we had chicken 65 as an app, paneer butter masala - medium, chicken saagwala - medium, goat curry - hot. Did I mention it was delicious? Rice was perfectly cooked. Butter garlic naan was just right crisp light not too greasy and hot!
The wine selections were good, we started with glasses at happy hour price. We were enjoying the atmosphere and food and pleasant service by Thomas so much we decided on a bottle. Thursday night and there was a steady flow of patrons the whole time. Warm and inviting casual perfect for comfort in the mid week doldrums if NEO winters or an intimate date night. Can't wait to go back and explore the menu!
