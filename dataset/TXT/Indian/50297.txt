UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w Have been going to this store for the past 6 yrs while I lived there. The kitchen which prepares food is descent. Their samosas are on the best in the valley. You order what you want by filling out a list with your name and pay at the counter while leaving.

The father/son who sit at the counter are two of their types (thank god). They talk sparingly; not that what they talk is pleasant either. Forget to hear them greet, it looks like they never figured that the jaw ( other than chewing pan) can be stretched a lil to smile as well. I wish they come out with no checkout free shops just to avoid such characters.

It's take-a-quick-bite while doing grocery shopping place.  Both the stars are for the deserving kitchen behind.
