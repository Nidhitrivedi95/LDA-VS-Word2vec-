3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA I've been to Curry Twist many times and it is and remains my favourite Indian food restaurant in the GTA so far. 

The atmosphere is really intimate and comfortable which makes it perfect for dates but not necessarily suited to a huge party without a reservation.

The service is always excellent and the staff always gives fabulous recommendations if you're not sure what to order or want to try something new.

The FOOD. I guess this is the main point people would be reading this. This is the best Indian food in Toronto (I don't work for them, pinky swear). My boyfriend and I are spice-addicts and have been to almost every Indian place on Queen Street. The Lamb Achari is what I had last time and I think it's taken the place as one of my favourite Indian dishes!

. This is still my favourite, the flavours are so authentic, the portions are just ride and it's served piping hot.

I'd highly recommend this place, it's worth the trip to Dundas West.
