H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ The food is good :) I'm super happy it is halal and am always satisfied. We always get takeout and are never disappointed. Definitely my go to place for Chinese food. The only reason I'm giving it a four is because I've never actually sat in so I can't say it's perfect when I haven't experienced it all.
