LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA We were on tour to Brampton and  cousin gave us treat at this restaurant. It's so crowded that it certify for serving quality food. Typical Indian atmosphere with everyone talking loudly and long waiting time . Never go without booking table ,but it's really good place for quality and variety of South Indian items.
