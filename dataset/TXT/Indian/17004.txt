DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew My husband wanted to get a carry away last night, he suggested Chinese. I suggested Indian. 

Our first visit here we were so pleased. Second visit, not so much. 

The food here is good, I figure anyone can have an off night, and we won't let this stop us from dining there again in the future.
