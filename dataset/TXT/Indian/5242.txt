2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Butter chicken roti YUM!  If you've never been, it's definitely a must try. Initially, I ordered it medium spicy but that nearly took my head off. Here I thought I could handle my spice :( mild is fine for me though. Their lamb biryani is quite good as well and has chunks of boneless lamb. 
I would suggest ordering ahead of time for pick up. They make their food fresh so it takes a little longer to prepare. Last time I ordered the roti it took 20 mins so I went for a stroll on the harbour.  
It's a very small place with a couple tables to eat but in the summer there are spots outside as well.
