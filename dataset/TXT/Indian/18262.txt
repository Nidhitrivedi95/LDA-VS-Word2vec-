EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Horribly salty and over spiced beef. I think the entire spice box you buy at the Indian store was dumped into each kabob. I've never had such horrible indo pak food. It was barely dog food. Sorry. Getting 2 stars for being halal and the rice and lettuce didn't make me choke. The kid at the front counter was an idiot.
