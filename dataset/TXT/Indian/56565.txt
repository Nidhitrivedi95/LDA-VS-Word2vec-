xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw This was EXACTLY what we were looking for. Authentic and flavorful foods made fresh for each order. Probably one of the best mango lassis I have ever had! The samosas were delights in a perfectly flaky crust, pakoras were just the right size and taste. The entrees were mouthwatering! No pictures because we couldn't wait to dig in! Thank you to Anup for creating a warm and welcoming environment to dine!!! Can't wait to come back for more and introduce our friends to this food gem!!!
