jRxLnJ9my31Re_O2MvQGhw Ordered again today.  Food was excellent again.  Owner as friendly as ever.  I order 3 on a scale of 5 and not spicy at all to me.  Going to go hotter next time.  (Owner will know who I am)  :-)

One tip... the large and regular appear to have the amount of "good stuff."   The difference is the amount of rice you get in my opinion.  Since I ordered from here in close proximity of dates, it was fresh in my memory.

In other words, don't order the large as its a couple bucks more for just more rice.
