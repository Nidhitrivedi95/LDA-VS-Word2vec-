A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Was excited to order from this restaurant through Ubereats. I put several instructions on what I wanted extra with my meal, which I was willing to pay for and upon calling them directly to confirm , the person told me he couldn't do anything about that since I didn't pay for it. 

I told him there was no option on the menu they setup for me to choose to pay extra and he pretty much cut the conversation short and said if his manager allowed it, I would see it in the order! What kind of garbage is this?! How does one talk like that to his customer?!

Joke is that all of this happened over a few bucks!

Guess this is the first & last time I'll order from these guys!
