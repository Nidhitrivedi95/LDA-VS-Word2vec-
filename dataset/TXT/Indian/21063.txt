GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I would have given this place a better review but the service is always so terrible. When you call up to order out they hang up immediately after taking the order without telling you how long it will take to make or even saying thank you or goodbye. If you eat in, there is always the same lone miserable looking server there who wants as little to do with the customer's happiness as possible. 

Apart from that, the food is very tasty. I have had a variety of chicken curries and grilled chicken and they were all very tasty. Also good is the Aloo Gobi. The hummus and samosa are great too.
