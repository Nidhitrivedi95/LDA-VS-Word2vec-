-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA This is the best Indian food I have eaten in a restaurant.  The service is over the top.  I went there in the middle of the week for lunch and a buffet was offered as well as the full menu.  The host took me through each and every dish in the buffet, to include the sauces, and what sauces were best for each entree.  The restaurant was clean and comfortable and the prices reasonable.  Because of the sign, I have always thought this was a Mexican restaurant, until my R man took me there last week.  I am so happy to have found this place and look forward to supporting their success by telling everyone I know about it.  Yum!!
