zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Dropped by a week ago to find updated decor, new menus, but the same wonderful attentiveness by the staff.  Did I tell you this is a family operation??  Anyway, the menu items have gone up by a few cents but that should not deter anyone.  This place just can't get anything wrong!  We had the delicious lamb and chicken kabobs, spicy rice and salad.  Just Fabulous.  It's one of those restaurants that just gets better and better.  I don't know how they do it, but they do.  
Thanks for the wonderful meals, guys.
