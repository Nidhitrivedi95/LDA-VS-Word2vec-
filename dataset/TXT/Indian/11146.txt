We happened upon this place when the original restaurant we wanted to eat at was full, with a 1.5hr wait. But what a pleasant surprise it was!

Sitting down to the mostly empty space we weren't sure what to expect. We were soon greeted by an energetic and very nice fellow eagerly awaiting our questions and order. There were four of us and we just couldn't decide so we ordered one of nearly everything on the menu. 

I could go through each dish, but plain and simple it was amazing. Seriously some of the best curry and South Asian dishes I've ever had. Each plate was a world of flavours that delighted our tastebuds. Amazing. 

My only criticism was the size of the dishes. Small plates indeed, but I think there could be room for change here, even a small (like teeny tiny) increase in size of dish would be all it would need. 

Highly recommend getting in here before it's too popular and busy.
