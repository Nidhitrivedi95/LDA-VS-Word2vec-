auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ At first I was skeptical about Indian food because I'm particular about the color of my food (yes I know I'm weird). Tried this place a few years ago when they first opened as we received a coupon for a buy 1 get 1 free buffet and have been coming back on a regular basis. Fast forward to today, the price of the weekend buffet is still the same! It's only approximately $10.99 for a buffet on the weekends and there is something for everyone as the variety of the selection of food is great! You get unlimited naan bread and the garlic one is to die for! It comes out fresh and hot! The food is always on point as the waiters work hard to make sure there buffet line is replenished with fresh dishes. 

This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas!
