kfwpXBsMQLqhUvscWB6b9g I stopped by this restaurant to order food to go as I was headed home from a doctor's appt. I'm not from the area, in fact, I'm originally from Houston, TX and was a regular at the Hyderabad House restaurant down the street from my house, so stopping in at Indian Taste restaurant, my goal was to determine if this restaurant would be my new "go to" comfort food and indeed I'm happy to say IT IS! Turns out instead of ordering to go, I stayed, ate and spoke with the owner, Mukesh. The saag paneer, galub jaman, naan and dal were amazing! His goal and plans for serving healthy, wholesome food tailored to customers dietary needs is far ahead of the way present day restaurants are set up and his customized tiffin meals, I know for sure will be a success. Don't judge a book by its cover, the food here is excellent and fresh. Thank you Mukesh and I will see you again soon.
