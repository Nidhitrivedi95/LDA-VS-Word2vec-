g1yY3v-5C3Xd0laRFFCEZg This restaurant is under new administration, I ordered the regular hot and sour soup and it had no veggies in it anymore, just broth for 3.99! Chicken tikka masala was served as chicken butter!! and the sizzling plate was so so DRY, had to ask them to take it away. And when I mentioned to the waitress she just made a weird face. I'm disappointed since I was craving the hot and sour soup. I will unfortunately not go back.
