ZKSivkZcnH-nfqcIS8PUWA I read good reviews about this new restaurant, so I finally decided to give it a try.  First thing you'll notice is that it's not that easy to find.  It's located within industrial units but the sign is large enough that you shouldn't miss it.  I decided to give the lunch buffet a try to assess the food quality.  Although the buffet price of $10.99 is quite reasonable, the selection is quite small. Tandoori chicken, butter chicken, goat curry and 3 vegetable dishes.  They also provide some chow mein noodles and tiny samosas that didn't look too appetizing.  They also offer a salad oddly presented in a Tupperware container and rice pudding in a pot that was actually quite tasty!  As for the food quality, the tastes were great!  The tandoori chicken was moist and flavorful, the vegetable dishes were great. I even loved the butter chicken which I usually avoid but this one was flavored beautifully.  If the buffet tastes this good, I can can only assume that ordering off the menu would taste even better.

But there are some low points.  For one thing, they consistently don't offer raita.  The chef said hardly anyone orders it so they rarely make it.  Other than that the food quality and taste are excellent! I highly recommend the fish tikka, the Chana and the eggplant dishes. All are amazing.  They are very few Indian choices in Woodbridge and Maple but this one is definitely a hidden gem!
