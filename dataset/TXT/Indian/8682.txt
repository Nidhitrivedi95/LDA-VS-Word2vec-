I usually stick to the Paneer Masala but the Saag Paneer is wonderful here too. The garlic naan was super delicious as well. 

Naturally, there are tons of vegetarian options so a great place for veggies! 

If I could eat here every night I probably would! Come hungry because one curry per person is a ton of food with rice and naan. 

I love taking Indian food home, though, and this place is great for leftovers as well! 

I haven't had dessert here but I promise to update this review when I do. I'm sure the Gulab Jamun is great!
