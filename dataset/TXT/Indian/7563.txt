5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ I am a regular customer and I do enjoy their food. My favorites would have to be the buttered chicken, buttered naan and the mango lassi. 

The owners are very sweet and exceptionally nice. 

Their prices are inexpensive and reasonable. And as a student it is nice to sit down, study and eat their food.
