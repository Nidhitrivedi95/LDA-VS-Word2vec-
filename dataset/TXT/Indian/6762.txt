4ChWAqNuzhsYB14_BCPbEw Family special for 4 is my go to meal here with my family of 6. 4 adults and 2 kids. The food is enough. The taste is great. Biryani kebabs and Nihari. I'm not a big fan of chicken jalfrazi so I substitute that for an extra Nihari. 

Good service And the food is just amazing.
