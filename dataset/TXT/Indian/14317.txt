c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg if you are here for the buffet, it is only on the weekday mornings  except for Tuesday. 

Food is awesome. If you appreciate south indian food then this is a place that you must try. Generally speaking, this particular line of cuisine is famous for using indian spices with a special focus on herb based ingredients. 

The servers were fast and courteous. You'll probably have a nice experience here. 

I took out one star from the review, because of their timing does not agree with me as I preferred weekend and evening eating out.
