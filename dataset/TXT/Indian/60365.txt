ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Great Indian restaurant near the University. The decor is authentic, as is the food. I ordered the chicken marsala, and of course, the garlic naan! Every bite was delicious. To end, I had fried cheese balls in a sweet honey sauce. Although this may sound somewhat repulsive, it was everything but! You have to try it! The restaurant is fairly inexpensive and great for college students. Be sure to get there early, as it does fill up quickly.
