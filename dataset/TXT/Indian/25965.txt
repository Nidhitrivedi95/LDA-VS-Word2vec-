You are given a variety of choices to customize your dessert including base, toppings, syrup, etc. There are two sizes to pick. I tried the Monkey Business which is essentially what ice cream would taste if Nutella themselves made it, mixed with strawberries, bananas, and of course Nutella. The way they create the dessert in front of you is unique and a good watch too. Try it! So good! Will be coming back for more!
