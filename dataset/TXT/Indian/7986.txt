We ordered the Mac and cheese (made it a combo with they're chicken lollipops), Hakka shrimp, brisket poutine,  and spicy beef sliders. This was enough to feed 4 people and the bill was around 80 after taxes and tip! We found the Mac and cheese too sweet (not really butter chicken) and quite honestly the chicken lollipops were good but TINY (hence word lollipop) I guess, this was disappointing as we came here for the Mac and cheese. Their Hakka shrimp was delicious as was their brisket poutine (crisp Fries!). Our favourite was the sliders. Only two came for the price with the slaw but they were very tasty! You can really taste the spices used and it was a juicy slider. I could have done without the slaw, too much mayo for my liking. And I must say,  they serve tea right. Served with a preheated cup and warm milk.  Perfect for the current weather (below zero). Would definitely come back to try more!
