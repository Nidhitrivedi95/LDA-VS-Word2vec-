kPjXA9lm7nQrn6UuPb5L-Q Best indian buffet restaurant from all the ones that I have tried till date. Pani Puri here is to die for. They have good enough options to eat from starters to deserts. Best things first pani Puri and papadi chat are really good to start with. They also have soup but will not waste much time on that as we have many more interesting things to try. They have samosas, paneer pakoda, khacori and many more to relish on. In veggies paneer one is really good and they serve hot roti with it. Dal makhani is really good too. In deserts is hot gulabh jamun which is yummy( don't miss out) and gajar halwa with six to sever flavours of ice creams. Hope after reading this your stomach is full.
