oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw Oh good lord, I wanted to like this place... I wanted to say that it was delicious and tasty and a great experience.  But it's not... and it's no where close.

I'm pretty sure this restaurant will be going out of business soon, but I can't imagine how people would voluntarily go back.

We went on a Wednesday night, and we noticed there were a fair amount of people inside, so we expected good things.  The best part about our meal was our server... and it all went downhill from there.

We shared two appetizers... the saganaki (flaming cheese) and the indian app sampler (samosas, pakoras, bombay wings and chutney trio).  The saganaki was pretty inedible, it tasted like a lump of melty, greasy, left over cheese.  And the sampler?  Oy vey... samosas were truly greasy, the pakoras were a little funky, and the bombay wings were strange.  We both love indian food, and this could hardly be called that.

Our wine was based on the servers recommendations and it was worse than boxed wine... I wish I was kidding.  My "cabarnet" was fruity, sweet and seemed carbonated.
My guy got the fisherman's stew for dinner... and it was mediocre at best.  I got the goan curry on the recommendation of our server and it was pretty terrible... every bite tasted different and only one bite was close to being "good".  Oh yes... don't forget that this is an indian (and greek) restaurant that doesn't serve naan.  

Ambience?  Well... it's pretty tacky... 

Don't waste your money, I'm still a little bummed I wasted mine.
