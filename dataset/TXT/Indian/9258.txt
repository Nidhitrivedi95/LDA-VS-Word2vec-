8cDP0mjK0J6lk292IeKRGg I think I just found my new favourite roti shop!
Stumbled across this place while shopping for swim supplies around the corner at Omni Swim. 
Had a delicious chicken roti with pumpkin and spinach, and a side of doubles (chickpeas in a sweet/spicy sauce sandwiched between two fluffy flat fritter things) that my husband declared to be the best he ever had. Regular size roti was HUGE- like, the size of my head!- thought I was going to pass out trying to finish my meal but managed to pack it all in and washed it down with a bottle of coconut water. Mmmm.
Hope to make it back here sometime soon to try something else from the menu, although it's a little out of the way for us downtowners.
This place proves it's true what the foodies say- some of the best food in the world is hidden in the strip malls of Scarborough!
