bfR-vJvrjdOJaWsXGJgzPA This place was OK.

I had the chicken curry and rice and it was a bit cold, but i did enjoy the flavour.  My bf had the butter chicken and it looked nasty, he didnt seem to enjoy it that much.  The naan sucked, but the samosas were pretty decent.

Probably wouldnt go back here.
