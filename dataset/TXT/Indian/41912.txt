qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA One of the few placed in the city that give you a good bang for your buck. I go there atleast once a month if not more. Service is slow but friendly, so maybe not the best place to go if you want to be in and out. 

I've tried pretty much everything on thier menu and usually stick to a few of my favourite. Udon noodles, crispy noodle and quasadillas are my toop three favs.

I like the decor, though not a fan of the music they play.

Overall I give this place an "A".
