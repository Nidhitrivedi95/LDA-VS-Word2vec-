RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w what can i say about this place ,but, "simply amazing food."  i went here with a group of friends on saturday and as soon as i approached the building/complex i was intrigued.

the inside of LTH is a little lacking, but they make up for it with awesome indian/pakistani music.  i was surprised to see such an eclectic mix of patrons, which gave me a hint that the food was going to be good.  

now to the good stuff.  i ordered a beef samosa, garlic naan and a karahi gosht.  the five of us split some aloo gobi and chana masla.  the samosa was alright, nothing special to me.  everything else was superb.  the lamb, the naan, the veggy sides, all to my liking.   the spice factor in the food is just enough to make you sweat a little, but not too spicy as to make the food unbearable.

very friendly service and the food came out very quick. everyone else that i went with thoroughly enjoyed what they ordered as well.  this place would get a 5/5 if they had proper cutlery, plates and cups.
