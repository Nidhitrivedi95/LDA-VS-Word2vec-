biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg My husbean and I have gone here twice, and both times the food was amazing. The second time we went, the owner and his daughter both recognized us even though it had been a month or two. I always end up with leftovers for the next day, and the cilantro chutney they serve with the bread is so yummy.

The last time we went, it was rather busy, but the service was still great. Both the owner and his daughter are incredibly friendly and willing to answer whatever questions about the food you have (such as what halal means, what makes meat halal, etc). The Turkish coffee is really good, as well.
