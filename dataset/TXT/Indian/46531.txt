sUGlSS0AF2xPYFEjvKJbSA From what I've read, this used to be another restaurant that switched cooks and changed its name. When I initially looked at the reviews, most said that the past restaurant was better and that the restaurant lacks ambience. 
Tbqh that may be true to some degree. The restaurant was very large, empty and had no music. The waitstaff seated me promptly and had good service.
 when I go to ethnic restaurants I usually go for good food and I thought the lunch buffet had pretty good quality with lots of variety.  
The curry was very flavorful and some were actually spicy, which I really like. 
The only dish I didn't like was the goat curry. The meat was very chewy and hard to eat, but I did like the flavor and consistency of the curry.
