2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Great food, I am so glad to have found this place. I haven't had good Indian since I moved away from Toronto! 

We had the butter chicken, chicken vindaloo (beware the heat on this one!) Plain rice, butter rice, naan, raita and chai.

Portions were good for everything except the rice and naan, which were very overpriced for what they are, at $3.50 each! The chai was good, but was almost cold by the time it reached me.

We were happy with the quality of the food, overall it was delicious and flavorful, with a good balance of spices and texture. A little bit overpriced I think, but still in the realm of acceptable.

What wasn't so great was the service. Slow, spotty and apathetic. It wasn't busy when we were there so there really isn't an excuse for not checking up on us, refilling our water, etc. We had a different person each time and they were far between. 

If the service was as good as the food I would have rated 5 stars.

We will go back because the food was delicious, and just hope that the service gets better.
