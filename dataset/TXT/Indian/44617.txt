S104l3lOcpkX6g98CFrGPw We took a lamb tikka massala and vegetables korma. These two dishes are classic indian food... But none of them tasted like usual tikka masala and korma. Both plates were TOO sweet... Like they add TOO much sugar. Tika massala was like a ketchup sauce. Vegetables korma... There were almost not veggies, too much cream and really too much added sugar. It is normal to add in some plate a bit of sugar but we had to ask another plate with less sugar. Even the regular nan was really sweet like a "brioche". I think it is just their way to cook but we won't go back there. Service was not bad.
