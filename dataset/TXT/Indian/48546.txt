ToU2fHhYJ6_7AVc_MojMRg Ordered delivery with them and I received the food earlier than anticipated! Nice surprise. 

The food was also very tasty. My favourite is their samosas. The vegetable pakora was a little disappointing. 

All in all a tasty meal, reasonable price, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers!
