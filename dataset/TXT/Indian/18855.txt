epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg I am on an Indian kick. I love Indian food. I may not know how to pronounce what I am eating, but who cares?

Cue Roti Cuisine. I walked by this place in January without even giving a second glance. How young and misguided I was. I returned there today after a massage next door and was delighted that there was fast & friendly takeout service. A simple menu and a decent price. 

I ordered a butter chicken roti and was delighted when not only did I receive a large amount of food, but, the roti was PLAIN. (I had momentarily confused the server by asking if they used paratha or dhal puri roti, but as it turns out there are no chickpeas in sight of this roti!) The butter chicken was pretty good, a nice amount of spice (ordered "mild") and balanced with potato. A different preparation than I expected, but every place should make things a little different. A nice addition was the small container of kheer that came with it.

All in all I was satisfied, and am happy to come back again to this prime (and beautiful) Annex location.
