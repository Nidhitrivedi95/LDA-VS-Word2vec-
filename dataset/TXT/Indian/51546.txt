UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I just love the food here. 

For the time being I honestly think this is the best place to get Indian/himalayan food in town. 
They are doing some big renovations right at this moment but when it's done they will have their lunch buffet open. 
I think it will be pretty nice on the inside once they finish, but for now you have to deal with the black tarp that divides the place up. 
I have eaten there two times in the last week and a hand full of times a year or so ago. I will say the food is much better this time around. I brought my family and we tried several dishes and everything was great. 
I ate there again yesterday and still consistently great.

OH almost forgot. they offer a good amount of vegan options and organic ingredients. (half of my family are vegans)
