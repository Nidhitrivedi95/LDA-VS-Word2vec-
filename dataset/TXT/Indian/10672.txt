A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA I have been here a few times. 

Although in fairness, many a time I had walked by this locale and the whole: having to walk downstairs, somewhat over simplistic vibe, and uninspired decour had discouraged me from going in. 

Specially since I am not Indian and my overall knowledge of what constitutes true "authentic" restaurants in this hood is somewhat limited, aside some tried and true spots. 

As such, when in the hood, which normally implies that I would be with a guest or a with a party, for their sake, I always opted to avert this locale due to the risk of a bad meal due to my curiosity.

However some of my Indian friends have taken me to this place since then, mostly because they like the selection of the menu which is quite extensive for what I have been told plus a number of vegetarian dishes (I normally come here with vegetarian friends) that I generally do not served in other South Indian restaurants like dosa. Although personally, I have to admit, the food is good but it did not WOW!™ me.  

It was good and I would go again but I give it one more star simply because although the decor is on the simple side, they always seem to have plenty of space. Also, most of the clientèle is generally DESI so that is always a great sign.

I still feel that I will come back but to really get the full experience I generally will come with someone who knows the cuisine a little better than me.
