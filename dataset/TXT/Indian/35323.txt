muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw This place is one of my favorite restaurants for that lovely Sunday buffet I ate two days ago.  i consider a visit to Tahoora to be a reward or treat I give myself not as often as I would like because it makes my mouth so happy I eat too much.  The variety, delectability, and service are just right, the price is low for the value, they don't waste time or money on anything but making delicious food, replenishing it well and cheerfully. It definitely feels "family" enterprise in the best way and I hope they live long and prosper.   If I've got a guilty secret to share its that poori, included with the buffet, just ask, and a hot puffy one appears glistening and pale, thin and delicate, just slightly yeasty and sweet.  I have to consciously control my desire to discard all semblance of civility in getting all of that luscious thing in my mouth at once. But I control myself and sip the lovely hot tea in between bites.  Actually, I can't believe I can get a table here, it should be overrun every Sunday with a line out the door.
