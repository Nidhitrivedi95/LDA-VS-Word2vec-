ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Happened upon Saffron and was really impressed! 
The appetizer sampler and chutneys were spicy and delicious, the service was excellent, and  it was a perfect meal from start to finish.
I had a spicy chicken biryani and my date chose  channa masala (vegan), and we were both raving. Finished up with a warm dessert that was like donut balls in a honey syrup.
Neither of us live in Charlotte, but if we did, we'd be regulars. Wonderful dining experience!
