-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw Nice store with many "ready-to-eat" meals that are a life-saver for me not really a chef, just a food aficionado.  Rani's  is fully stocked and closer to me than the other ethnic food locations I often frequent. They also do a good business at their tavolo caldo where, although somewhat pricey, the fare can be delectable. Rani, thanks for being in town!
