-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Udipi used to be our go to place for vegetarian food. My wife absolutely loves their butter paneer dosas. I like their idli sambhar and gobhi manchurian. Their north Indian food is good as well and I have tried chana bhatura, paneer curry, and parathas amongst other things. However, my last experience was horrendous. The owner seemed pissed at one of the employees and he was yelling around. Me and my family were waiting to be seated and he paid no regard to that. That was an unforgettable and unforgivable incident and we haven't been there since. Customer satisfaction apart, we come from India where we treat guests as Gods. But still there food is good and you should try it. As I said, I had been there dozen times before and didn't experience such a problem.
