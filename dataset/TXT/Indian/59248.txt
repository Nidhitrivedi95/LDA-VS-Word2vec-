yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I have eaten at MANY vegas indian restaurants and this one takes the cake. You HAVE to try the lunch buffet it's really the best, and overall they have the freshest, least greasy, and big variety of Indian food than any other here in Vegas. I crave it all the time lol! Nothing bad to say, and DO try their delicious mango drink or strawberry lemonade.
