SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A I have been going here for a few years and it is kind of a love hate relationship. They are consistent and the food is some of the best Indian food in town but the service is usually terrible and they are very expensive. I do prefer them over Gaylord at the Rio which has a much nicer dining room but it is even more expensive than India Oven. I wish Yelp had half stars, I would give this place 2.5
