7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA This has been a fave spot of mine for over 8 years.  Servers are very good;always coming by to check on how you are enjoying your food but not rushing you. They'll make dishes more spicy if you ask. I haven't been disappointed in any food I have ordered here. Great curry;the vegetarian selection is delicious. Ambiance is comfortable with decor that reflects the Indian region the owner is from without trying too hard. Better choice than stuffy LUMA across the street and far more affordable.  Go.
