scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Based on lunch buffet only. Very small buffet. Everything on my plate was lukewarm at best. There is no spice. Everything was bland or even sweet. The pork dish was the only thing with a little heat. Staff was friendly and attentive. The place was clean and nicely decorated. I will not return as I've had better. Try Haldi instead.
