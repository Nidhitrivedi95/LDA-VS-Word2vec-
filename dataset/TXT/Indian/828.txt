-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw We ordered 2 dinner plates. The portions were sufficient, and the food was good. Limited choice though.The best part is the tea. It is like home made Indian tea which you rarely see these days, also the food has authentic Indian taste.Even the simple dal jeera fry has an authentic taste.
They also gave a grocery store which is a bit pricey, but it offers the convince of ordering your food,and instead of waiting for the food, you could do some grocery shopping. Overall a good place.
