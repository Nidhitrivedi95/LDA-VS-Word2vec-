RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg I am pleasantly surprised to have experienced the food here.  I chose the buffet - everything is wonderfully fresh and delicious with beautifully unique seasoning without being heavy.  I was on my way somewhere else here at the Rio, and stumbled onto this.  The decor is exquisite - I felt like royalty when I entered this beautiful restaurant.  All I can say is that no one should pass this up.  You'll experience a wonderful meal with great service.
