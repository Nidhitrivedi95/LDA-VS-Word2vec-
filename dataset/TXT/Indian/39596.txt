I come here at least once a week for lunch. I'm usually not a fan of buffets, but Their lunch buffet is amazing. It's $10, super clean, always stocked, and you can enjoy a really fantastic lunch and be back to work within 30 mins. I can't say enough good things about this place. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat.
