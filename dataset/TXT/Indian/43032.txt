RGhWcpC9hA2wvlWSjptxvg This review and rating is based solely on their beef patties.

Tinnel's is a chain (according to the patty box they gave me).  The Beef patties are $12 for a dozen, and only come spiced HOT.  The hot is pretty hot, but not as hot as Randy's patties.

I rank these patties in my top 2, along with Randy's.  The flaky pastry is what makes a god patty for me.
