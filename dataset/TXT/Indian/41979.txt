qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Great place to hangout with friends. The atmosphere is more like a coffee shop than bar. Drinks are all reasonably priced but not necessarily the best tasting. 

The only thing refraining me from giving this place a higher rating is its cleanliness. Strange stains on their couches and dingy colored walls makes one wonder when was the last time they had a thorough cleaning. Probably a decade ago. Service is also mediocre and they do not do separate bills.
