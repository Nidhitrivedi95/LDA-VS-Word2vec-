qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Although the owner of this location (Krishna) hasn't put as much work into the interior decorating of this place like the Burlington location, I found the food quality and service to be far superior. He has taken the effort of traveling to Delhi to venture on the streets to replicate flavors to the best that he could and he has done an amazing job!!! Originally from Nepal and in the Markham area for a few years now, his passion and dedication for his restaurant is even indicative in the dishes he serves as part of his lunch buffet which is only $11 includes meat and veg dishes as well as naan that is brought to the table fresh and warm. With a very pleasant demeanor, humble attitude and gratitude shown towards every customer there; excellent food at an extremely reasonable price, he scores high on my Yelp list for the one of the best Indian restaurants in the Scarborough / Markham and beyond area(s).
