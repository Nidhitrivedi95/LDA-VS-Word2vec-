biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg I have been to many Afghan restaurants in the bay area and have often been disappointed when i goto new restaurants with "afghan" cuisine. I really enjoy afghan food and found this place to be of very good quality and I thought the environment was very pleasant and the food was very tasty.
