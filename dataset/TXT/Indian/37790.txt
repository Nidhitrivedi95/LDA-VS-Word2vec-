ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw We had a groupon that we needed to use so we came here for dinner. We ordered the garlic naan, samosa, chicken marsala, and the origin India platter that came w paneer cheese, lamb sausage, chicken, prawn and some lentil/bean type of soup. 

Pros:
- Can never go wrong w chicken Marsala and naan. 
- Samosa was yummy

Cons:
- Seemed like there was only 1 waiter and so it took awhile to get his attention
- By the time I got my platter, my food was not hot so eating it semi warm made it gross. The prawns didn't seem like they were well cooked or over cooked. Rubbery on the outside and a bit mushy on the inside. 
- Menu was too complex. Like most high end places I guess. I hate reading. Lol. Not a lot of choices

Overall, I felt out of place there. I prefer to go back to India Palace. The environment is just more friendly and more welcoming. The waiters and waitresses there are more attentive.
