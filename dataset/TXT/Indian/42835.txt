RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Awkward experience with yummy food!   Like a tourist restaurant that only expects to serve you once, I guess because the coupons and gift certificates are so widely available. 

Reviews are 100% accurate. Not cozy or intimate. You sit at tiny tables way to close to other diners in a very open setting. Awkward. Modern decor but just plain awkward seating arrangement with sounds bouncing around everywhere and ridiculously noisey chairs making loud farting sounds every time you move them. Ridiculous for sure.  The place is hard to find, directly across from mellow mushroom hidden in a sidewalk "breezeway".  Understaffed seems the norm. You will get your water refilled but definitely not your drinks. 

The garlic naan is yummy and the white rice is delicious. I would still prefer whole grain options on both. Dinner was good, small expensive portions but just enough to take a little home. If you want an extra drink or extra bread definitely order it with your meal. 

One attractive waiter serves too many tables with the assistance of a bus/water girl and a food expediter both of whom speak little English and can do very little for you. I would go back if I had another free gift certificate but would try even harder for off hours and I would keep my service expectations low and order extra garlic naan and a drink refill early. Get reservations too.
