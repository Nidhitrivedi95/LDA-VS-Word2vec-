CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA I ordered the Veggie Biryani, and it was fabulous! Was the most amazing Vegetable Biryani that I have had in a long time. I moved to Phoenix from NJ, and NJ is known for its great Indian food. I will tell you one thing, this biryani was better than even the most famous Indian restaurants in NJ.
Great work and keep it up!
