KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Cool place for Indian meets Canadian food. It's neat to see butter chicken mac and cheese and all sorts of interesting samosa flavours. 
I ordered the byriyani dish and it was half decent. The flavours were bright and the dish was filling. The presentation was literally an over flowing small dish of food. It was a mess to try to eat since all the rice kept falling on the table since it was overflowing. My husband says the samosas were amazing. 
The Punjabi burger was ok. Great spices added to the burger patty but other than that, the burger was just ok in flavour. The fries are freezer fries. Nothing special. 
Over all I would go back. The food was good. But not great
