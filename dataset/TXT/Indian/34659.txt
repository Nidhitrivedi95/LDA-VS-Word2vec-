Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I had my nephew's 21st birthday party, and this was the only restaurant I found on the strip. I called and talked to the owner about 25 people coming to the party and I told him what we need. He was very gentle and said anything you guys like, we'll make it for you. So, when we got there, our table was all set up, and I had the chance to meet the owner. He told me how the food will be prepared. Our guests were surprised to see the quality of the food and the service. The food was awesome and starters were amazing. I highly recommend this place. The waiter was very friendly and helpful.
