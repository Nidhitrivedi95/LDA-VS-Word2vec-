tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My new favorite Indian buffet.  The chicken tikka masala was the best I've had since working in Silicon Valley.  The lamb vindaloo could have used more heat, but the lamb was nice and tender.  The saag paneer was the best I've ever had.  Tasted fresh and it had a little kick.  That's a very welcome first.  The garlic naan had the whole table raving.  Very good food and the price can't be beat.
