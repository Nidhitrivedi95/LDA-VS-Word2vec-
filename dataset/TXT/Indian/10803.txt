A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA My wife and I came here for the first time today for their lunch buffet on a recommendation from a friend. It was very good and it lived up to our expectations. The food was fresh and hot and I would definitely come here again.  The lunch buffet is good but I'm hoping to order off the menu next time I come and try something different.
