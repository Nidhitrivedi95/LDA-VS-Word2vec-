Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I love love love this restaurant. They have a great affordable lunch buffet which is always freshly stocked and yummy. Great vegetarian options on the buffet and the menu. They are very kid friendly and dont give you the evil eye when your kid makes a little mess with the rice. The wait staff is very helpful and on top of things. The food is awesome! I cant say enough about this restaurant.
