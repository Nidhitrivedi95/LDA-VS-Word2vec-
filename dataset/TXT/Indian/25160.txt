hbzVZzrEeREZsd2jzwL1YA It's a simple no frills Dosa place - that's the one line to describe the place. The theme is around Ramayana and hence the name Rama. It's in a market place and there is enough parking. Seating is comfortable and the service is quick. The dosa's are pretty good and comparable to the other places  in Toronto. They have various options out there for you to chose from. We were a group of 4 and all of us chose a different kind of dosa - mine was a Mint Chutney Dosa which I liked very much. The service is quick and the host was friendly. The washrooms can be kept more cleaner - I don't know why restaurants ignore that important factor, especially the Indian ones, as folks eat with hand. Overall a good place if you are craving for some good Dosa.
