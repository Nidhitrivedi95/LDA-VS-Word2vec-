Yoc9_4sv6AT1AIohPPiGbA I tried my first mango lassi for the first time. I enjoyed the thick consistency and mango flavor. I am only docking two stars because of the customer service. The man behind the counter was unfriendly and did not seem enthusiastic to conduct business. After I made my order, he made a phone call before I could pay. I may or may not give Chennai Express another shot. I was really looking forward to exploring the tastes of their menu.
