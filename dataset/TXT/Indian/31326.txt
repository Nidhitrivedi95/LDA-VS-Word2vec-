KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw I finally got around to trying Ricks Good Eats this past week with a friend and it was worth trying! Upon arriving here, I liked that there was no issue with finding parking spots despite how busy this restaurant got for 1:30 p.m. on a Tuesday. I also liked how it was a casual space with cafeteria style ordering, a bunch of tables that were mostly clean and it had a couch area for hanging out. 

We had a really hard time choosing what to get since there were so many great choices on the menu and I really wish I had room in my stomach to try everything. After talking to different staff members there who all enthusiastically gave us their input, we ended up getting the butter chicken loaded fries, the healthy-ish salad with tandoori chicken in it, samosa filled with lentils (forgot the official name for this) and the ras malai cheesecake samosa. Our order came out to about almost $24 with tax. 

The butter chicken loaded fries looked delicious, it was tasty overall and a good portion. I just wish it could have stayed warm longer as I found that it was cold within less than ten minutes of eating it. There were some good flavours in the healthy-ish salad that we got with tandoori chicken but some of the chicken pieces I ate were slightly over seasoned. The samosa filled with lentils was flavourful, filling and the shell was crispy. Last, the ras malai cheesecake samosa was delicious and not too sweet - for me, this one was the clear winner of the bunch! 

In terms of portions, we were more than full enough with what we ordered. By the time we were done eating, there was just under half of the butter chicken loaded fries left and we still had about one third of the salad left. It was all filling considering how hungry we were at the start of the meal. 

All in all, we had a good dining experience here and I would definitely consider coming back to try some of their other menu items.
