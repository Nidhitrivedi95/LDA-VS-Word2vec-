The buffet can also be considered overpriced given they have very limited options, but the food taste good and they serve real fresh naan. The kitchen seems very clean after seeing it through the service window, which is not much seen for similar Indian/Pak restaurants and definitely a plus. After few disappointments with their prices, I am forced to go to restaurants who have more options for similar food while charging way less.
