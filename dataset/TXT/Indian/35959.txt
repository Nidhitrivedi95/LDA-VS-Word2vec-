nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ I love this place.  I go very often especially on the weekends where they serve halwa puri. They make it on the spot.  I love the fresh puris come out to order so they don't feel greasy or heavy.   
I have also gone for the buffet however I find it expensive.  They have good variety but not enough for the price.  The halwa puri price is perfect.  Service is ok.  They are alway in a rush.  Overall clean and delicious food
