ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w This place exceeded our expectations.  It is by far the best Hakka/Indian food I've ever had.  My one co-worker was even a skeptic, but was raving about the meal days later.  I ended up getting two entrees, but portion sizes were plenty for an average appetite.  It has just the right level of spice, it had a good kick but able to enjoy the flavor.  The dinning space was very casual.  Perfect for lunch and take out.  We got dinner and dined in.  We will definitely be back to this place when we are back in town!
