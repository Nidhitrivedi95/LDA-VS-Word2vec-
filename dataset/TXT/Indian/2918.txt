0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw At last an accessibly located Indian restaurant in Avondale!  We've been there 2 or 3 times and the restaurant has been empty.  I really hope they make it, and when I drive by each day I'm happy to see the "open" sign still in the window.  One piece of advice to the waiters:  when we order alcohol and you ask for my ID, and a younger female at the table asks if you'd like to see hers, say "yes" even if you don't think you need to...talk about faux pas!  Food is 4 out of 5, not the best, but not bad.  The combo platters are a LOT of food for the price, and the buffet is passable.
