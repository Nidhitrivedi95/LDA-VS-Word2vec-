-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw I came here once and don't think I'll be going back. The food was passable, and the service was commensurate to the price. However, there was something that I did not like about its business concept:

According to the menu, a combination plate (a thali) gives you 2 meat choices and 1 vegetable choice. Two meat choices can be anything that's available like "butter chicken" or "lamb curry", etc. The issue I have with this restaurant is that, according to the waiter, you cannot chose the same meat twice. For example, I love butter chicken and I don't care for the other meats. However, I cannot chose butter chicken twice as my two meats. I have to chose something else. Why?

Is it something so hard to do? Will it cause the business to go in financial ruins if I choose "butter chicken" twice instead of for example "butter chicken + lamb curry"? In any case, on my last visit, I was forced to choose "butter chicken + lamb curry" instead of "butter chicken + butter chicken"...

But I guess this incidence was a blessing in disguise anyways as the butter chicken wasn't even that good.
