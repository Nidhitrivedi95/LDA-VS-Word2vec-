Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg This is my absolute go-to Indian cuisine spot. They have an excellent selection of dishes for their lunch buffet, including vegetarian for all of $10. The naan is also a consistently healthy portion, which is a must. Their chicken tikka masala is to die for. They combine the delicious all white chicken with a thick tangy sauce, and large chunks of green pepper and red onion. Dishes are served in Indian metal tins, consistently keep the right temperature. The Indian hot should not be ordered without caution but do walk on the wild side with medium heat.

The service is friendly, I believe all are native to India by way of the U.K. Cheers, excellent spot.
