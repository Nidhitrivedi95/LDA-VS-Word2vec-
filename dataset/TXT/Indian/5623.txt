Go for the ~$7 lunch buffet noted by the other reviewers.

Its actually a good place for a lunch meeting b/c its nice and quiet, with an ever so slight air of fanciness coming from the white table cloths, AND you can eat immediately (ie. no waiting for the food! Its a BUFFET!)

If you are in a hurry grab the lunch buffet in a takeout box for even less. Just don't try to go *too* crazy stuffing your food in the stryofoam box if you decide to go the takeout route...
