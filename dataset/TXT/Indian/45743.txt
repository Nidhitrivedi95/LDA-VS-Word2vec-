scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Haveli is a great spot to get some authentic Indian food. I'm a vegetarian so with limited options in the Madison area, this a great place to go with a vast menu that I can eat. I recently went for lunch and finally tried their lunch buffet which was also good and a great price!
