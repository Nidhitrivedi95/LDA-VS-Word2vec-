TTFW5vD2i3ylvWaLpv4l6g Love the quality, sattvic cooking style and food. We go there all the time. There are many great places in town. This is one of them on the healthier side. Very kind hosts, the sag-paneer is second to none with the freshness and quality, the dhal is beautiful. 

I consider this the healthy tasty version of indian food. We love the greasy kind as well, and all in between. Unless I see something from behind the scenes showing terrible cooking practices we'll continue to go there almost once a month. 

But oh so many good places!
