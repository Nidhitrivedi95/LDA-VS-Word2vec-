RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I've been here once before and I have a lot of friends who rave about this place but I honestly just think it's 3 stars.  The buffet was pretty good (the Baignan Bhara (sp?) was the best choice) but I have yet to find an Indian buffet I love. I honestly just think the buffet isn't for me, especially since I like my food spicier than most. Otherwise the food was good and the service was great and I'm sure I'll be back many times as it's close to home. I still think Copper (their sister restaurant) is better though :-)
