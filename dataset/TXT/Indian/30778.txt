KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ My husband and I ate here for the first time. The restaurant is a little large for them, so it felt empty, but the servers and waitress were so friendly and helped us with our order. 

We ended up getting Manchurian gobi for our appetizer and it was delicious! It's basically tempura cauliflower, and was delicious.  I'm not a cauliflower fan and I loved it. We also ordered the Saag paneer and the Lamb vindaloo. They were both great. We will definitely be coming back to try more. The portions were huge and we came home with two boxes of leftovers for lunch the next day and we ordered an extra Naan to go with it. I think I want to try the buffet to taste many options at once!
