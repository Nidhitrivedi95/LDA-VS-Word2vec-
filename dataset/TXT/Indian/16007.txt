dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q Yum!  I came here with some friends for the first time the other day. We did the $12.95 lunch buffet, and we all shoved our faces with delicious Indian fare!  The lunch buffet was a bit modest but it had all the staple Indian dishes, including about 5 types of meat dishes, the chick peas and eggplant dishes, rice, naan, salad, and 2 types of desserts.  I'd definitely suggest the buffet for lunch, since individual dishes run between $8 and $12.  I had 2 plates of food, and everything was super tasty!  The only criticism was with the lamb dish, which was mostly boney and tough.  Besides that though, everything else was spot on.  I'd definitely go back here!
