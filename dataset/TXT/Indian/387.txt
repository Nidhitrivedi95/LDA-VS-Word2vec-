-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Upon walking in the restaurant,  we were a bit put off. There was a strong sewage smell and the interior looked like it had seen its best days in the early 80's. HOWEVER, we stuck it out and ordered.
The food was worth enduring the smell. We ordered chicken biriyani and chicken tikka masala. Both were some of the best we've ever tried. A little disappointed that rice didnt come with the chicken dish and cost extra...but even so, it didnt dampen the experience.
Like others we were given a complimentary drink (pink lemonade) and dessert (donut holes in syrup), which was a nice add-on.
Service was very good. The gentleman that waited on us was very friendly and quick to help us.
