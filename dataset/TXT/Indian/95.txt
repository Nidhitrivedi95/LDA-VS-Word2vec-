-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g First off, Have you ever been kicked out of a restaurant while you were eating because they were closing?  Normally I get hints but never asked to just leave the place before I'm done eating.  Anyways, the food is so so, not incredible as far as Indian Cuisine goes.  The service was terrible, the waiter/host was unfriendly, slow, and definitely hates working there or hates his job.  The walls, tables, plates, dinner linens were filthy.  I saw roaches in the restroom so as mediocre as the food was who knows what might actually be in Tikka Masala. Very unfriendly environment, if you aren't really out for a dinner or lunch experience and just want so so food, this might be OK but otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.
