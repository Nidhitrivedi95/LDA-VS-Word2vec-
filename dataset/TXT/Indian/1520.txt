-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA My sister-in-law and her boyfriend took my husband and I here last week. The staff were very nice and professional and were quick on the drink refills. We ordered papadam, Gobi 65, chili paneer, and I think it was the malai kofta. My husband and I had never had Indian food before, so we basically went into everything blind. We definitely were not disappointed! The food came out very quickly and it was absolutely delicious! I'm not one for spicy foods but what we ordered was just the right amount of spice and there was a ton of flavor! Would recommend to anyone!
