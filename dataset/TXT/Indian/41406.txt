I couldn't help but try nearly everything; 3 plates and 2 dessert bowls later, I successfully gathered my parts together in time to write this review before falling into a very long nap. 

There was an appetizer table with fried goodies, chicken cooked at least 5 different ways, delicious veggie options, a soup bar, and a dessert table. Probably 6 different chutneys. I cried with delight when I spotted the idli and coconut chutney, and dosai with sambar. Seeing as those are some of my favorite Indian food items, it was hard to hold back. 

Late Sunday after noon, customers were still filing in on the regular. A wide range of people were dining here, from couples to families to large groups of students. It seems like they have plenty of regulars and a very diverse crowd at that. 

M- F $9.95 for the lunch buffet, and Sat /Sun will set you back ~$11.95.
