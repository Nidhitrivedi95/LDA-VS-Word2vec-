oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q I have heard that if you want the best Hakka food then Eddie's is the place to go. This was evident in the fact that there was like a 30 minute wait line to get a table. Luckily I beat the crowd, since I guess I was a bit early, and got seated immediately. 
I've never been a fan of Hakka cuisine from previous experiences of the food being overly greasy for my liking. Since my mum really likes it, I decided to take her here.
She started off with the tom yum soup, while I got the hot and sour chicken and shrimp soup. I really enjoyed my soup, however she wasn't a fan of hers. 
Let me add that my soup arrived much earlier than my mums, whereby once I finished mine then came hers.
To avoid the reoccurrence of my greasy Hakka experiences, I opted for the safest option, which was the dry tandoori fish even though it was on the pricier side. 
My mum ordered the Hakka noodles. While placing the orders we specified to go easy on the oil, after which we got a snarky response saying that the food is cooked in oil so there has to be oil. He then said that he'll mention to go slightly easy on it.
Our food arrived and the noodles were shining with oil. The tandoori fish looked good but it did not look like a 'tandoori' fish to me. I took a bite and immediately realized that it was deep fried. When we asked, the employee told us that all their food are fried and that by 'tandoori' they meant the flavor, not the style of cooking. 
I guess that was my fault for not asking. 
So, I decided to order the mango salad to add something light. It was okay.
Overall, I would say for someone who doesn't mind greasy food this place would be great. The portion sizes are generous and the place is nicely furnished.
But I feel the prices are quite high and the food was just not my style.
