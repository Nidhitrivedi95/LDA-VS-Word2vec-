NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ Tip: Go to hotrmild.com and order your food if you are not going to get the quick carry-out options (Customers Choice veg/non-veg). If you order food from their kitchen - for example, Goat Biryani - it will take a while to make! They do prepare their food fresh. Think sit-down restaurant style cooking but prepared in to-go only style due to limited space.

Hot or Mild is only a few minutes from my work and I absolutely love Indian food. Needless to say, I visit Hot or Mild quite often.

Simply put: Hot or Mild is my absolute favorite Indian food restaurant.

... and here is why!

Food:
    I am the type of person that samples a few menu items that I am familiar with before making a real decision on how I feel about their quality and taste. Unfortunately, because this is Indian food, I was unable to do that. You cant exactly get a burger and fries here. But, that's a good thing! You would be missing out on way too much if you could. My coworkers used to make Indian food and bring it in for lunch. Therefore, I would expect that whatever food they prepare is as close to 'authentic' as our grocery stores allow it to be. Hot or Mild is no different. I feel that their food is of equal quality or better than the food that my coworkers have cooked for me. I do NOT feel as though they skip out on certain ingredients to keep prices low.

I have had the privilege of enjoying many menu items at this restaurant.

    - Chicken Tikka Masala: Classic taste. Great for someone new to Indian food!
    - Chicken Vindaloo: You can taste the mix of spices very nicely in this one. A second favorite here.
    - Chicken Curry
    - Butter Chicken: Essentially a less spicy tikka masala. Still good but I prefer the Tikka Masala!
    - Paneer Tikka Masala: Replace the Chicken in Chicken Tikka Masala with cheese.
    - Vegetable Jalfrezi (Added 11/3/14): My absolute favorite vegetarian dish that I have tried here. The spices are nice, complex, and delicious. The heat was spot on.
    - Dal Tadka (Added 11/3/14): My least favorite dish over all. The spices were nice but they texture and flavor were not expected. The heat seemed to be a lingering after-burn.
    - Samosas: Always delicious.
    - Chutneys (all 3): Delicious!
    - Rice, of course
    - Salad
    - Chapati

    Next time I go I will be sure to get something that I have not had. This time around was Chicken Vindaloo - I might actually get this as an entree rather than in the Customers Choice combo box. It was really delicious! I also need to try some of their dessert options. Unfortunately, I have not tried any so I cannot comment on them. One other thing I feel necessary to add is consistency! Every single time, not just most of the time, that I have ordered from Hot or Mild my food has been pretty much the same quality as the food that I have ordered in the past!

    Everything that I have tried has lots of flavor and leaves me happy and full! :)

Drink:
    The only drinks that I have purchased from Hot or Mild are the pre-bottled soda type (coca-cola, pepsi, etc). Their prices are average for a restaurant that offers bottled soda and they keep them at a good temperature; Cold.

Customer Service:
    I have been to Hot or Mild 20+ times and have had the opportunity to speak with the owner about his restaurant, food, etc. He is a nice Indian man who is trying to provide delicious, quality, indian food to the area. The guys who man the front counter are always helpful and when asked will help you in trying to decide. Just today I asked about Chicken Vindaloo versus Chicken Curry to see which had more spice. The chicken Vindaloo was definitely spicier than the Chicken Curry that I have ordered in the past.

Other Thoughts:
    I need to start asking for my food to be spicier. Most people are likely good with the food exactly as it comes. Some items are spicier than others simply because of the types of spices being used in them. When ordering, make sure you specify your own level of spice or it will come the default 'mild' that is prepared to appeal to a greater audience.

    I in no way want to bash Hot or Mild so please do not take it that way but keep in mind that the food and quality are appropriate for their prices. Some people, myself included, will feel that their food can rival other indian restaurants charging $12 for the same thing that you can get for $7 here. I have ordered take out from at least one other Indian restaurant in the area and it was far more expensive. You could easily feed two mouths with the same money you feed one elsewhere.

    I cannot stress enough how important it is to order your food online, or by phone. This is kind of like ordering a pizza - you don't go to the store and sit and wait for them to make it. Even when I make indian food at home, from a jar, it takes me 30+ minutes and all I have to do is brown some chicken and then let it simmer in sauce.

    A friend of mine said their garlic naan is fantastic. I really want to try.
