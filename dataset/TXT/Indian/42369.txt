Qrz20jCLqVSixe53_McCMQ I actually had a poor customer service experience at a place next door to these guys and so I happened upon Amaya Express..

Walk up to this place and you are welcomed with a friendly greeting and they tell you the options available today -- all of which look great..

I tried the Beef Roganjosh and the Saag Paneer (spinach & cheese) and they were pretty good.. Not as flavourful as some other times I've had Indian but it was $10 incl. tax and came with some naan..

It's in my building and I'll definitely be back.
