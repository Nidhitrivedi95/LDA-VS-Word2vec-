-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g Although the coconut chutney has seemed very watery every time I've been & the rasmalai portions seem tinier than any restaurant I've been to, I love the food at this restaurant. Excellent southern Indian dishes. Perfect amount of spices. Great menu. Good service. Love this restaurant.
