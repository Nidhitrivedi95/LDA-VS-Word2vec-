VuW81oFt6-X9-vMYFYJY6Q It's a small restaurant but food was good and fresh. I ordered garlic naan with malai kofta which you could taste was fresh. However the service sucks. The girls working there just stand there watching the Indian dramas on tv and pay less attention to their customers. For that reason I give 4 stars.
