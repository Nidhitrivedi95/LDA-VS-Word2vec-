g8GNA1Np_tA_41_9v1S0eQ Dinner at Lucky Lin's Restaurant. Met Sue at the cash, she was born in Guyana, bunch of nice friendly folks working at the restaurant. Lovely conversation and good food.  The food is reminiscent of the Guyanese Chinese food in Guyana. The pepper sauce was tasty and added that extra flavour. We only tried three dishes and Sattie was delighted that the food tasted as she expected, delicious!
