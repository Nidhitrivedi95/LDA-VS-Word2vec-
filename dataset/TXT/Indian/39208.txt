oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw I actually feel bad for them... :(
I went there with my boyfriend last Sunday with a reservation. It was about 7:30 at night, but the restaurant seemed empty. We went there because I received an email from them with 10% off for their Sunday brunch and dinner buffet. It says on the email that buffet goes until 8:30. However, when we went there, I noticed that there was no buffet! The hostess said that they had to end the buffet early because they were not busy and they didn't want to let the food sit there. We left with extreme disappointment and sadness... I respect them for doing the right thing by not letting the food sit there, but they did not honor their promotion and promise. Needless to say, if I ever think about going there again in the future, I will call ahead and make sure they are able to deliver what they promise to deliver.
