auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ We ordered Karahi, Chicken Tika Masala and one more dish called Buryani here and loved all of them. Their garlic bread was amazing! I have had Indian before and this was literally the best. All items were super tasty and flavorful. We had to order a second garlic bread , I can take 10 more home. The service is great as well. Totally worth coming here.
