MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Wow. This is a place I've heard about for years, but for some reason or the other never ended up going. What amazing samosas..
Pro: The samosas!! Absolutely delicious. They came piping hot just made. I included an image of the paper bag that they came on to show that there wasn't any excess oil in or around them. That's a feat in itself. Well filled. Slightly smaller than I'm used to but not a concern I just had a couple extra to make up. I had the spinach and cheese samosas. Nicely flavoured, well seasoned not overpowering. 3 samosas for $1 same as most places. I will need to make sure I try  fried stuffed bread next time. 

Cons: I tried the mango lassi. Wasn't appetizing at all. Too thin, and had a very aftermarket taste to put it. As if it just came from a bottle. Not that nice. The sauces that came with the samosa though, lacked a tad. Too watery and not enough flavour. 

All in all recommend 100%. Will update this review once I've tried the other items on the menu.
