ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Honestly , I've tasted better in the area. We arrived about 1pm on a Sunday. A number of items on the lunch buffet were empty except for the
sauce. Unlike many ethnic restaurants , our drinks were kept full. Overall flavor was good, but as mentioned I've tasted better in the area.
