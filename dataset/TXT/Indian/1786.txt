-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw My go-to Indian delivery in Montreal. I haven't actually ever been to this restaurant, but I order from Thali several times a month, and it is always consistently delicious(which is rare for delivery!)
Normally, I get the butter chicken and the kebab appetizer and a serving of rice.... mouth-watering is probably the only way to describe it. Always tastes fresh and beyond flavorful.
