DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Stopped in on a whim-  best decision of the week!  Food is incredible- so many flavors- blended to perfection! It's not often I can't wait to get home to post on Yelp- but knew I was going to immediately. Prices are reasonable, service was attentive, atmosphere is inviting, portion size is generous- and oh! The food!!  Will be craving this place again soon!  No doubt we will be back!
