UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Pretty good place. their menu is a very unique as every dish can be made with veggies or meat. Their drink offerings feature Lassi with Vodka or Tequila. Very unique in that regard. We tried the Goat Rogan Josh, Mango Mahakali, Chow Mein and their soups. Everything was delicious with the right flavors, the service was quick and folks were polite. And the portions are just about right. Be sure to reserve a table ahead.
