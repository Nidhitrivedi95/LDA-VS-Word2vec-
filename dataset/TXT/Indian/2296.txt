_Oe8NDjmeYkkHFs7f8CekA I had the Lamb Vindaloo spiced at a level of 7.5 on a scale of 1-10. I was warned that 10 was very spicy and that most Americans could not handle it. In retrospect, I felt the dish was not spicy enough for me  and that a 10 may have been underwhelming as well. 

The flavor of the dish was okay. It was balanced, and I couldn't pick up on any of the other spices. The lamb itself was a little tough. I would have liked for it to have been softer and for it to have fallen apart easier. There also wasn't enough sauce to cover all of the rice, so I had a few bland bites of basmati.

As a final note, I think the portion size and quality are fair for the price.
