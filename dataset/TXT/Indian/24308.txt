GyHJAwBQ58L3ORBLm0G-hg I thought it was time to update my review; it's been several months since I last raved about India Grill.

India Grill has since become a favorite lunch time spot, the lunch buffet is just delish! The menu changes daily and I noticed on the daily specials, that on certain days employees of Free Scale and Honeywell get 2 bucks off their lunch, I think that's pretty neat, a company rewarding employees that go to their restaurant. 

Today I was craving the butter chicken and rice, I had been thinking about it all week and man it was perfect! Also out to try was Chile Chicken, that my friend was a very delish dish. Oh and let's not forget the garlic naan, that's some good stuff right there!

If you haven't been to India Grill, you should give them a try! Also if you check in on Yelp, you can get 10% off your bill!!
