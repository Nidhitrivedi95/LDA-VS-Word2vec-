-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA The food here was fantastic. I went for the lunch buffet and was pretty much blown away by it. The chutney, paneer, and butter chicken were particularly good. I found the cilantro rice a little bit odd because it was green, but it tasted fine regardless. I was also a little disappointed that the buffet didn't include samosas, but that's really more of a nitpick. My only real complaint (and what's keeping this place from 5 stars) was the price. $14 for a lunch buffet is a bit steep in my opinion - plus they ask for a tip. I don't normally tip at buffets but I was too intimidated to not leave one as I had to do that right in front of the cashier. I've been searching the valley for the best Indian food, and my search for what can top Kohinoor continues. This place is as close as anyone has gotten, though.
