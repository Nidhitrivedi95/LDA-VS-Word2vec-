So, I felt like playing ping pong, drove to Estrella (the old Smokey Joe's) near Yonge and Sheppard...and I wanted to eat something.

I used to live in the area for 2 years, and know for an emprical fact you have good people and things to do in the area.....but every single restaurant in the area - sucks

So, after playing ping pong, I walk in here.

It is EMPTY.  Not a single person in the whole restaurant, except the owner.  Bad sign.

Nothing to lose (nothing in the area that is worth eating, I lived here and checked under every rock), so I sit down, and order.

The food comes out actually very good.  There are some fake pseudo names to foods to make foreign food easier to understand.   Pakoras are now named "Poppers", Daal is explained as Lentils, and Chana Masala is now flavoured chick peas.  But if you know what you are doing, you can work backwards and order what you need :) 

Ate the Bombay Curry (which tasted exactly like a good Karaih Curry), and shish kebabs which was pretty good too.

Overall, I remember NOT writing about Bombay Grill (because I used to have to get takeout somewhere) and you can't write bad about somewhere you eat!  

So, I would say give it a shot if you are in the area.  You have no other choices unfortunately :( 

The person who served me Ali (I think) was outstanding customer service.  I had to personally tell him to keep his business going.  People will come.

Should be a solid 4 star, but gave it a 5.  It defies all logic of Yonge and Shep and actually gives you a decent meal.

Enjoy :)
