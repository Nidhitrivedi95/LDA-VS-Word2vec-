j3YSK-IgpNabCIzWEl7CaA When I see a lot of Indians going in and out this place then I know this place must be good! and for sure it is! Chicken Tikka  and Chicken Biryani was a great awesome deal and the Biryani was super spicy and authentic! Everyone seems get the samosas so i got those too and indeed they are good! I also got the Candied Coconut desserts in various colors.. they are ok seems softer  than the ones I'm used to back home but perhaps are different types. 
There is also a grocery market section and the only gripe I have is there are No Prices!!  If, you sell goods you should always have prices labeled! Alas I could easily give this place a 5 Star but Minus one star for Missing prices.
