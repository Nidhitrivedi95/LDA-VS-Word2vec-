cvELVLQ4jbS5Qqbm79IxVA Had the take out standard Indian - Butter Chicken and Tikka Masala last night. The owner seemed deeply interested in my opinion, and my opinion was that it was probably the best Ive ever had. Seriously. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and I genuinely hope they do well, because this is the kind of place and people that deserve it. Do yourself a favor and check this place out
