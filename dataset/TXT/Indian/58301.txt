Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g The Butter Chicken Factory is just down the street, but Rashnaa's does a much better butter chicken. A lovely almondy-tomato sauce, creamy, with soft morsels of chicken. I actually like their butter chicken more than Banjara's, & everyone seems to agree that Banjara does the best butter chicken in Toronto.

Their saag paneer wasn't very impressive - gritty spinach and a few tiny cubes of paneer, in an infuriatingly small "vegetarian sized" container. Although I'm not a fan of their titular dish, The Butter Chicken Factory's palak paneer is incredible, so when I do takeaway I get my butter chicken at Rashnaa and my palak paneer at Butter Chicken Factory.

The space is strange. I've never eaten in, but the restaurant is a converted house and the dining room is the original living room of the house. I always feel a little like I'm walking in to someone's place uninvited when I go to pick up my takeaway. They do have a patio for the summer, however.

Staff have always been friendly to me.
