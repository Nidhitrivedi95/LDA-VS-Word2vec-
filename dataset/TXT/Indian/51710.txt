UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I loved this place.  Very clean, great service and great food.  I have never had Indian food before so I was not sure what the items were or their taste.  The waiter was extremely helpful, pulled out his tablet and showed me pictures of the items I had questions on and explained them to me.  I have an allergy to onions so he was quick to show me the items that I could not eat.  I would recommend this restaurant to my friends and I would of course eat here again.  

Also, we had a larger party (7) so I made reservations and our table was ready when we arrived at the time given.
