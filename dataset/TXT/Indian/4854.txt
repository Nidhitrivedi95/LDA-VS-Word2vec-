2ph-6k3mXY93TLDCteC6IQ I went there with the family. Nice decent place. Lot of food for little money.  Got good service we were the only ppl in during lunch time. We ordered thali , naan & chicken 65. Thali was good. Chicken 65 was plain & bland. Was disappointing.  Might not go there again. I have had much better South Indian / Sri Lankan food in Montreal.
