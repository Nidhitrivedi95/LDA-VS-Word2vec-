Had to come on here and say I was feeling sick and one of the servers noticed and offered me hot lemon water which was really nice and unexpected. Definitely coming back here for a full meal + dessert since I was too sick and had to take out my unfinished meal. 5 stars for the excellent service, I'm impressed by how nicely they packed up my food too with circular containers and staples and all haha. I would recommend this place to my friends!
