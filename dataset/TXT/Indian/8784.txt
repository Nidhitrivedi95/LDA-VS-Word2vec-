7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Probably one of the better Indian food in the greater Cleveland area. We were greeted right away and there was no wait. We ordered and appetizer & our entrees at the same time. The appetizer never came out but dinners did. We didn't feel like asking for the appetizer since our entrees came out. We ordered items off the tandoori menu and a curry dish. All delicious. Definitely be going back again!
