Hmm Indian food selection is very limited in Champaign so I was excited to eat at Bombay again since my medical school days. I had only been here once with my wife for dinner and the food was pretty spicy. The lunch special seemed enticing for 7+ dollars depending on what you order. I wish I took a picture of the menu, maybe next time. The chicken curry I ordered took a bit of time to prepare but it came out piping hot. The curry was not spicy at all which was perfect. It was rich and creamy with ample amount of chicken. The naan was simply the largest naan I have ever seen. It was perfect with the curry. You also get a potato pakora. No salad though as mentioned previously. All and all great, but if you could pay a dollar or two more for buffet at someplace else I probably would go with that for variety. The only downside of this place is that they use plastic ware and plates, but I guess this is a college town after all and I have to lower my standards. 

Pro: large menu with lunch specials, large naan, not too spicy curry

Cons: plasticware, slow service

Hidden gem: 
7+ dollar lunch specials with large naan or rice and potato pakora
