Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I had a seekh kebab as well as a chicken curry (I forgot which kind!) with a friend. Fantastic. They really know their way around flavors. I was basically enchanted the entire meal with what was going on in my mouth. Good portions too! We came at a good time when there weren't as many people and service was great and quick. Best if you enjoy food spicy!
