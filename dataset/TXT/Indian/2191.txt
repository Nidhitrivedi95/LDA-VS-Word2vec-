_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA I ordered dinner from here, in bread I ordered onion kulcha, palak cheese stuffed naan and Stuffed with sun dried tomato garlic and chilli, breads were fine not something out of the world. Paneer tikka was bland even though I asked for spicy. The vegetable biryani was disappointing, it was not flavourful. I expected something really mouthwatering with all the reviews. Being a vegan I don't know about the Non veg food served here. However, the veg food that I ordered did not delight me for what I paid. I have eaten better Indian food for lesser price.
