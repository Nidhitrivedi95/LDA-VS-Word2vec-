JoHDOuZ1BnFi63PgC_zYeQ I've ordered delivery once and went to the lunch buffet once.

Service :2/5
For the lunch buffet, they had a large crowd and the kitchen could barely keep up. They also had only one waiter who seated people and handled payments, so it took a while to pay. They are quite understaffed and it shows.

Food: 4/5
For the items available, the lunch buffet was very good. The tandoori chicken was well seasoned and the curries were delicious. Also, the chicken in their chicken tikki masala was not overcooked (unlike kohinoor, sorry to say). They had some mushroom spinach curry that was amazing, and was probably my favorite dish in the buffet (besides the tandoori chicken). Overall the food is quite good here.

Ambiance: 4/5
Nothing much to say here, the place seemed clean and organized. Decor is nice but nothing special, and it's comparable to other Indian restaurants in town. 

For the delivery, the food arrived on time and was also very good. 

If this restaurant hires more staff to improve their service, this place can easily be 4 stars or higher.
