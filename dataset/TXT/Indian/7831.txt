6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w The food is good and it's nice that it's on Main Street. However, unfortunately the food took forever to come out. We waited for the appetizers for half an hour and the mains took another hour. The time for food to be placed on the table is unacceptable. 
The kitchen needs to be a bit more efficient.
