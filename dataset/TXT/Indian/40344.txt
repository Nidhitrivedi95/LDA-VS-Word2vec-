pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA What I love about the greater Toronto area (GTA) is the vast abudnance of South Indian/Sri Lankan/SE Asian cuisine dining choices. This particular one does offer often a few non-mainstream menu entrees. However today I elected to try the buffet, just to get a feel for the variety. I noticed they had goat bone soup besides the traditional 'Rasam' (funny enough the word means juice, but spicy juice as this is prepared mainly with tamarind or tomato as the base along with cumin, black pepper and dry chilli powder as flavoring ingredients). Was disappointed that the bone soup was very lukewarm. They had the usual savory fritters (pakora), paper dosa, parotta (layered flatbread, very soft, buttery and tasty!), chicken chettinad (rich brown gravy), vegetarian choices, curd rice, papad (thin crisp disc shaped accompaniments, made from lentils), choice of two Indian desserts: gulab jamun (literally rose plums :) made by frying dough balls and then steeped in syrup) plus payasum (a classic rice pudding made by boiling rice, or vermicelli with milk and sugar) also available is ice cream. I do like that they offer fresh cut fruits as well. I topped this off with very classic Madras coffee (flavored with chicory), served in a piping hot steel tumbler. Recommended!
