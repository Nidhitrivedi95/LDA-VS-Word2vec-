TAnzFr9NixvCbvUdJMWL5Q Wife and I went there today because next door is a top-notch vacuum repair place.  We decided to visit this restaurant for the first time.  Boy!!! Are we glad we did.  Very clean.  Hostess/waitress was very accommodating and helpful as we deciphered the menu items.
This is not a buffet but a restaurant having a list of lunch items.  Each dish comes as either vegetarian, chicken, or goat.  Wife had chicken and I had goat.  Both meats fell off the bone.  Was a bit spicy but not all that bad.  Each lunch special came with a appetizer, main course with nan, and a dessert. We both loved our meals and we'll be back.
