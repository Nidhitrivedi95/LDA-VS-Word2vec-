xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w In Pittsburgh, it just doesn't get any better than Tamarind for Indian cuisine.  Moderate prices, great service, and really great, authentic dishes that don't skimp on the heat.  If you ask for extra spicy, you GET extra spicy.  We've been visiting this place on occasion for several years, and from the very first visit, we noticed that there were a lot of folks of Indian heritage frequenting it.  That hasn't changed.  It's tempting to order appetizers at an Indian restaurant, because usually portion sizes in such establishments are modest by Pittsburgh big eater standards, but that's not necessary here.  A papadum and some nan are the only sides you'll need consider.  The garlic nan is excellent, as is the dal.  My favorite dish is the lamb vindaloo, but the tandoori sampler shines, especially for those who are shy about curry.
