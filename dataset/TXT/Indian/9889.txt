9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw My favorite place for Indian food in Las Vegas and has been since it first opened. I was overjoyed when I saw the new one going up on Durango and have been there at least five times already. The most recent visit was Saturday for the buffet. Pakora. Chicken korma. Chicken Tikka masala. Mutter paneer. Saag with mushrooms. It was delicious from start to finish. I don't eat naan - not gluten free - but even that smelled fantastic. My partner says it's the best naan he's ever had. I'll have to just take his word on that.
