LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Having been lucky enough to have homemade dosas with good friends, I can say how lovely it is to now have this option to tied me over between visits with them!!  Delicious, authentic, full of flavour and textures.  Tried the rava dosa and thoroughly enjoyed even at the mild level!  Make reservations ..its busy weeknight and especially Sunday lunch.
