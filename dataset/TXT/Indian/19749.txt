FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Wow!  This is my favorite restaurant.  An indication that it is good is that it is almost always busy, and always has Indian people eating there.  It is busy, but I still just love the ambiance, and the food is really good.  My taste buds say so, and my Indian friends who know Indian food also say so.  Highly recommended!  Lunch Buffet is best.
