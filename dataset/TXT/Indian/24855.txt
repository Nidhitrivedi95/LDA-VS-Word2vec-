h2cPIifmtPD029q4sthRSQ I went here a week ago with family. First off this place is tiny, has a very cramped feel to it, employees were having a hard time squeezing between chairs to get to the kitchen in the back. Our server was very nice. Service was pretty slow despite there being a max of 10-12 people in the restaurant, I think there were a total of 4-5 employees working that I could see. We all had the $16 dinner "buffet", it's not actually a buffet it's basically a platter of different varieties on one big plate that has unlimited refills, including naan bread and dessert. Took awhile to get to us after we ordered, and when it came it wasn't that hot. The food was pretty good but I had expected the butter chicken to be better, it was way too salty. When we were paying for the food I asked the owner if I could give some constructive criticism that would benefit his business, he agreed and I let him know about the butter chicken. He told his chef in front of me and looked a bit offended, he explained it was a new chef and it was his first day. The owner had a bit of an attitude, would not recommend going here there are much better places for Indian food out there.
