yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I have frequented this restaurant since it opened. I understand the problems people may have with the place, i have had a few of my own. 

There are also the great things which people have mentioned. Here are some more.... 

There is this new guy in charge there, from Sri Lanka, who is really cool (and into Pink Floyd). I think he's changed a few things recently, and also is a very helpful energetic server. Each day, there is now a different salad for lunch. Our lunch thali began with an outstanding salad with mangoes, lettuce, and veggies served in a bowl shaped papad! Later that lunch, when he found out my friend did not eat dairy, he offered an awesome fruit salad for desert instead of the gulab jamen in creamy fruit sauce. 

Another time, we were talking to our waiter about one of the dishes, a bitter melon dish (the melon with the spikey outside). We decided to stick to our normal orders. Then, the guy brings out the dish for our group of three to try on the house! I would not recommend ordering the dish here, it is funky and bitter. At the end of the meal, they brought out hot towels and lemon for us to clean up with. They were pampering us, maybe because we come in all the time and tip well. 

I later had the bitter melon in New Delhi and it was way better. I'm thinking the melon might be shipped here, giving it a strange taste. This is most certainly the case with the Indian soda, Limca, which you can order. I believe they ship over old batches, as evidenced by the lower cost printed on the bottle, and the aftertaste of cardboard. I want a real limca so bad. Its nice that they have chaat (indian street food), but it was better before I knew what Indian street food really tastes like. Still, it's these things which makes Dhaba stand out above the other places, that and its cool to hang out there. 

It also can be slightly cheaper than Delhi palace, or royal taj.
