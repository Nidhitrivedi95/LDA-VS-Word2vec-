nbf4o8gUP2y9JKFE2wBO2A The food here is delicious! Take out only though and the service is a little slow and haphazard. We were there on a busy night and the staff couldn't figure out who was next in line; they should look into a numbering system. The butter chicken and channa masala were very flavorful, but the naan was just OK.
