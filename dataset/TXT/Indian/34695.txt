Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg When I am in Vegas, very rarely  do I wake up in time to have lunch. I have been to Tamba 2-3 times before and always for dinner/pre-dinner. There food has always been good, but the service with attitude has always turned me off. I would not waste my time typing this if it was not for their value for money lunch buffet I had last time. It comes to $15 per person and it has lots of variety. None of the items are truly great, but none are bad too. Now only if they would serve you water in something other than those cheap iparty plastic cups!
