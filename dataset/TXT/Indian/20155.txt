fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA We really very much enjoyed this Markham Indian restaurant.
We went for lunch on a Saturday, and there was a great selection. 
They had all the usual suspects. 
Such as:
- Butter Chicken ( boneless)
- Tandoori chicken
- Goat Curry
- Daal
- Aloo

Plus lots of different kinds of salads, rice, fish, lots of vegetarian choices, and they brought fresh man baked right on the tandoor. It was awesome. Loved the Naan bread. Service was nice and friendly and we ended up having Mango Lassi with it also 

Dessert was fresh fruit, ice pudding, ice cream, carrot pudding. and the cake balls in cardamom syrup. 

Food had a bit of bite to it but definitely suitable for western palates. It was pretty busy with families and couples alike.
