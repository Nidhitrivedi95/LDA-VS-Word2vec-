CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Outstanding.  Every dish we ordered was a knock-out, and the service for our party of four (four adults and a spice-averse 5 year-old) was excellent.  We all agreed that Dhaba served one of the best Indian meals we'd ever had.

I didn't pay the bill that evening, so I can't recall the exact damage, but I think that it was slightly pricier than your average Indian meal out.

Highly recommended.
