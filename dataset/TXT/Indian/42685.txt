RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg This is not the best of the Mel Oza family of restaurants, but if you can't get up to Copper you should at least come here. Each and every time I step into one of these Indian establishments the quality and variety of the food is top notch, and the flavors are always astounding!
