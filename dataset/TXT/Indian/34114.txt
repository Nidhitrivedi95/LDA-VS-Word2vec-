m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw We have went to all the Indian restaurants in CU and nothing really touches this place in terms of quality and flavor of food. I've been for lunch twice and dinner once. We've ordered Chicken Saag, Lamb Saag, Lamb Korma, Mixed Grill, and the Mutter Mushroom Paneer. We've also tried the regular naan, garlic naan and Jaipuri naan. Everything has been absolute perfection every time. There is one waitress who takes the orders (and I've seen that place so busy, she literally RUNS from kitchen to table) while the rest of the wait staff bring out the food, fill drinks, and clear tables. Waitress is knowledgeable about the food and has offered personable and extremely pleasant service each time. The prices here are also phenomenal. For dinner, we had ordered 3 entrees (one of which was the mixed grill), 2 orders of naan, a milk tea and a mango lassi and the bill came out to less then $45. We were floored it was so inexpensive for how much food we took home. 

This place has it all. Flavor, great food, fantastic portions, incredible price and unbelievable service. Definitely head in here for a meal. You won't regret it. I truly hope this place stays in CU for years to come.
