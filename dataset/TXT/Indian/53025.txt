V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg Atrocious on almost all levels. Complete apathy of service, almost borderline rude. Food was sub par, my usual favorite dish of Matar Paneer was almost inedible I threw most of it away. I would mention pricing but honestly if the food was good I wouldn't be too upset but $20+ for a terrible meal isn't good value. Change your attitudes and your chefs.
