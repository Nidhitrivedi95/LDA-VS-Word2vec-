DPsbhgdHty--Jegj_yNaUQ Jaaadu was transformed sometime this year into a second location of Chef of India. Jaaadu was well-loved and I think Chef of India will be a worthy replacement, I don't know what the background story is, but my impression was better than the reviews for the other Chef of India location.

Chef of India was up there with the best Indian food I've had in Toronto. Two words are all you need here, Malai Kofta. Their version of the amazing fried spiced paneer and raisin balls absolutely floored me. The kofta were absolutely perfect and served in a delicious korma sauce which left my belly in a state of complete and muttar bliss.  I also got to try the Chicken Danshak, which I've never seen anywhere else and it was decent and wonderfully spicy, but not one I would order again, too many other classic dishes to try.

I always try the mango lassi when I'm checking out a new restaurant, and Chef of India made the best one I've had outside of House of Curries in Berkeley, CA, which is steep praise. Their naan was a little buttery, but fluffy and absolutely delicious.

It was a little pricey, but the food was definitely a cut above most establishments, and I like that they serve classic dishes in a classic style. They have a buffet, though I don't have the details. I'm definitely going to check it out soon though.
