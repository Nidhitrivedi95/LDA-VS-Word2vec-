NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I like the paneer, tikka masala and kulfi here. The rest are meh.

Paneer: indian cheese, made by Amish source.

Tikka masala sauce: the most flavorful sauce here

Kulfi: I had mango flavor. The taste reminds me of  mango lasse. It is a type of frozen custard. I'm hesitant to call it ice cream because it is not whipped, so it's less airy, more dense and creamier.
