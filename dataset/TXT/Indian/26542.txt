ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg My second visit to Copper and I was just as pleased as the first time!  We went for dessert after the South End Gallery Crawl and sat at the bar to enjoy our cups of Massala Chai Tea and wait for our gelato.  We sampled pistachio, mango and passionfruit and they were creamy, flavorful and oh so good!   The wait staff once again were friendly, helpful and attentive from the hostess to the bartender.  

Great place for a wonderful meal and definitely for dessert!  Go check it out!
