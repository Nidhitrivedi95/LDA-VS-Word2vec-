xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I would rate this place a two and a half at most. Lots of dirty tables that need to be cleaned.  Very slow service.  No one greeted us when we came in.  My order was wrong, and so over stuffed that I had a hard time eating it.  The red chilie was very good.  My wife and son liked thiers.  Prolly won't return.
