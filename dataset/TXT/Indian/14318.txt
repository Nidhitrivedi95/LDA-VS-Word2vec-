c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg The butter chicken here is good but when we ordered the second one it tasted completely different, it was very sweet compared to the other one that was buttery and a bit more spicy. When I addressed the issue they told me all butter chicken was cooked in the same pot that even if they change it, it would have been the same. I am really confused as of why all 4 of us agreed that it was different and even the colour was different. The food here is ok but the service here is horrible I would not return.
