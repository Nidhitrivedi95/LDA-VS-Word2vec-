i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ First time trying South Indian food, and I was very impressed! The restaurant is in a cozy house, so you feel like you're having family dinner in someone's home. 

Ordered a bunch of appetizers to split with friends. They each came with four sauces that were delicious and packed with flavour. The tomato one was by far our favourite.

I had the paper masala dosa and it was delicious. Like a thin and crispy crepe, coated with melted butter, and filled with a spiced potato mixture. The first few bites were like a dream. My only complaint is that the ghee (clarified butter) started to feel very heavy as the dish cooled.

Would definitely come back to try more things!
