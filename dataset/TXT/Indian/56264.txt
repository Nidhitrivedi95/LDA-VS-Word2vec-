xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA This is a place that I only accidentally found through Yelp itself.  No one I know had ever heard of it, but they have now.

The jerk chicken is what I constantly get every trip there.  Its hot, but its a quality heat.  Absolute delicious every time I've been there.

Had chicken curry in the past, and while it was well done, I end up constantly coming back to the jerk chicken.  Yet to have a bad meal there, after 10+ trips.
