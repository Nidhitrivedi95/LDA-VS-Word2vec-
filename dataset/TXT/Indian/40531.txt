PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ The food was delicious!  We were in the area after a yelp event and a friend was familiar with this place, so we decided to do dinner here.  It was great.  The food was delicious (we ordered two chicken dishes and a veggie one) and the service was friendly.

To be honest, the only reason this doesn't warrant a 5 star is that the ambience is pretty mediocre.  The rest of the experience is perfectly lovely (or possibly even amazing).  I would recommend to practically everyone.
