auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Had the lunch buffet on the weekend.
A fresh garlic naan was delivered to our table within minutes of getting our drinks.
Food was very well prepared. Everything was being replenished all the time. Nothing was stale or old. When my wife and I left there was only two empty tables.
Great food and wonderful service.
