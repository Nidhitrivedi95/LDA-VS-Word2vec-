gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is my second time here. Not a Vegas native but this is a must visit upon arriving. The manager (Prakash) is very accommodating and courteous with his customers providing over the top service. The food is an orgasm of flavor  and taste with an abundance of options. 

I travel frequently and this is by far the best Indian yet. Highly recommended. DEFINITELY order the gulab before you leave :) 

Guten Appetit
