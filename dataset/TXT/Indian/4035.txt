112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA I ordered delivery on 7/26 and it was pretty much a success.

I found that the value for my money was pretty good.

I had the lamb salad, which had a reasonable number of lamb chunks and a healthy dose of cabbage based salad that actually tasted pretty good.

I had two of the mini samosas. The paneer and spinach ones. They were also pretty good, but definitely small.

I also had the Masala Chai, which was actually pretty spicy for a drink. Almost two spicey.

I ordered just enough to avoid a delivery charge. Ordering on the phone wasn't super easy, the young kid who took my order had to ask if they could deliver a drink or if I was in there range or if they had the advertised dessert from the hand out flyer I got at the Shaker Square farmers market. Delivery time from the moment I hung up was about 30 minutes, and I live pretty close.

It comes down to Chutney Rolls being a good value for the cost, and I would recommmend you try them!
