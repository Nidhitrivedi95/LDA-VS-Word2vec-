iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I do not have a whole lot of experience eating Indian food however tonight's dishes chosen at Marigold Maison must set a new standard in terms of quality, depth and complexity of flavors.

We ordered the seared eggplant and butter shrimp as appetizers and they were both incredible. The seared eggplant was like candy it was so good and melt in your mouth! The butter shrimp was succulent accompanied by its chipotle cream sauce.

As entree, we ordered the spicy chicken korma and it was delightful. Our server Abraham brought us three different kinds of chutneys which were a nice finishing touch.

The service was spot on and very attentive. Thank you Abraham and the chefs who prepared this most delicious memorable meal ! Will definitely go back!
