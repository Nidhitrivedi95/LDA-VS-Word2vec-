0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Great  service , the owner is really nice especially if you speak Hindi. The waiters are very attentive when it comes to filling drinks, taking plates and making sure that you are satisfied. We came in around 9pm and the buffet was still full and worth it ( $10 per person) . My girlfriend is a vegetarian and she enjoyed the sahi paneer and I'm Non-Veg and I loved the tandoori chicken and chicken masala. If you guys enjoy beer than I would recommend Hayward 5000 to add delightful yet unique favor. P. S. the bathrooms are clean, and check Groupon out if your looking for dinner for 2.
