jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg Honestly, I was a bit disappointed by the food selections upon initial inspection but warmed up to them. I looked at other reviews on here and realized that it was southern, not northern indian cuisine which I was unaware of. I liked the spiciness of the food and the naan bread was wonderful. My favorite was the cauliflower dish(cannot remember the exact name.) The only thing I would add is to goto the buffet earlier - towards the end, it seemed like it was pretty picked over(like the dish with paneer cheese had none except sauce). The bathrooms themselves seemed disorganized with paper products running out and in random locations. It's definitely somewhere I'm going to try again. It isn't as big of a buffet as other places but the price was right.
