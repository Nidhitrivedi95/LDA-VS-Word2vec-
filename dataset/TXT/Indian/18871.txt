ERX_Dz1prKPk_qXtFhUsAA I really like the owner/waiter. He was fun and nice and kept talking to me in urdu which was nice because that means he thought I looked Pakistani when most people think I'm Mexican (I'm Pakistani). But I had no clue what he was saying, but it was still enjoyable. 

The food is decent. Definitely not the best indian food you'll get in the city, but decent. It's good for uptowners, for sure, as it's literally across the street from Sheppard Centre. 

It's not particularly cheap though, not insanely expensive but definitely not cheap. 

Service was good. 
Staff was lovely. 
Food was alright. 
Price wasn't great, but what to do...
