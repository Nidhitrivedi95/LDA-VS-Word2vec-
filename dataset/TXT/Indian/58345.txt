YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ This place was awesome and they had the best thing I've ever tried, Samosa's with Channa Masala, it was spicy and just wonderful.

The servers were fast and efficient and they had a huge variety on the Menu, not just north indian foods but south indian as well which isn't too common in indian restaurants in Canada.

People sitting behind us were annoyingly loud, other than that I have no complaints about my experience at this restaurant.

If you are in Montreal and in the area, this is a cheap place to eat and has amazing food.
