yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This is my Wife and my new favorite Indian place to order off the menu!! To be fair, we have a favorite lunch buffet and a favorite dinner buffet places when it comes to Indian.

Typical Indian service...just enough service and only when needed. They don't hover or push you out the door.

We had the Keema Samosa's and Paneer appetizers. I had the Khanaza Tandoori platter and she had the Chicken Tikka Masala. Everything was delicious and above par for PHX Indian food.

Try the Kashmiri Naan with a spicy vindaloo!!
