flEnFkUtW5YVowWbenXsSg This review is only for their chicken kebab combos. The combo is $8:50 including tax and comes with 2 chicken sheekh kebabs and the option of rice or fresh naan, salad and a choice of pop or bottled water.

The kebabs have been fairly consistent and the fresh baked naan is always good, spice level is medium to hi and the kebab is very flavorful, for the price you cannot go wrong.
The decor is not great, you wouldn't want to go out on a date at this place. Place is open till the early hours 7 days and till at least 4am on the weekend. The normal crowd in this place seems to be taxi drivers.

I have never tried any of the curries in this place so I can't say anything about those dishes.
