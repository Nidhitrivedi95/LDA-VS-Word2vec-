DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA They are more of a Nepali restaurant than an Indian restaurant.
Getting straight to the point....the food was amazing!!
We had the Nepali bhel and momos for appetizers. The bhel was so good albeit a little spicy. You might want to stay close to the lower end of the spice scale when ordering.
The momos were also really really good, closest to authentic momos I have had in the US.
For entrees we had kadai chicken and a lamb dish. Both were very very good. Just the perfect balance of heat and spices.
Even the naan bread was so good, soft and fluffy!
Now to the bad part....the place was dirty!!
The tables were not clean, the carpets were stained, the decor was shoddy and the whole place seemed so uninviting.
I hope they can figure out the cleanliness issues, otherwise it's a little gem of a place.
