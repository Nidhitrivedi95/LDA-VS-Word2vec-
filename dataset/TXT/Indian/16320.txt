The complaints about the food being bland are valid BUT only because they cook all the food mild be default, it says in the menu to ask for spicy if you like some kick.  I can understand this but didn't see the section in the menu mentioning it so we got our food mild and it was certainly mild!  

Great food though, very light, not heavy like most Indian restaurants and coming from an indian family I know my indian food well.  Looking forward to going again and asking for some "kick." 

Had:
Veggie Samosas (good chutneys)
Papadum (also good)
Chai (excellent!!!!)
Saag Paneer (Very good, pretty sure the paneer was fresh also and not the Indian grocery store Verka/Dhawat/Nanak prepakaged)
Chicken Tikka Masala (good, needs kick though there was no "tikka"
skipped desert was too full

Total cost was under 50 bucks with tip/tax will definately go again!
