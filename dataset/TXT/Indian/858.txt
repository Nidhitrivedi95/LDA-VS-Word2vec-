-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I wanted vegan, and the staff made some suggestions which I took. Very tasty. Very helpful and friendly staff too. Unfortunately
(For me), I wouldn't know how to order SE
Asian vegan dishes, so I have to ask for suggestions. But the suggested dish(es) were tasty and varied. The staff helpful and friendly, and other diners friendly as well. 
This is a no frills section of a supermarket with maybe 6 small tables. Free chai tea, and I was stuffed for under $9.
