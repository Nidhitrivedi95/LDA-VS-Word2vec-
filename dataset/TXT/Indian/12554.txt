AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw The plethora of good reviews for this place is mind boggling. This was a quick pick up and get out venture as this place came recommended by someone.  My friend who buys samosas regularly commented boy these are pricier than normal for a smaller sized offering. They have two categories of samosas. Traditional and gourmet OK I suppose as why not try out a new take on this tried and tested offering. There were three offerings for sauces as well. 
We stuck with the traditional chicken version. They do sell frozen version for less so if you like the taste profile here give them a try. 
The fresh one's were very greasy. The filling was nothing to write home about either. I would say food court level. The sauce for dipping was bland as well.  If one factors in the price/value proposition I would say you are better off buying at your regular source.
