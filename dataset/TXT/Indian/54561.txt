WCW9a5AfUlyx98Ul-hRMHg After moving to Toronto from Vancouver, we had been searching for dosas like we used to get out west. After a few different tries we discovered The Tiffin Box right around the corner from our home. While it's not a huge menu, I think it's a good thing as everything we've tasted has been delicious. The prices are also very reasonable, especially for the quality that you get. 

If you're in the Bathurst / Bloor area and have a hankering for quality South Indian food, The Tiffin Box is definitely worth a visit.
