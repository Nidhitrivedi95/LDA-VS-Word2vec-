Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w What a find.. absolutely recommend this place. We ordered the chicken lollipop which came with gravy and was fantastic. Then come the chilli chicken momo's with gravy again.. recommend it. Final order was veg fried rice which smelt so good but was full and had to take it to go. Will definitely come again to try other Nepali cuisine..
Food - 5 star
Ambience - 3 star (after the food, can't complain but if they can improve it'll be even more busier)
Service - 4 star (momo's are freshly made, so they take time about 15)
Overall - 4 star
