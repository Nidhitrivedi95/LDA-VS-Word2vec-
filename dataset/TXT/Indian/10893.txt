a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g I went for some good Indian food. But this was not the right place. I thought of trying this place for a change and it turned out to be a wrong decision. The food was not on par with any other restaurants I have dined-in before. After waiting for almost 20 mins  our food was ready. The Naan was dipping oil and the curries were filled with strange spices. If you are really hungry and want some real Indian food, avoid this place.
