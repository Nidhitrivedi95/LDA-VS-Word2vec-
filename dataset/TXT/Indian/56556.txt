xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw Cleveland Tiffin is definitely the go-to spot in Cleveland for authentic Indian food.  We called in our order and drove over to pick it up.  We were given piping hot samosas as we waited for our freshly cooked food.  We ordered the chicken tikka and it was wonderful.  Couldn't have more authentic food if it was made by our mothers!  Will definitely be going back.  An ideal spot for busy professionals/medical students/medical residents to pick up food for the week.  (This is not however a place for a sit-down meal...more-so a storefront for pick-up).
