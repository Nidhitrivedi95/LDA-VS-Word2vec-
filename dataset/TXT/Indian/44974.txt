S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA This place is amazing! Where do I begin? The decor is simple but very clean and as soon as we walked in we were greeted and seated. We encountered three waiters and every single one was super nice and they all answered any questions we had.

This was my first time eating Indian food and I am a fan. My husband had the chicken masala spice level 7 and I had a shrimp dish (I can't remember the exact name) spice level 5. We each ordered a side of basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was absolutley delicious and not too spicy. We ended the meal with the deep fried cheese dessert which was amazing. 

When you come across a place like this you want to tell everyone! There is a shortage of places to eat where not only is the service excellent, but the food is as well. They don't get all of these amazing ratings for nothing, so go check them out! I can't wait to go back!
