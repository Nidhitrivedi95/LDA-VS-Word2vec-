gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA This place is simply amazing!! I was a big fan when they were at the riviera and im super excited about this new location as well....I have to say this location is much nicer and cleaner than the Riviera...but the food is the best part which continues to be transferred over.....we visit vegas for work and this place is our absolute go-to.....they have the best south indian dishes!!! The Masala Dosa is my most fav!!! The staff is friendly and the service is good too.....A must try for anyone who like indian!
