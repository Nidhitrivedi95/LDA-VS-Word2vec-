RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I had a business dinner last week at Blue Taj. I eat only vegan, whereas my associate does not. However, we both love great Indian cuisine. 

We arrived with no reservation on a Thursday evening, around 8:00PM and were greeted quickly and cordially. We were seated within five minutes. The atmosphere was very nice, quiet and our table fairly private. The wait staff were attentive and knowledgeable. I mentioned my vegan requirements and suggestions were quickly made to accommodate me.

The food presentation was great. Plating was clean and simple, food looked great. But the best part of the taste and quality of the food. It was perfect in every way. Spices were exactly as ordered. Mine was modestly spicy. My table mate's was much hotter, as requested. 

Vegetables were fresh, tender, cooked perfectly. The sauces were excellent. Our food was hot, but not too hot to enjoy immediately. Everything was delicious!

Prices were very reasonable and fair. Our overall experience could not have been better.

We both agreed that we would return to Blue Taj. And I would recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for excellent, authentically Indian cuisine and courteous service.
