RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This place is freakin' awesome. Best practical regular Indian food in the city I think (barring some really fancy places). Sure, it's a hole in the wall (well, actually several trailers in the wall) but who effing cares. Deal with the styrofoam plates. The plastic cutlery. You're coming for the food, not the atmosphere at this place. One thing that actually is on the nice side are the restrooms. They share them with the place next door. They are very clean and have those sensor taps and soap dispensers. Great if you get ethnic fatigue too early :) But I digress..

On to the food. The butter chicken is the best I have ever had (and I've had really good homemade stuff at an Indian friend's house many times). Had a really nice kick to it. And the chicken was cooked in the tandoor before it was bathed in the butter chicken sauce. So its like tandoori chicken in butter chicken sauce. The grilled lamb skewers were also fantastic. Bursting with flavour. I would steer clear of the samosas. They are not bad, just not worth wasting space on! 

I will admit that depending on what you order, the food can be a bit on the greasy side, but it is so damn good. I think next time I will focus exclusively on the BBQ stuff.
