0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I absolutely loved this place! It's a little bit awkward at first because they don't really seat you or tell you how their setup works, you just kind of go for it. The price is unreal! I called ahead to ask for pricing and I thought for sure I had misunderstood. The restaurant was clean, and you could tell it was family owned. Everyone was very kind and attentive, they knew that we hadn't eaten there before because they didn't recognize us. They brought us one of each of their deserts for free, such a sweet gesture. The food was really wonderful, I wish I had a bigger stomach. They have a great variety and a few things I hadn't heard of before, along with the staples that no good Indian restaurant can go without. The man who was refilling everyone's water was hilarious. Can't wait to go back!
