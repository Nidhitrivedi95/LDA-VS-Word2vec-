BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg Well-meaning but understaffed. I got to check out the dinner buffet where one waitress had to take care of all of several tables. The kitchen was having a hard time keeping up with the food supplies. They ran out of Naan pretty frequently but the waitress had us in mind and always saved a few for us. The lamb curry was too slow coming that they just removed it from the buffet selection leaving nothing but chicken. The tandoori chicken was a rare sight too but the butter chicken was decent. As far as dessert goes, the Gulab Jamon was good but the ice cream was too hard to properly scoop, given that they didn't actually have an ice cream scoop. I'd say come only if you need to fix your Indian food craving.
