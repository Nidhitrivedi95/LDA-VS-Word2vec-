3r5FidzFQ9rfAoQOtixfxA Delicious nihari and BBQ! The place is not that nice of a sit down which is why I only gave it 3 stars. But the food is great! The Kashmiri chai is also not be missed. Just be sure to ask for more tea and a little less milk since they tend to put too much milk for my liking. The service here is amazing!!
