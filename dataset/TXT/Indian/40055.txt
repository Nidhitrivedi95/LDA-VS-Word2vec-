pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Stopped in Dec 28,and ordered dinner. Asked for a5 in spicyness. Food came and was way over 5 (more like an 8). The manager came by and asked if there was a problem. We explained about the extreme heat, and she immediately took all the dishes back and replaced them with new food that was much milder and edible. Great service. Have stopped in many times before and will definitely return.
