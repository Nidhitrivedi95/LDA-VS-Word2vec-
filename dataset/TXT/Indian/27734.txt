irCBE0vRZ9oQZ26qMR-5HA This amaya express, although in a food court, blows my mind. The guys that work here are so so so friendly, and always offer me samples when I'm looking at the menu or just walking by. You know that if you are living the vegan lifestyle, you need to be super careful when eating out, especially in a food court. I had already made my rounds around markville's food options but found nothing appealing. What is so hard to get that vegans can eat more than a salad?? Life's rough. 

I went over to amaya, because if anything I can get some rice and call it a day. I'm hangry as hell at this point. I approach with caution because I am so awkward that I may end up buying everything even if I can't eat any of it just because I feel bad that they have to talk to me. First, I don't like mentioning the word 'vegan' when ordering in ordinary restaurants/food places because I always feel weird and don't want that special spotlight on me. They have several deals and they told me I could choose a combo with one rice, one meat and a veggie. I chose the biryani rice, which looked bomb af. I hesitantly asked if I could only choose one veggie and no meat because I only saw the curried chick peas and the rest of the vegetables looked like they were swimming in dairy-based sauce. The guys insisted on me choosing another vegetable to get the best out of the deal and when I declined, they gave me a reassuring smile and told me that it's vegan. Phew, avoided that awkward situation! I ended up getting this eggplant dish along with my chick peas and rice. Oh, and also warm warm naan bread. Yum! The biryani rice drenched with the sauce from the chick peas was warming to my stomach and in return it thanked me for carbing the f up. 

Everything was delightful and I'd definitely return to amaya for more food court meals when I'm hangry next. (It was a tiny bit oily, but so is all food when you eat out)
