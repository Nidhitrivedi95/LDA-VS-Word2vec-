KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw This place offers a modern take on Indian food that is really impressive. You can pick from a variety of vegetarian options and completely forget that what you're eating is just veggies... The spices are bold and plentiful, and the brilliant concoctions served up are unlike the usual offerings of traditional Indian restaurants. The only reason I won't commit to five stars is that our dining experience was slightly odd... It was 1:00 in the afternoon and they were blasting super-raunchy R&B... The kind that would make you blush... But the burger and fries were out of this world, so yeah, I'd definitely go back. The food is inventive and delicious, and almost confusing. In a very good way.
