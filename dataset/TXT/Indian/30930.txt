KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ We eat at PTI about once a month and absolutely love the weekend lunch buffet.  The buffet consists of some hot soups, hot dishes and a small salad bar.  The standouts are the vegetable Pakora, chicken Paneer, chicken Tikka Masala, Saag Paneer and the always spicy vegetable Biryani.  The food is always hot (not warm) and all the options are wonderfully delicious.  The staff is always pleasant and the restaurant is always clean.  If you're near Tempe and your tummy is in the mood for some tasty Indian food, plug in Passage to India into Google Maps.

*Tip 1*  
They typically offer a $2 draft.  Last time it was Heineken.

**Tip 2**
Check your local mailers.  I've received several discount coupons from PTI over the last 2 years

***Tip 3***
They have a full bar!!
