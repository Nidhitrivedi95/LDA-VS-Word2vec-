GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg Looking at all the reviews, we decided to give this restaurant a try on Saturday for lunch. When we entered there were hardly anyone may be coz we were a little early.. My husband had been before and said they make it fresh so waiting period is a little more than usual 
We ordered tandoori chicken, mango lassi, chicken biryani, boneless chicken handi with naan. We wanted to eat Karahi but their chef was not there.. Put me in question who was cooking?? 
As soon as the food arrived which was after half an hour. presentation was really impressive my stars go for that and freshly made mango lassi and naan which were good..
The chicken handi had no taste was so bland and felt the chicken was spoilt and same with the biryani, I being a regular cook I felt the biryani was made and refrigerated and warmed up for us.. The biryani had no flavor, The rice was hard and chicken stinked..
My husband who is a regular felt bad coz he wanted me to try and this was it 
Such a disappointment I'm never going to visit this place again
