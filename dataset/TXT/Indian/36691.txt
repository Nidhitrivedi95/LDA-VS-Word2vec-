NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Good food. Good price. Not as spicy as Indian cuisine elsewhere. While I'm not a fan of very hot, spicy food I'd prefer a little stronger spice than what's offered. There is an optional hot sauce that doesn't taste very Indian to me (tastes like buffalo-wing sauce actually). That's an option if you simply want more "heat."

I had lamb meatballs with masala on the side during my first visit then chicken biryani on the second. Both times I ordered pakoras with mint chutney (which is really good). The meatballs with masala is my favorite of the two. The biryani was good but very dry. Possibly the rice was overlooked slightly?

There are a number of other items on the menu to try so I'll definitely be back!
