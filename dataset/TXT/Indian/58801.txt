yOi6Lrcm9EnbVxMj0lNSnQ The staff was good, but the food was horrible.. Had butter chicken but it was sugary, the naan doesnt seem like its made in house, and the samosas were nothing exciting.

Ive had indian food at all sorts of places in Montreal, Toronto, England, and even India. Go somewhere else if you are craving butter chicken.
