abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg Came in to order the Crispy Milk Pastry to-go. The man and woman who were there were very friendly. Since we took it go and ran some errands before getting to it, the pastry wasn't crispy anymore (totes our fault). The milk sauce was so delicious and I can only imagine how awesome this would be when it was still crispy! Kinda pricey for the size but I definitely see the appeal. I thought it was a very romantic and tasty dessert since it has rose petals sprinkled on it.

I'll definitely be back to try some more things. Especially now that Rickshaw Bar is open for lunch!
