Known for their AYCE lunch and dinner buffets, the ambience of the restaurant itself is a bit strange. There's very little service, the buffet itself is located a fair distance from the tables (which makes you feel a bit awkward while walking back to your seat) and it has the vibe of a small-town restaurant, despite being in the heart of the city and located across the street from Roy Thomson Hall. It's a place that's clearly designed to seat a lot of people, but most of the time, I found it to be strangely empty and unappealing.

Food selection is solid overall, ranging from classics like butter chicken and masala to vegetarian dishes like Paneer Kadai, and a wide assortment of desserts, but the presentation is fairly plain. Regardless, the quality was very good across the board and is the basis for why I give it three stars.

It's a tad on the pricey side, but you're paying for the ease of location to the entertainment district and a fairly quiet atmosphere. Solid buffet overall, and it's one I'm happy to visit again.
