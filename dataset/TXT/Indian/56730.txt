xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw This is the best frybread I have ever had! The portions are huge! I split the Ultimate taco with red chili with my son. My daughter tried one with green chili and liked it even though it was too spicy for her. We also shared a chocolate frybread. The service was fast and friendly and the restaurant clean. Much nicer than their old location.
