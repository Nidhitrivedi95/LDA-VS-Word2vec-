3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg It's the first time we decided to try Indian food for Delivery.
Food was delivered hot, right down to the garlic naan. 
My boyfriend is not one for spicy food, where as I can generally take a little heat. Though flavorful it was more  spiciness than I expected, my boyfriend however loved it. We were complete opposites on this, but both agreed on what mattered... the dishes were overall delicious.

1) We had the Boneless Butter Chicken. Very nice - 5/5 for $22.00 (large), did not come with any sides. It was. rich, creamy and flavourful. *FAVE* 
2) Lamb Vindaloo - 3.5/5 (Not a fan of bones or the spicy level) for $18, did not come with any sides.
3) The Chicken Tikka Masala Signature - 2/5, came with naan, salad and basmati rice for  $17. Great deal but dry.
4) Yogurt for $2 was a nice saviour for the lamb Vindaloo and served to counter the spiciness nicely. - 5/5
5) Paratha for $2 each was sadly a disappointment, as I had a very West Indian (Caribbean) ideal of what it should be and the brown flat bread with black spots confused me, still was not bad, but certainly not stellar. - 3/5
6) Garlic Naan was $2 each, but lacked garlic flavour, not bad... but certainly not great. 2/5
7) Delivery had to be over $75 which is pretty easy to do considering the curry dishes don't come with rice or naan, which was a bit of a let down. 4/5
8) Person on the phone was pleasant and willing to work with our 'spiciness' fears, very professional and very pleasant. 5/5 for service.
9) Willing to deliver, which added to their rating. 

Overall the experience warranted 4/5 stars.
