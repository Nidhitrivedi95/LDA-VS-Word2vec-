jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Definitely can tell it's a new place need to work on their service! when I got there no one was ringing anyone up and a girl didn't show up until five minutes later which is weird to leave an entire restaurant alone with no one in the front... The food though was very good and is the only reason I'd come back ..but maybe call ahead and dine out
