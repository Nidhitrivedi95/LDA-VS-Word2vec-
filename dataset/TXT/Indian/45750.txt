scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg YAAAAAAAAAAS. Definitely one of the best, if not the best Indian food I've had in town. Not to mention the service is fantastic. 

We arrived about 15 minutes before they opened, and to our surprise they happily seated us and took our order! I ordered a Mango Lassi (personal fave) and my brother ordered Mango juice. They were both delicious, and large serving sizes! They also came out very quickly. For our appetizer we tried the Vegetable platter. Everything was very fresh, and nothing was greasy. We really enjoyed the Paneer Pakora and Aloo Tikki.

We split 2 main dishes between the 3 of us. We tried the Chicken Tikka Masala with level 3 spice (because obviously) and the Shahi Paneer with level 2 spice (because cheese). The portions are really great for sharing! Both were fantastic, although the Shahi Paneer may have been my favorite. I would order it level 3 spice next time though, as I enjoyed the spiciness level of the Chicken Tikka. I'm always hesitant to order any level of spiciness at Indian restaurants as my spice palate isn't always on par with the chef's :) But the 3 was perfect! We enjoyed our dishes with Garlic Naan and Coconut Naan. Although the Coconut Naan got a little messy as the coconut was falling out of the bread, its sweetness combined with the creamy spiciness in the sauces was amazing!

We were way too full for dessert, but I happily left the restaurant with leftovers that I'll likely be enjoying tonight. Also - they have lunch buffets on the weekend! I will definitely be returning to check it out.
