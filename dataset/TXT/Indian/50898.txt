UI4lGUcqc4YyzXJ2Uqe6BQ I have wanted to try this place for so long but whenever I go to Little India I already have my plan so have never been. Oh my gosh, I'm going again.

My pallet just didn't know what was going on...it was so interesting. 
I would say it was more chinese tasting than Indian, but then dosed in a bit of Indian spice. The staff were all Indian, the decor was all Chinese. Super interesting and well balanced. 
The staff were so cute, they were so concerned about our satisfaction. Kept saying thank you thank you when we'd say we were interested, or liked something.
Definitely the best veggie pakoras I have had in a very very very very long time. 
And the prices were quite decent. 
We had the fish curry on the hakka platter, all the other parts of the meal were veggie and more chinese style: veggie noodles, veggie rice and veggie spring roll. 
Then we ordered a crispy chilli fried veggie which was DELICIOUS. Not the most interesting veggie-cauliflower and carrots-but they were fried in batter than doused in indian masala sauce stuff. Wow.......mmmmm....
So good!
And then I had indian chai. 
Yummm. 

I have to go back because there were so many things on the menu I need to try...next will be the lollipop chicken (yummy looking breaded and spiced chicken drumsticks)!
