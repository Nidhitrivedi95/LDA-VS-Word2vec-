yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg I ordered to-go from Star of India.  Garlic Naan and Aloo Gobi, with rice.  

Service: It was a to go order, but everything was ready when I arrived, and they packed it up neatly with no leakage at all.  

Food:  DELICIOUS.  I ordered medium spice on the Aloo Gobi and it was perfect.  Well seasoned, excellent flavors, and just hot enough.  The rice is good and the Garlic Naan was excellent.  

I'm really glad we have Star of India in the neighborhood.  Go there!
