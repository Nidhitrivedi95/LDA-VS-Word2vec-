It is a small place with seating capacity for only 10-15 people, so large groups beware. They pay attention to your preferences and you can customize the dish to your liking by telling them exactly what you want.
I have noticed that other indian restaurants use something in their dishes that makes me queasy after a filling meal but not here. I guess they use home style ingredients. It is definitely worth checking out!
