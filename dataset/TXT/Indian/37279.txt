O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Gave this another try because it was close to a friend's house and she chose it for her birthday. Surprise! A "new" batch of Nepalese selections greeted me as soon as I opened my menu. Very exciting. I chose the vegetable thukpa, a simmered noodle dish with assorted veggies. The noodles were al dente and the whole dish was really flavorful. Definitely a nice departure from their Indian menu. Their garlic naan was outstanding again, and I tried and liked the paneer pakora as well.
