yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg Food is good service is always subpar. Problem with daily run restaurant is when you try to do everything yourself. Always understaffed and waits are ridiculous if here at busy time. Often takes an hour if you order carry-out which you can't tell me it takes an hour if you're sitting at table.
