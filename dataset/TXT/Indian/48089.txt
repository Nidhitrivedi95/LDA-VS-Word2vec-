TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I'd like to consider myself a regular although I only visit this restaurant four weeks out of the year, which is whenever I'm in town for work. This is where I come when I'm craving my mom's homemade Indian food as this is the best place for North Indian food in Las Vegas.

Las Vegas has several options, but if you're craving fresh North Indian food, this is your spot. It used to be a hole in the wall years ago, and a bit less pricey, but they've stepped up their decor big time and have a small but classy bar setup now. They expanded their seating space as well, allowing for large groups; call ahead and request one of their private rooms that can be curtained off (I would estimate it seats between 6-12 guests, depending on the room).

You'll smell your usual Indian spices in the air, making you hungry. Worry not though, while waiting for your food you have both the papad they serve complimentary and Indian music videos playing on a pair of flat screens.

And when the food comes out, you will have no regrets no matter the choice. All around great food served in large portions. Of the 100 times I have been here, I have only literally had one bad experience. That's awesome.

Average vegetarian dish costs $13. Compared to other Indian spots in town (especially Tamba), this is a great deal for much better quality food. It's worth the trek from the strip!
