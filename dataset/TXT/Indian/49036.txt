TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw This place is in a horrible neighbor hood. So if you choose to go here, then do get a cab or car. We walked there and felt very insecure. Place is dark and dingy. I didnt have the courage to try the restrooms. 

Horrible food. Pathetic ambience. We went there for a Sunday Buffett, they were clearly not prepared. Their food containers were half full, may be it was left over food from Saturday. In fact, when one of the vegetables was over, I asked them to get more.., they put water in it and got it back. Bread service was slow and poor. 

Save your money. Don't go here! Try something more popular on the strip.
