hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Good food, however, the portions are small.  I go there a few times a months due to the fact its the only Indian food in the SW area which is where I live.  I  really like the chicken tika masala and the malai kofta ; I had some of the appetizers as well and they are all fried and doesn't go very well with my healthy diet.  

I would recommend  Mantra Masla if you are in the area and craving some Indian food but I think there are much better restaurants in town such as Mount. Everest.  Hope this review helps.
