TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw My food companion and I came here many times for dinner. She is memorable and they are kind to her. They are on top of everything. The food is good, mostly because it's Indian, but not superlative. I love the bollywood music videos and overhearing conversations in the next booth. We have heard many annoying ethnocentric, pseudo-open-minded weirdos here. The staff give me a twilight zone vibe, which is not to say they are bad. They just smile and look upon us for a long time and I don't know how to react to to the small talk. Anyway, this place is good and worthy of a visit. The parking lot is small and you have to drive around the back to exit. One time a car blocked the way and it was a nightmare.
