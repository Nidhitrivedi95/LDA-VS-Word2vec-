PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA Very convenient for meal before or after a movie. I enjoyed the lamb curry.  The portions were generous I think for an Indian restaurant and price was average.  I prefer saffron patch but this is a good choice if i happen to be in this part of town. It's not particularly memorable but the people were nice and the food was prepared quickly.
