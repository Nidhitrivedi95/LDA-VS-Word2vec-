Yh5j6ESKrXBoIuOtLrkBfw We discovered Namaste Nepal during Taste Of The Danforth, just by chance because they were doing their best job as carnval barkers to sell food, and giving out samples - we tried their channa masala and butter chicken and were impressed enough that a few days later when we were down to the Danforth again we went for dinner.

We went with a few options to try to get a good sample - a chicken biryani, a Nepalese "chow mein" like dish that was more akin to Singapore noodles (though quite unique), panak paneer, more channa, and naan.

It was more food than the three of us could eat, but it all reheated beautifully, and for the price we were totally blown away. This place is pretty simple, not overdone with decor or ostentatious, it's almost a little spartan at first glance, but what matters is the food and they do it right. This is a new favourite for me.
