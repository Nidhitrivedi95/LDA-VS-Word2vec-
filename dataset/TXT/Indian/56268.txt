xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Ordered take out this morning through the phone.  I was very happy they were open at 9 am on a Sunday. It was easy to order. They asked me if I wanted boneless or not and how spicy and small or large. I ordered 2 large chicken roti, boneless, medium spice and 4 doubles little spice. The only thing is that you still have to wait in a long line whether or not you order through the phone, that's the only downside.  I was so happy they spelled my name correctly though! In the store they play traditional music and have desserts on display also some pictures of what you can order. My total came to $31.  The people are nice there. 
The doubles were kinda sweet and not what I expected- next time I will order medium  or hot. The chicken roti in dalpurri was very good, right amount of spice. Will definitely be returning. I want to try their mango curry.
