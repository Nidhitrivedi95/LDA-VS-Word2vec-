It wasn't bad per se, it just didn't have all of the flavor and spice that Indian cuisine should have. It wasn't so much authentic "Indian" as it was "Indian Lite". Everything just tasted watered down, so I couldn't really enjoy anything I ate. 

If you like plain food or can't handle too much spice, this would be a good introduction to Indian cuisine. However, this is not the place to be if you're already a fan of Indian food.   

I won't be returning personally, but I might recommend this restaurant to my friends who are more of the "meat and potato" type.
