f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Let me start off by admitting their service isn't the best BUTTTTTTTTTT their food is ON POINTTTTT! Service can be improved but food- that's tough. This place has that figured out. My family originates from the Sindh region of Pakistan and I was sick of the same Hyderabadi South Indian flavored every single indian restaurant in charlotte has. This is super refreshing! I used both my hands and was literally pigging out. If you like damn good food then make your way over here. Just make sure you call before so you can eliminate the wait time or better yet take it to go. Also the owner suggested to come earlier on the weekends, because between 8-9pm it's a mad house on the weekends. The owner was super sweet and knows his food. This has been over due in charlotte, finally we have true diversity. Thank you for sharing your talents with the community!!!!!!!!!!! We will be returning frequently.
