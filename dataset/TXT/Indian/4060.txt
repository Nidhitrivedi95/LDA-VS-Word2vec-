16-gsPZnaBJgFi9Le-i27w My boyfriend always suggests Indian food and I always turn it down since I always leave an Indian restaurant feeling 5 pounds heavier. I'm glad I didn't turn down his suggestion this evening... definitely worth the extra pounds!

We started with the Chandi Platter - with a vegetable samosa, pakoras & onion bhajia ($9). The samosa was one of the best I've ever had! As for the pakoras and bhajia, I had no clue what these were. I think I was daydreaming when the server explained to us what these were. All I caught was the tail end of his sentence when he assured me they were delicious. And just like that I was sold (not difficult when I'm starving)! The server was right - the onion bhajia was amazing. It was like a fried onion fritter. As for the pakora, they were like a chickpea (I think) fritter, which sadly wasn't as good. Found it a little dry and crumbly.

We also ordered the butter chicken ($15). It contained large chunks of chicken - white meat. Although I prefer dark meat, the chicken wasn't too dry.. the amazing sauce really helped. It tasted especially amazing with the garlic naan ($3.5), which is a MUST order. Delish!

The second entree we ordered was the Coastal Prawn Curry - with coconut milk, tamarind, mustard seeds & curry leaves ($19). Not quite as good as the butter chicken, but still decent. Slightly sweet curry with a bit of a kick to it.

We also got an order of the Saffron basmati ($4). Tasted like plain rice to me. I'd skip the rice and just get the garlic naan.

Overall, I had a pretty good experience at Amaya. Sure, the prices are a little on the high side - the bill for two of us came to nearly $60 before tips, but given the great food (for the most part) and the upscale, intimate ambiance, I feel it's justified. I'd come back!
