UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I first went to Banjara 3 years ago and was very impressed, you had to wait 30 minutes before the food showed up. I like that as they prepare the food fresh. I went there recently and was a little disappointed, the food was decent, but we asked for medium and got mild spice. And the food showed up very quickly, I suppose I was there around 6 and they were getting busy. will be checking it out again soon, but worth giving a try, they also have lunch/dinner thali.
