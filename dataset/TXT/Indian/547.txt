-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g The Mint Indian Restaurant is a great find for the valley. There are a few curry restaurants but they seem to fade away with time or get too fancy with the food so there is nothing "indian" left in the food. This place has been consistent from the beginning and serves the best quality meat i have ever found in curry. The lamb in the biryani is unbelievable quality as well as the rest of the meat dishes. Service is excellent especially since Kojac is back. Hope it lasts but has been packed again the last few times there. New owner is getting it together.
