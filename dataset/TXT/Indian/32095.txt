LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg 'Unhygienic' is the word I can use for this restaurant. Almost all the dishes they had were dirty. Then my friend found a human hair in chicken curry. After complaining to manager the owner came, apologized once and thats it.
Then I went to have salad and found alive cockroach crawling on food containers. On complaining to the owner she said 'The cockroach wasn't big sir' . Wow does that really matter if it was big or not. Second statement from her was 'Sir it happens in all restaurant and not just here. Really! she was trying to justify everything.
While I was still talking to her, she started attending another customer, now this is unprofessional.
Am surely not going to this place again.
