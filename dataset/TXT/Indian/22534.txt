gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg This is the first time in 25 years that I've been to an Indian eatery. But being a vegetarian eatery, my wife and I had to try it. 
We were greeted by Raj, the owner, as we walked in and he sat us immediately.  As he was giving us the the menus, we asked a few questions  since didn't have a clue what we were looking at. He totally went through all the different types and how they are to be eaten. Awesome guy and very helpful for us first timers.
We had a spicy soup that was excellent. Sorry, I can't remember the name of it. Then I got one of the crepe wraps that was huge and excellent as well. Then we got the Curry eggplant that was rich and so tasty!! And the beetroot halwa is my favorite desert!
Such excellent food, I'm amazed there not more people on a Friday night! I just wished this place was closer to East Mesa...
