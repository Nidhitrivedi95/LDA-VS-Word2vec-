CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA I have driven by several times, and decided to check it out.  Upon arrival we were seated immediately.  I ordered the Punjabi spinach saag with chicken and my husband ordered the Goan Vindaloo.  Both were delicious.  The Vindaloo had a little spice,  but it did not take away from the flavor.  We will definitely be back.
