5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ Hands down the best Indian buffet I've been to in Cleveland, and I've tried quite a few. I've never had a bad dish here, and the service is so friendly and attentive. The goat korma and goat curry were the stars of the buffet when they were available, but even if neither are here you will not be disappointed.
