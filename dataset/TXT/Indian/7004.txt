4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Ppl are being too hard on this place. 
You have great ambiance for starters!! 
You get seated right away, no wait (I went for dinner on a fri night).  They have a huge selection of foods. I understand more in more places are catering to a general population so they don't make everything too spicy for our white friends. 
Chaat wAs great, the paani was great. Chicken apps were decent but u didn't care for the veg apps- samosa and tikki. 
When you get to entrees, there's a huge selection. I like flavor and heat. My top picks: goat meat, fish korma, koftas and yellow curry.  Butter chicken was not your typical blend of flavor but still a tasty one for kids and white folks. 
Salad bar and pizza.....ummm come on I didn't  come here for that but it adds variety so why not. 

They have a mini Hakka area and dosa station. They were so so. 

Dessert: it was pretty typical. I wanted chocolate cake but all these little girls devoured it all :( 
But they do offer jalabis for those who like that. 

I will def go back. Buffet for $20 bucks and it's cheaper during lunch. 

They have an interesting selection of drinks, still need to try them. 

It's fairly new so they are keeping themselves upto par.....hopefully they focus on flavor and not so much on quantity like other buffets
