VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg LOVE this place!  Beautifully decorated and they have belly dancing on Friday nights.  Very reasonably priced considering the ingredients that it takes to make Indian food.  The only thing I didn't like about their dinners is that you have to order the rice separate from the entree.  But still very good.  Try the Samosas!
