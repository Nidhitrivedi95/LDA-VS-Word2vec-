irCBE0vRZ9oQZ26qMR-5HA I concur with the other reviewers and would give this place a 0 if I could.  Food was small in portions and not filling at all for the price you pay.  

I didn't ask for their naan bread but they said that they will give it to me.  Being that it was 10 min before closing I thought it was free.  They then charged me for it hoping I wouldn't notice.   Not the type of business I want to support.
