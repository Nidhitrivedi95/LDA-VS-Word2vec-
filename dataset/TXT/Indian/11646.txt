ajMgo23H5Qcn7Ma-xtiCqQ We walked into the Junction strip looking for Indian. When we got to Curry Twist (which was full) we realized we'd already tried it, so we turned around to try out one of the other Indian restaurants, despite neither of them having any customers (on a Fri night).

THE GOOD: The pappadum starter was absolutely delicious. The server did a good job (prompt, non-intrusive, water refill without asking). And there was no wait.

THE BAD: But after that, the food we actually ordered was sub-par. The palak paneer was ok - nothing special, a bit too sweet. The butter chicken was incredibly strange - like none I've ever tasted, in a bad way. Extremely sweet and a twinge of something I couldn't put my hand on - a little sour maybe? And the texture of the sauce was very liquidy - we were expecting creamier.

The plain naan was also not that great.

I wanted to like this place but given the other choices in the neighborhood (indian and otherwise), we won't be returning.
