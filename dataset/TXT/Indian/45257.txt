S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Excellent family owned and run restaurant. The staff was so nice and friendly- and spend extra time explaining all the dishes to us. We went right at 5 and the restaurant surprising was getting full by 6. My husband and I LOVED our dishes- the best Indian food we have ever had in Phoenix. The server told us his father is the cook and he is always there he never lets anyone else cook to keep their quality high. We had our toddler with us and they even brought him out his own rice on the house. When we couldn't decide on dessert he brought us a sample of the one we decided against. Seriously the best customer service and food. We went for dinner but are ready to go back for the lunch buffet so we can try several dishes at one. Defiantly give this place a shot!
