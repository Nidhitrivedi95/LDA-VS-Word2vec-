zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Worst dining experience of my life! I ordered the over priced kabob platter to share with a friend. We were both sick to our stomachs for over 24 hours!  The chicken was dry and had a nasty sweet taste. When I called the manager to complain, she had the nerve to tell me I am not American and I have an accent!!!! The nerve!!! The ambience was also poor and small. Very over priced for nasty food. STAY AWAY!
