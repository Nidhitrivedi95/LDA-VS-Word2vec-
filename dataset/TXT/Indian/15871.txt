D8or2Ls5m3cntRK8hyfmwg Can't believe this place wasn't packed to the rafters with people, as the food is of a very high quality and also reasonably priced.  It was a Sunday night though so that could explain why it was for the most part empty.  Always a good sign was that a decent number of people came in for takeout so I didn't feel bad that we were one of the only tables dining in.....

Couldn't say I didn't thoroughly enjoy ANY of the food that came out, although I do blame the chef for ruining the rest of my night, as I ate so much I just couldn't get back into party mode....

Try it out if you like Indian food and you'll be glad you did.
