It's located on a corner of a building on Fremont and the restaurant looks old and greasy. Another thing that had me questioning whether or not to stay was the menu. I've never had Pakistan food before so I didn't know what I should order. I ended up sharing the tuna salad and the beef kabob. The food was different from anything I've ate before and it was actually pretty delicious.  It's not one of my favorites, so I don't know if I'd come back, but it's definitely worth a try! The best thing here is their pita bread so don't forget to get something with pita bread!
