yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Even being of Indian decent, I've never really cared for this type of food. A few years ago, I visited this place for the first time and fell in love! The flavors are so unique and the atmosphere is so peaceful. Next to the amazing food, the service is good and the restaurant is always clean. Before you come, take the time to make a reservation online or by phone.
