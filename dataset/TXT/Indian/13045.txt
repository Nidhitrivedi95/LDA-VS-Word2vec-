b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Upon entering with my wife (at 8:30PM - not an abnormal time for dinner), the guy who later self-identified as the manager didn't say "welcome," but rather curtly told us that "the restaurant closes in 30 minutes, so [we'd] have to order and eat fast." Pretty terrible start.

After our dinner order began to take an inordinate amount of time to arrive, a waiter appeared to ask "Uhh...what did you guys order?" Wish I could've told him, but the pressure to order was so great that I pointed at something vaguely familiar on the menu and hoped for the best. I responded with "Indian food." Fortunately, it arrived a few seconds later.

Mid-meal I asked to order some garlic naan to-go (you know, because we were being rushed out of the dining room). The waitress told me she "wasn't sure" and "would have to check" if it was possible. Miraculously, the to-go naan appeared a few minutes later, literally thrown onto my table by a drive-by waitress. This prompted a woman dining at nearby table to lean over and ask: "Did I really just see her throw your naan at you?" Yes, you did, friend. Later, this same woman asked a waitress why all of the customers were being treated so poorly if the sign says "open 'til 9:30PM" - turns out they accept take-out orders until 9:30PM, but it's simply unacceptable for the dining room to be open past 9PM.

Throughout our entire dining experience the staff was abuzz with their closing duties: rapidly clearing plates as soon as they appeared half-done, the manager barking orders to quickly prepare and deliver food (even though they didn't know to whom it belonged), and reminders to diners that the dining room closes promptly at 9. Diners were visibly annoyed/angered.

The food was good, but not THAT good, you know? Next time namaste home and order a pizza.
