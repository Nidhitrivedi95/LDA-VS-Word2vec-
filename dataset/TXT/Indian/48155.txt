TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA I had a really good experience here with my group. We were hungry after  groceries and settled on some dosa.  . Having dined here before its the go to dish for most people. My group got  a ghee paper masala dosa, a mushroom masala dosa,  garlic dosa, upma and a Curd Vada 
Also I do not recommend anything  on the menu  that has ghee in it ( my guest ordered it against  my recommendation)  because it is high in  cholesterol and saturated fats despite its health benefits,  1 spoon of  ghee has over 100 calories and it will make u gain weight .
Our service was  very good and our server  was  helpful and recommended good   items such as the dosa specials  available on Fridays-Sundays which we got. 
If you are new and trying dosas, first stay away from anything with ghee /clarified butter in it. Your must order the paper  masala dosa , and try any dosa that is  of the paper masala variation and ask for light spice if you cannot handle  any form of spiciness.  You must also try a  sweet curd vada and get their  Special Madras Coffee as it is one of the finest. 
Also try the "Dinner Special Dosa"  as they are really good but only available on Fri-Sun after 5.30 PM 
So if you are looking for some tasty dosa , there is good variety here and you will  definitely return for more .
