JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ This weekend, my SO and I decided to give it our first try. Checked the reviews here and was excited about checking it out.  The food is tasty, but the service was very slow and unattentive. I noticed it was every table and not just us, so that was a little comfort. I would try is again, but not go out  our way again to go.
