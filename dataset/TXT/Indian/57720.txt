yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The best Indian food I've had in Scottsdale/Tempe! I recommend starting with the Gobi Pakore if you're a cauliflower fan like myself, it was perfectly savory. I'm a huge lover of their kashmiri chicken tikka masala; it's mouthwatering delicious. As far as the naan goes, the garlic naan wins my vote hands down. This is the best naan I've ever had; it's fluffy yet thin in true naan style. I can't even describe how perfect it is! I still have so much to try on this menu, I can't wait to head back! 

The presentation of their food is very exciting, it's unlike other Indian cuisines I've tried before. Their staff is also very welcoming! Must try.
