W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg I really enjoyed the lunch buffet the couple of times that I have been here.  I am not familiar with the names of many of the dishes but I know that I really loved the flavors of many of the dishes.  They have fantastic rice and lots of meat options.  I am a big goat fan (no judgement please) and I want to say it's among the best that I have had in the city.   

The service in this place is also standout!  The few times I have been here the staff have been extremely accommodating and ultra pleasant.  I am happy that this place has opened up so close to my office as I foresee many visits in my future.
