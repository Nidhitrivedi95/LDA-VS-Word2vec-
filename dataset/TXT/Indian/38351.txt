oMt3FrXtmYiP2ayn46PHtQ If you're looking for truly authentic Pakistani food in Charlotte, look no further than Zafran. This establishment offers consistently fresh and tasty South Asian cuisine at a reasonable cost. I've been here several times with family and friends and have never been disappointed. 

I recommend the nihari, chicken 65, butter chicken, and mixed grill platter.
