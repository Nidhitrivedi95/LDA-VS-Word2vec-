KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA It's a mixed feeling....
Though they are open till midnight, but the kitchen closes at 10:45. The service is excellent. The servers are polite and very attentive and puts their best effort to maintain your satisfaction. But unfortunately the place lacks in cleanliness, almost in all aspects!!

The food is average. We found the nan and paratas too oily.  We had Bhuna lamb, but the meat was not as tender as expected and the flavour wasn't deep infused!
