DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA I was feeling down and needed a hot pick me up with some Indian food... This place had it!!!

I had a traditional goat dish with rice, with Samosa appetizer, I was very happy with the quality of the food!

The service was less then great, but still very good:)

There was more than enough for next days lunch.
