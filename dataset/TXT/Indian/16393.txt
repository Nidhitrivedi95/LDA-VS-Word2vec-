dg4EMyM1feTEWfLPSbunrg We got takeout today - chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, naan, and mango lassi [this is how I take the temperature of an Indian restaurant].  Solid 4.5 to 5 stars.  Chicken was extremely moist; spices were well balanced.  

Asked for "bahut spicy" (ie, food of the five alarm variety) and they did pretty damn well on that front.


Recently under new management, and they were spot on tonight.  Lunch buffet is only $8.99, which is outstanding for Indian buffet.  I'll have to try that, too.
