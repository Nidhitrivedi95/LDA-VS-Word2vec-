3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Bought a groupon for dinner buffet for two here. Half the buffet items were tepid in temperature, and the other half were overcooked. Naan was bland and paper thin but papadums and sauces were quite nice. It could've been that we went too late, so I'd give them another chance. Tandoori chicken was well done in my opinion. The buffet table did have a lot of variety and the mango lassi I had was also very tasty. 

Bathrooms were clean and big (check out the 3D picture on the door of the woman's washroom, ha ha) ...also, there were blonde russian twins working as waitresses so that was kind of a bonus. I haven't been to many indian restaurants in Toronto both the buffets at Jodhpore Club and Mount Everest were much better.
