i3rdifli2uVDfAn5-E4jmg I was traveling from Boston and came across Palais Ajit Indian restaurant while staying in Montreal... this is definitely one of the best Indian food I had outside India... we tried quite a few things Tawa aloo parantha, chicken curry, paneer mugglai.. everything came out perfect .. I wish they open a restaurant in Massachusetts soon..
