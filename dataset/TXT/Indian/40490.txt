PQTtKaBK_WdvLm-zp4fQ1g Having never had true South Indian cuisine - my date opted for this restaurant. (They also have an extensive vegetarian menu). The food was well spiced, portion size OK and the service was OK. The food was the best part. The dining area was well lit and clean. We would recommend this place and will come again.
