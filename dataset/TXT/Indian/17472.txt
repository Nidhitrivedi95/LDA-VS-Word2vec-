DPsbhgdHty--Jegj_yNaUQ I live right by this place and steered clear of it for months fearful that it would live down to the standards of the average Indian buffet priced at $12. Two weeks ago I decided to take the plunge and honestly not outstanding but it certainly outperformed my admittedly low standards. If you don't want to head too far south and are in the Yonge and St. Clair vicinity this actually makes for fairly good value for money - I'd go again, good for the price. A la carte may not be so attractive
