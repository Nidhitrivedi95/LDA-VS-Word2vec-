-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Amazing buffet! Went on a Sunday late afternoon around 1:45. Chai tea and mango beverages included along with garlic naan. Chicken tikka and the potato masala were both excellent! Costs a little more on the weekend but after tip under $30 for 2 and full the rest of the day! Very friendly staff and ice cold water served (which means a lot to me, can't stand room temp water) Will go back.
