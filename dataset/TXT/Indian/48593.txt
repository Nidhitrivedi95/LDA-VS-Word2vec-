Ordered:
Chicken karahi - did not look like classic chicken karahi as this karahi had gravy in it. Real karahi does not have gravy. 
Nihari - the beef piece was a little rough but so tasty. 

Naan -  very good

Tikka -  it was just ok

Whole chicken -  it was good 


The place is good but is definitely not organized. 

I not sure if i will return but the place is overrated for sure.
