tRSUE3l8T2ptsj4LMk8Ysw This is my go to place when I have that irresistible craving for Indian food. On my most recent visit I had the lamb rogan josh, butter chicken, coconut shrimp masala, chicken biriyani, garlic naan, and raita (yogurt sauce). The food was delicious and was served piping hot. The curry sauces/gravy on these dishes were so rich and flavourful. My only critique would be that I would have preferred the lamb to be cooked more tender. The shrimp dish was amazing as well, with big juicy pieces of shrimp and a mouth watering tangy curry sauce. (..not sure if it was tamarind or perhaps lemon) The biriyani was moist and flavourful, and the butter chicken was smooth and velvety with chunks of white meat tandoori chicken. Garlic Naan is a must, to sap up those savoury curry sauces. The service has always been courteous, fast, and exceptional. I visited around the lunch hour on a very cold and chilly sunday. It was a tad bit chilly inside but the food quickly warmed me up :) We also had the raptors game on the television, which was a bonus. A warm masala chai afterwards, and I was good to go! I would recommend that you skip the buffet (not sure if they even have this option anymore), because it's just not the same. The level of freshness when you order a la carte is just not comparable. Great job India360. My compliments to the chef for a delicious and filling meal.
