FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw We've recently moved to the area and we were hoping this could be our new Indian food go-to restaurant. The food was tasty but nothing to really boast about, especially when discussing food and value. I've had better indian food in TO that was offered at a more reasonable price. 

Also, the server made a mistake on our order, twice. Which is OK, I guess, but then he questioned us about them. Why would we lie about what we ordered? It was so...weird.
