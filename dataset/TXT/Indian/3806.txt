0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I appreciate great, high quality, authentic food.  Kohinoor Cuisine provides this to the Phoenix metropolitan area.  It is no doubt my favorite Indian restaurant in Arizona (comparable to Anmol in Milwaukee, Historic Mitchell Street); let me tell you, delicious!  

It is also worth it to go for just the sweets!  I believe the owner makes them himself and it is as authentic as the food.  

I give 5/5 because it is pure quality.  Try the Tikka Masala! Soooooo gooood.
