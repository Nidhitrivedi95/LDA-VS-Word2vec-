The samosas are so good and the people are really nice they cook the samosas right there and they give you a sweet dipping sauce. We typically get the vegetarian samosas just because we like the flavour. Last week I ordered 20 samosas to take to school for the other staff members and everyone asked where they came from. It was very cheap only cost $7 or $8 for all of them which is amazing!!
