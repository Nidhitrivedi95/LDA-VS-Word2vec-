YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw Whenever we go to Fox and Hound for poker, we like to get takeout chicken biriyani (order it spicy!) from Persis since Uptown Charlotte is an Indian food desert. We called in about 30 minutes before closing and were a little hesitant to pick up since he said it would be ready in 15 minutes. But, to our surprise everything tasted perfect. Great flavor with the earthy spices and heat with the chilies. The portion size is also reasonable. I haven't been to the buffet before, but I do love my takeout biriyani, will be back for more. Cheers!
