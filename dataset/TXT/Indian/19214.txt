f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg One word for this place.  Disgusting!  Poor customer service and dirty.  Chicken Marsala was not cooked all the way and the naan was burnt.     The floors were so filthy your shoes stick to the bottom of the floor. Cups were dirty, I couldn't even drink the water as there were rings around the glasses.  This place was terrible. 2 people in my group became very sick that night after the food.  Never again will we go back or recommend to anyone!  Nasty!  I wish I could give this place negative stars...
