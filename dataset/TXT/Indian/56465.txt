XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw If you are in this area you MUST come here for lunch. Mt friend and I came here after reading all the yelp reviews and they're all true (the good ratings ones anyways). The walk around this area is a bit sketchy but the food here is so good. We got the lunch specials which is only $8.99 and came with so much food. Soup of the day, steam bun, rice, fried dumpling, and one entree. I got the chicken curry and my friend got the dry chili chicken both wete really good.

The service was exceptional. We came there at 11am right when they open and the lady there was very nice to us. They take credit and debit and cash. No american express.
