Tandori chicken was really good! The spicy chicken dipped in cooking yoghurt made me crave for more. 
Extra large 'crepe like thing was ok. Wasnt a fan of the dips that they offered with it. Though loved the presentation and crisp of the crepe. 
Mango lassi was delicious too.
Rasmalay was great though my gf didnt like the texture too much. Expensive though for 2 pcs$5
Service was slow, there was only 1 server/hostess when we arrived. 2 more staff cane after , spacious and clean looking place. Worth going 
Collect point of every dollar spent. $200 =$-10 . 

Would go back to try other items.
