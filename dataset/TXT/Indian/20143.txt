fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA We came in for a weekend Indian buffet lunch and came away happy.

They have a large selection of food and everything is helpfully labeled. There are a wide varieties of curries, a vindaloo dish, saag, butter chicken, shahi paneer and a variety of fried items (eg. fish pakora), you can even get paneer separately. I enjoyed all the food and felt that it was worth it.

The dessert selection has a number of ice creams, a fruit platter (the pineapple were sweet when we went), as well as desserts named 'rice pudding' (I think one is ras malai, but their might be 4 different kinds). Na'an and water top-ups are frequently brought to your table. They take credit card.

Compared to Chauhan's nearby, there's a bigger selection, but at a higher weekend lunch buffet price.

The restaurant is clean and a large window allows you to peek into their kitchen as well. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but the inside feels recently renovated. It's of course cheaper on weekdays than it is on weekends.
