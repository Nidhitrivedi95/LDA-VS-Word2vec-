-cZOrBfMRkNRSYm02SiY7w Bit of a mixed bag, this one. In truth I was never really a fan of the Vintage (just another bar the hipsters told us was cool in my opinion), so I held no grudges ahead of my visit to V-Deep. I and few friends have a curry club - V-Deep does curry. No brainer.

I like what they've done with the place. Not what I expected at all, very pop art and graffiti-inspired. I particularly liked the design of the tables with their comic book pages or their layers of seeds and spices beneath panes of Plexiglas.

Menu's interesting but pretty small, with the shellfish and the staff curry the only dishes changing daily to add further variety. In truth, there were four of us, we ordered two dishes each, and in doing so tried everything on the menu that piqued our interest. If repeat visits were to be had, it would have to be down to the quality of the food and not the food we didn't get to taste...

The Highs:
- Haggis Pakora on Tamarind Sauce
- Mutton Achari
- Butter Chicken
- Kerelan Rainbow Trout
- Bhuna Beef (the highlight!)
- Good staff, laid back but knowledgeable and forward-thinking. Case in point: when we arrived the waitress advised that they were out of Coconut Pork Pakora and also the Pork Cheek Vindaloo. Two dishes I had earmarked ahead of our visit. Gutted. The latter had been replaced by a pork belly dish so I instead ordered that, however when the dishes came the girl advised that thet in fact DID have pork cheeks and so she ordered that for me instead... some might find that presumptuous, but I made a show of my disappointment so on this occasion it was a great call.

The Lows:
- The Pork Cheek Vindaloo was star anise-heavy and, as a result, not very nice....! (sad face)
- It also burnt the roof of my mouth off. I like a hot curry but I don't expect it to do that to me.
- Venison Korma meatballs were tough and dry and the sauce was too thick to mop up with the naans.
- The naans were over-cooked, dry and brittle.
- All dishes seemed to be £1 - £1.50 too expensive. I've no idea how successful these guys are on the weekends, but Tuesday night saw three tables of 4-6 people. If they're struggling in any way, they might want to revise their pricing structure.

The Middles:
- Kohli Fried Chicken was middle of the road and also a bit dry.
- The Bubble & Sikh was nice, verging on unremarkable.

Overall, like I say, it's a bit middle of the road. Unlike the other reviewers, I would say the dishes had flavour, with the Venison  and the Fried Chicken the only bland exceptions. Unfortunately for me, not all of them were good flavours.

The Bhuna Beef and the Rainbow Trout are must-haves on a menu of predominantly average dishes. Worth a look if you haven't been before, but I doubt I'd be back for my curry fix.
