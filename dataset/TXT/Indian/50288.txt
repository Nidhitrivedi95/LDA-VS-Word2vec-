UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w Finally writing a review for this wonderful little place .... 
This is where I was first introduced to 'chaat' from my desi friends and fell in love with it.  All the chaat are vegetarian ... but oh they are so good 

I honestly cannot speak if it is authentic or not ... but they are certainly yummy with a very reasonable price. One of the mom & pop type of place, they have pictures on the wall for the non native like me to order from ... but the best way yet is bring your indian friends.... you will find plenty of tasty surprise that is not on the picture 

The only reason this place is missing a star was that it doesn't feel very neat given it is inside a grocery store and have very few tables ...
