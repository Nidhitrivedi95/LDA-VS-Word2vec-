4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q I've been a huge fan of the Tandoori Flame in Brampton: huge selection, huge dining area and great staff. 

Unfortunately, the Tandoori Flame in Mississauga is nothing like its sister-location in Brampton. I'll list the pros/cons below: 

Pros:
-the quality of the was good
-the staff were friendly and courteous

Cons:
-the selection was horrible: maybe 10-12 dishes ...considering this is Indian food, where we expected 20+ dishes (as in the Brampton location): HUGE letdown
-although the staff were courteous, there was a SINGLE waiter to serve our entire dining area (50+ people seating capacity)
-we asked for a refill of water, and it came at the end of our meal ...and then they had the audacity to bring a single glass rather than a pitcher!

Conclusion: I understand this is a new opening, so they might not have everything streamlined, but this was a pretty big letdown from a chain I've come to love. I'll probably go back one day, but hopefully they read these reviews and clean up their act.

TL;DR: decent quality, kind staff, bad selection, staff/customers ratio is too low
