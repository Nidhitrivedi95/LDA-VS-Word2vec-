PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Stopped in for lunch based off Yelp reviews and were glad we did.  This is real deal Indian home cooking.  We had the lamb curry, palak paneer, and garlic naan.  It all came with saffron rice.  Everything was wonderful, fresh and wonderfully spiced.  They also had some specials of the day and after seeing them go out, wished we had more room since they looked great as well.  It takes a bit of time, but totally worth the patience as it seems everything is scratch made to order.  You do get everything in Styrofoam dishes with plastic cutlery but I can forgive that because of the yummy flavors and generous portions.

I wish someone would open a place like this closer to the far North Scottsdale area - I'd eat there every week!
