0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I've never been dissappointed with my meal here.  Our favourites include the Shrimp Pakoras, Chili Chicken (spicy), Ginger Beef, Sauteed Green Beans and the Manchurian Fish.  Hot, spicy and fresh.  Remember that it's Hakka food (Chinese Indian), and not your typical Chinese food.  We always order a few dishes for the variety, then take the leftovers home.
