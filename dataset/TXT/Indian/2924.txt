0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw My husband and I have been coming here for several years now! They have delicious and very authentic Indian food.  The customer service is awesome and they make you feel so welcome! We love eating here and the food is always excellent! If you are in the area I strongly recommend you try India Garden I know you won't be disappointed!! They allow you to custom your level of spice which is nice for those who want it less spicy or more spicy!  Whether you want to get take out or dine in India Garden is the perfect place for Indian food on the west side.  They have a wonderful buffet too at lunch with lots of options.
