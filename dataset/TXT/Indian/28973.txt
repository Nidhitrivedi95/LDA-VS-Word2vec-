jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q I would say that this place combines the three things I enjoy most - amazing service, great food and hookah.  So lets go a bit into more detail on each one:

Amazing service - This place has a great staff that really knows how to take care of their customers.  My friend and I spent quite a bit of time talking with the owner who is an amazing and very interesting guy.  Service is super fast and very attentive.  

Great food - There is a reason why all reviews rant and rave about the food at this place.  The menu has authentic Indian cuisine done to perfection.  I definitely want to stop by here for lunch to try their Lunch Buffet.

Hookah - If you are a hookah person this is among the top three places in the valley.  This is the only one that I know that will serve hookah in a quiet, intimate atmosphere where you can go and enjoy the hookah with friends or on a date and don't have to worry about loud music and a bunch of underage kids.  Also the only place in the valley to serve all glass hookah for the price of what you would usually get a regular hookah for.  

PS.  One thing I have not mentioned is the view.  This is the only place in the valley that has a perfect view of the airport and the strip.  You won't find that ANYWHERE else.
