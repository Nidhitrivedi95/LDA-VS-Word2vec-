mUk-0jToBuzk4KaDXp-uew ** Lunch Buffet Review **

i went here for lunch probably 2 months after they opened.  I had high hopes based upon the menu--a lot of good non-standard Indian food...  but the food was just OK.  I hate to judge a place by its buffet...  

Service was good.  The folks were friendly... but the food just wasn't what I was expecting taste wise.  Their curries needed salt.
