zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ Ok this place has really good food!  The portions are not huge but they are 'enough'.  With that said, its a little pricey- most items run about $12-$15.  The dining room is very dark and the walls are orange so its not really my style. The service is friendly and the food comes out pretty fast.
