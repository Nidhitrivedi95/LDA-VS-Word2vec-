2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw We ordered veg sampler (upsize) for starters.. It was nice though the quantity really didn't increase that much considering the amount for upsize.. I ordered for a green apple vodka but it was too much diluted..
Main course we ordered was malai kofta and baingan patiala.. Malai kofta was very nice.. Baingan patiala was just fine.. Butter naan could have a little more butter on them.. But all in all this place is much much better for indian food than a lot of other places in toronto!
