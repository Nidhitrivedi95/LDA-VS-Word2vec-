TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw India Palace is my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas.  My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken Makhani.  The cheese naan and garlic naan are also excellent.  The servers are friendly and helpful with recommending dishes, especially our favorite server Garry.  We use certificates from Restuarant.com every time we go to save money.
