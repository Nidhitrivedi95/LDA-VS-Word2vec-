OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w We went for a dinner on Sep 9th - having been there 6 times before, we had great expectations from this place. This time around, we were extremely disappointed. Half empty restaurant on a Saturday night should have been our first hint. The service was really slow and at times food was served but no plates or utensils. The owner said 2 of his chefs did not show up that day. If an institution cannot manage this type of issues, I don't think it deserves to be in this business. Would definitely not be going there again.
