gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This place is really really really reaaly good. It was a "yelp it to get off the strip" find. Everything made fresh and "instant". (see the naan on the menu). The buffet is for lunch only  and yes, it had some weird decor, a couple of electriic guitars and a neon billiards sign. Go here. Eat here.
