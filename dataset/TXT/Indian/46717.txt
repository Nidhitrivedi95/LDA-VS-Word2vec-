t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg 5 stars! I had never had Indian cuisine until tonight. The waiter was amazing and explained everything on the menu and what kind of meat was good with it. Very clean, inviting, and polite staff. Our drinks were NEVER empty. The food was high quality and super good. My Tika Masala was spicy, so without hesitation, my waiter brought out a cucumber yogurt sauce and said it was like a fire extinguisher. He was right! Go eat here. You won't regret it!!!:)
