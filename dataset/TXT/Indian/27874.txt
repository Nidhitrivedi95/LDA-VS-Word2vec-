IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Nice quiet place, servers are very polite & attentive.  Food is very good, although rice portions sometimes seem a bit excessive-don't like to waste food.  My favorite is the lamb shank, also the kebabs are quite good.  The Persian ice is a family favorite, but unfortunately they were out this night.  Only other negative was refilling my mother in laws Sprite w/ water, a simple mistake as all the glasses are the same-fixed promptly.

I would recommend this resturant to anyone seeking good, reasonably priced middle eastern cuisine.
