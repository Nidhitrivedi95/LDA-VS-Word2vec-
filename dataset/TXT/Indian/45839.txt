SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ Very good! You can tell that the dishes have been toned down for the American palette. I chose the buffet, which was excellent. The chicken makhani was watered down... But it was OK. The rest of the foods were fresh and were re-stocked often. The place gets packed around 12pm, so get there before or after the lunch hour.
