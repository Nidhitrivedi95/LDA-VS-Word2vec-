The outside may appear to have been a former fast food joint, but inside you will find a great Indian restaurant with a good selection of Indian dishes. Lunch time prices are reasonable and the establishment got pretty busy within minutes after opening. Good sign! My wife and I were impressed with the selection from the saagaloo, to the chicken tika and tika masala. This restaurant is about 2 miles west of the strip near Palace Station Casino (The Casino where OJ finally got arrested). This Indian restaurant as well as Taj Palace, located in Henderson, are my two favorite Indian restaurants.
