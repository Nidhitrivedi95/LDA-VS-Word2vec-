MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw I love this place. Authentic Indian cuisine nice environment. Great service and reasonably priced. 
The lunch menu is just as good as the dinner menu. 
You can watch the chefs working in the kitchen cooking which is always a bonus. 
I would happily recommend this place to anyone. 
Happy eating :)
