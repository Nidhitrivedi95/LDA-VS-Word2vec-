yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw when ever i visit tempe i come to Dhaba but God knows whats going on with their food recently . i had mixed Khazana last month in the midst of december it was so good and was perfectly spiced but now i had it last week and it was horrible the presentation itself made me realize that something is wrong. There were no flavours the texture was weird and on top it was overly cooked the chicken tikka and tandori was like rubber the seek kebab was bland with no spices or any taste and on top the shrimps looked liked they were only coloured and tossed with salt .the curries were ok but not so appetizing their Bhindi was excellent and the naan was also lousily cooked I know the owner makes a lot of effort to improve it and i dont want to criticize but i was not happy this time but i know they can do better .
