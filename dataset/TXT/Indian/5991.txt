Only negative was that as you get sat, there is no silverware on the table, instead the silverware were in bins where you pick up your plates to go down the buffet line, sort of like a cafeteria. That might be personal preference though, but it was just an extra piece to carry in my opinion.
Overall great experience. Water was filled at all times, the flavours of the food was amazing, goat curry/chicken curry/biriyani rice were some of our favourites! We will be back!
