GyHJAwBQ58L3ORBLm0G-hg Tried out the place today for lunch with a group of friends.  We have all been to star of india, pasands, copper kettle, kebab palace, etc etc.  From those places, I always liked Kebab Palace the most.  It's a little on the expensive side but clean and very flavorful.

India grill is in a great location on Kyrene and Elliot.  The space is very new and clean.  There are high ceilings and a lot of walking space between tables that lends to an open feel.  Service was impeccable.  They refilled our waters many times and asked if we wanted more naan.  They also to be genuinely attentive asking if we needed anything.  The price point was about $11 / person.  Kebab is around $13 and most other places are $9.

The variety was the same amount as Kebab Palace, but there were a few more dessert items.  I would say there are maybe 9 or 10 different lunch items to choose from split half between veggie and meat.  I took a taste of each of them, and the butter chicken was my favorite.  The lamb was a bit too gamey.  The tikka masala wasn't as good as other places either.  The veggies was nothing to write about.  My favorites was the garlic naan that comes with the meal, and the veggie pakoras which had an awesome seasoned filling that I have not seen at other places.  I wish the other items had the same seasoning level as the veggie pakoras.  It would have made this place better than kebab palace.

Overall, I loved a few items they served here.  I think they fell short on seasoning, but the service and space they have make up for it a little bit.  It'd be a toss up for me between this place and Kebab, but I think you can't go wrong with India Grill.
