TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I've eaten at my fair share of Indian restaurants. That said, casual or fine dining, this place is by far the best. Service was quick without being rushed, prices are reasonable, good beer, and the food is delicious! Great for vegetarians and vegans- We had the Paneer Tikka Masala, Bhindi Masala, Navratan Korma, and Garlic Naan. All, so far the best I've had in Las Vegas. 
The location leaves something to be desired but the interior of this quaint and clean restaurant along with the amazing food makes that easily disregard-able. I'll definitely be back soon and often.
