5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA Went there today for lunch with a friend who has never had indian food. It was absolutely AMAZING. chicken curry was to die for and the rice pudding dessert was great. I assume I was talking to the owner but he explained the food and was very helpful. I will be returning for sure.
