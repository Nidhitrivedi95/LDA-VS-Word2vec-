It might have lacked the finesse of the plated entrees (probably due to the additional heat from the steam table), but the flavors from butter chicken to chickpeas were robust and the food was beautifully spiced.  The service was also polite and attentive, which we appreciated. Worth the trip - if I lived closer, I'd be a regular.
