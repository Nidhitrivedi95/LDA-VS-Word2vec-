XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw I've been here twice and both times got the Saag Paneer Roti, and both times it was delicious. 5 stars for that.

My dining partner ordered a chicken rice the first time and one of the dosas the second time. Both times he said my Saag Paneer was way better.

Both times were dinner - plenty of seating. Cheap price. Huge portions. Overall, very happy with my favorite dish.
