VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg I orded takeout today after waiting a couple of years to try their food (prices are high). Had the mutter paneer, garlic naan, and rice. The garlic nan was well above average in fluffiness and flavor, which I would give a 5. The rest of my food was about a 3.5 in comparison to other Indian sit-down restaurants in Cleveland but the prices bring me back to a 3.
