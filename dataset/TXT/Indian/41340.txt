This quaint restaurant is tucked under a small flight of stairs right at the mouth of Yorkville avenue. 
Your typical meal starts out with a delicious complimentary appetizer- Papadum. Papadum is a lentil cracker with black lentil flour and masala spices. This appetizer comes with chutneys of jam and mint to dip in. 

I really love the ambience of this restaurant. It's cozy and endearing. The restaurant is family run and the owner is extremely courteous and accommodating. 

My favourite dish is the shrimp malai curry with mild cashew cream sauce. This dish just melts in your mouth: a potpourri of sweetness, umami, delicate seasoning and all things good in life. I never leave the restaurant unhappy after eating this dish. 

I would also recommend the Sag Paneer (cottage cheese smothered in seasoned and tempered spinach) and Lamb Khorma. 
The curry is way more than enough for one person, especially if you order Nan and rice with it. 

The only caveat of this restaurant is that it is small, with seating for only maybe 20-25 people. 
Make sure to get reservations if you are coming here for weekends.
