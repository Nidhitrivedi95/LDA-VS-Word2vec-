PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ This is our go to spot for Indian food. This place has a huge selection and their items from the tandoor are amazing. We've been to a lot of Indian restaurants in the city. Nothing like Tandoori Flame to hit the spot. PS - Order a King Fisher, and request Garlic Naan at the naan station.
