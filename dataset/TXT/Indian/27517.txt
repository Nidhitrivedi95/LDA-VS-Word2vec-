Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg The food here is outstanding. I've had the lamb curry and te chicken tiki tiki masala which were both very tasty. The sauce is good enough to eat straight from the spoon ! The service seemed slow for a place with such few tables but the food all but makes up for it! Have been back 3 times in the past month and plan on more.
