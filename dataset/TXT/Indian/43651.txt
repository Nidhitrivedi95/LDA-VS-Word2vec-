RROOK4PBvXnzuBtUHMbLMA If I could give a zero I would.   Horrible service.    Waited more than 1 hour for ANY fòod.  When we complained about the service the owner told us this was not McDonald's and told us (party of six) to shut up (in person)    We had young children with us who had school in the morning and went hungry that evening when we walked out. Do not patronise.
