yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg Star of India has some of the best food around. I've never had anything here that I didn't like, the chicken Korma is a particular favorite. Owner-manager(?) Preet is incredibly kind and welcoming, my husband and I are regulars here now and he always comes over to our table to say hello and talk with us. We also usually get a dessert on the house too ;)
