afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w I tried Sri Lankan food for the first time today.  I didn't get anything crazy...just hoppers.  I went with the hopper combo 2 which comes with a egg, milk and 2 plain hoppers.  The Hoppers aren't as exotic as a thought it would be...but their good.  What makes it stand out is the coconut sambol.  They give a generous amount of this side to eat with your hoppers.  It gives a nice spice and texture that is not overpowering.  The egg hopper was cooked to perfection and was able to coat the hopper in silky yolk as you break through.  The milk hopper was pleasantly sweet...almost desert-like...really good.  The plain hoppers were light pillows to enclose the awesome sambol.  $4.50 tax in...can't go wrong.  I think I will be more adventurous next time and get a a fish or mutton lampries.  I will definitely be back to explore.
