TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA We visited Tamarind last night.. Initially we were skeptic with the experience we had with other Indian hotel the previous night ... But I should admit This is one of the best restaurants that have the authentic Indian taste .. The place is clean .. The waiters were respectful , handled every customers very politely..even those who showed after kitchen close were handled politely and given proper explanation ... ( a elderly couple were taken in though they came very late )  excellent   food for a very low price .. These guys are really awesome ... Will recommend this place for everyone who visits Pittsburgh...
