daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ Stopped by since I was in the area. You need to order at front and pay first. Then find a table and wait. Water is free but need to pick it at the back corner. 
People at counter were attentive and also made interesting joke. Ordered goat biriyani, papri chaat, chicken tikka masala combo and chicken tikka pizza. They had thums up which Indian coke. 
Good arrived in paper plates. I guess it keeps cost down from hiring cleaning crew for dishes.
Biriyani was good but was missing kick you expect from spices. Pizza had lot of cheddar cheese and green peppers. Instead of chicken tikka masala they brought paneer masala. It was bit sweet. Again missed the spice kick. I think best was chaat. 
Lot of Indian Bollywood music in background... Kids friendly place...
