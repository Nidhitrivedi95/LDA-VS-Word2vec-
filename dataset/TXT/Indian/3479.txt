0rrxeGhMUXZdyVt16DdKHw I live in the neighbourhood and generally am bad for trying new food/restaurants. A friend and I decided to give this a try and I've since been back repeatedly. Yes, the samosas are fried, but they are not dry. Beef is my favourite, then potato and cheese. I find the spice just tasty enough for me without being overly hot. Also have bought for my friends who inhaled them. For quick and delicious, this place is great.
