2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Went to dinner this past Saturday night. Place was PACKED....a good sign. Slight mix up with our reservation, but was sorted out quickly. Stand out dishes were the lamb chops & Gobhi 65. If you're looking for a higher end Indian dining experience, options are limited. This is one of the best!
