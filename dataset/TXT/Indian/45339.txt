S6pZkoM41a2GWbaxR5bYHw we were the only people in the place last night, adn It was an all-around odd experience-- Weather Channel music, classy decor, but...why?! it's not really a high-end place. The food was decent, albeit a little heavy on the cilantro. It may have been bc it was empty, but I felt very "watched" by the waitstaff....hurray awkward conversations. The naan was rather pizza-doughy to me. I liked it, but it was different from any other naan i've had. i dunno. 

I'll just stick to going to  Bombay Cuisine in Mooresville or Sangam
