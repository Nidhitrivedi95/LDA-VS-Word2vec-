I'm not the most well versed in Indian foods but for whatever this is worth I really enjoyed this place. The interior design is really modern and open. It's split into two rooms. Upon entering the restaurant, you'll find a spacious bar with minimal design and free wifi throughout the restaurant. On the other side is the actual restaurant and large kitchen. They also have a buffet line every day from 11-3. Their caramelized mushroom and corn appetizers were the highlight of my meal. The entrees were really big and yummy as well. Worth a try!
