P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I tried the lunch buffet and I was sorely disappointed. It was very bland and slightly sweet. Nothing was terrible (although the goat curry seemed to have excessive bone in it), but nothing was particularly good. I realize it was the buffet, which tends to be more mild, but this wasn't mild. This was just bland.
On the plus side it was very gluten free / vegan friendly. I might return if someone needed that. Otherwise I doubt I would go back. Also the chicken chili was pretty good.
