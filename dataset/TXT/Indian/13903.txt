bU6mVZSuO5EpvfUay87e8g My boyfriend and I waited an hour for food, butter chicken and chicken tikka masala with naan. Once we received our plates, there was literally five small chicken chunks in each portion for 12 quid a piece. Extremely greasy and unappetizing. We left without touching it and the waiter chased us down outside.  We explained our reason for leaving and he let us be. Instead, we had take out across the street where we immediately received better customer service and good food for half the price.
