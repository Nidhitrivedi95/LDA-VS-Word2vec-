How does one intelligently review an Indian buffet ? First off, India Delhi has the second largest population in the world and projected to surpass China within the next ten years. China has fifty-three ethnic minority groups. Where as India has thousands of enthic groups each with their unique cuisine.

Delhi Indian Cuisine is operated by two families, one Indian and the other Nepalese. While Mt. Everest India's Cuisine on the westside is owned and operated by just one Nepalese family. 

I have dined at many wonderful Indian restaurant all over the US. Buffets are for the general public to sample Indian cuisine and are usually available during lunch. Dinner is always much more satisfying and my preferred way to really sample many od India's incredible cuisines. I also think it's important to know which region of India the head chef is from. It's important since the seasoning and method of cooking will be greatly influenced by his region of origin.

I've pretty much have tried all the Indian buffets in town and I would rank Delhi Indian Cuisine's buffet equal to the spicier Taj Palace on Eastern Avenue and certainly superior to Mt. Everest India's Cuisine makeshift buffet counter. My review of Taj Palace is available. Mt. Everest India's Cuisine had failed to impress me in more than one way, and I didn't bother to place a review. 

My most favorite Indian buffet is served at the beautiful Royal Taj of Hanover, MD.  The family is from the region of Kashmir.
