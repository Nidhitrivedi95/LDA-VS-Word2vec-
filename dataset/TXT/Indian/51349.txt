UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ Apologies to the owners, as this place hasn't been there long, i've been waiting a while to try them out. This doesn't do justice to the food...I stopped by after work and grabbed a mixed grill (multiple tandoori, looks like it'd be good for 2 people). got it home, and i'm not sure, but I thought it was supposed to come with rice and naan...I only got the naan. Naan was good, chicken was good, but the shrimp was dry, and the beef (lamb?) was super overcooked. Very dry, and i just had to spit it out and move on. Lettuce and tomato/cucumber was meh, not what I came for. and no sauce at all? no yogurt? everything was just average, and that is terrible for a 16$ entree (18 after tax). Maybe I'd try it again, but not likely. Go to curry corner instead.
