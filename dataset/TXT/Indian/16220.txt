De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA Horrible service. Went there today with my two friends.
One of my friends was starving for an hour waiting for her order, reminded the staff twice. An hour later they bring it after the gravy she ordered is cold. Canceled the order. Refused to pay for the item returned. 

This will be our last time there..... Very disrespectful!
Staff needs training!!!

Similar incident every time we go there.....
