It is so good. The restaurant it self is big and spacious with plenty of parking. Service is excellent and the staff are very friendly. The food is just so good. There are plenty of items on the buffet. And the food quality has always been just perfect. The "naan" aka Indian bread is always baked freshly when ordered. One of my favorite items on the buffet is the Goat Curry. It's just so delicious. If you are looking for a good Indian restaurant in Las Vegas, I highly recommend this place.
