nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ I don't really bother eating the main meal dishes here .. I am usually full by the time I am done with the starters.
The fish pakora and chiken kebab are awesome .. I can eat a whole plate of just that. Then there are some noodles and some more chicken appetizers along with pani puri and chaats. All of those taste great too.
And when we are done eating and line up to pay the bill, my eyes keep looking at the options of sweets. I end up buying some sweets and paan too. 
So, overall this place is never a disappointment.
