v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug I got takeout from Coriander last week. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Aloo Gobi, a cauliflower-potato dish. The food does not taste authentic. The quality of the chicken was mediocre, the Tikka Masala sauce lacking in spice and flavor. Frankly it reminded me of a spiced tomato vodka sauce. I'm familiar with what this dish should taste like. It appeared as though they had used dried herbs.

Even the Naan was no good! How is that possible? I love Indian cuisine and this is close to my home. Too bad it's not to my standards.

They had a full bar!
