X46mymnTc04uhlXPqmq7qw Went after reading the reviews and the article on Globe and Mail. Highly disappointed, since I  went there on my birthday. Biryani is my favourite food and it's so integral part of our cuisine. First of all, what this restaurant serves is not Biryani at all. It's some sort of spicy rice. It's an insult to call these spicy rice Biryani.  I'm giving it one star since it's such a misrepresentation of Biryani. You can get 100x better Biryani with 2x quantity both rice and meat from any decent south Asian food joint. Save your money and disappointment
