0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Chili Chicken House is the first place I have ever felt confident to give 5*.

Whether it's food, cleanliness, or service - it's impeccable, no doubts. 

It's the perfect place for a sit down meal, takeout, or just a back up when you don't wanna cook. 

The food is great, not super greasy for hakka cuisine, and plenty of flavour. 
The staff there seems to know all their regulars by their first names. That speaks volume. 

Definitely worth checking out!
