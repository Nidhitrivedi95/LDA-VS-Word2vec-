8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg It's a shame that I had to give this place only a 3 star rating, even though the food was quite good and I have recently started to really like Indian food. The problem was the service. I'm normally not picky about service, as long as I get what I ordered I'm happy. But decide for yourself whether the following is acceptable to you. They're supposed to open at 4:30, and we arrived at 4:35 to find the door closed and locked. My wife and I then walked around the block for a few minutes to wait, came back, and the place still wasn't open. I peered through the window to check if anyone was inside, and made eye contact with two of the restaurant staff. They stared at me, then went back to chatting with each other (they weren't even busy preparing tables or anything). By this time it was around 4:45.

Once inside, we basically got the cold shoulder treatment, as if they were being passive-aggressive about my peering inside earlier. No smiles, no welcoming attitude, and when they came to take our order they just stood next to us without saying or asking anything. We ordered a lot so we had plenty left over, and specifically asked for TWO boxes to go, and they only brought one of the small boxes, which was clearly inadequate for how much we had left. So in summary, 4/5 for the food, 1/5 for the service, 3/5 overall.
