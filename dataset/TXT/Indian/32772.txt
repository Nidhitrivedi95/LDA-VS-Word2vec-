LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This is Dosa heavan in the GTA.
It came highly recommended and i was happy to have tried them. 
The variety is great in just the Dosa category. Appetizers are also excellent. 
A must to finish the meal of with a Madras Filter Coffee. 
Price wise, this is cheap. 
Expect to wait - they do take reservations, but you will still wait for a little bit. 
If going with friends, bring cash because they don't do split billing on the weekends.
