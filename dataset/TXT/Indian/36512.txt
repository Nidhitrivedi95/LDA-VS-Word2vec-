NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg My order was charged for a green sauce which was never provided and naan was burnt.Very little raita given with any of the dishes and drinks like mango lassi are half filled. They charge you for condiments like raita, which is like McDonald's charging you for ketchup. Raita is filled half way in the plastic cups as they know customers will come back for more kinda like getting a dime size of ketchup on a burger. The manager is extremely rude and not open to suggestions or customer feedback. This place is the McDonald's for Indian food and the manager compares it to a higher end resturaunt. He claims to have the best chickens used ....Very untrue it's not organic or grass fed at all. Basically they have taken fried meatballs and label them different names depending on the sauce provided. It's more of a ripoff for your money since they provide very tiny quantities especially rice. I will go to Taj India Palace which serves authentic Indian food with great customer service and healthy sized options where the food is prepared fresh and tastes amazing. Perhaps the manager at choolah needs to rethink and take courses in customer service rather than behaving like he is a pretentious maharaja wannabe prince
