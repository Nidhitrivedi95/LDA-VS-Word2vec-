_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Although Toronto is known for its restaurants, and especially its Indian fare, the meals that I've had in the city's Indian restaurants have so far been pretty "meh".  However, I finally broke my culinary drought when I found 259 Host via Yelp during a stay at the nearby Intercontinental Hotel on Front Street. 

The decor, a refreshing change from the typical travel posters, worried me a bit - it was nice enough to look like $30 entreés were  - but we didn't see any over $20. So we settled in.

I tend to default to an order of pakoras, tikka masla, and naan, but the menu's creativity won me over and I plunged into the chef's universe. Our server hit just the right note between description and encouragement, and the food was indescribable. 

I will have to come back later and discuss the food. About $100 for dinner for two with wine. Well worth five stars.
