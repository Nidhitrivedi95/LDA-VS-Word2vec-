GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Great food!  There was just the small problem of forgetting that my girlfriend and myself were sitting in the restaurant. After watching everyone else receive their food (after entering 30+ minutes after us) I decided to enter passive aggressive stare mode with the host.  My non verbal cues were apparently on point and we then received our food with a very brief explanation on how our food was sent to another table minus the apology.  I'd recommend curry corner as long as you don't care for service or an immediate appetite.
