DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ Best bang for your buck when you're feeling for Indian food! I come here all the time for their butter chicken which is awesome! The vindaloo is not as spicy as I would like but still good, and their sweets are also incredible. Their stuffed peppers, curries, and vegetarian dishes are also very flavourful. Would recommend this place to anyone
