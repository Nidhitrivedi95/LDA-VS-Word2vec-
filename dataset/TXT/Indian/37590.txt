OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A We went to Darbar for dinner on a Sunday night and my entire family loved it.  I haven't tried any other Indian places in Montreal, but have tried several places all over the world (except in India).   Darbar places in the top 5 of all I've tried. The portion size was good and the flavors outstanding --plenty of depth and complexity. For something different, try the chai martini. The service was attentive and friendly. The space is quaint, seating maybe 25-30 inside. So if they accept reservations, I would recommend making one in advance.
