gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Very disappointed in this restaurant.  I had eaten here twice before and the food was reasonably good; not outstanding.  I was craving Palak Paneer - spinach with cheese cubes and so I ordered that and another dish for pick-up.  When I got home, the spinach dish tasted so terrible it was inedible.  It was a combination of burnt with something else.  The dish has a green, slime look so it's bad enough the taste matched how it looked....usually, it has a fresh, bright green color and is so delicious.  The other curry dish was only vegetable and I lost my appetite I could not eat it as well.  I can't come back here again after losing the cost of two dishes.
