2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Ok I've mastered the best order, medium spice chicken tikka masala OR spicy butter chicken. My fiancé and I crave it and the portion is huge. Even with the recent price increase it's a lot of food inside that roti. Good deal!
Wish the inside was cleaner looking, the patio furniture is off putting but don't let that deter you, the food is fantastic.
