GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Great honest and delicious food! We've been there twice now and I can't wait to go back. We had the goat kahari, lamb kahari and a fish & shrimp kahari, my husband and daughters shared them. The favorite of both my daughters was the fish and shrimp kahari. It comes with rice and we added the garlic naan bread. I really enjoyed the spicy chicken biryani, it was a big portion and so flavorful I couldn't stop eating it. The restaurant is not very fancy, but we felt very comfortable and the service is friendly. The entire menu is great and so very affordable. I hope they never change!
