GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA We decided to try it after Guy Fieri s recommendation.
They only had two servers - which made service slow.
For appetizers we ordered the aloo tiki. My husband enjoyed it. I found it too salty.
I ordered the sheesh kebab. It was dry and overcooked. I only ate the rice. 
At check out, they took it off the bill.

My husband vegetarian thali was to die for. Delicious!! I kept stealing fork fulls of his food.
