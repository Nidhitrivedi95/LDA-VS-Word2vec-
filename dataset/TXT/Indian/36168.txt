nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw Some people found the staff here to be rude.  I'd say it was 50/50.  I'd admit to cultural differences, and think maybe they were supposed to ignore me and look down while I'm standing at the host stand to order take-out, but the second person who came along was very pleasant.  Maybe someone just pissed in the first guy's Wheaties that morning.  Maybe he just isn't cut out for customer service.  

I ordered take-out.  It came quickly.   They forgot to give me utensils.

The food was decent, but even when I ordered "HOT"- it wasn't.   The amount of food was very small, especially considering the price, and that it was Indian food.

Over all, I'd say it was OK.  I'm going to try something else next time...
