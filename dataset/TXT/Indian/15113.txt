CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Been here many times now and each time it has hit the mark. Now it is an Indian buffet so a 5 star review is going to be pretty hard to come by just due to that fact, so 4 is a solid mark. They have an excellent selection, enough to keep you satisfied, and I cant say that there is much that is of low quality. I have mostly done lunch but sure dinner would be no different, just hungrier and can eat more.

The service is nothing to write home about but then again I dont expect that from a buffet to be honest and its not what I am coming here for. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you are in the mood for some Indian and have a big appetite to fully take advantage.
