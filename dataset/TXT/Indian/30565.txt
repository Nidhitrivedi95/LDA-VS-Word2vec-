kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I will definitely be adding this place to my "quick, close, and tasty" lunchtime rotation! Everything we tried was great! I had the chicken pad Thai with an egg roll and tried my cousins' chicken peanut special. Both were hot, fresh, and tasty! The egg roll was crispy all the way through and not too greasy. The sauces are thin but delicious! The portions are generous and the cost is competitive. The employees were friendly and the restaurant was clean. I would recommend!
