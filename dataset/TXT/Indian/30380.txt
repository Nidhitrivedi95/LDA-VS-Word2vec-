There's enough options for a buffet but don't expect 30+ different selection as if you're walking into a Mandarin. You're looking around 10 main dishes and a salad and fix-ins bar. The naan is freshly made and brought to your table.  The goat was our favourite.  Their dishes weren't that spicy but that's an easy fix. I think there were maybe 2 dessert options? Can't sit in and you're on the run? They will give you a box and you can fill the box up for $10.99. Did I mention YOOOUUU fill the box up yourself? They give you a big box as well. Overall favourite dishes were the goat (did I mention the goat?) and paneer. There's plenty of room so bring a gang of people.
