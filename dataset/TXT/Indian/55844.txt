xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w I ordered takeout for myself and my two brothers. We got the chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, and the tandoori chicken, along with naan and roti. The food was pretty serviceable overall, but the portions of meat were very small. The tandoori was very frustrating, as it appeared to have several well-prepared pieces, but two of the five had almost no actual chicken on them. On the plus side, the meat was moist and flavored well. The rice, garlic naan, and roti were tasty, but the breads also felt overpriced for the quantity. We liked the tikka masala more than the curry. The downside was the portion size (a small plastic container, not even completely filled) and although it was pretty flavorful, it was missing an extra note to really tie it together and brighten up the dish. 

Considering the convenient location, we may end up ordering from Tamarind again, but we will certainly not rush back.
