E-DzU_pihpAjBW4fVaw-Pw Worst Indian food you would ever eat. HORRIBLE SERVICE. 
It was one man show - who cleaned, took orders and was trying to be bar server too! And we just ordered Pappadum and Samosa and left the place - yes everything was soggy. And the person asked us to give tip on that!! 
Not a kid friendly place -- we tried to take our toddler to this place and he was irate dark place.
