-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw Great Biryani!  I mean really great Biryani!

Sure, it looks like a mom and pop operation tucked into a tiny store front, and the atmosphere is not "dine in.". The small kitchen is visible from the customer area. I like that.  The owner is friendly.  I like that too.

Listen, curry is curry. And the curry here is good, but no better than expected. The Palak Paneer and the Dal Curry that I've tried were very good, but they are not the draw.  

If you like Biryani -- and I love Biryani -- then you owe it to yourself to order Biryani here. The flavor is great, the accompaniments are spot on, and this is absolutely the best  Biryani I've found in the Phoenix and Scottsdale area.  You'll find a few whole spices in the Biryani; a whole clove, a pod of cardamom ... yum!  And you'll find a whole boiled egg, another gem in the mix.

This is the only restaurant in the area that is serving great Biryani instead of passing off fried rice (or worse, Rice-a-Roni) as  Biryani!   I've tried the goat, lamb, and the chicken Biryani.  Not being a fan of small chicken bones, I found the Lamb Biryani to be the best.

This place is now one of my weekly stops for dinner.
