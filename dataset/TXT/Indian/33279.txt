llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Super nice family run business with great food.  Not much else that I could ask for!  

I came here once to order take out during lunch and regretted it almost immediately because there was an awesome buffet with already made food that would've been much cheaper and quicker.  The next time we came for the buffet and had a great time.  My favorite was probably the chicken curry.  The best part is that the buffet also comes with unlimited plain and garlic naan!

The people that own this place are really nice and friendly.  They really took care of us.
