Eecewruq14ycZwV--OdOSw So much awesome 

We ordered: 

Beef ribs without fries 
Beef mishkaki
Chicken biryani (extra spicy)
Two butter naan

Holllllyyyyy I couldn't stop. The red and white sauces they give you are phenomenal 

The food comes out SIZZLING, tender and so tasty

Excellent service too 

The best place for tandoori, barbecue ANYTHING

The kabab rolls are also very good. I can't speak for any curries, haven't tried them
