fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA I love to go to Indian Buffets because you get to try all the goodies without having to commit to one thing.  So I have been to my fair share...

This is the best Indian Buffet I have been to!  They have such a huge selection of foods, vegetarian and meat both.  They even have goat, which I haven't really seen at too many places.  One of my favorites is the Butter Chicken.  They also had a stewed eggplant dish last time I went that I really loved.

Naan is a must!  They are constantly bringing out fresh, hot naan.  You can even see the guy in the back cranking them out all the time.

They are always busy and have a buffet for lunch and dinner.  Bring your appetites!
