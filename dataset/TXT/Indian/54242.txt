VvZnozdEpjw0e7Dg-kKIxg Finally, an Indian restaurant that delivers, figuratively AND literally!

Brossard seems to be generating a lot of buzz around quality Indian meals (Le Tandoor and Mysore have been rated consistently well), and this new restaurant is proof in the pudding.  

We ordered butter chicken, tandoori, and some vegetable dishes.  All were good, however, the butter chicken made a lasting impression.  The portion sizes are also very great since we'll have leftovers for at least another day, and our meal came with some interesting fixings such as pickled carrots and a very delicious mint/coriander chutney.

The restaurant itself is undergoing some renovations, so I'll have to review this place again to comment on the decor.  

Overall, a good experience, and a welcome alternative to the regular day-in-day out delivery options.
