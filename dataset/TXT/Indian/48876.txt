tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA I went and ordered veg thali(not recommended ever)


After picking up the thali brought it home it had a half eat'n cucumber ,  the supposed to be dall makhni was actually some thing else and chickpeas portion was literally gravy.

Never going back  
Thanks for giving indian veg thali a bad name
