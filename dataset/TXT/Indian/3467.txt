0rrxeGhMUXZdyVt16DdKHw I arrived her at 6:30 pm, noticing there weren't many samosa left on the tray, hence my speculation of it being end of day and they no longer had fresh samosas.

I asked for 3 samosas and a ginger ale and I ended up getting 4 instead. The woman at the register was very nice and offered a free dipping sauce. 

The samosas were very good. Im happy with the customer service as well 
 

Not a bad place to eat
