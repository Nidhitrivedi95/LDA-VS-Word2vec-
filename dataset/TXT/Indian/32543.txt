LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Well the stain on my shirt hasn't fully dried yet, so I'm hopeful I am able to extract some taste later as the dosas exceeded my poor little California heart's expectations! Friendly staff as my first-timer doe eyes looked around awaiting the cultural experience I wasn't ready for. The tastiness of the dosas made me want to head back again for breakfast. Get a reservation and go home satisfied. Fantastic quality all around. If I'm ever in this area again, will DEFINITELY return.
