LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng People who've read my review contested that the food isn't as salty as the one time I had it, so I gave this place another try. Service has improved, though I went at a time when it wasn't busy at all. While I no longer needed to gulp down an entire fish tank, I still needed several glasses of water to go with my samosas and curry. Their spiciness level is not for the faint of heart and stomach. The mango lassi now has an overwhelming amount of rose water. Would I go back again? Probably not, but I'm giving an additional star for their attempt at elevating Indian cuisine.
