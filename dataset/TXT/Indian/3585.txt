0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Best Hakka place in the city! It's one of those restaurants where I always get the same thing because they are consistently sooooo good: chilli chicken with gravy, Hakka chow mien, and their gobi Manchurian. I've also tried like everything else on the menu and trust me, those three are the go-tos. 

The service here is also fantastic! If you come here often they'll remember you and there's cash discounts for purchases above 25 bucks--what more can you ask for??
