kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I MUST tell the world about how delicious Curry in the Box is. Everything about my visit was exceptional and I've recommended it to a few friends already.

They have a bit of an advantage in that I love Thai food, but what I wasn't expecting was how much I would love a dish that wasn't Pad Thai.

I got the Pineapple Curry to go and asked if it could be less spicy (was listed as a 2 pepper spicy rating). The cashier said they could add some extra pineapple juice to the sauce and take care of it. Nice!

The food was so so good. My friend got the green curry with tofu and it was also excellent, albeit a little spicier.

We got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and both raved about it.

Nicely done! I WILL be back!
