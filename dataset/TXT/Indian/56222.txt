xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Coming from a Trini family I know my roti & doubles very well. Leela's also being very close to me means I am here frequently. I can say the doubles are very decent in terms of offerings within the GTA. Up to the standards in Trinidad? Not quite. Ask for slight pepper. "Slight is just right". Leela's tends to dab the pepper sauce in one spot in roti & doubles so you'll be eating with no pepper half way through usually. As for the aloo-pie it is pretty good as well as the pholourie. They have roti specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays as well as other specials during the week (try the veggie platter). The roti however usually is not filled with a lot of meat at times and can be a little dry. The wait times always can be frustrating. I've had to wait very long for an order that was placed over the phone for two roti shells - many times I've experienced this. However in the area it is placed it is the only West Indian option worth visiting.
