dJfiXs0BwwkGKl0sXC3dzw Indian food in charlotte has gone from bad to worse over the recent months. It was high time, I found another restaurant than my usuals to satisfy my Indian taste buds. Having said that, sithara restaurant has been around for some time as I have been to this restaurant at-least an year back, but it wasn't good enough that could make me want to return.
Anyways back to the very recent visit, the  restaurant is located in a busy complex up north tryon. Combined with a lot of restaurants, the complex has a lot of other hang options and enough parking spaces. The interiors is not a very big space and not very fancy but decent enough, serves South Indian style food and offers Indian beers as well. The staff Was welcoming and we were given a table right away. We ordered Medhu vada(an Indian snack) and it came with sides of sambhar and two chutneys. This was the average start. The Vada needed a lot of improvement and so did the sides.
Next we Ordered the Chettinadu chicken curry, (breads) Naans and romali rotis. The curry quantity is sufficient for two and tastes great. We had ordered it to be medium spicy but this itself was too spicy for us to handle. Make sure you order the right spice levels. Chettinadu curries are known for the spices and the flavors it brings, Loved the curry and would return for this alone. The Breads were fresh and exceptional in taste. 
At the end we ordered the desert(carrot halwa) and it was awesome. The restaurant hosting hyderabadi style also had haleems and biriyani on its menu. So overall a very satisfactory visit. We will be definitely return and will recommend others to visit.
