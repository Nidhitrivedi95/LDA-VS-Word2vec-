xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw If there was a Zero star that's what this place would have gotten overly priced for just ground beef and the fry bread alone $6.50 no cheese,lettuce etc. They must don't know their competition here in Phoenix like White Eyes FryBread where you get any topping added to your choice of meat for $6. The cinammon honey sugar FryBread was bland! Was in booth less than 3 mins after receiving food... Starving still and disappointed! Don't trust other reviews I did coming from N.Phoenix
