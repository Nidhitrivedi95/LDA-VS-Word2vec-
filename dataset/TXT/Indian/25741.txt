hVNISzeoHut2RlmPb0n4CA Great Indian food! Cant believe it was all vegetarian. Very clean and the servers were nice and very worth it for its price. Im not very familiar with Indian food so I would recommend coming here with someone who is, everything can look quite intimidating. Everthing I had was delicious, we got unlimited naan bread, and would definitely  come back if I was in the area
