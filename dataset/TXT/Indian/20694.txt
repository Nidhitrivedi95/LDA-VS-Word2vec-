g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ Being a mumbaikar for me it was Great place and delicious food. I ordered Shrimp curry which had well balanced flavour of coconut and spices, loved it. Also order masala chai, really good and had really nice and strong flavour of ginger and cardamom. Will definitely come back and recommend to try something delicious and great Mumbai food.
