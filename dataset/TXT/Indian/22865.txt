gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I hate to downgrade this place, but it's totally necessary. After telling everyone how great this place is, we took a friend there for dinner. Being pregnant, hungry and soon to be chubby, I ordered two main dishes. I love saag and I love masala sauce so I ordered both. My chicken tikka masala was good and made to order. My friend got that as well and liked hers. The hubby liked his curry, too. We had exceptional service that night. Where they get downgraded is that they without a doubt served me leftover saag from the lunch buffet. The spinach was browned like it had been left under a heat lamp all day, it had tell-tale paneer in it that they missed removing even though I ordered it plain, and it was spicy as hell even though I ordered it mild. So disappointed in this place for trying to pull a stunt like this. Even though I feel this place may still be the best in town...I'm now on the hunt for my new favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas.
