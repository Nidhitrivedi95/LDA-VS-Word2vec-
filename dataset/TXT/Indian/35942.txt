nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ India's Taste has one of the best buffets in the GTA. The place is always busy, especially weekday lunches and weekend evenings. The couple who own the restaurant are always hands-on and very welcoming.

There is also a wide assortment of sweets available in gift boxes. 

The food: Separate tables for meat and vegetarian dishes which is really nice for those who don't eat meat. As soon as you are seated ask your waitress for an order of  'Papri Chat' which can be ordered mild, medium or hot. We like to call these "Indian nachos", a nice start to the meal with a unique taste and texture profile. Papri chat is crispy wafers, chick peas, diced potatoes, covered in a trio of sauces (yogurt/mint/tamarind) and yes it is included in the price of the buffet.

The naan is served hot and fresh, delivered to the table on request. 
My favourites are the lamb curry, Tandoori chicken, Chicken Tikka and eggplant (bartha). 

Don't forget to leave room for the amazing desserts; Carrot Halva, Ras Malai, and (hot) Gulab Jamun.  There is also ice cream and plenty of fresh fruit.

I suggest you bring a South Asian friend on your first visit as most foods are not well labeled and you may end up eating desert as a main course.

Service is friendly and efficient with every staff member pitching in to help where needed.

Bonus: Great Bollywood movies (muted) on the flat screens!
 
They have recently added a very nice party room that can accommodate about 30 guests.
 
The bill is settled at the cash on an honour system. 

This venue is a great value, especially if you have a big appetite.
