Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA Came here for brunch one weekend. Great pub atmosphere if you're looking for some good old English breakfast for brunch . Located at the corner of Queen/Dovercourt, this restaurant may get busy at times but the service was fast. There was also an upstairs bar if you wanted to watch sports.

In terms of what we ordered:
- Full English Breakfast - The downside was that they ran out of black pudding that day which was a disappointment. 
- Eggs St. George - Not your typical eggs benny but spicy eggs benny with a kick. 

In terms of food portion, there was a lot of food including a small salad and homefries. We both left satisfied. If we're ever in the mood for English food we would know where to go!
