ePBGDKArVr5YImZu1QP9rg So glad I discovered this place. Indian restaurant running out of the kitchen at Crown and Tiger. Take out only for lunch and dine-in when the bar opens at 5. I was looking for an indian place for lunch since I work in the area and this  place is exactly what I've been looking for! Nice flavourful curries. Lots of veggie options. Reasonable prices. Fast! I also love that they do combo meals for $10-$12. A lot of indian restos you have to order each curry and your rice separately, which ends up being expensive if you're just grabbing food for yourself. Will order again :)
