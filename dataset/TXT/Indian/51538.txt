UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Great off-strip choice that is allergen-friendly. All the options on the buffet are clearly labeled and so many choices are both gluten & dairy free. Gf breads only available for dinner buffet but no shortage of carbs. Discounted prices for the kids are much  appreciated. I like the blend of both north and South Indian choices. I've been to Indian 3 times and this food is fabulous. The restaurant full of Indians seem to agree. Will definitely eat here again next time I'm in Vegas!
