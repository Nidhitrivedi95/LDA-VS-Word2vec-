auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ This has got to be my favorite Indian place of all time... The food is always amazing and the service is as well. If you are new to Indian food the servers are always happy to help you order a dish that you'll LOVE. There lunch buffet is great too for $10.95 all you can eat and its a great way to try all the different dishes. This place is highly recommend!
