I ordered shezwan rice but what I got was a vegetable rice with lots of chilly sauce put over the top and mixed. Nothing near to shezwan, it was not even shezwan sauce.
They should improve on the quality and taste of food when you are charging above $10 per entree. Heads UP!!! they will add mint leaves in every dish on the menu, as the restaurant name itself suggests.
