86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ Four of us plus a toddler went to Nawab a few weeks ago. It is nice that they have their own parking lot around back (maybe 6 spots) and they let us leave out the back door (instead of walking all the way around from the front) because it was a freezing cold night. The music they were playing was good and the waiters were very patient with our group, which was great.

The place is kinda dark and has a black decor which is ok. They have several TVs showing sports (not good in my books) so I'm not sure what they are going for, are they an Indian fusion sports bar? The food was good overall, even the poutine, we thought it was tasty. Our friends said the food wasn't as good as the Thornhill (?) location, which I understand is closed.  The service was definitely sincere and quick. The restaurant isn't very cozy so I don't think I would go back given the other options available in the area.
