E8cDJWMj5y6nrzcSyu5w4Q Ordered a family combo tonight. Came with 4 hot and fresh naan, chikken tikka, chicken kebabs, beef curry and biryani! All for $25.  In an area surrounded by south Indian and sri Lankan food this place is much needed.  We were very happy with the food quality and price. Lots of leftovers for lunch tomorrow for the 2 of us.  We will be back.  The restaurant is a bit  hidden they have a very small store front located between the Caribbean and Sri Lankan spots. Got to love Scarborough.
