UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I really want to give this restaurant all five stars, just because the service was fantastic. However, I can't say that I loved the food entirely. This won't stop me from coming back though since I did only try the items on their lunchtime buffet menu. I will definitely have to go back for dinner.

I will just point out the positive aspect of my experience for now:

1. Fantastic service: Right when I walked through the doors, I was greeted by the staff and felt very welcome. Our waiter made sure to check up on us several times during our meal and was very hospitable. 

2. Nice accommodation: Very cute and quaint mom and pop restaurant. The interior decor is nice and their choice of music is very soothing. The restaurant is very clean as well, which is a huge plus.

3. Food: I'm not a huge fan of rice pudding but they actually won me over with their rice pudding. Their garlic naan is also delicious--very light and fluffy. Actually, I really loved most of their vegetarian/vegan dishes.
