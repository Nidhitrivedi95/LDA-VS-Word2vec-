uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w I was so excited when Ambar opened up! My husband and I LOVE Indian food. So much so, that we had it catered at our wedding! 

The food here is delicious. The lamb korma is PERFECT to my liking. Trust me, I get it everywhere...  The naan is huge and fresh. The portions are decent. Sometimes I get my own dish, sometimes I split one with my husband.

I prefer the menu to the buffet, but I feel that way just about anywhere I go. However, a lot of people do get the buffet.

It can get really busy being next to campus, so if you don't like crowds, avoid this place on a Friday night. The prices are decent. The staff is friendly. If you're on campus and want Indian food, go to Ambar and not Bombay. Seriously.
