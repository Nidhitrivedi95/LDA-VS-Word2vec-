gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Indian Buffets in Las Vegas r a dime a dozen. So it is quite difficult to give a fair opinion about each one of them. So far, I had a very satisfy experience with most of the one I've been. And if U r a curry lover or a vegan. Going to an Indian buffet is an absolute delight. Mt. Everest is a bit distinctive n stand out from the rest is because their oven roast butter chicken drumsticks r amazing. Also they give U a basket of freshly made Namn for each table they serve. Even though the selection of food r very limited to around 20 items. U will walk out the restaurant feeling happy n full.
