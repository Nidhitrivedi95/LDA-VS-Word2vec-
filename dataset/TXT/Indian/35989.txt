NocyBdVknfXDDLTPg8wRpw Had a WagJag deal to try this place out. I love Indian and was looking forward to it. I ordered a butter chicken plate and a spinach veggie plate off the menu. As soon as they saw the WagJag - the person began complaining that I should have shown him the voucher before ordering. He said the WagJag offer has its own menu (which it does not and he could not show it to me), and he basically charged me some random prices for the food I just ordered that was roughly 80-90% more than menu prices.

The food: portions are small, butter chicken had only 2 small chunks of chicken, and I was overall disappointed with the taste. The only thing I liked was the naan (for which I paid $2 for one piece). 

Service: not friendly, awkward. 

Not going back there again, which is unfortunate since I live across the street.
