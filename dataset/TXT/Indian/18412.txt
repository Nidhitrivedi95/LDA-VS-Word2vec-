eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Dishes which are supposed to be Salty are too Salty. Ex. Dal makhani. 
Dishes which are supposed to be mildly sweet are too sweet. Ex. Malai Kota. But Malai Kota is bad just by preparation. Gravy was not absorbed and tooo greasy.
Pan is not worth the $2. 
Buffet is not worth the price of Dinner $23. At about the same price or higher I'd rather drive to tandoori flame.
From chaat counter - samosa, indrani and Gujiya are good.
Ambience is nice.
Hostesses are courteous. 
Want to give them 2.5 stars but giving 2 because food wise Dal makhani is not nice
