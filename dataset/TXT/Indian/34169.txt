md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA I use to eat here regularly. Got sick from the butter chicken the one time we ordered it and never ordered it again. Gave them the benefit of the doubt. 

Today I ordered the palak paneer and naan and aloo tikki. There was a crunch in my food and I didn't know what it was. Felt the crunch again so I reached into my mouth to pull it out - it was an open staple.

I just got off the phone with Telehealth and now I'm on my way to the hospital for an X-ray.

My husband had to leave work early to watch the baby so I can go to the hospital.

I will never eat here again.
