-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g First time here. My husband and I stopped for lunch. Buffet lunch. The food was really good and the staff was nice. Not a huge variety of food. The chicken tikka masala was awesome. The saag was a litter bitter but still very good. The slightly bitter saag is the only reason for the 4 stars and the building was a typical strip mall building. Not dirty but a little worn.
