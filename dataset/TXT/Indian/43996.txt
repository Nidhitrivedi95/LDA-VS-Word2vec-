RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This place is so ghetto looking but I heard I had to get the food so I came here for the food!

We ordered a few items but I was recommended by some legit Indian foodies to stick to the tandoor which we did.  We got the lamb and beef kabobs as well as an order of butter chicken and garlic naan.

Kabobs were excellent!  The butter chicken looked oily but thankfully didn't taste oily.  It was the weakest part of the meal but still good.  Garlic naan was good as well.  Seriously stick with the tandoor items!

Service was attentive but the place is slightly ghetto.
