0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw Close to being the worst Chinese food ever! Crispy chicken was more like dried out and chewy. Singapore noodles were bereft of even a hint of any kind of chicken or shrimp. Some other kind of green bean invention recommended by the person answering the phone was an unwise choice. Shrimp and vegetables dish was competent but flavorless!
Overall; YUCK!
