CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ I've eaten at quite a few Indian places. From the other reviews and closeness to me, I wanted to like this place. However, after going, I can't. The service was inattentive, and the food wasn't what I had expected. It became very apparent to me that the place does not have an tandoor, or if they do its not used. The chicken was cooked in the sauce, but had not been spiced before. Their scale for rating the spiciness of the food [1-5] was unhelpful as that they didn't compare what a 5 is and whats a 1. Lastly, the spices used to make the dish spicy weren't dried peppers, they were full undried peppers. [The dried version takes in the moisture of the sauce and becomes part of it, the undried version doesn't]

Lastly, the naan bred was what appeared to be buttered pita bread.

Price: For an Indian restaurant, this was very cheap.
