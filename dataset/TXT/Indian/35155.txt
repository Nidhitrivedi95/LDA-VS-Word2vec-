MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw Food is very tasty but is a great option for Indian food if you are in the area. The servers are very friendly and helpful. 

We ordered the Tandoori Whole Fish - Sea Bream, it was $22 but so tasty. The meat was so moist and absolutely delicious and flavourful. 

Definitely would come again. For the fish, the rest of the fare I find is pretty standard or slightly above standard.
