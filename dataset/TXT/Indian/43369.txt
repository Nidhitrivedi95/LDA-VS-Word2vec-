RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg I am disappointed in this restaurant. We ordered vindaloo and korma for delivery. Each dish was $22 and we received two little plastic containers with zero rice. I eat a lot of Indian food and I never had to specify that I want rice with my curry. I called the restaurant to verify whether the lack of rice with two small tubs of curry was correct. The restaurant admitted that we need to purchase rice separately. After paying $45 for two small bowls of curry with nothing to eat it with, I feel like my family was robbed. 

Luckily I had two bags of Uncle Ben's ready rice in my cupboard. Never ordering here again. We are better off eating Indian food from Fashion Show Mall food court.
