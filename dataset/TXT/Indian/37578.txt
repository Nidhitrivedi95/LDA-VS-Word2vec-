OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A We were in the mood for a good meal and this place satisfied our needs. The staff is very friendly, it is a small place so I suggest making a reservation and if ever you have questions about the menu or need a suggestion ask your waiter. Their advice is gold. We had onion fritters as an appetizer and we had the thali one with butter chicken and the other with lamb madras, a suggestion from our waiter, it was amazing. If you do not really eat Indian food the thali is the way to go. You get a bit of everything on a plate to taste and see. Plus price wise it was really affordable way under what we were expecting. Will be going back for sure.
