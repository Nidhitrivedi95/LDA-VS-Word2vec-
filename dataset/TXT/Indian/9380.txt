8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I enjoy the food at Sitara. We regularly order food from here when we host game days at our house in Urbana. Most of the time we pick up the order because they don't always have a delivery driver, or the delivery is super slow. I've never been disappointed by portion sizes, taste or value. They have a very small dine-in area, and the service was quite slow the only time I've gone. They are definitely not accessible, as there is a step up into the establishment and the booths are on a platform.
