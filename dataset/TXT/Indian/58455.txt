yi1LdN8dBh3TLN1hTTOrGw Wonderful Indian restaurant!

The ambiance of the restaurant, as it's name would suggest, is warm, inviting, relaxing and authentic. Though casual, definitely not lacking in elegance or quality. 

Wonderful service from very polite and knowledgable waitstaff. 

Have only been for dinner as I'm not a buffet person, but have only heard good things about their lunch buffet. 

Best naan bread I've ever had!

I recommend:
Garlic Naan
Tomato Shorba (very refreshing and light, super fresh)
Onion Bhaji
Butter Chicken (nothing particularly special, but a well executed classic nonetheless)
Palak Paneer
Malai Kofta 
Shrimp Vindaloo (amazing but definitely not for those afraid of spice!)

Yummm!
