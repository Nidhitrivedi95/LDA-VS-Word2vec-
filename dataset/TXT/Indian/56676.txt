xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg Just knocking off one of the flavor cuisines on my mental list of international appetite-ness (credits to mio bello on that) :P

This menu is a bit different. There is a section for Indo-Chinese.

The selections we ordered were perfect in flavor. Not too spicy. And they ask how we want it. It was highly satisfying food. 

The service is really pleasant. Their restaurant can take private parties. The space is huge.

I couldn't stop staring at the umbrellas on the ceiling. I actually think they need more :P Awesome water fountain wall at the entrance.

Suggestions: mango lassi, any of their curries, and biryani!
