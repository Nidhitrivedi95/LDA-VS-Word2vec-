Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q Some of the best Indian you'll find in the GTA. For what's it's worth, I am a second generation Indian person who has lived here her entire life. I've eaten my fair share of Indian food all over the city and this place by far has the most delicious food you can find ...it is however second to my mother :p. 

Their quality of customer service here is also exceptional. Before ordering, our server was kind enough to inform us that we would be waiting for our food longer then most places.  But rest assured, it's well worth the wait because everything is  so delicious and freshly prepared for you. You can also order their food online and get it delivered if you are not in the mood to sit down in this lovely quant restaurant.
