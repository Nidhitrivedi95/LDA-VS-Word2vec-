We ordered a sampler platter, garlic naan, chicken tandoori and fish masala. The chicken and garlic naan were very nice. The platter was also tasty for a group appetizer. 
Ask for Kumar he's a sarcastic waiter who may make you laugh. Check-in and you may get a 10% off food coupon for lunch or dinner. 
The decor is also quite nice, very calm dinner environment. It also had several Indian families as customers, which seemed like a great sign to me. We ordered a bottle of Cabernet wine and it was about $35 per person not bad for the strip.
