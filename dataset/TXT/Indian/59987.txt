zJRJX2-xnxHCUXA5WbBYPA I wish I could give zero stars. We waited on a veg biriyani and mango lassi for more than an hour and still it wasn't ready! We could just get our starters punugulu, Which turned out to be something like Mysore bonda . We ordered paneer tikka; they messed up our order and gave the right one after an hour. The place wasn't even crowded so that we could think they were flooded with orders.Very sad experience !
