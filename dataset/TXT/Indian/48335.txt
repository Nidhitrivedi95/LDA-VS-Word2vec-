ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA I'm a vegetarian so of course Indian food is right up my alley. You'll find your classic curries and masalas, but Saffron really is a fantastic place to eat. My boyfriend and I have been there several times and I've told countless people about it.

Great atmosphere, excellent food, nice staff--you can't go wrong.
