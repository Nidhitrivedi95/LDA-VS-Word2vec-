MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Wow - a friend had told me about this place for samosas and it being a bit out of the way but holy - is it ever good!  I ended up getting dinner for two for $5.19 including tax.  What a bargoon!

The name is pretty accurate - it is actually a huge factory in Rexdale, with a little counter to order from.  Medium samosas are 5 for $1 as Karl R. said, and they have vegetable chalis (combos I guess it means?) which range from $2.99 (for rice and 1 veg side) to $3.99 (for rice and 2 veg sides).  These were all really fresh, and really delicious.  

The lineups can be daunting, but are worth it!  

I unfortunately didn't get to try any of the barfis or gulab jamuns or rasmalai or other yummy looking desserts because I had ODed on jalebis during the week, but they looked incredibly fresh.  As Ahhhnold says, "I'll be back."
