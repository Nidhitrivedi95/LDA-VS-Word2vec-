0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Was craving Hakka and this was the closest place that had a great rating, so we decided to check it out. Amazing service! They said it would be a 15 minute wait before we got seated, but the waiter saw how hungry we were by the look on our faces and seated us within minutes since there was just two of us. The food came in quick and the waitresses would always take our finished plates off right away to make more room. Good chilli chicken (had to try this cause of the restaurant's name) and great rice and pakoras too! Would definitely come back here if I was in the area again.
