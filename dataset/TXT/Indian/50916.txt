UmcOChw3fm-GgbpK2o_t5w Very reasonably priced with good quality indian food and a nice ambience. We went in mid-week and it was nearly full. Nicely layed out, and staff more than helpful. Nothing was to much trouble. Very attentive too. Would definately recommend you try Tikka Tikka as we found no faults there what so ever. We would definately go back for seconds.
