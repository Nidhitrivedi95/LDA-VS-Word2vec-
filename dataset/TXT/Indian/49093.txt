tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Yes yes yes. This place is everything yummy that everyone has said it was! Have to admit. I was skeptical. Buffets generally fall short with food sitting too long in warming tables, lots of grease, etc etc. that isn't the deal,here! Nothing stays in the warmers long enough to get  over - done. They are quick to replace items when needed and everything was really delicious. The service is awesome. You really get the feeling that the family that runs the place is inviting you into their home, and they want you to enjoy what they have made for you. The lamb dish melted in my mouth, chicken was moist and yummy and the rice pudding has just enough sweetness. We have found a new favorite place. And if you can eat this well, anywhere else for $9.95, and eat so much with good variety...I just want to know WHERE? Delish!
