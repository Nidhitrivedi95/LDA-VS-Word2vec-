We ordered two Thalis one vegetarian and one chicken. Both were very good and authentically Indian in taste. Very nicely cooked vegetable and the bread was served hot (as expected). Quantity is more than sufficient for one person. Overall a very good place to try Indian food. The only thing missing was the dessert which could have completed the Thali in true sense. Strongly recommended
