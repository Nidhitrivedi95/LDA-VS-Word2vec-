2ZmZbmsTRHogSZR-nJY_Fw Went there for dinner on a Tuesday night. They were running specials - unlimited Chaat + Biryani + 1 Dosa for like $9. The food was pretty good.  We tried all the four Chaat they had and the chicken biryani. Chicken tikka dosa was really good too. The server Aayesha was friendly and prompt with the service. The owner seemed like a nice guy and chatted with us for a few minutes. 

Will definitely visit again.
