3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA After a long time found a typical North Indian restaurant which still has some true Indian flavors in their chicken, goat curries and creamy tikka masala

Pakora, tandoori , were good too. 

Biryani was decent

Chilli chicken could have been better. 

Could probably improve their sambar.
