7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ I really enjoy coming to Persis. I frequent this place at least twice a month for the lunch buffet. The food is always delicious and the staff always makes sure my needs are accommodated. The guys who work there are consistently polite and professional which is why Persis became one of my favorite places to eat. As soon as I finish eating I start thinking about the next time I want to come back and who else I can tell about the wonderful food!
