UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Price point was perfect for the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala, and was rice was included as it should be (unlike its nearby competitor).  Most importantly, my fiancé and I thought they were some of the best versions of those dishes we have ever had - and I'm a CTM snob.  At Cafe tandoor it would have been $16.50 plus tax for their CTM, which is good (but not as good as flames) with rice... $4.50 more than flame!!!  (And that is if they haven't increased the prices from what they show on their website and Google).  

Only reason 5 stars not given is due to the same thing that plagues most all indian restaurants: lack of common business sense and poor customer service: there was only one server for 9 tables on a Saturday night.  This likely contributed to a 1 hr carry out wait time at 6pm on Saturday night and I still waited another 10 minutes in the restaurant.  More importantly, the dine-in guest experience appeared to suffer from what I saw.
