He was about 15 minutes away, and after 30 mins I called the restaurant. Very unhelpful or catering about the situation. When pushed, he said if it was cold he would do another order, which would have added at least another hour. Not keen to refund, directing to the online company. No apology or other suggestion. When the food came, my husband accepted it as it wasn't stone cold and we were hungry after over 90 minutes. Food was actually good, and would have used them again except for the poor customer service. Too many good Indians in Toronto to use a place that has multiple bad reviews about their delivery, and which they haven't bothered to address.
