The best part is he is very reasonable with time. He was catering for a party once and i walked in to make a take out order. He told me the wait would be about an hour and half before i ordered. I can tell he wanted to make sure i was ok with it. Because he was honest I decided to stay and order food. It actually took and hour and half and he called to let me know when the food was ready. He didn't rush through the order and he took the time to cook everything properly. His lunch buffet is always a good deal. I would go early so that way you're not getting the left overs. Even then the buffet is freshly stocked.
