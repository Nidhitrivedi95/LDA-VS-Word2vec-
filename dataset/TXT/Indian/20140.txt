fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA This Indian buffet is just average. It has no appealing features other than offering an all-you-can-eat meal for a very good price. It's a cheap place to eat at, and you get some of the typical Indian cuisines you would find at other Indian restaurants (chicken tikka, Chana masala, etc). It does, however, lack a lot of choices. They could do better by improving the menu. Perhaps by having less Western food (like macaroni pastas, salads) and adding more Indian delicacies (like dhal or chicken pakoras). I do like that the naan bread is constantly refilled by the servers though, that's a plus, as I don't have to keep getting up to get some bread.
