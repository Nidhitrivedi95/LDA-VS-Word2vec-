MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g Hi
I would like to share my experience
Last week I had my son's birthday party here in restaurant 
It was awesome experience 
More than 35+ guests came and very one was very happy 
Satisfying 35+ people in one floor is big task but this guys did it
We had 7 items in the menu that too in the biggest tray size. All food was empty 
Highlights of menu is Mutter paneer, Mango Kulfi, veg Manchurian and spring roll
I need to tell about cake
Oh my goodness, it was so delicious 
We made 2 theme cake with Indian flavor, we personally feel like the cake was brought from India it was that much taste
Overall the party gives us the feel that we had function in India 
I have more to talk about but I think this is good enough 
I recommend everyone to taste and experience by yourself
Pls don't bang on with my or others taste and experience
