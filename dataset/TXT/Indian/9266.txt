8cDP0mjK0J6lk292IeKRGg Ordered the Shrimp and Dahl Roti. There was way too much Roti and not enough filling. The filling was quite bland. 

We did get there around lunch time so it was busy so it did take a while to receive the food. I wish I could say that it was worth the way...but in my humble opinion, it wasn't. 

Maybe their not known for their Roti so I would be open to trying something else. 

As a side note, the cashier was not very attentive or friendly. A smile goes a long way.
