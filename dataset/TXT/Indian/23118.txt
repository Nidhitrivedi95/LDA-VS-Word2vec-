gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I wanted to stray from cuisine I was already familiar with, so I grabbed a handful of friends who were up for something new and came here after looking at some reviews. It was our first time trying Indian food, and I have to say, I do quite like it!

An $11 lunch buffet is a great price. There's a lot of room in there, and there is variety in the dishes from what I can tell. I spooned a little bit of everything on my plate and nearly everything I tried I was a fan of. The naan came, and the garlic naan was as good as everyone on Yelp had said. My friends were also fans of the sweet rice. I think it paired perfectly with the chicken curry.

The service was awesome, too! Being first timers, they were all very helpful. They made more sweet rice for us even when they were around 10 minutes away from closing and didn't hesitate to let us know what the fennel was for by the entrance. Lol. Overall, this place is a great experience for those who want to try it!
