gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Well thumbs down for this indian restaurant. The food is not bad for 10.99 lunch buffet . It is only good if anyone is looking for food at a lower price. The worst part is the staff of this restaurant. They do not know to interact nor they know to take care of the guests. You have to wait in the queue to get the table and no one responds well except the owner. They don serve good and hardly care for the queries of the guests. I am an Indian and i feel ashamed when this kind of attitude is shown to the customers because not even in India you will come across such rude behavior from the staff in any restaurant.

I read reviews which said this place is very good and amazing for indian food. But my opinion is do not visit unless if your left with no other option
