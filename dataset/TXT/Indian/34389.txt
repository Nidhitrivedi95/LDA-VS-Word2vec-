MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g Bunch of cheats. Went there Sunday evening and ordered a couple of items upto 15$. After reaching home realized that at the store they forgot to include one of the items I had ordered for. Will never go back here again and neither to their sister property Chettinaad something. A real bunch of Indian cheats. Being Indian myself I feel he just tried to rip me off and succeeded. Do I need to open the packet and check everything that I ordered? Bunch of scoundrels.
