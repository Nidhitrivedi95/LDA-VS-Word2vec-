DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Damn, I hate to give out these "fives!"

But, I gotta.

Two superb entrees, one of which had more HOT than I expected, but was exactly the  way I ordered it.  Two great beers and service that is about as good as it gets -- an incredibly good-natured, knowledgeable, and nice fellow.  Also, very quick and efficient.

We'll be back. In fact, we may alter travel plans to do so.  Highly recommended!
