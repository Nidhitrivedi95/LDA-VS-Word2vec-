ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw We enjoyed our dinner at Needle and Pin. Definitely make reservations if you are planning on having dinner during the weekend. The place was very busy. One downfall was that even though we had a 7:45pm reservation, they were already out of fish and chips, pani puri, and rabbit Masala. This is understandable but still a bummer.
