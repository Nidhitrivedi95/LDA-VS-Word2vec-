WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA Used to go to Bacchus all the time when I worked in the area...over 17 years ago.  They used to have a small stall like establishment.  Then they moved into a restaurant which sells beer.  Prices went up, but a real chill atmosphere with friendly and attentive service.  Nice in a busy place like Toronto.  Had the channa, spinach and squash roti.  YUM.  Bought a second one to eat today at work.  My nephew also loved it.  Will definitely keep coming back.  Loved the fact that I could get all the cold water to drink that I wanted.  Clean.
