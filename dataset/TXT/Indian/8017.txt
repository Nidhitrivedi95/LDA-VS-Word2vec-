75HVFV2yYaaz0qH_KCgyFQ The restaurant is beautifully decorated and comfortable as well as clean, which is what made us decide to have a afternoon brunch there, you know the saying don't judge a book by it's covet, the food was very poorly prepared and it seemed like it was reused from previous day. Just about every dish was unedible, from the butter chicken (which was SWEET I think the chef put sugar instead of salt in it.) to the spinach and tandoori chicken all tasted 2 days old. I would never eat here again:-( IT Was Terrible!
