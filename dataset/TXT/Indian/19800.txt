FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw I've eaten in a lot of great Indian restaurants around the US since traveling in India many years ago and Swagat is the best of them all.  Each dish had its own unique flavor and Swagat is the first Indian Restaurant I've been to in the US that offers a selection of Southern India dishes, something I've never had the chance to explore before.  Service was excellent and the servers are knowledgeable about the menu and the differences between dishes from different parts of India.  Very extensive menu, so I'll have to go back again and again to try  everything, which I really look forward to.
