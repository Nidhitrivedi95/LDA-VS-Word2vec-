daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ This was my second visit, during my first visit we tried the Chicken Dum Biryani, it was delicious proper spices, good taste, good portion size and chicken was not under or over cooked. Today we tried the goat dum biryani and had an opposite experience, the rice and spices were alright but the biryani was not fresh the goat meat was over cooked and mostly burned. The goat meat was strange it was  mostly small pieces of bone that had very little meat touching it I bought two order but we threw away 1 whole it was not good. I will stick with the chicken biryani if I did go back to this place ever again.
