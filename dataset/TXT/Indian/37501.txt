OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I'd give the food a 5/5. Maybe even a 6/5. We ordered onion bhaji and samosas to start and both were fantastic. Perfectly spiced. For the entrée we did madras lamb, tandoori chicken, aloo saag and chicken kashmiri. All 4 were equally amazing. The tandoori chicken was incredibly juicy which is rare with tandoori. Their naan was perfectly fluffy and chewy at the same time. However, I removed a star for several reasons-the servers, although very friendly, were forgetful and took a long time to bring basics to the table throughout the meal. Additionally, we received tap water instead of bottled and aloo saag instead of saag paneer. My final complaint was with the drinks. The two cocktails we ordered were served warm: in my case I ordered a chai martini and it came not just lukewarm but practically hot even though it was supposed to be chilled. We also were served wine in metal glasses and the metallic taste was overpowering. That being said, the food was so unbelievable I would happily return. The decor was beautiful as well-3 or 4 of the tables are traditional and have pillows and platters instead of a table and chairs. Oh, and one last thing is that despite the description listed on Yelp they do have outdoor seating. I would definitely recommend.
