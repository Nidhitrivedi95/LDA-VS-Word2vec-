FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q First , rather than commenting about the food I would to comment about the service which is atrocious. It's been 6 months I have been staying in Madison and visited this place three as it is near to my office. Every time I visit This place I see a weird look on the face of the people working over there , never the smile never the warmth. 

The lady working over there is the never smiling, always rude with customers and blabbering to herself . I do not want to comment about the food as this is one of the worst Indian food any one can taste in a lifetime. I had given even chances to this restaurant and I am done with them .

Never visiting them again
