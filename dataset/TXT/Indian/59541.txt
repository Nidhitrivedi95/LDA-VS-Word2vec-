ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ My husband and I like to venture out on the weekends and try new places.  We have tried a few Indian buffets in Arizona and by far this has been my favorite.  Their staff is very friendly and their food is just amazing.  I tried Idly Manchuria today because my usually favorite wasn't out today (Gobi Manchurian) and I was not disappointed.  I love coming here.
