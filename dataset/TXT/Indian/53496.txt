VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg Ok,, as an Asian descent, I expected a little more from this restaurant.  The food was good - we ordered one paneer dish and a lamb dish.  We assumed our order would come with rice or naan but everything was a la carte. The price was somewhat pricey given that we had to pay for our rice and naan - $3 for each. But the food was tasty.
