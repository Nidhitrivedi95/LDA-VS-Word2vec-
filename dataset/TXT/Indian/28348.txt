J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Probably the worst Butter Chicken and Raita that I've had in my life. The Butter Chicken was so incredibly sweet as well as the Raita. It was like they dumped a ton of sugar in it. It's so sweet it made me sick, like I was going into diabetic shock. The garlic kulcha and Kashmiri naan were good. The man on the phone taking my carry out order was very nice and polite. Great customer service, he even gave me carrots and 10% off my bill for no reason. Won't be ordering from here again. 

My boyfriend says that it was decent. He felt that it was a little too sweet at first, but he enjoyed the spicy after taste. He enjoyed the naan. He wouldn't order it again.
