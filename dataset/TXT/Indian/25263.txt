hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q Bombay Grill is simply amazing, I have tried Indian food in several different countries and islands, and nothing has compared to George's kitchen at Bombay Grill. You have to try his tomato soup it's such a basic name in the soup world but it's the best tomato soup you can ever imagine!
