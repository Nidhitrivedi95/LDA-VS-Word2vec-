yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Didn't like the food at all.Apart from that unfriendly staff, we asked for something and have to remind them again and again.They don't bother if you need something.Food is on expensive side and you didn't get a quality indian food.This was our first and last time to go there. There are lot of good indian restaurant don't waste your time and money
