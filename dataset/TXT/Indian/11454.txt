AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw Amazing prices (student friendly) for the quality and quantity of food. I like the set up of the restaurant too! Possibly my favourite restaurant in the Parkdale area.
I had the vegetarian lunch special. The portion size was quite big, and it wasn't oily at all like how some other restaurants prepare it.
