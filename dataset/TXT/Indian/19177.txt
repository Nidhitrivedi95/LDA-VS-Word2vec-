f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Lived in CLT for 10 years and never knew this place existed.  I'm back for a work trip and wanted to enjoy some good food and avoid overcrowded options. I'm so glad we gave this place a try. It was DELISH!! We tried several things from the menu and loved them all. The staff took great care of us as well. We are both familiar with this type of cuisine, but they checked in with us a few times to make sure we understood the menu. Give it a try!
