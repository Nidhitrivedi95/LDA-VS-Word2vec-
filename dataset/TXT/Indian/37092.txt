o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw This restaurant is an attempt at marrying Indian and Chinese. I found the curry and the Eggplant dishes to be ill prepared. They used the same sauce and tasted the same. The coconut curry did not have any coconut in it. The cook seems to believe that mediocrity is a good. 

I would waste my time coming from Surprise to this restaurant when other fine Indian restaurants are available.
