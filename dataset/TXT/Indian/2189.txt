_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA I'll make this short. I've eaten here a few times. This is arguably the best North Indian food you'll find in the downtown area and I would even say Toronto. 

However, the service and atmosphere keeps me coming from visiting often and spending my hard earned money. I know they're trying to be a 'fine dining' restaurant. But that doesn't mean that the ambience and decor should mimic that of a funeral house. Eating at the host is a dreadfully boring experience. Times have changed guys - the Host doesn't have to be the New Delhi Imperial Gymkhanna club and resemble the bygone era of British Aristocracy. 

The servers are at times rude, arrogant, and lethargic. They don't make any effort in being friendly or providing recommendations. I've been seated at the lower section of the restaurant. As soon as the food is served, the servers are MIA. No water refills or even someone to ask you how the food is. Last time I had to walk up to the 'upper deck' and plead for a sever's attention in an half empty restaurant. These guys have the serious potential to break the stereotypical traits of an Indian restaurant in North America if they bring the service level up a notch and provide a modern ambience. I suggest the owners hop on a flight to Delhi and visit restaurants such as 'Dhabha by Claridges' or 'Punjabi by Nature' for inspiration. Damn I miss home :(. And I guess that wasn't short after all!
