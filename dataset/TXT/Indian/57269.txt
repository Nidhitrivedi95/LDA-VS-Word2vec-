Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ This used to be my staple option for Indian food before Mint opened. I have had the buffet several times which has good variety but average quality at its best. Sometimes they take way too much time to refill the curries during buffet. If it was only for buffet, I'd probably rate them 2. However, if you're ordering things from the menu, for instance lamb curry or chicken karahi, they do a far better job. But then if you go too fancy and try something fancy from their menu, the food comes out as a mixture of few curries rather than the original. So in summary, if you're Indian, you know what the staple is and stick to it. If you're not, stick to chicken karahi, lamb curry, vindaloo, and chicken biryani.
