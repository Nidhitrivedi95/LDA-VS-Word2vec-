arP20rlnrGuX1Xker6xPzw Liquid dessert? Or Ice Cream?

For me that's both. Mango Shake with a scoop of ice cream ($3.50) or that Pink Cream Sherbet Sundae ($2.50)?

There are also snacks: Mutton Roll ($1) is light but still have a good kick of spices and Vadai Fritters (3/$1).

There are also different variety of house made ice cream if you just want a cold treat.

Lingan Cream House is a good place if you looking for a snack or dessert...for me that is any time of the day!

Just be warn! The ice cream here is NOT non fat, low sugar or any other healthy option! Expect to have a mouthful of sweetness, creaminess and smoothness!
