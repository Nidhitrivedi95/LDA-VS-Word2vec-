4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q This location at 401& Mavis has a nicer ambience and much nicer decor than the Brampton location. I've been to the old one many times before and was impressed by the whole set up/decor here.  

This was a decent dinner, seats many people and would be great for big and small
Groups. 

Food: appetizers offer typical dishes like pani puri, bhel puri, chat papri, pakoras (meat/fish), Tikka and salads. For the main dishes you have your usual selection of vegetarian curries (7 dishes),
Chicken and lamb curries as well. Bread can be anything from naan--- they even had bhatura (big fried puffed bread) when I was there. I didn't try the Dosa (didn't look the best But it's there). 

It fell flat on dessert-- the selection was alrighty and had your Indian dishes but not much cakes etc like the other location. Premade waffles are blah and are cold. There was ice cream.

Even on a busy Saturday night plenty of waitstaff to clear dishes as you make your rounds 

Buffets are always quantity over quAlity. This is okay food 6.5/10. Fab for big groups!
