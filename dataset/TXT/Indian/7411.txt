5OHW43gqdoWOGWDmUmps6A I am a fan.  I walked by the place almost weekly and smelt the amazing spices coming out of the restaurant.  I didn't get enough courage to try it just yet.  A vegetarian friend told me that he had tried the restaurant and he liked it.  I moved across the street and I finally took a bite.  Boy am I glad that I did.  Flavourful, Spicy & Authentic.  The meat samosas are delish.  We did try the curries as well. Fresh naan made to order as well.  I just came back from my third trip in the past week and a half.  Can't wait to try more.  Not bad at all, would recommend.
