0oOTrzxhO3FxHqmeZuC3mw The food is delicious but it takes forever. I went 3 times because I wanted to be sure the awful wait wasn't just a bad day. Every time it took a ridiculous amount of time before the food came up.  The next time I went the food for my friend and I came out The kitchen at different times. By the time she got her food mine was ice cold. So, the food is delicious  and the service is so slow that it is not worth it.
