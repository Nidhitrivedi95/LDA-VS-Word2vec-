HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A When traveling on business, it's hard to find decent places to eat. First, even at the best of times, convincing three team-mates to try something they've never heard of is a fight. Second, after ten hours with clients, who wants to think? (These things are related.)

Fortunately there's Yelp. And with my team scattered for various reasons tonight, I could use it to explore the suburban wastelands east of Cleveland.

Saffron Patch is, indeed, hard to find. After your second circuit of the unremarkable office building containing the restaurant, just give up and park somewhere that doesn't look prohibited.

The place looked a little drab, but as it was later than Suburban dinner time on a weeknight, it wasn't bad in context. The service was on point (despite my server having to deal with a difficult customer at another table). The food was quite good. I'm spoiled, living in Chicago, for excellent Indian food. This place didn't disappoint me.

I had lamb vindaloo, with "4 out of 5" spiciness. This is the Ohio 4, though. If you've eaten and enjoyed really spicy Asian food before, just go for 5, because 4 is pretty mild. I also had a tasty, well-prepared (but also kind of mild) samosa.

Again, it's not Devon Street, but it's considerably better than the chains that surround the hotels nearby. I will go back, and try to convince my team to come with.
