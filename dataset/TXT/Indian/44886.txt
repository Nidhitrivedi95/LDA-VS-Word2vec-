S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Came here on a Friday night. We walked in and it was pretty quiet. MP, the host, greeted us with a smile and sat us at a booth. He explained the menu and since I'm vegetarian he offered some good recommendations. Our appetizer came out rather quickly.  I had the ghandi tali. Everything on the tray was delicious. There was enough food on the tray for two people. Crystal our server came over several times to check on us, also very friendly. The thali also came with desserts. We tried the rice pudding and mango ice cream. Both good choices. Can't wait to come back and try the lunch buffet. We highly recommend this place if you're looking for authentic Indian food off of the Las Vegas strip. Be sure to check in on Yelp for a 10% off
