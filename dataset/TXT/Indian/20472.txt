FuYTMNlkpe898_c0EiySFA Nice new Indian buffet, the place is clean and the dining area is nice and bright. At first, we were not sure if they still accept people in as we waited for a while before anyone came to greed us. But once we got seated, water arrived instantly. 

Lots of food choice. The butter chicken is still the only dish I will eat with naan bread. We had to order naan by asking the servers as they make it fresh for you. The kebab and tandoori chicken sitting on the buffet were dry.  

Kids from 3 to 6 : $8
Kid from 7 to 10: $12.50

They do have a part room... good place to have large gathering.
