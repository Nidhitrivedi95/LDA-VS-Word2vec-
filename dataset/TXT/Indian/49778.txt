U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw My husband and I got take out from here for the first time.  Y-U-M-M-Y!  This will be our go to place for Indian food from now on!!!  Everything was declicous!!!!   I really wanted Chicken Korma and they only have Lamb Korma on the menu but we asked if they could make it and they said no problem.  Melt in your mouth delicouness with crazy-good flavor!!  My husband had vegetable samosas and alugobi.  He was loving both of his selections and said he would get them both again.  We each got an order of paratha and dipping that in the Korma sauce has left us wanting more!  Thank you, Bay Leaf Cafe!  Please keep up the quality, freshness, and flavor of your food.  You've hooked us!!  :-)
