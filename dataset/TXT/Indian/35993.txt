NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ Decor - A small fast food joint for indian food. Unfortunately the facilities here are sub-par and should mainly be utilized for take out. They had 2 small tables and a large sofa area, but neither were cleaned properly. Their bathroom, located down a narrow corridor, was quite messy.

Service - The server/cook was very courteous and understanding of our waffling party members. Also the reason for the extra star.

Food - 
The pros: each order of rice is large, the naan was also large and hot. My party mentioned that the samosas were piping hot and the best part of the meal.

The cons: chili paneer (too spicy and didn't have any indian flavors to it), paneer makhani (tasted like it had too much butter and very little heat), bhel puri (it was mainly puffed rice with sauces, rather than the usual ingredients), the flavors were very underwhelming. 

Overall - Subpar food and facilities. If I return to eat here again, it'll only be for a samosa.
