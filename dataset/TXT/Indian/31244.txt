KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Just left and want to go back already! 
This place was soooooo good 
We had the loaded butter chicken fries, Tbolt, RFC burger and a sample of the mac and cheese. 
I can say that I loved everything I ate. 10/10 
The customer service was great very friendly and helpful. 
The food has a great amount of flavour without being to spicy or over bearing probably the best I had in a long time!   I know I am gushing about this place but I loved it!!!!! 
It's busy for a reason, but it's very quick.
