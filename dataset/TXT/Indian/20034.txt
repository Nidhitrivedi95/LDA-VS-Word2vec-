FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Once you get over the fact that you seem to be the only person talking in the restaurant because it's such an expansive place, you get lost in the large, delicious portions and steamy, buttery naan. The place doesn't look fancy enough for the prices on the dinner menu (about $13-16), but the food is good enough to avoid regret. 

If you don't want anything specific, the buffet is well worth it- all of the dishes always look steaming hot and fresh and there are at least 20+ different items (plus dessert) to choose from...all for only $8.95.

in fact, i wish i was there right now.
