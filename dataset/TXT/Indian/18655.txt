eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Came here a week ago and this was a return visit, and as always they do great. 

For a small mom and pop place, this is a great restaurant that has an amazing selection of Indian food. 

I come here and have no expectations of a fine dining or amazing service, but I always get it. The food was awesome and the Naan bread is to die for. they check on us enough to make sure we are doing okay but they do not over do it, so it is appreciated. 

Our waiter was good, not talkative or welcoming, but got the work done, and I was fine with that. The hostess who I believe is the owner or wife of the owner is very friendly and asked about how we were doing and how we enjoyed the food.

I definitely recommend it, and make sure when they ask you how spicy you want, go with medium, it is still spicy enough to enjoy the flavors and the spiciness.
