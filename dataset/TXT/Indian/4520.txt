The chicken was really spicy, but also very flavourful. The naan bread was good as well, fresh and chewy, perfect for sopping up the sauce!  The lunch comes with rice, two sides and a tiny rice pudding. I had the eggplant and cauliflower dishes both were fairly tasty.  The entire meal was large and very filling. I'm only downgrading due to the amount of the main dish itself, thought there should of been a little more of it, versus the rice and sides.
