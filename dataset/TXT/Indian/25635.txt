hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Not really impressed with the food here. Stopped in recently for lunch & the place was absolutely dead. No other tables were being occupied at right around 12pm is not a good sign. I had been here once before a few years ago so I knew they had lunch specials. We were given the regular menu & had to ask for lunch menus. I over heard another table that came in after us ask for lunch menus later on as well so I don't think they automatically give them to you as they want you to order off the higher price menu. Ordered off the lunch special & got the Chicken Tikka & Dewane Handi as it came as a combination meal that also had a soup, naan & basmati rice with it. The basmati rice was dry & stuck together in a way that it would seem that it was quite possibly rice from the day before. The Chicken Tikka was ok but needed more sauce on it. Only 3 small pieces of chicken on the plate which was a bit disappointing. The Dewane Handi was just ok. I had to put more salt on it to get the flavor to pop a bit. Naan was just ok. The soup (some kind of curry I think) was actually really good. But I am not going back for just the soup. Have eaten at other Indian restaurants in town that had more flavor.
