-I got the chicken chilli bowl. 
-Like 90 percent of it was rice, veggies, and spicies, barely any chicken.
-Taste wise is was alright, it tasted as if rice was made in the morning and reheated again in the afternoon. I bought this meal around 3pm, late lunch.
-For 8 bucks the portion was super small.
At least this place doesn't hand out EColi like Chipotle.
