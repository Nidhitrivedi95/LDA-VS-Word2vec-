c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg After seeing decent yelp reviews, I stopped by for dinner today. Service was ok, we only waited 5-10 min for our meals to be prepared. My dosa was crispy and well filled with malasa potato mix. My friend had the chicken disk, a little on the small side and didnt like the bones still in. But otherwise delicious flavour.

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here. Its an ok restaurant. I've had better dosa in Mississauga (check out my review of dosa palace).
