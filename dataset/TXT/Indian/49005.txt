TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw This review is for their lunch buffet. I came in around 1pm after a day at the Korean spa. They are open from 11:30pm-2:30pm for lunch and then reopen at 5pm for dinner. 

Yet again I almost missed out on a solid place because I was going to walk out. First glances can be deceptive, especially when you walk into an empty restaurant in the middle of lunch hours. I decided to stay anyways due to all the high reviews of this place. I cannot say that Yelp has lead me astray. 

The lunch buffet is smaller than other restaurants and does not offer saag. I was disappointed to see that their paneer is without the homemade cheese cubes. I did enjoy their butter chicken and aloo gobi though. In the beginning, I was counting all of my favorite items that was missing, but after a few bites I was enjoying what they did offer. 

Unlike other places, the items in the warmers were kept piping hot. Nothing was lukewarm. The fried potatoes retained a crispiness that is normally unheard of in buffets. Overall I was impressed with how attentive the owner was. She cleared plates, refilled my water, and checked up on me frequently. I overheard her conversation about the restaurant having a tough time, but she doesn't let it show in the quality of the food. I hope their business picks up, because it is a solid option for those not too familiar with Indian or someone who loves butter chicken (Which I don't see too often on the line).
