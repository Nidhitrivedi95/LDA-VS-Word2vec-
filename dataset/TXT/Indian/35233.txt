MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Stopped here after work, service was quick and friendly. I sampled all three samosas and they were good but not sure if I would go out of my way to get them again. I also ordered chaat papri which was very good but could have been amazing with tomatoes and cilantro. When I've ordered it elsewhere it had been included, not sure if you had to ask? In any case, I would go back for chat papri but I would make sure they include tomatoes and cilantro.
