U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg Horrible customer service! The "manager" will yell at you. I just asked to have my order corrected. But he said, I am wrong and it was only half wrong...did not apologize at all. After spending a decent amount of money, that just does not sit right with me. Also place is dirty, it's too bad because otherwise the food actually tastes good.
