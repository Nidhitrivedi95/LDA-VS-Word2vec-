SaAtDmMKN_B5-8d-n5X86w I really like this place, I wish I could give them 4 stars but there is a few kinks they need to work out. Seems like maybe this is their first restaurant? Regardless, the gentlemen that always takes our order is always smiling, very friendly young fellow who seems to be doing his best. Their food is AMAZINGLY delicious. Anyone who's saying it's a bit oily, it really isn't, just more traditional than most Americanized Indian food (which isn't bad either, just different). 

I really like this place and hope to see it succeed!
