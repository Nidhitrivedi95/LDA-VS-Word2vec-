8PZGCtgG5MZKvz9i3B9gCA came here with my friends after visiting casa Loma. The wait was a little bit long but the food was really good. The wrap is nice sand warm and the sauces are very tasty. I got the bbq chicken with yogurt sauce and mango sauce.  My friends got the butter chicken and they say it's pretty good. But be warned, it will get messy because of the sauces.
