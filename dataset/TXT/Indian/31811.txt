The samosas for instance aren't nearly as good as real fried samosas. Frying makes everything better (and less healthy obviously). But other dishes were very close approximations and much healthier. Was the tikka masala as good as if it was loaded with butter? No, of course not. But I thought it was still quite tasty and was happy knowing that I could enjoy a healthy version of one of my favorite Indian dishes. 

The service was pretty good, no complaints there. Looked like they had a huge wine selection for such a small restaurant.

If you want traditional Indian that's fine, just go to a traditional Indian restaurant. So come to Bombay Spice knowing what you're in for and you'll be satisfied.
