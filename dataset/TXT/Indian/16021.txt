I enjoyed their dinner buffet, the assortment was typical- ranging from paneer, butter chicken, chicken tikka, samosas, lamb, etc. Nothing different, however, and items were abundant. Freshness was a slight question for some items, others looked and tasted great.

Would have come if it were not for my Groupon though? No, probably not. Only because there are other Indian restaurants close (enough) that see more traffic, priced similar, and offer a few more items. 

Overall, the food was good, ambiance was good, and the prices were O.K.
