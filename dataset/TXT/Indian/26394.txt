ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Really loved the food but think its WAY overpriced.  Will be an occasional stop when Im craving indian -but Im from chicago and got the same delicious indian for half the price so its hard to stomach the prices.  Great Tikki masala and nann.  To Copper- lower your prices and you could have a real loyal following- but for most people you have priced yourself into being a very occasional visit.
