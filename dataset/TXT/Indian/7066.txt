4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q High end buffet price - low end buffet quality.

Came in with a group of 4 for weekend dinner. Sign posted in front says 2 hour limit - they gave us the bill about 80 minutes into our meal. Then said we couldnt split the bill. Ummm huh?! How hard is it to just charge per person. 

Dessert table was beyond pathetic - for the price I was expecting more authentic indian sweets, not cheap store bought cookies, cakes, and ice cream. 

Get rid of the sad and cheap pizza, fries, spring rolls, onion rings ect and have more variety of biryani, pakoras, samosas (one they had tasted like cheap frozen ones you get in stores) or even have an hakka-indian section if you want to branch out of the traditional indian food. 

The naan was actually really good - but Im not paying 30$ to fill up on naan. Decent amount of curry options ..but it gets repetitive after you go through them all. Outside of the curry bar - your options are limited. I meant they had a buffet tray...for KETCHUP. 

For 120$ between 4 ppl, your better off going to an fine dining indian cuisine - get the same amount of food, better quality, for way less $. 

To leave on a positive note, the waitress were nice though. Quick for water fill ups and removing dishes.
