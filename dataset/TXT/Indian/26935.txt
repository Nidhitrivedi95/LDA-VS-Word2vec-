iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Yelp Phoenix weekly last week had a list of Indian food.... When I saw it, all of them listed looked very good including this place.

I came here for early lunch the other day, and really enjoyed my food here. They do get busy, I am glad I arrived here around 11:30am.  Around the peak lunch hour, they were completely full with some people in queue.

I tried their iced chai tea. It has a nice bold tea flavor to it, I really enjoyed it. I think I would have enjoyed more if it was hot.  (It was still hot outside so I wanted iced tea but next time I will order hot tea). 

I had tandori shrimp. Shrimp is served still in the shell but they prepared nicely to eat to peel off. Shrimp had a very nice tandori oven cooked flavor to it, I enjoyed without any sauce as well as some of the sauce. My favorite was green one. They had four difference sauce, each was good.  Basmati rice was very good, I enjoyed it with red sauce. (I don't know what they are but tasty.  I asked for the name but I couldn't remember them).

For desert, I tried Rasmalai, Indian Cheesecake.  I never had Rasmalai before. In fact I never heard of the name before.  No pictures on the menu, I decided to try anyway as I like cheesecake.  Well, it was nothing like cheesecake I thought. I was actually quite taken back when I first saw it served. It ended up being quite good, very light, perfect way to end Indian meal. I thought it helped me settle my tummy. 

I didn't get to try any of their curry. I am looking forward to my next visit here and try their curry.
