oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q Super impressed by this nice sit-down Chinese fusion spot. Bonus points for being a great halal option. We only ordered  Chinese, although they do have Thai.

We ordered their crispy beef- sweet and perfect. No sauce but with the taste of this you may not want anything else.

We also had chicken wonton soup and they are not shy or greedy with packing in won tons. It was very tasty as well. My husband looooved the hot and sour soup. 

There were some side chicken dishes but they were not THAT memorable, but still good.

And a dry chili shrimp dish (B+) and chicken drumsticks (B-)

Fried bananas were a really great ending- if you have room. 

All together, I have to say given good quality, great taste in the majority of dishes, and good service, we will definitely be back when we return to the area.
