zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q After reading all the great review on yelp was utterly disappointed. Definately not an Indian or Pakistani restaurant. Food is bland.
Biryani is just plain bland masala rice made with afghan spice combo. Nan not good either.
For people looking for authentic indian or pakistani place this is not the place.
