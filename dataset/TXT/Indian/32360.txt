LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw I've always been a big fan of this place but lately I've kinda fell into a love hate type relationship. The shopping mart side is great and I love the fresh meats and how they cut everything right in front of you. Now as for the food court area it's been making me upset. I was here about two months ago and I got the rice and the tikka masala. As for the same thing today and both times have been bad. The flavor is invisible the chicken is so bland and it's just not there. It is disappointing to me because it use to be the best around and it makes me wanna stop coming because it seems the quality of the food has been downgraded. As for the rice it was normal basmati rice had good flavor. One thing that's really nice is they have two different baskets at the register. One has normal pita bread and the other has deep fried pita bread and I think it's awesome that's include free of charge. I really hope things change and go back to how it was before because I think this was one of the better middle eastern food spots in Pittsburgh.
