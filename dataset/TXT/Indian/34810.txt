Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Not many indian restaurants in Vegas. This one was ok. Was a buffet when we arrived, werent sure what half the stuff was! Coming from England, we love a good indian curry, but found this pretty average even though there were many indians eating here which was a good sign. The pakora batter was waaay too thick and the currys not spicy enough for my liking. Not a bad choice though if you fancy a curry. The vegetable dishes and chicken curry was good. They also provide goat curry and saag which i didnt rate too much. worth a try.
