kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I came here on a weekday night and wasn't crowded. Technically, I guess this place counts as a fast food restaurant so they are really quick to get your order in and then out the door.  They have a fusion of all different types of curries and noodles.

Given the vast amount of variety here, it's hard for them to truly be authentic in any way. I had the pad thai here which was much too much tomato flavor. I would not recommend getting that here. The curry I had was really delicious. Definitely worth it for the price.

In summary, stop by if you are in a hurry and would like some cheap good curry. Do not get the noodles! Don't expect authentic Asian cuisine but do expect some overall good food!
