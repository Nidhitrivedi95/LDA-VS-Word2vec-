epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg I don't usually go for Indian food because their food is usually preeeetty spicy and so all I can really happily eat is the butter chicken + whatever side they give you. I can handle spicy but not suuuuper duuuper spicy.

I was referred here by one of my friends who frequents this place. I had to give it a shot and change things up! It's a small restaurant with maybe about 6-7 tables. I came here for lunch so since my go-to was butter chicken, I got the butter chicken roti with vegetable samosas for the appetizer. I was pretty hungry and thought that at the very least, butter chicken was a safe choice as I think it is hard to screw up such a popular item.

The butter chicken roti was awesome! Very flavourful and I got to choose the level of spicyness too! I found a lot of other Indian shops I've been to didn't give you that option. I chose mild and it was perfect! Not too spicy but not too bland either :) the roti was crispy but soft and soooo yummy! I actually got full from eating 3/4s of it but I just finished it all because I couldn't stop myself! I kept wanting more!

The samosas were pretty good too just a bit hard on the outside but that's about it.

I actually came back later that day for dinner and had the lamb biryani mild spicy. That was just as tasty but I packed part of it home as I could not finish it. When I had the samosas and biryani the next day I was impressed!!! Most food doesn't taste good after a day old but both tasted just like the day before and even if you heated it up REAAAAL good, it didn't get dry or hard at all! This was awesome! I definitely will go back to try some other plates and I suggest others to visit this place too if you are feeling for some good Indian food!!
