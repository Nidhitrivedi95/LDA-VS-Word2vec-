Yea, it's a bit of trek as we gotta ride the streetcar way out west but hey when we're hungry we are looking for something delicious and satisfactory. And Gandhi fits the bill with its amazing creations. The word on the street is right about this place, they do serve up beautiful indian style rotis. 

Saag Paneer has become one of my favourites, the creamy base of chopped spiced spinach (notes of ginger) is studded with blocks of cheese all over. Chicken tikka masala has rich flavours while the butter chicken while wonderfully creamy is a tad oversalted and lacks the complex spicing of the chicken tikka or butter chickens past at other establishments. Both feature tasty pieces of white meat though. My favourite part of the meal is the roti pastry, it's thin, light and a little sweet. The perfect shell to the bundle of goodness inside. Portions are huge here, we usually try to get 2 rotis to amongst 3 and it's more than enough even for the guys in the group. Heck if you have a real hungry man in your life one of these babies eaten in a single sitting would keep em happy. Oh and they're usually pretty on the mark with their spicy/hot scale here, don't be an hero and order hot because it's uberly tear inducing, breathtakingly hot!

I wish that this place was bigger, the lineups at lunch hour and peak dinner can be overwhelming so again-call ahead especially if you have a big order. (expect a half hour to 45 minute wait during peak lunch if you have more than one order) The atmosphere is non existent and with the meat rotis past the $10 price range you'd think they they could bone up on the extras such as extras such as side sauces, extra seating or tableware as Susan pointed out below. But maybe they're perfectly fine with the status quo as the folk keep comin' and enjoyin'.
