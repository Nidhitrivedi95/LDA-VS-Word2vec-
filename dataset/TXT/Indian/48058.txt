TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We were visiting from LA and after 5 days of meals on the road, I was jonesing for a home cooked indian meal. We came across a Groupon deal and read excellent reviews for India Palace. When we got to the restaurant, it was not that busy and we got seated immediately, our server Anthony, seated us right away and was very attentive. My little one does not eat any spicy food, and the chef made my non spicy daal , which was delish! and was a hit with the little one. We ordered Chicken Tikka masala and kadhi goat. .both were excellent. The food HIT the SPOT. I am going to sleep sooooo well tonight. I would highly recommend this restaurant to Indians as well as others...
