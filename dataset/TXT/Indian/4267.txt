They didn't come to take drink orders for probably 15 minutes.  We went ahead and ordered at that time too as it seemed they might never come back.  We had our 18 month old son with us- he is very good at restaurants but this was getting a bit ridiculous for him.  Portions were decent- but I didn't think the food was great.  Once we finished, I went to the car with our son while my husband waited to pay and it took at least another 15-20 mins for them to drop the check.  Honestly, I won't go back.
