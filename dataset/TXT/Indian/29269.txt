JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ I love this place. We have been eating here for many year and we do because we are treated like part of the family. Leslie and Agnes greet us with a smile and welcome us back. While yes many new Indian places have opened in Charlotte over the past 6 years or so I like to stick with the tried and true recipes of Woodlands. Yes I have tried other places and some I even like very much, however when you combine the QUALITY and SERVICE that you receive here that is where the VALUE comes from. I love this place and my family loves this place!
