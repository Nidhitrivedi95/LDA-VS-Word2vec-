o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw One of my favorites! Everything on the west side seems to be a chain restaurant with very little flair or flavor.

This restaurant has great food, a friendly staff that has obviously been carefully selected,  and a comfortable, casual atmosphere. 

Literally, the only complaint I can make is that I wish they were open on Mondays! I'm off on Mondays, and like to eat lunch out. I guess if that's my biggest complaint, it's not too bad, huh?
