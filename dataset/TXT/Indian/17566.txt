DxbdfvNYPCyiLJDDPJK3Tg Decent Hakka food. Vegetarian Manchurian balls were my favourite. The Bombay paneer was not like your traditional chilli paneer but it was more like barbecue paneer. The Hakka noodles were good, we ordered them spicy but it was almost unbearable because of that. Medium is probably good for most.
