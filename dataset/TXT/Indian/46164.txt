sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ One of my favourite hole in the wall east Indian spots in Toronto's west end. This place is easy to miss, but if you're lucky enough to find it, get ready to chow down on some of the best  roti in Toronto.

The menu is fairly simple: meat or veggie-based rotis. Once that age-old question has been answered, pick a spice level (the guy behind the counter can usually help you figure out what spice you can handle). Wait 5-10. Enjoy. 

The roti itself is packed like a brick and served in authentic hole in the wall flatware (aluminium containers). But once you cut into one of these bad boys, your face will be blasted with the aroma of delicious spices and meat (or veggies). Most rotis also come with potatoes inside. 

The serving is massive. Don't be discouraged if you can't finish in one sitting. The roti tastes just as good (perhaps better) the next day. Just like the day-old pizza that you rejoice in with a fist pump after a night out on the town. 

The only downside to this place is that seating is extremely limited (maybe 10 seats). It's meant to be a grab and go given the tight quarters. Also, since the place is really small, you also end up taking the scent of the restaurant with you as you walk out the door. So make sure you're not planning any close encounters after visiting here unless you want people wanting to eat your sweater because it smells like roti goodness.
