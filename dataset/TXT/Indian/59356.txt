z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA Never have been. Decided I'd come from the Clinic down Euclid and give it a shot with a coworker. I love all sorts of cuisine. 

Walk in. Presentation of the bar awful. Minute or so later finally greeted. Proteins and what not looked as if they were microwaved from perhaps last night. I made it clear id never been. Just wanted a little run down of what these indistinguishable items were. The guy really couldn't give me much insight. Kept calling me young man. When he was probably my age. They had cleaning chemicals out around food. My buddy took a pic of that and is sending that in so keep a look out for that. 

Food tastes pretty good. However with awful first opinions and customer service like that I fear for the longevity of the business. 

Regards.
