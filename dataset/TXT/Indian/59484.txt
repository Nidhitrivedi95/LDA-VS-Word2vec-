z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Needed an Indian food fix, my friend is 6 months pregnant and craving Indian food,so went here as it was the closest at the time, It was pretty good, I had the chicken Tikka Masala and some kind of yummy Korma. My friend really liked the dessert which was some kind of fruit pudding, I myself would rather have Kheer,Ras Malie or that Indian dessert that is made out of carrots not sure of the name
However 
I really enjoyed the Chicken Tikka and the Korma. And I felt the service was great especially since we had a toddler with us , the waiter was so friendly and helpful with the toddler,  and I was impressed by that and the fact that he kept our water glasses filled and had a smile on his face the whole time. Super friendly service... A++ service . I will definitely be back. The only thing I think needs improvement is keeping the buffet re-stocked.  That is why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 stars.
