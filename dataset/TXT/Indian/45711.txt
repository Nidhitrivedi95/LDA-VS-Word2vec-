scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Ordered a butter chicken (chicken makhni) and garlic naan and roti. Chicken curry was too tangy - not what i expected from a good chicken makhni. Naan was alright and roti was terrible.
All in all food is pretty ok - more on not so great side.

Service on the other hand is good. Our waiter made sure the orders were taken right and kept an eye on regularly asking or replenishing stuff for us.
