bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug The restaurant is ok but Becky is the only person who understood our order and always brought  us what we asked for. She is gone now and if you get the food as is, then it's ok. If you make any changes, be prepared for a surprise. Food is oily but good in general. The restaurant is always very crowded and no service when you need it.
