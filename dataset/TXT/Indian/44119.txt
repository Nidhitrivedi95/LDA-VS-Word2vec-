RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Got takeout from here and I have to say I was pretty pleased. Food was ready on time and only took 10-15 minutes. Portions were plentiful and weren't just sauce with a few chunks of whatever dish you ordered.

We got naans, beef kababs, mutter paneer and the veggie combo sizzler. I never had a mutter paneer loaded with so many peas. It was fantastic. The kababs were good and I would totally order them again too. Though I might try a different protein next time. The combo sizzler was good and also good value. Its a bigger dish than the mutter paneer. All the portions were great and tasted great too.

Who knew Pakastan made such good Indian food? So pleased to have a go to Indian/Pakastan restaurant in the area. I will definitely be back
