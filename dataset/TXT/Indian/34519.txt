MmwKWBBrR0NF05hGBxnWjA Channa masala FAIL:

I've given Veda a try twice now and found it rather disappointing both times.  Maybe the problem was that I went towards the end of the lunch hour both times?

The channa masala had clearly been in the steam tray for a while...it had that luscious texture of cardboard.  Also, shockingly for a vegetarian Indian dish, it was rather flavourless...the flavours of coriander, garam masala, chill, ginger which normally turn chickpeas into something more than well, chickpeas, were totally absent.  The channa masala was piled on top of rice which had also clearly been in a warmer for quite a while, gradually becoming dry and crispy.   

On my second try, I had the lentil curry...slightly fresher than the channa masala fail, but also quite a bit on the bland side.  Are they scared of spice at an Indian restaurant?

The ATMOSPHERE is, well, a bit depressing...subterranean cafeteria.  The STAFF are reasonably friendly.

I like the idea that they're trying to do something cheap and healthful...not often an option in the college cafeteria; however, they really should step up the spice and care with which they serve their food.  If they've held the food long enough that it has become visibly desiccated better to throw it out than serve it to an unsuspecting customer.
