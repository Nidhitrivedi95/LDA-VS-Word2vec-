ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Copper delivered on providing an absolutely stellar evening of dining. My bestie and I decided to indulge in some higher-end Indian food on a recent Saturday.
We made reservations for dinner at 7:00 and when we arrived, we were able to choose our seating area. We went with sitting at a table in the front porch area. However, they also provide patio dining.

It was slightly busy when we arrived but got busier as the night progressed. We decided to start our meal off with cocktails, I forget the actual name of the cocktail but it had mango puree, lime juice and amaranth (I believe that's how it's spelled?). It was delicious! and we also had the vegetable samosa. Th samosa had a slightly thicker crust than I was expecting but filled with the right amount of spice and texture.

My bff went the traditional route and ordered the chicken tikka masala while I decided to go the more 'modern' route and ordered the black sesame-apricot-chili glazed chicken tikka. A giant bowl of jasmine rice and basket of naan accompanied our plates. The naan was light, fluffy and practically melted in my mouth. My plate of chicken tikka was so beautifully plated and tasted even better than it looked. So juicy and full of flavor. The vegetables were lightly spiced and slightly al dente.

I got to try some of the traditional chicken tikka and the chicken was so buttery. The naan was perfect for scooping up the chicken and sauce. Our meal was delicious, we didn't want it to end so we ordered dessert. We shared a bowl of the kulfi which was delightfully light and sweet way to end our time at Copper.

If you're looking to impress someone special, celebrate a special occasion, or savor a good meal, go to Copper. You will not be disappointed.
