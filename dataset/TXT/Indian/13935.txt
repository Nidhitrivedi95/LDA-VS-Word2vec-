BuC5gidaUkXs0YPZmvQexA Very homely n friendly staff. Tried Curry pie n Pot pie; curry pie is different in taste then Indian curry but is scrumptious!!! Very mellow ambience with good food. 
I only had problem with the way sauces were self served from fridge which could lead up to one using someone else's not so hygiene way of handling them. Individual servings packs would be an ideal way. 
But all in all, loved the experience n recommend to few on my way home.
