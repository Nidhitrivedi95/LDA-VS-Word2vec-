8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Went back again for take out. 
Portions were great and the flavor was above average. Ordered the lamb vindaloo, and got a heaping container of vindaloo and another good sized container for rice. And the garlic naan was very very good. 

When I stopped by to pick it up I asked one of the staff members why Somosa wasn't on the menu, he said "it's on the dinner menu, you can ask for it any time"

Very helpful and friendly staff. 
Food is still good and at a fair price.
