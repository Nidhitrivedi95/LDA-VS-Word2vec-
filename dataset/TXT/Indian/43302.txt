RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg 7-17-2016 Being in Vegas...walked by this place and wanted to check it out! Ambiance was nice, very ornate and classy. Resturant wasnt that full around the time we went. Chicken tika was really yummy, garlic naan was hot and fresh.....then the all meat sizzling platter was no good. It tasted like it was pre made and just heated up to make grill marks. Especially the lamb. I was really disgusted by it. I know Indian food and that was not good at all. I'm sorry I had to be honest. I mean I was really excited with the sizzling platter and presentation. The clean atmosphere. But very disappointed with the sizzling platter. I hope I can come back and give them another try on that platter but the chicken tika was absolutely devine.
