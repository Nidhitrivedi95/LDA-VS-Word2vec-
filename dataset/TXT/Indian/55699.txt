x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ This restaurant has actually changed quite a bit. The food was pretty good. We got our food very quickly and our waitress was pretty nice. We were overall happy with our experience, but one thing that should be noted is that more than half of our food seemed to be reheated in the microwave since the food came out a bit cold. The food would have tasted a lot better had it been served hot.
