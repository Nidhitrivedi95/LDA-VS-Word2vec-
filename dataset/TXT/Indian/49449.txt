tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My wife and I went here for lunch today.  Now just for clarification my wife is not one to enjoy foods that are ethnic.

She left this place raving.  The lamb was delicious as was the basmati rice.  Hmm the naan (flatbread) was divine.  Even the deserts were delicious: cheese donut thing, carrot pudding, and this amazing mango pudding.

The two of us enjoyed a delicious and filling lunch in a wonderful atmosphere for about $20 bucks. Not bad!
