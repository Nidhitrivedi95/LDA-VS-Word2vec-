zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA Returning home for Thanksgiving from Chicago ( boasts an Indian neighborhood ...Devon), my family always visited Star of India sometime during the Holiday. Never had a bad meal there. I eat Indian food frequently and after reading the Yuva reviews I was skeptical. We went Sat evening and couldn't have been more pleased. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the service was efficient and friendly and the food...the food was sophisticated, authentically spiced (as far as I know) and just delicious. We were impressed and will return.
