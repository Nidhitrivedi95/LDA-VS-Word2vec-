Saffron Indian Bistro is the closest thing to quality Indian food on the West side of the I-17.  Notable mention however, was their new hire Alex, who masterfully handled the entire dining area with such engaging class and anticipation of the diners needs.. His being hired was a true stroke of genius to have represent the restaurant.  Alex relayed that the cook likes to create dishes with  edgy cross-fusion, that I'm sure is very unique and  tasty .. I however was really craving a good chicken korma, so the addition of corn, chopped green beans, and cubed carrots was disappointing, but the base flavor was still good enough to be able to pull it off to where I would order it again.
