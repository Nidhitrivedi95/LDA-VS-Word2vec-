VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ This was EXACTLY what my wife and I were looking for. Although we did make the mistake of going for dinner and paying for every thing individually (46.99) instead of the 8.99 lunch buffet.... But the food, Ohhhhh man. So tasty. tandoori shrimp tiki masala on spice #4 was the JAM! Definitely will be going back.. For the lunch buffet. ;)
