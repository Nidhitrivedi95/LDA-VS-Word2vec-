The Devi was near our hotel and shared equally good reviews as another within our walking radius.  On a hot summer's night the fact that this Crescent St resto offered a deck won us over, the richly flavored food and charming attentive service of our waiter, Adam, made us glad we came. The the lamb kebabs were sumptuous and, if Colonel Saunders was there, he'd tell you himself that the garlic naan was finger licking good. Likely my stand out fav of the night was the daal makhani - a black lentil dish that is simmered for 8 hours of flavor-filled, stick-to-your ribs perfection. The night was so lovely we lingered on after dinner was complete enjoying a bottle of wine, the street views and chatting with other guests. The delightful scents wafting from other tables made me want to keep eating, save I was too full for another bite.

From my street view, the interior decor looked quite nice. If they could bring a little of that feeling to the terrace it would be even better. We will return on our next visit.
