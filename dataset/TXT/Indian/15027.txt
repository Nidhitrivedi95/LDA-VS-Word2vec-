cJLx99fsYPM0SlNfWLb4Ug Taste of India is a staple in our house.  I can't speak for all dishes because we are too hooked on our favorites, which include the chicken tikka masala, raita, garlic and cheese naan, chicken tandoori appetizer (amazing amount of chicken for an appetizer), and beef vindaloo.  The staff is excellent. The chicken tikka is hands down the best in Madison.
