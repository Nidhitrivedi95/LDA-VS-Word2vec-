0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw This place is unclean, disgusting and has terrible customer service. I found a dead fly at the bottom of my takeaway container. Went back to show them my food with the fly in it as evidence and I got called disgusting while being sworn at by the manager. Terrible customer service. Apparently a fly in your food isn't a big deal according to the manager. I was "just exaggerating", also according to the manager. Don't eat here. 0/10 recommend. 
Attached are pictures of the fly at the bottom of my food. Terribly uncleanly.
