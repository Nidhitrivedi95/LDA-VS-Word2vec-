Delicious!  We are vegan but anyone would have loved what we ordered! 
  Started with vegetable stuffed dosa that comes with 4 different dipping sauces.  Also ordered a cocktail recommended by our server Jay.  Five spice passionfruit mojito- I think- lol.  Had fresh ginger, star anise, mint, lemon,cherries.  
  After taking a look their menu we decided on the vegan prix fixe menu which was $42.99 for 2 people.  Each person got a bowl of tomato soup, shared an appetizer and then a a huge sampler entree of the veg korma, curry, dal, rice, pickled veg, roti and more.., and a dessert.  Everything was prefect.  The dessert that they normally serve with the vegan set menu they were out of though so they gave us some sort of mango sorbet.  It was so frozen that it was hard to eat with a spoon but I was so full it didn't matter.  One other downer is that we did have to ask a total of three times (two different employees) in order to get our bottle of sparkling water.  No big deal though, other than that we had atleast 4 different employees serve us, check in, help out.  Honestly if the service had been perfect I would say 5 stars.
  Great staff and genuine.  We will be back.  Can't wait to try lunch buffet.
