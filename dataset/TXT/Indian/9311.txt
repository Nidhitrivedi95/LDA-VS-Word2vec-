8GtI_5mG3V1e9vDODgWC1A I went here with a group of friends for a birthday celebration on Saturday last week... We arrived a little earlier than everyone else and so were sat in a relatively quiet restaurant to wait on our friends arriving at 7.30pm. The problem was it seems that EVERYONE arrives at 7.30pm! They had booked all of the tables to sit at the same time, which of course meant the waiters (of which they were plenty) were running about like headless chickens. We were advised by the 1st waiter to order quickly so they could take it to the kitchen (my friends had not even taken their coats off, let alone look at the menu). When we ordered off their impressively massive menu we were advised that what we ordered was not on the menu...??? And to 'hurry and change our minds!'
When our meals arrived they were very tasty and went down a treat, and the BYOB was great as it meant the meal worked out at £15 per head (we didn't order starters in case the waiter got angry at us taking our time).
All in all we enjoyed great food but they need to re-think their meal booking times. Perhaps it would be best not to go on a Saturday when they are busy???
