-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ We came here for my son's birthday. Service was slow as "they prepare food from scratch when you order". But food was amazing. Delicious. Fresh and frankly the best I've had in Mississauga. Every dish had been prepared in an authentic manner and BBQ was just out of this world. Highly recommend. Will visit again.

Hoping for better service next time but the food was worth it. They recommended that we call ahead so they can prep in advance. I still gave tip for amazing food.
