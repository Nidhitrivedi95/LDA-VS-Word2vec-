Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg We went here by accident and it turned out to be the best indian food we've ever had. Like another reviewer stated, it beats anything I ever had in NYC or Chicago. The naan bread and roti are great. But the entrees and appetizers are fabulous.I've so far tried the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala (of course), methi paneer, gobi matar paneer keema (my absolute favorite), paneer phaldari (I like paneer, alright?), panch puran daal tadka and more. 

Two standouts for me were the gobi matar paneer and the cholay samosa chaat. And the methi paneer. It's impossible for me to decide on only one because nothing is even close to bad here! Even the rice is fantastic.

The chef always comes out to talk to us. You can tell he really loves cooking and is passionate about sharing his experiences with indian cuisine as well as wanting to hear your thoughts and experiences with indian food. I really like him and the woman who works the front a lot. They are friendly and helpful without being intrusive. 

It's our new favorite place to eat!

FYI- Closed Mondays
