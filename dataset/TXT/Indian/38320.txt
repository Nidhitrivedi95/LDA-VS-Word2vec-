oMt3FrXtmYiP2ayn46PHtQ I am not a big fan of Indian food, so when my husband brought home my chicken tikka masala I thought it would just be an ok dinner. To my surprise the chicken has become my favorite meal ever! I was actually upset when I finished it! I am so glad we found this place!! Definitely a MUST try!
