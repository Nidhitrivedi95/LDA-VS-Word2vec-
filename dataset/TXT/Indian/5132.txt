2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Decent tasting roti shrimp curry , the number and size of the shrimp was i of significance compared to the almost similar tasting curries with various meat options. Add pickled mango or lime pickle to your order to make the over powering spice more balance. The amount of folded bread with curry layers in between was to much . The rice and curry option is a way better choice. The place for sure needs a good house keeping and definitely in need of some kind of fan or air conditioning . It seems that roti house intends to make the customer perspire way before the arrival of their order :-)
