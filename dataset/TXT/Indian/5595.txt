3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Went here at 9pm. Got the end of the day leftovers. Also agree there should be samosas instead of springrolls...wtf. Got rushed 3 times by the servers to "hurry up" and get out. They brought us our bill before we asked for it. Also, the manager was seen doddling around standing in the buffet section just stirring the curries & staring off into space. Weird place, especially for King street. For a cheaper price you might as well get indian food in the food court. 

Ps. No ice cream, it had freezer burn and couldnt even scoop it out and whatever we could scrape out ended up tasting expired.
