0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ My go to Hakka restaurant when I'm looking for something spicy. Usually order the same things...chilli chicken with gravy, Crispy beef, shrimp pakora and a noodle dish (we switch it up depending on the preference for that time). My only negative comment about the food is that shrimp pakora should be made smaller...or cooked longer. The inside of the pakoras are not cooked in the middle and we often are around them since we had take out and couldn't ask them to refry them.
