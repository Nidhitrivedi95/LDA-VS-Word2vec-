THE UP-SIDE:
Fantastic Greek and Indian food in a really pleasing atmosphere.  Great place for a first date.  If possible, sit by the window on a summer night; they open the whole front up to the outside.  It makes for a really nice dining experience; especially if it is it's a little rainy outside.

THE DOWN-SIDE:
Always difficult to come up with a "down-side" to a five star establishment.  Um...  

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Go here for tasty food and the romantic atmosphere!
