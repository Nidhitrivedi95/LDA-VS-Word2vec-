HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A I had a craving for Indian food (which I had for a while now, and wanted something a bit more substantial than Choolah, which is still YUMMY) so off to Saffron Patch we went.  My fiance, who is Middle Eastern does NOT like Indian food, because he grew up with it, but he indulged me.

It's a bit hard to find, but it's in the back of an office building on Chagrin.  Think Shuhei.  The inside is beautiful and modern and the servers are well dressed.

We ordered samosas, naan, paneer, garlic naan, chicken tikka (with masala sauce on the sauce) and lamb chops (we wanted to try everything).  I loved the samosas, both of the naans were to DIE for (especially dipped in the masala sauce) and the lamb chops were cooked perfectly.  The rice was so fluffy and there were pounds of it.  I did not care for the paneer - but I think I was expecting something more of a mozzerella stick texture, so that's on me.  

We had so many leftovers and will FOR sure be back, both for dinner and to try the buffet!
