RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg One of the best indian foods I had in the US. Undoubtedly best gol gappa in the US. We went for Sunday buffet which was quite detailed and amazingly tasty. All the dishes were delicious.  I heard the similar reviews from other friends who went for dinner at this place. 5 star for food!!!
Ambience is also trendy along with soothing music.  Service is not that good as I felt they are short of people.  That's why I gave overall 4.5 star to this place.
