4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw The food is all right. I can't say I'm an expert when it comes to Indian food, but I feel like the food is on par with the other Indian restaurants I've been to. I did have their buffet once and a lot of the foods were too salty. I usually go on Tuesdays though, when their main entrees are half off, but it really isn't as good a deal as it sounds. The portions are smaller than at other restaurants, so you're getting what you pay for.  
The service the last time I went was ATROCIOUS. The waiter filled half our water glasses & ran out of water in the pitcher, but it took him forever to come back to fill the rest of our glasses. It took him a while to take our order, too, but the restaurant was busy so I'll forgive him for that. While we were ordering, he asked us, "what kind of bread would you like?" as if it were included in the meal, but be warned--it isn't! We were aware of this and ordered naan anyway, but be aware that it isn't half off. Throughout the meal, we had to keep reminding him to refill our waters and when my friend wanted to place an order for our other friend who was showing up late, the waiter asked him to wait for a moment and never came back. We had to flag him down to get the order in. Later, I asked for a take-out box and while my friends were finishing their dinners, I sat there balancing my box on the edge of the table because the table was so full (what's with their gigantic serving platters anyway? Such a waste of space for so little food!) The waiter came by a few times and never thought to clear the table of the empty plates. I feel like these are just basic waiting skills that everyone should know. We also had to wait forever to get the check. Also, they accept credit cards, but will only take 2 from a party (in case you wanted to split the check a bunch of ways & pay with credit).
