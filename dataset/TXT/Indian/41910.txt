qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Red Room. Use to go here quite abit a number of years back:) Was back this Saturday night for a friends going away party. Nothing has really changed. Still quite the dingy place. Service is dodgy but the place is dodgy too so one can't expect much. Logistics didn't work to well for us either but one can not expect logistical brilliance and accomodation from dodgy service. Let's get to the food. Cheap, and tasty. I had the Pad Thai as always and for late night food (we got there at 11:00) it definately hit the spot. Drinks were also dirt cheap. Doubles for 6.50. Reminded me why I use to frequent this place heavily back in the day. Random indie/alternative or whatever you call it today is on the music playlist. Look forward to stopping by again in another couple of years when I want to reminisce about the good old days. However, definately recommended for the younger crowd who are on a strict budget and are looking for a hip locale to hang at. Would give it a 3.5 if there was such a score.
