idrN6XWKErG6nKDsEMNbOQ I did not expect much but was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. I was expecting typical bland buffet food (that accommodates the masses). The food is well spiced and the selection great. I frequently eat Indian food and there were items I had never tried before. Highly recommend except to those that can't handle spices.
