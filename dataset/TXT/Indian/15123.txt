CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Hardly excellence. The food was OK and the service was awful. The servers were aloof and barely acknowledged our presence.  One guy kept coming to our table to drop off food while talking on a cordless phone! They did not check in once to see how we were doing - but seemed to have plenty of time to do random things. At one point I waved a server down and he asked me what I wanted from across the room. RUDE.

Waited forever for the food even though the place was not busy. The chicken app was a paltry two pieces of bland chicken. The main courses were OK. One star for the service and poor attitude.

Toronto has a ton of great cheap Indian and Pakistani places. Don't bother with this overpriced place with bad service.
