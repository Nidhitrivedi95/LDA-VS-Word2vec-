KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw I took my parents to Rick's good eats, I've been wanting to go so bad for so long. Well, the wait was worth it, the food exceeded my expectations! The layers of the flavours on the loaded fries, wow I couldn't stop eating them, I really couldn't stop. My mother got the classic Mom's briyani which, also was filled with layers of flavours. My father got the butter chicken mac n' cheese, very very good. It was so so so delicious, my parents and I were already discussing on the way back home what we are going to get the next time we go. The staff was so nice, they were very kind. Great time. Marvellous food.
