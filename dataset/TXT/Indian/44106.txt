RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w People who believe this to be authentic Indian food are horribly wrong. Being Indian myself and having tried Indian food all over the world, I can gladly say this is the worst place ever. I don't even know where to begin my review. 

The inside is meh and whatever. I like how they try to be authentic with the decor and added tid bits here and there. 

The food, well it's actually Pakistani cuisine not Indian and people who think it's the same ITS NOT THE SAME. Everything tastes the same, same masalas and it's always spicy as hell even when you ask for mild. I can't even begin to describe the amount of oil and grease they incorporate into each dish. I feel like nothing is made in a tandoor as they say because it always has huge amount of oil on it. I don't even know if they have a proper chef because the quality of food is below par, along with presentation and taste. You can't just add huge amounts of spices on different meats and say they are different dishes. I'm sure people believe this to be good food although it's not. And I've been here many many times and finally stopped coming when I've found other places with good Indian food, that doesn't make me sick. 

I don't know how hygienic the staff is because I see some servers blowing their nose on their shirts and serving us the food. And it can probably explain why my friends and I get diarrhea each time. So I hope a food inspector comes and sees if the health and safety regulations are up to date.  

I'm sorry I just never had a good experience at this place and I've tried all their dishes. I dislike the customer service and even more the atmosphere. 

I would never eat here again.
