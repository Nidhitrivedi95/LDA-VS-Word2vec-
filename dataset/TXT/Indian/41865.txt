QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Samosa was delightful. Garlic and onion naan was fresh, tasty, fantastic. Mango lassi had a pleasant smooth yogurt taste that was pleasingly different from other places I have tried. Lamb curry and Chicken Kendai dishes were not "10" spicy as requested, were similar in taste, but were satisfying. I will try them again. I would like to see how their buffet is...
