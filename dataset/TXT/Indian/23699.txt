gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This was the best Indian food I've ever tasted. My friends and I love Indian food and have tried just about every place in Vegas. Happened to stumble across it and wow! We must say we are impressed. If I could give 10 stars I would. Their tandoori chicken and Tika massala chicken was absolutely the best! Has become my favorite Indian spot in Las Vegas, and the owner is just the best and most accommodating! Has my recommendation!
