pX7ftE5CySOa-5cpuJl_ZA WORST SERVICE EVER. I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala with extra bread over the phone as a to-go order and they said it would be ready in 20 min. I go there 25 minutes after the call and when I got there the service was the WORST (I work in customer service). Not only did I have to wait an extra 50 minutes to receive my paneer tikka since I paid, but the cashier asked if I could dine in instead, because the food was ready (even though I waited an extra 20 after). I said no because I had to leave awhile ago, and they gave me the paneer tikka PIZZA (no extra bread) and insisted I had ordered that. At that point I was so annoyed and took my food and left. Normally I don't have issues in Tempe, but this Pastries and Chaat sucks. I was the ONLY person in the restaurant. Pizza was also soggy.
