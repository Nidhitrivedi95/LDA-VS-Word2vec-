6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w I love Ambiyan. The mango lassi is yummy and everything I have ever tried has been delish! My fav side is garlic naan... but you probably shouldn't order this on a first date.

My husband isn't so fortunate.. hah! So we always garlic-it up!

Portions aren't large, but we always leave full. 

I also tote along a 4 year old and a 1 year old.
