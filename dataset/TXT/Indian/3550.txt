0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Chili Chicken House is the perfect place for people looking to experience Hakka cuisine for the first time. Service was excellent even on peak hours. Food was really good compared to other Hakka places. You can never go wrong with their chili chicken (dry or gravied). Another surprisingly good dish is their chili fish. Only negative is that the place is really small.
