SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg Our first experience at Bhewala was fantastic.  The man who led us through our menu options was very helpful.  We ended up with a brown rice bowl with lamb meatballs & Okra.  It was a substantial portion of which the left overs are going to make the perfect lunch tomorrow.  
I've left out the most important part of my review - the food was delicious!!! The meatballs were great, vegetables perfectly seasoned, all of the wonderful Indian spices you would want to have shined through, and the condiment sauces really let you personalize your dish.
I can't wait till the open more in other local cities.
