aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q After hearing so much about this place I finally went and they did not disappoint!
I might as well been having my punjabi grandmas home cooking! I had the mattar paneer, dal makhni, aloo gobhi and malai kofta with basmati rice!.. Oh so good! Rest assure I will be back!. The owner if Indies is so nice! Great service!
If you want to know what North Indian home cooking tastes like go here!
