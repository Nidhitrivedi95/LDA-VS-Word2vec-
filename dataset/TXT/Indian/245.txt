-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g The lunch buffet here is one of the best dining deals you can get in Tempe. The buffet features a good variety of well-seasoned favorites and is not overly meat oriented as some buffets tend to be - a boon to those who prefer their diet to be mainly plant-based. I especially liked the chicken tikka masala and the dal (lentil), and freshly-prepared garlic naan was excellent for sopping up the tasty sauces. The service is friendly, the lunch buffet was inexpensive especially considering the quality of the food, and wifi is available.
