-qdbWrCU8Ktg80dk458BAw I skip breakfast on on weekends so I can come eat here. I'm usually in the area on weekends and absolutely love the food here. 

I have tried couple of things on the menu but their chat papri and sev puri are amazing. We always get those two things and maybe try something else. 

Had their royal falooda last time and it was really good as well. The decor does need an update (ancient Egypt theme?) but who cares when the food taste so good. The staff is also very friendly.
