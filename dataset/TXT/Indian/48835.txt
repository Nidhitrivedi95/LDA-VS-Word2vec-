TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA Normally I get takeout, but a friend and I stopped in for the lunch buffet right on a Saturday afternoon. The buffet is predominantly South Indian, which means you may not find the dishes that are typical in American Indian restaurants, which mostly come from the North. So (for example) there was no butter chicken, but there WAS a very lovely spicy Andhra-style chicken curry where the chicken was super-tender as it was still on the bone. It reminded me quite a bit of the chicken curries I ate in India. We also had the curd rice (delicious, like a savory rice pudding with mustard seeds and curry leaves), and a number of Northern-style vegetable curries--saag aloo and cauliflower in cashew sauce were particulary good. And you get free dosas! The buffet is (imo, as a Westerner who has been to India but doesn't claim any expertise in Indian cuisine) very authentic to the consistency and spice of what you might get in India, but people who are used to more Americanized food may find it unfamiliar.

I usually get chicken 65, vegetable Chettinad, and samosas for takeout--the samosas are huge and always crispy. It's a draw between this place and Udipi for me in terms of South Indian in Pittsburgh--Tamarind is much closer but Udipi has upma. But you can't do better in terms of buffet, and lunch is dirt-cheap.
