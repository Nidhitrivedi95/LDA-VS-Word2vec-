ai9r_wv56TPzwtrfUEPXTw Well this was our go to place. Food is great...except for our last visit. We ordered pick up. We came, waited, waited, waited, and then another customer came back and returned his food (which was our order) as he had wrong order and then they wanted to give us that food which was gone for at least 10 min (can you believe it) as we waited and never saw this individual in the restaurant.  She argued with us telling us it is fresh....how would you know that your rotti order is wrong unless you tried it.  We finally got our money back after a few back and forths.  CANT believe that just happened.
