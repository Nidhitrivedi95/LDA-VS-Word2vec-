AgnnYOtOmSr3W_vUmSIeaw This place took over the old Bay Leaf indian restaurant so we gave it a try last night with new management and first of all I never expect good customer service at indian restaurants but these guys have excellent service! Extremely friendly!!
Second the food, we moved here from Chicago and so far nothing had met our expectations on taste, we were always disappointed but this place has changed that! The food was so amazing that my picky kids were licking their fingers and finished everything on their plate! The chicken 65 Biryani was amazing...chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken all excellent!! You even get free tea after you are done :)   Sooo happy I found this place!! I just hope they don't change their taste because once a restaurant becomes famous they start cutting corners and change their menus...keep doing what you guys do cuz we love your food!
