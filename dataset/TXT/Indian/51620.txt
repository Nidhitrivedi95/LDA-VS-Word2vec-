UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Wow, this off the grid bistro is outstanding. One of those hidden gems that needs to be on everyone's must visit list. Friday night, recommend a reservation it's busy. Service was good, atmosphere is low key but the food is the wow. If it's your first time have the waiter recommend the favorites. The tandoori chicken was incredible very flavorful. We had a lamb curry that's was equally as good and of course the nan bread. Samosa appetizer to start. We will be back!
