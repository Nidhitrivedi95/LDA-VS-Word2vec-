MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ I have always been a big fan of BP mainly because of the consistency of the dishes, we usually loved the buffet style food. Lately, however, my wife and I agreed that the dishes to us have become predictable and to be frank, boring. Yes, the sauces are spicy and flavorful, the naan is always fresh and tasty and the butter chicken melts in your mouth. BUT:

Despite the consistency and taste (4 stars) there is simply nothing extraordinary about BP and the atmosphere makes me think "seniors day". The dining room is dark and imposing, definitely would need a more contemporary design makeover. The menu could use fewer but more exciting a la carte highlights and what's more important, a stronger seasonal and regional influence.

BP has good tasty food, yet a not exactly authentic menu. Atmosphere is rather old-fashioned and a tad musty. Go there if you crave indian food and have nothing else to explore, but it's not fireworks - just very tasty.
