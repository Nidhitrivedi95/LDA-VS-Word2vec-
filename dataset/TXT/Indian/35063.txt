Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Was excited to try this Indian restaurant since it was recommended by some Indian acquaintances.  I love Indian food.  I generally don't go to the buffet lunches as they usually don't offer the best selection (everything chicken) and quality but my friend said, the buffet is actually good and they even offer lamb curry/korma (you just have to ask for it and the waiter will bring it to  your table).

The flavors of all the curries were fantastic and deserving of 4-5 stars, the only problem is every curry was WAY TOO SALTY.  Not sure if this was intended being that it was a buffet and perhaps they want you to fill up on rice or nan.  Had they cut the salt in half, they would have gotten 5 stars from me.

Apparently they must be doing something right because out of the whole food court in Hawaiian Village, they were the only restaurant left standing.  I would potentially go back again but only if I needed some extra sodium in my diet.
