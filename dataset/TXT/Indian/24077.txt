GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg This really isn't an update I am just trying to add my pics! As I type this I will try not to eat it all before the pic. This food is amazing! have I already said that lol. I am trying the famous chicken biryani...oh my best I have ever Had! I know my biryani too! The sauce is beautiful, that comes on the side. I also had the best mango Lassi of my life today at Lahori's. As I work my way through the entire menu I'll update here. I have a feeling the 5 stars will remain the same from me! Oh the Tandoori chicken, Lahori's Nihari, and even the Hot tea are all divine!
