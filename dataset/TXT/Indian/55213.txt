WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA i'm not a roti connosieur but i enjoyed this place quite a lot! the vegetarian selection was great. i tried the mushroom, cheese and spinach (i chose rice but i think she mixed up my order and put cheese instead. either way, it tasted great and it ended up being a good mistake). the lady at the counter was very friendly. i wolfed mine down in a matter of a few minutes! i'll definitely go back for more and try the other veggie selections!
