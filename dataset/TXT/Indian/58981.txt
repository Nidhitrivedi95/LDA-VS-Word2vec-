YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A Came back, good food, but slightly uncoordinated service.

This time around the servers were just as nice as before.  However, I believe they could use more organization.  They were definitely working/hustling with things, but not in a coordinated manner from the look of it.  The worst part of the example: a set of dishes left on the patio for hours in the evening.  I wouldn't go back on a Saturday.

The other drawback from this visit: out of Cheetah draft.  Guys, c'mon... don't run dry on your tap on a Saturday evening.  I didn't want anything else to drink, that's your moneymaker!!

I'd still come back though, not on Saturday.  Perhaps I'll call and confirm if they have Cheetah on tap before I come.
