TBHpa0OX9WnWdlrti-KBxQ I really enjoyed this place. The service was attentive, the Saag (a dish I'm very familiar with and so I use it as a point of comparison when trying a new place)  was delicious, we each had ours prepared mild.  The spice was just right and it was full of flavor. The vegetable pakora were amazing and plentiful. I think there were about 10 of them on the plate. We also had garlic naan and an order of Raita which wash creamy and delicious.  I will definitely go again if  I'm in the area and look forward to trying something new.
