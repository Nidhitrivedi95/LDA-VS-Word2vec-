OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Seriously the best Indian food we had in US so far. The menu is unconventional compared to other so called Indian restaurants. The decor is unique. We found this on yelp and went for dinner. Got a chance to speak with the owner and we could immediately sense so much passion for good food and a drive to stand out. He offered us Pan Shot. A shooter that tastes exactly like Banaras Pan :O. What a treat. We will definitely return for vada pav and buffet.
  (see you soon for sure)
