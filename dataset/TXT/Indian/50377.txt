UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Arizona. Seating is limited as it's inside a grocery store. The food, however, is amazing! I find the food here to have the closest taste to that from my city of childhood - Mumbai, India. Almost everything here is delicious. If you're looking forward to have a full meal, I would recommend ordering Chole & Bhature / Parathas / full dishes with Pulao. What I come here for is Bada Paav, the AZ equivalent of Maharashtra  Vada Paav. Little India is truly little India!
