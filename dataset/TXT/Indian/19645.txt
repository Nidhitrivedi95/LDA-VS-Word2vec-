fHqJZK0D9E91ltD62SwzSw CAUTION: Name and management have changed. We went because of the decently good reviews, but they are no longer warranted. 3 stars is a bit generous but I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt because they are new. 

Pros: food was decent (although nothing special), portion sizes were generous. They were willing to accommodate a larger party and do separate checks. 

Cons: They didn't have a bunch of the items on the menu. They had cocktails on the menu but didn't know how to make them. One customer showed a staff member how to make a martini- Bizarre. Service was sporadic and disorganized. Once my tikka masala came out, I was told that the white rice wouldn't be available for another 20 min. (?!) Had to upgrade to saffron rice - they charged extra. As we were about to pay, we were informed that the credit card machine wasn't working. Were told to walk through the rain to a bank machine. In general, we were not pleased. 

Dine with caution and with cash.
