So let's start with the good. Service was prompt and our waiter was attentive. Thumbs up too for the recommendation on an appetizer.  He recommended a cauliflower dish which was delicious and spicy, definitely not something I would have gotten on my own.

Then there's the not so good...I ordered chicken korma which is a fave of mine at many an Indian restaurant. It was not good here. The sauce tasted not great like it was out of a jar. Frankly, if I wanted something out of a jar I could have done that at home. I asked for medium and it was pretty effing spicy. I had to order a pop to help ease the spice. And for the cost, it was pretty unenjoyable. And naan is $3 for one large piece.
