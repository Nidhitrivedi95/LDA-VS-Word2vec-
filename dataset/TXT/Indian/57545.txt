ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ Just ate here for the first time, and loved it. The food was amazing! The server recommended the chicken makhani, and he couldn't have been more right. Lunch special comes with a side salad, rice, and a generous portion of naan. The server was very nice, let  come in and have a seat 20 minutes before they opened so I didn't have to wait I'm the heat.  Will be back for sure.
