jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q I love this place. Good Indian food, though possibly not quite the best in town. But it's still very well done. The service has always been good to me. I won't lie, I freaking love the view. Come in during the day so you can watch the planes taking off and landing at the airport.
