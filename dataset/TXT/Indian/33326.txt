llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Awesome awesome awesome. The selections of traditional Indian favorites are here. The spice mixes are here. They serve chai iced tea! They use real Indian paneer for their cheese naan. It is in a strip mall but I am not going to knock a star for that. I've never had lamb as tender as that in North America. It appears that they also have a traditional tandoor (the breads and tandoori chicken seemed authentic) this is the real deal for Indian in the valley. One other thing, it's very reasonable. Love it
