-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw This is a gem of a place. It's a large supermarket with all sorts of goodies from all over the world and they also have a prepared foods section as well. The older lady (I believe she is the owner) is so nice and friendly. She offered me a few treats to sample. I wound up buying some Naan and some other stuff from the grocery section. The prices are very reasonable. It's a little far from me, so I dont get out here to often, but whenever I am around this area, I do stop by. Good food, friendly people and decent prices....YAY!!! I am a fan of that :)
