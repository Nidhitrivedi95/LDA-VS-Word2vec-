ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw My boyfriend and I took his parents here prior to going to a show. The service was great! We had three apps, a few entrees, dessert and bottled water. The presentation was great, although I considered the portions small. They didn't ask us how spicy we wanted it and found it too Americanized. Normally its a good assumption that Indians will prefer Indian food traditionally. Total bill was 150 plus tip. We will be back but remember to ask for extra spice
