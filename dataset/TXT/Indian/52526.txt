UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw Would not honor a valid coupon from the Entertainment Book.  Coupon was for one free entree when you buy two entrees - up to $13 value.  Server said that the system would not let her enter the coupon unless one of the entrees was over $13.  I argued that was not what the coupon said and she agreed but said there was nothing she could do.  Shady.
