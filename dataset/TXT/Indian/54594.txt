wDLB9JTsQ8HkkrU4jJBpCw This place used to be my fave neighborhood haunt. Went this last Friday and we ordered the prawn masala only to get served the baby white tiny shrimp that they use for the tom yum soup! Asked the waitress and she said she didn't know the difference between shrimp and prawn...umm lots...eg the price! The grill platter was very tasty. The lamb briyani a big disappointment... Rice soggy and tiny pieces of lamb...like they had taken one piece and cut it into many tiny pieces. So disappointed!!! New ownership and a high staff turnover may have to do with it.
