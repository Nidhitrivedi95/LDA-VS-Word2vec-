Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I just moved here from Orlando, where I had an amazing Indian place I frequented.  Delhi Palace is now my new favorite Indian cuisine restaurant in the PHX area, so much that I don't miss Orlando.  I'll definitely be back even more times in the future to try more dishes.  

The staff has always been quick and courteous, despite not always speaking English that well.  The food is the real draw.  It's fantastic!

My favorite is the Fish Masala.  Give it a shot!
