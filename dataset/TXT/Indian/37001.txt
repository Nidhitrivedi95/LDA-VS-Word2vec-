o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw My wife and I were not impressed with the food at Saffron. 

My wife had the the Chicken Tikka Masala. It didn't even taste like CTM normally would. It was bland and reminded me of what you would expect from a frozen dinner. The chicken had a weird consistency and felt like a hard boiled egg. 

 I had the Lamb Vindaloo. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. The lamb was tough. There wasn't any onions or peppers in it. 

The Garlic Naan was bland and tough. I don't know how you screw naan up. 

 The basmati rice was good but it was a small portion. 

There are so much better Indian food restaurants in the area. I suggest you go there. 

 On a side note my wife and I both had stomach problems for the next few days after eating there. I'm guessing it was the chicken.
