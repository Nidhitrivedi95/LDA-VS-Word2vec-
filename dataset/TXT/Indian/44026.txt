RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I used to love this place but lately I have been very disappointed! The last few times I got take-out and it was terrible! I ordered a butter chicken and a chicken tikka. Not only did they not label which one was which, they tasted exactly the same. (Chicken tikka is supposed to be spicier.)  Also, in both dishes, there are only 3-4 tiny little chunks of chicken swimming in a pool of such! Is say probably a quarter of a chicken breast! For $15 bucks each I'd expect way more. There are so many other choices in that area, I will not be returning.
