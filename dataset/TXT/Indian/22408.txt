I was visiting with family and all they eat is Indian so we had to come here daily. We ordered the veg thali both times and it came out okay with 1 naan, rice, 3 veg dishes (paneer, daal, chole). Chole bathure also were decent. It's a self serve joint in the mall so I didn't have much expectations to begin with. Overall, if you are on the LV strip craving Indian...go here.
