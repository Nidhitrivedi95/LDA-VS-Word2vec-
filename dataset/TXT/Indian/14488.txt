C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA My wife took me here for brunch on a Saturday around 11.

The 'brunch' menu is really small. Just some of their usual offerings + French toast from what I remember.

-DÉCOR-
Kalendar is in my top 5 nicest restaurants in Toronto that don't break the bank. Rich wood everything with such a nice European/French flair. Prepare to be amazed (the patio in the summer is the best on College St.). And that clock out front is iconic. Definitely a place to bring someone you want to impress.

-FOOD-
We came for brunch and we both had the French toast. The French toast were pretty good; average. Portion size was very large. 
The fruit compote was just frozen bagged berries. The home fry potatoes were undercooked (yuck). I wouldn't bother having this menu item again. 
Other peoples food looked really good so I'll have to come back for dinner.

-SERVICE-
Unfriendly & indifferent. The maître d, who was also our waiter didn't crack a smile or really say anything other than "how many people? What would you like to eat & another cup of coffee?".
First cup of coffee was cold, the second cup was lukewarm. Soy milk was brought out for me in a dispensing cup which was great.
All the waitstaff looked like they were nursing hangovers or were genuinely not morning/afternoon people. I wasn't impressed with the service.

-SUMMARY-
Great décor, okay food, lousy service. I was impressed by the décor but that was it. I'll have to come back for dinner to see what the evening fare and service is like. A future review is forth coming.
