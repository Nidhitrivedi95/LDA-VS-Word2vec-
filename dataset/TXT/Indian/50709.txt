UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I came to eat here yesterday to satisfy my s/o's butter chicken craving, and it did just that. 

Once seated, we were given some fried tortilla-like thing to munch on. Sorry, I don't know the name but it was delish regardless. My s/o ordered butter chicken, and I should have done the same but I figure i would go for something different. I opted for the tikka masala. We also ordered one plain naan and an order of saffron rice. 

The food came out pretty quickly. Let's just say - the butter chicken was immensely better than the tikka masala. 

This place, although the food is good and the service is subpar, the decor is a bit off. I hated the buzzers we press to call the server over - I felt that was a bit degrading :( 

After leaving, I went to class and the food coma sleepiness hit me hard. I could not stay awake for the life of me and had to leave early to go home asap. True story! 

Will be back to try some more food items!
