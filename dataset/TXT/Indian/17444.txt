DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ I'm seriously in love with this place. 

Pros: 
-amazingly kind staff. I have never felt so taken care of. I felt like they actually cared I was there!
-amazing food. Got the salmon tikka masala. So rich but excellent flavor. The salmon was so tender it was falling apart in big juicy chunks. 

Cons: 
-not a place to have a private conversation. I could hear both of the tables next to us pretty clearly. Maybe they could turn up the ambiance music a little bit? But this in no way hampers their review. 

Go, and thank me later.
