tsUFlp2DQw7Nk2I9mRL2hg I've been here more than a few times and the chili chicken and chili beef lunch specials are perfect. The hot and sour soup is unlike anything else I've ever tried and the dipping sauce for the pakora chicken/fish is brilliant. I'd eat here every day if I thought my stomach could handle it. Absolutely recommend.
