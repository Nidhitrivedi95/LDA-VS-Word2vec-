U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg This is one of the best eats in the hood. We continue get the Shahi Paneer wrap when dinner isn't planned out. But as vegetarians and paying premium for Paneer... Why do you substitute POTATOES for PANEER??? It's like putting in chicken instead of lamb. I pay for paneer. I expect paneer. Not filler...
