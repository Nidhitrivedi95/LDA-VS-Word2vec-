iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw What a lovely dining experience!  The restaurant interior is very attractive.  It's simple and clean and looks like it has been recently remodeled.  The food is excellent.  The savory samosas appetizer was very good.  My lamb korma was delicious, and I wish that the portion size had been slightly larger.  One of my dinner companions ordered an off-menu side dish that he knew they would be able to put together, and it was no problem at all.  The service was great and the overall experience was fabulous.
