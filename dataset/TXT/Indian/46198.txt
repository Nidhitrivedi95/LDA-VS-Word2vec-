sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Like the other reviewers, my last meal on earth would be the butter-chicken roti.

Be warned, the spice levels are NOT dumbed-down to Toronto levels.  The HOT while delicious left me struggling to continue eating because my lips/tongue/mouth were zinging.  Even the medium can be pretty punishing depending on the mood of the kitchen that day.  Mild or medium-mild are my recommendation for the un-initiated.

Warning: if you like shiny, new, clean looking places, you won't like the looks of this place.  It's well used, perhaps to the extent of being "beaten-up" looking.

That aside, the fantastic roti make up for any sense of evil you might get from the lack of decor.

What's bad about this place?  They don't have to be open 11am to 3am because they do enough business from 11am to 6pm and they are CLOSED on weekends!!!

Also since it's a take-away place you will only find 2 tables with limited chairs.

Ghandi's is absolutely freakin' fantastic.
