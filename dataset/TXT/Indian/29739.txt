jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg I have been out of town for a couple of years and remembered this place quite fondly as my wife and I enjoy eating Indian food on a regular basis.  Regardless, food was only ok, chicken biryani rice was too wet and had large chunks of tomato, onion and green peppers in it - not my preference.  The tiki masala was good, just not delicious as it usually is.  The naan was delightful.  The mango masala was more tart than usual.  Would go here again but will try other restaurants first to see if we can find an Indian restaurant that meets our preferences!
