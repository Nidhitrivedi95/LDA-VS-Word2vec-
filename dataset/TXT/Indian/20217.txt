fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA I went here with some friends for their all-day buffet. This place's buffet actually has a lot of choices. They had a fair amount of meat options, along with many veggie ones. They also had a number of options for dessert, such as kulfi (in a number of flavours), ras malai, carrot halwa and gulab jamun. The only downfall was that most of the food was mediocre. In fact all the curry sauces were too thin, and nothing including the naan was that great. However, for the price, the food was acceptable.

Also, they had some flat screen televisions on the walls that were playing music videos from popular new Bollywood movies, which was quite neat.

The staff seemed a little overworked, so the service suffered throughout the meal. However, with the exception of some of the forks, the place was very clean.

A big bonus for me was the fact that this place has a bakery inside of it, which is full of Indian sweets for sale. Furthermore, all the sweets for sale in their bakery are quite delicious. 

Overall, this place is okay.
