Jq60uSolPAPJKXulKzyP4Q This location is in a small plaza with very tight parking so you don't really know what to expect at first glance. However, this has been one of those little gems that have been around for a long time with consistently good food which is always delicious.
Although we have been coming here for what seems like forever, today we finally we went to eat lunch and ordered the thali and channa bhatura. I have to say the portions were plentiful, the food was fresh, and it was exactly how I remembered it. The location itself is the small Brars but if you come at the right time you can avoid the crowded tables and lineups. Brar is known for its malai kofta but in my thali we ordered the Palak paneer, shahi paneer and chili paneer with gulab Jamun. Overall, I was just as satisfied as I usually am and will definitely be back here soon!
