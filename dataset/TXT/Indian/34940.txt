Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Dinner prices are very reasonable.  It's surprising how busy it can be considering the location way back in a plaza with nothing else there.  They offer a multisampler dinner which gives you small portions of 4 or 5 things.  I got the buddah's delight which included a few vegetarian dishes and also included rice and naan for $21 but I didn't like everything that was offered.  I would rather just have one large portion of a dish I really liked for $13 instead.  The saag paneer was incredible.  It's amazing how every restaurant does it differently.  This was more pureed than others.  

I looked at their selection for the lunch buffet and it still looks great.  Look forward to checking it out again.
