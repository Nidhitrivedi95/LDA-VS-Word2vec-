xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw This small Indian storefront take-out restaurant is a really great find, and among the most delicious, flavorful Indian cuisine I've ever had! The restaurant is geared toward take-out/carry out, although there are some booths and the owner welcomed us to sit and eat our ordered dinner. I was with two other people and we ordered butter chicken and chicken korma. Both dishes were full of flavor and very obviously freshly prepared. The owner was very friendly and explained how the food would be freshly prepared, and as we were concluding our meal, shared how he and his wife started the restaurant - originally out of their own home!!! What a wonderful dining experience, and when we are back in town we will be sure to visit again!
