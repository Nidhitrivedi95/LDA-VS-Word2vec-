HkhmrEG8I3crc7pVVblyQw Sree's, an Indian eatery, is one of the best things Pittsburgh offers. I am sure that due to their locations and hours that many people living in the city have not experienced their food, but it is a definite must.

I would add it too my list of places to go before you leave Pittsburgh. The menu is limited and by limited, I mean that they pretty much server the same thing every day. The main entrees are always the same. You can choose from either Tamarind chicken or vegetables and tofu.

I am not a huge tofu eater, but it is ok. The tamarind chicken is excellent.

As for the other sides, you can typically choose from:
1. Chickpeas and potatoes 
2. Spinach and potato 
3. Tomato dal
4. Grape leaves and curry
5. Spinach dal

I can highly recommend just about anything. I have been known to eat their food several times a week and I will often bring it home for my family. You get more than enough food for only $5.50

A must visit for a unique side of Pittsburgh.
