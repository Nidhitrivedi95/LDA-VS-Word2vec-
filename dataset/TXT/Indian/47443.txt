TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We ventured into this neighborhood trying to get some neat food on a cold night. Since it was our first night in vegas and we dint know this side of the city very well we ended up coming in the wrong side out from our hotel and i must say the route was super scary to walk by. I barely thought of how could any restaurant be tucked in this neighbourhood. Once we went in we were seated and we ordered malai kofta ( very enriching taste) and korma with naan. The food was overall very good. The service was not exactly great or worth mentioning but the power of food overpowered the service and hence the solid four stars.
