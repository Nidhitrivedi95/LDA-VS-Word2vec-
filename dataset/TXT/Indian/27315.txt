ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w Flew in to visit family in the greater Toronto area and nostalgia for Indo-Chinese food got the better of us.....

Service was slow - we got our drinks immediately after we got there but it took them a full 20 minutes to come back to get our food order (and this after two treks to the counter) and another 35 minutes thereafter for the food to show up. There was a party of six that left in a huff after having waited 50 minutes with nothing to show for it, so tardiness seemed to be a bit of a recurring theme. 

We had the Chicken Manchurian, Chili Chicken and the Sweet and Sour chicken - decent sized portions  but oddly enough none of the entrees came with rice....Which I found rather incongruous for a Chinese restaurant.

Overall, I'd rate the food a solid 8 out of 10, but the poor service and desultory attitude of the owners/waitstaff pretty much rendered the whole experience intolerable.
