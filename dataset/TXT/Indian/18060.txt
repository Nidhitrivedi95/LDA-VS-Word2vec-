ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ This is a great little BYOB spot in Garfield. I've never made it there for the lunch buffet, but I've dinner a few times and it's always been great. I've had a few Biryani dishes as well as Chicken Tikka Masala and it's all been delicious. It's a great place to go with friends so everyone can share and try a little bit of everything. Friendly service, delicious food, worth checking out!
