yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Punjabi cuisine. I won't consider myself very knowledgeable with Indian food. I won't be able to tell the difference from cuisines from different parts of India, but I can tell the difference between really good and flavorful Indian food.

THE PLACE: Located in a small plaza with small shops, including an Indian market. It smells marvelous in the market. They sell all kinds of spices, a lot of english products (no surprise), even some frozen, heat and eat indian dishes. Don't forget to pick up some home mades sweets too. Place provides ample parking for all the businesses in the plaza. The restaurant itself, is not that big, but it is comfortable. Always clean.

THE SERVICE: Friendly and helpful. Not certain what to get? What goes together well? Don't hesitate to ask. Granted I make it a point to avoid busy hours, my experience has always been excellent. Always attentive. I'm not a soda drinker so I really appreciate an establishment that makes sure I have all the aqua I need in my cup.

THE FOOD: Vegan, vegetarian, omnivore or carnivore, you are welcome here. Everything is so flavorful. Don't ever skip on the Naan or Roti's, they are so good. Of course, it is best when consumed with the fabulous dishes such as Paneer Tikka Masala (I can bathe in the sauce --- so good!). Shehenshahi Palak Kofta is another good one. My kids and hubby enjoy the lamb dishes too. Oh, and the saffron basmati rice, smells so good and just compliments every dish. Hungry yet? I am.

A definite winner and favorite.
