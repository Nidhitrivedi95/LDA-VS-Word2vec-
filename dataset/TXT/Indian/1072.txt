-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw Been here a few times. The service isn't the best (usually only 1 or 2 employees constantly on the phone or running around), but we've always taken it to go. It's usually about 25-40 mins depending on how busy they are.

We've had the chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, masala dosa, garlic naan, and others. The naan can be hit or miss; tonight it was rather dry and crispy. The various sauces that come with the dosa are about average.

I've never had an issue with missing items in my to go order, but I was double check the bag for any take-out order.

I'll continue to go back, as they provide great value for the food/price points. If you don't want to drive to Scottsdale or up to Pinnacle Peak and pay 2x as much, then I recommend this place!
