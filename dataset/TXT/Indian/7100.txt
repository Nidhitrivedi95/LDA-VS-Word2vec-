4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q I was here last Tuesday (Sept 1st, 2015). I was recommended by this place by a friend however, he told me to go to the Brampton location. I decided to just go to the Mississauga one since it's a lot closer to where I live. BIG MISTAKE!

I was super excited and started 'snapchatting' the food, a man named RAHUL (the host) came up to us and told us not to take pictures of the food. My friend then explained it was just for snapchat and it deletes the next day. He looked at us and said "umm....I don't care.."

Okay rude.
People take pictures of their food all the time and put it on instagram, facebook, snapchat etc. I've never heard of a restaurant that didn't allow pictures of their food. Strange!

Anyways, the food was pretty bland and wasn't hot. Everything that was "supposed" to be fresh, was room temperature warm. Gross..

I should've read the reviews before going to this location. Do not go here...staff is rude, food is bland/stale and it's pricey!
