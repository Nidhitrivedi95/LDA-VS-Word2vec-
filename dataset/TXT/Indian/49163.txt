tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This was the best place to bring my parents for my birthday dinner!!! Everything was spiced spot on!!! Delicious!!!! Now my dad had a problem with the spices but enjoyed his Arnold Palmer drink, I ordered mom tandoori chicken which she tried n liked, I got to take ALL her leftovers home!!!! Seemed a bit pricey for dinner but OHHH SOOOO GOOOD for the person who enjoys great india food!!! Go here!!! I will try for lunch some day... Excellent 5 thumbs up.... I mean stars!!!
