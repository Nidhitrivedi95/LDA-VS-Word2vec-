UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w While the snacks and food may be good, the customer service is not. A little boy went to get plates for his family, when one of the head cooks in the kitchen came out and yelled at him and the family for taking additional plates. The amount of professionalism was lacking and I would have liked to see this situation handled better.
