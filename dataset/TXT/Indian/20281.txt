fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA India's Taste is my favourite AYCE Indian buffet restaurant. The food is consistently good and the cost (13.99 for lunch) is very reasonable. The service is also very good, with servers constantly refilling water glasses and offering freshly made naan.

I still don't know the names of all the dishes, even though they are labeled but I know what I like when I see it. They offer a lot of vegetarian dishes, chicken, goat, salad, fruits, and ice cream. All good.

I particularly enjoy the chickpeas (chana masala?), paneer (cheese) tikka masala, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, goat curry, and the naan. Everything else is good too but I can only eat so much. I always leave feeling uncomfortably stuffed and very satisfied!
