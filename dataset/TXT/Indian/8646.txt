I had khums matar paneer and it was the first time I ever had mushrooms in Indian food. The dish was flavorful and a decent-sized portion; no complaints, I'd definitely order it again. My companions had chicken tikka masala and lamb korma, and enjoyed both. However, the food took very long to prepare. We waited over 30 min and the restaurant was quite empty at the time. Maybe this is why the food was so good and fresh, but in general I thought it took too long.
