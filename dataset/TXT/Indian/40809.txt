PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g We were going to head out to our fav for lunch at weston/st. clair  Ville Verde for Portuguese but construction is so over the top heading from east to west that we needed to think of where to get the heat of Piri Piri in the east end.  We decided on Indian, and since many of the resto on Gerrard are closed for lunch or offer buffet.  My designated Friday lunch gal from time to time decided the sit down lunch in Leaside/Davisville Village look good.  

No disappointing lunch offered.  The place was very sparse on patrons but the service was excellent.  It is white table cloth service for lunch and the menu offers $10-$12 portions of chef made indian.

The order:

Chicken Vindaloo $10.95
Aloo Gobi $10.95
Chicken Tikka Masala $10.95
3 orders of Tandori Naan (charged $2.25  xtra for one order)
Raita  $2.25
champange cocktail $10
one domestic beer $6

$73 (included tax and tip)

The vindaloo  was spicy like it should be but not over the top,  chunks of chicken w/basmati and a wonderful mango chutney & a veggie samosa.  The rice and chutney accompany all lunch specials.  Plus an order of naan.

The aloo gobi was not greasy sometimes you get that sitting in a bed of oil.  The Tikka was dry to the chicken but not dry in flavour.

The raita was a bit runny, but did the trick for the bite of Vindaloo.  

Perfect Indian lunch, we had a little more then we should but it was a girlfriend friday lunch with cocktail.  Quick lunch for 2 could easily be $15 each.

Only complaint, the server suggested that we didn't get the lunch aloo gobi because it included rice and such.  but we ordered more naan and if we got the lunch one that would have been included so we paid $2.25 more than we needed.  Not a big deal but worth noting.  Pictures uploaded of dishes.  Will be back.
