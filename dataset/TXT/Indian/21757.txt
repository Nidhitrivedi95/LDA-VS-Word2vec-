gJliACNKY4rK30BTMIzwsQ I can't believe I like Indian curry so much - NOW!
Was I glad I went and met my fellow Yelpers at this tucked away place on St Leonard Street. The outside is painted lilac and you might think what is this all about, but it all fits the style they project. I guess its not a typical Indian restaurant you might visit from time to time, but rather something different. I found it very relaxing, clean, customer friendly, attentive, reasonable priced and somehow it reminds me of WINGS, the chicken wings extravaganza in old town.

Its BYOB! Bring your own beer or wine!

I ordered the medium version of Jahore curry sauce with lamb and Garlic and Coriander Nan bread. The lamb was soft and tender. The tomato sauce savory and a bit spicey. Am I glad I went for medium heat as the hot versions will make you twitch :-). One of my Yelper friends spit fire towards the end of the meal. The other was glad to have gotten a spare beer to mellow the burning sensation.

The menu choices are amazing and you can choose between mild, medium, sweet and sour and hot curry sauces. And if I say hot, its really HOT, but not as hot as the Killer Curry!!!!!!! Yep you heard right. Don't forget to read the small print! 
Other curries that stood out: mild chocolate curry and Iron Bru curry or try Mama's and Papas special curry on bones. Also try Nutella or Haggis or Marshmallow or chocolate nan bread :-)

The personel was really friendly and very, very attentive. The interior is classy and trendy.

Don't miss out on a fantastic curry experience!
