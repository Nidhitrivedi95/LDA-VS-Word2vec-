Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ Worst place and worst people. We were driving from Chicago to Maryland and stopped by at this place. This is the worst thing we had done In our trip. We went for Saturday buffet and there were no one at the restaurant. We served food and seated. We did not like the food. But then we thought we should eat because we came. Chole was bad. There was bad smell coming out of it. My husband went and asked how could they serve bad rotten food. That Gujarati lady at the counter started yelling saying yes it is bad if you want to eat then eat you can leave if you want. Don't make a scene here. I was shocked to hear that. We just paid the bill and left that place. I still repent of paying our valuable 20 bucks for such food and her words. If she is reading this review I want to tell her that she will learn the lesson surely at some point of her life. Bloody bitch
