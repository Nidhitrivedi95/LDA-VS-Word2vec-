82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA My first trip to Montreal, looking for good Indian food, so here it goes:

This place looks good inside, I think it is expensive but the food was good.

We ordered:
a) Chicken Vindaloo - Excellent and the chicken was really good, it was not some kind of processed chicken.
 - I will give this an 8/10

b) Lamb curry - Really nice, I give it a 7/10.

c) Plain Nan - I haven't had this good in a big while. This deserves a 9/10 baby!
             - In Concord, NH, in early 90's there was an Indian restaurant who made some real good nan, but that guy moved someplace.

d) Chicken Tikka Massala - Massala (gravy) was good but the chicken was processed chicken, not tasty at all, my recommendation don't buy it.

On the whole, food was good and therefore made one more visit before leaving back for USA.

Note: Chicken Tikka Massala is so common in USA and I can't understand why people don't see the difference between processed chicken and real chicken!
