GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA What an amazing place! Our first time having Pakistani food so we didn't know what to order, but we were lucky and met Shawn who gave us a quick explanation of everything and even gave us an excellent recommendations on the food. My husband got the Goat/Lamb  Punjabi Handi (Goat stew) and I got the chicken Tikka masala; both were DELICIOUS. They were served with rice and Naan,  yummy yummy!

Service is great and fast.
Prices are more than fair.
If you like to try new food and spices, this is your place, be adventurous. Don't miss it!
