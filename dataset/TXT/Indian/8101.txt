7d2LqDc0Cb5dcizil_h34A Surprised by the reviews on here - I had a very positive experience with a group of friends at Karma's Kitchen. 

1) The hot sauce with the momo's is excellent - I would by this by the bottle if they sold it!
2) Very friendly chef, who was very kind and welcoming and took the time to answer the many question one of my dinner mates had!
3) The vegetarian thali is delicious - packed full of flavour!

This place is a no-frills type of joint - yes, the service isn't the fastest - however, it is excellent value and for lack of a better words, has a lot of 'heart'.
