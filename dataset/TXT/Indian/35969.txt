nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ We go here all the time. Great for takeout. They change the TV diner thali container often so unfortunately portion sizes can be unpredictable. Delicious flavours and good selection.  Staff is helpful and friendly, some challenges with accent  are over come by being patient and asking again. The mango lassi drink is a nice complement to a take out dinner to cool down the spices. Both meat and veg options, and both are good. Huge dessert takeout section if you like those sweets.
