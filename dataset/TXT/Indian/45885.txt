siFCEoRRDSmLN0RCvdV74w I can't believe I'd never eaten there in the seven years that I've lived in the neighbourhood. Although the restaurant looks shabby inside and out with zero decor and ambience, the service was friendly and speedy, and the food (we had take-out) was flavourful and absolutely delicious. I will NEVER go to Swiss Chalet again for take-out, lol. So glad we discovered it. What a gem.
