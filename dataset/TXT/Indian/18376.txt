Also, I've gone at different times of day and yet every time I go, the food is always luke-warm/ cold. They also ALWAYS run out of naan which I'm left waiting for. It's somewhat satisfying to eat in the moment and great for any vegetarian person as I mentioned there's a wide selection. However, the quality of food is mediocre at best and the buffet price shouldn't be as high as it is especially for vegetarian food.
