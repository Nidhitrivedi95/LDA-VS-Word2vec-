arDp3i7B_ULDsbZcYk_57A Finally an Indian restaurant that listens to requests to make it Indian hot. Ordered the Massala Potatoes, Beef Vindaloo and Yellow Dhall.  The flavours were distinct and even though delivery was rapid it did not taste like a lot of other Indian delivery: same curry sauce with boiled meat dropped in it.

Came with roti which was delish and still warm. Went beautifully with the spuds and beef. Had enough left over for 2 meals and the rice was very generous and well cooked and I still am going though the first container.

WIll definitely be ordering from here again.
