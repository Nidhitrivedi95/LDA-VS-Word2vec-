tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g I've been to this place many times and have always walked out satisfied. The buffet on saturdays is very good. One night, they had no servers or cooks apparently so the owners were running the whole show. They were over apologetic and I'm pretty sure the paneer paratha was pulled out of the frier. That is the only bad experience at Cuisine of India. I always get the same dish (lamb vindaloo) and it is always to die for. Their chutneys are very good too. One of my favorite Indian restaurants.
