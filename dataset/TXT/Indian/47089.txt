Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I've been wanting to go here for years and finally made it! Indian Delight did not disappoint. The interior decor was surprisingly more sparse than I'd assumed it would be, but what they lack in presentation they make up for in flavor! 

The style of cuisine was different than other Indian food I've had but it was wonderful and different enough to be fresh and new. The sonic red chicken tikka masala was the standout hit, full of bright and complex soothing flavor, the sauce was one of the best I've tasted. The Vindaloo and Karihi(sp?) were also on point, with the later being a hearty, savory and zesty option that was perfect for fall. We went medium spicey all the way around and it was a perfect flavorful kick without burning too much. 

The mulligatawny soup was one of my favorites, a wild blend of curry and spices that was tasty and fun to eat! 

And the naan was about the most proper serving of naan I've had, big crispy, flakey, and perfectly soft and chewy halves that rounded out the meal perfectly. We also enjoyed the veggie samosas and chutneys as an appetizer. 

My lone complaint. I wasn't terribly impressed with the quality of the chicken, I couldn't tell if it was a bit overdone or just not a great grade. But I ate it and enjoyed it nonetheless. 

The service was warm, friendly and welcoming, and sauces were the standout hit. I'll definitely hit up Indian Delight again on my next trip to CLE.
