5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA I am not a big review on yelp (yet!) but I had to review this place. This is some of the best and most authentic home cooked food you will find in OH (perhaps in the US even!) if you go, get their beef kebabs and their biryani, it's absolutely delicious! the owner rightly describes his kebabs as 'if you don't like these kebabs then you don't like kebabs!' He was right!

Their naans are made from scratch, their vegetarian dishes are to die for (this coming from me a complete non veg person!). The vegetarians at our table made sure to pack some food, one of them was traveling from New York and guess what, he took the food bag to the big apple! 

The food takes a little while to prepare during lunch especially if there is a big order, we usually order ahead and then go in and everything is ready. 

If you happen to be in and around the West Chester area, you cannot miss this place!
