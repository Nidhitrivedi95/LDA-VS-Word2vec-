MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ That really good Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area has eluded us - we've tried at least 10 that were supposed to be "it". So this time no one recommended Al Hamra - it's just been on my way home for as along as it's been open. It was worth stopping - very good lamb vindaloo (spice level 7 - packing some heat) and a variety of other dishes that we tried. My wife liked the samosa but I was thinking 'so so'. All in all the chef has a fine touch and the food is very solid and well above average, although a bit pricey (as you might expect for the location). Most of the recommendations by others seem spot on. Recommended.
