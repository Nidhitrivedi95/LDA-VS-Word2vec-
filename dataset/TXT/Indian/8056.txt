7bKDFnTkYzlYEfU7hJ9UtA Horrible food. good quantity though.

we catered from Desi Corner as Shaheen catering was fully booked for Eid catering orders.  we had 45 guests over and not a single person praised about their food.

2 aunties working in the kitchen need to buy new clothes (with all respect).
