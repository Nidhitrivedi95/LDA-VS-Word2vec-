gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Some of the best Indian food I've had, including in India. The spices were fantastic. Each dish we had was absolutely wonderful: chicken Vindaloo, Aloo Goni, Dal, Nan, rice pudding and rice. And the menu's offerings are impressive. Plus very warm service. If you like Indian food I recommend you try it! And I look forward to returning this restaurant in my next trip to Vegas. Only wish I lived closer to it.
