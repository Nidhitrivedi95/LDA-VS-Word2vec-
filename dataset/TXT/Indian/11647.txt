ajMgo23H5Qcn7Ma-xtiCqQ I honestly don't know what "SP M" is on about.  

What I do know is that last Friday night, a party of five devoured as much of HPSH's food as we could possibly stuff into our bodies.  Butter chicken was heaven, the eggplant dish was divine, the mango lassi got passed around to everyone, and the pickled sides were of another planet.

The food was so good and reasonably priced, we tipped the waitress $60.   THE best Indian food I've had in Toronto.
