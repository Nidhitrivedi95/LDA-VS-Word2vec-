hDaookbWWFR3bEm-1_orrw We've been twice for the buffet. We are happy to report that Sutra has one of the tastiest and most diverse Indian buffets in town. Favorites include Chicken Tikka Masala and Vegetable Pakoras. Diners are given a choice of plain or garlic naan. It's not all raves and applause - The bismati rice was a bit over or undercooked (crunchy) on my last visit, and on both occasions the owner's long-winded chit-chat actually kept us from enjoying our lunch while it was still piping hot. Still, as far as Indian restuarants in the valley go, this one is tops. We hope Sutra, opened in April 2009, will be a fixture in Goodyear. We don't want to go back to driving to Glendale or Tempe to find decent (or meh) Indian cusine!
