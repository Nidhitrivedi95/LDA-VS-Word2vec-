kRAZ3PzNA8O_VrBI52FLKQ I'm not ashamed to admit that I could probably eat here multiple times a week (and actually have...)

I've had catered meals (butter chicken - mmmM!) from Tanjore for office/work parties and have individually ordered the thalis many, many times. The thalis are great value for your money. Both the veggie and meat options are solid. You get a fair selection of items (rice with either three vegetable dishes, or rice with one meat and two vegetables. Both come with a large, fresh-outta-the-oven naan as well as a little mixed salad/pickle mix) I always get the rice with curry chicken and either lentils and mixed veg, or saag paneer. The only downside is Rakesh (the friendly owner) doesn't always have the saag which is my fave veggie dish :-(

Like others have mentioned, this isn't really sit-down friendly (just one little spot in the corner), so I always walk-in, and grab my thali to go. He takes debit/credit/cash, which is great for people like me who run on plastic.

The wait for food isn't usually very long, but if you do have to wait a bit, I suggest placing your order and then waiting around outside so you don't end up smelling too heavily of Indian food. It is a very small restaurant, so I find it gets a little stuffy inside.

This is totally a little family run place with great meal options, particularly for students and people wanting a full tummy on a thin wallet. I love that Rakesh remembers you once you've gone a few times and has always been consistent with both the quality and the amount of food you get.
