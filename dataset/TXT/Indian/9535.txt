8PZGCtgG5MZKvz9i3B9gCA Delicious BBQ chicken wrap and also delicious coconut cream noodles with an egg on top! Probably the best little meal we've had under $20. 
Called the order in for pickup on a 15min estimate, and it was kept quite hot all the way home. 
They were sold out of the butter chicken wrap so we'll be back. :)
