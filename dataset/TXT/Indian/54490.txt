W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg Big fan of Minerva. Excellent food, staff, and well worth the trip. Recently moved to the Madison area from the west coast and can't get enough Minerva. Have been there twice and left fat and happy both times. My wife had the butter chicken, both times, and I have tried whatever the owner tells me I'm having. And he hasn't let me down yet. I get a 7 for spicy and it's just right. Next time a 8, my wife gets a 5 and says just right. But I like a spicy, "employee only spicy" and Minerva delivers!
