ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w Love this place!! I live nearby and have been waiting for a great Hakka restaurant. This place is very clean, friendly staff, and the food quality is top notch. Everything we ordered was clearly made from scratch with no compromise on quality. They're new to the neighborhood and will hopefully also introduce a delivery service soon.
