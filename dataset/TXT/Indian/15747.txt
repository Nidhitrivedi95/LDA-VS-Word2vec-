CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ Went for lunch buffet today recommended by a friend.  Small place but all the dishes were full of authentic flavor. Even my husband who just started exploring South Asian food could tell the quality of food is amazing and very fresh. Naan was yummy and fluffy. Loved Rasmalai and Kheer as dessert! Service was excellent. A staff offered us if we need some help assuming that we might be new to their dishes. Definitely one of our best Indian restaurant list in Mississauga. Can not wait to bring my family and friends there to impress them.
