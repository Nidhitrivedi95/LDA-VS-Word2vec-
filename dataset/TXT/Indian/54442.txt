W_45hJzm592FMZZLeIzpoQ This place smells of dirty damp carpets. The staff were continually watching every move especially when we went near the food which turned out to be of poor quality. Choice was limited and the amount on display was pathetic. Would not recommend ANYONE to eat there,  I enjoy Indian food very much but this place is a total rip off, would rather go hungry than suffer this awful place ever again
