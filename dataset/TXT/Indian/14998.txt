cJLx99fsYPM0SlNfWLb4Ug Went for dinner last night.  It had been awhile since I'd ventured over to Taste of India, and I believe the last couple of times I had the lunch buffet.   Dinner was thoroughly great. Their chutneys are fresh (seem to be housemade) and flavorful.  

I had the lamb madras- chunks of lamb in a rich sauce redolent of ginger, curry and coconut.  It was really tasty.  The lamb was a bit tougher than I expected, but still good.  I appreciated the server's suggestion that I order it a notch spicier than usual, as otherwise the sweetness of tamarind overwhelms the other flavors.  We split the spinach naan- very plentiful basket for $2.95.  My boyfriend has a standard order nearly every time we eat Indian food; he loves the Tandoori mixed grill.  Although Taste of India serves theirs with raita, and not masala curry sauce as other establishments in Madison do, he proclaimed theirs the best he's had in Madison.  A steaming mound of tandoori chicken, fish, shrimp, and seekh kabob atop surprisingly flavorful red/green bell peppers and onions- even with a little help from me, we took over half of it home.  At $15.95, that's a steal.  The fish was something one doesn't see nearly enough of on the tandoori mixed grill, and it was a standout.  Well worth the trek from east side to west, right down to clean and festive decor and little touches like silver chutney spoons and antique tureens containing my curry.  mmmm.
