TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw India Palace hit the spot right on the head. We had the Chicken Vindaloo, garlic naan, and Lamb Tikka Massala. They'll ask you for the spiciness level and on scale of 1-10, we got a 9 and it really wasn't that bad. Add on the house sauces and we were stuffed and satiated. The only problem here was using the Yelp deal ($15 for $30) -- perhaps it came at a point of confusion for the manager and waiters but it took a little bit for the deal to be honored. In the end, it was all fine. Just be careful to have your voucher information and yelp deal marked as redeemed to show them as proof.
