GaymsFE7jVr9PtLwYRYiAA This is the best Indian food I have ever eaten! The staff is wonderfully polite and attentive. I went the first night I was in Edinburgh and went back 4 nights later and the waiter remembered what I had ordered. I don't eat dairy and he remembered what I had asked them to make special for me. I highly recommend them.
