OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Tried only vegetarian dishes from buffet.  The food is really bad. Main ingredients are onion, corn, carrots, and Indian spices of cause. Nothing tastes good. No paneer dishes. Music is very annoying, night club tracks on shitty speakers very loud in the middle of the day. Masala chai is not good either. Indians next to me complained about meat dishes as well.
