ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA The food is delicious! The price for the buffet is great! I go once a week. I'm only giving it four stars because the restaurant is small and when its crowded, I feel like they rush you out the door. Plus when I order a water, I feel that the waitstaff becomes rude to me. I never drink soda. It's not that I'm trying to be cheap.
