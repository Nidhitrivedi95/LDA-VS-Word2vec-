SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ This is a go-to spot for some of my co-workers and me when we just want to get STUPID full on naan and curry.  It's not a high-end Indian restaurant, however, it's inexpensive, fast, the food is tasty, and the staff is efficient and friendly.  Every time I come here, it's packed by 12:30 and there's a mad run on naan.  Get at it.
