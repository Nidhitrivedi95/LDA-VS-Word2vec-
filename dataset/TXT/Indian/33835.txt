LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng Excellent. We had goat madras and the second starter on the menu which is crispy rice and dots of mustard for the sauce and maybe cardamon in it and wonderful. The Maharaja beer was great. Service excellent, friendly. It was pretty warm, so I'm hoping the ac is working better next time I go, which will be soon.
