pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I took my mother there to turn her on to Indian food. It didn't work out well. Okay, the restaurant was under construction when we went there, so I'll assume that they are not at their best. Also, we arrived during the buffet (I, personally, hate buffets of any cuisine). Still, we gave it a shot.

The parking lot... REEKED of rotting garbage. Arriving and departing were both very unpleasant. The place is in progress, but it has a loud, cafeteria ambiance. I'd call it a dive, if it weren't for the unpleasant, bright, florescent lighting. Greeting was friendly, and we were seated quickly, but the table we were put at still had chunks of food over the tablecloth from a previous party. The buffet was illogically set up, so diners were dodging in and out of each other to get to food they wanted. The food was lukewarm or cold in parts, as if microwaved. Beyond that, it was just bland, bland, bland. The tray of nan stayed empty for most of the time that we were there. 

We paid on the way out instead of the way in. It would have been very easy to skip on the check entirely, despite a man sitting by the buffet, like a vulture. 

My mother won't be visiting again. I may try again some time in the future, but more likely, I'll go somewhere else.
