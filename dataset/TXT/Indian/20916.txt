gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw The food is pretty good - I would have given more stars if it hadn't been for the rude attitude of the waitresses.

I have been there more than once - and each time the waitresses have shown some unfriendly body language or made disapproving facial expressions even at the simplest of requests (like asking for a spoon). Also one time one waitress indirectly demanded a tip.
