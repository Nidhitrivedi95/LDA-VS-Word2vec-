_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg We went here on a whim with a hankering for authentic Indian food, hoping it'd be one of those hole in the wall gems--and boy did we get lucky! The restaurant is in the room behind the grocery part. I loved looking through the grocery at all the herbs and different kinds of rice! The restaurant food quality rivals the best of the best. We tried the lunch buffet, which was also a great price at 7.99/adult. Everything we tried was very good...and I had a little of everything! :) The reason this gets 4 stars is the dining area is a bit cramped and close to the buffet line, so you will say plenty of "excuse me's" whilst getting your food. Also, one thing that would make the food even better is to add more spices!!! I'm talking cardamom, fennel, more garlic--that sort of thing! Otherwise, impressive!
