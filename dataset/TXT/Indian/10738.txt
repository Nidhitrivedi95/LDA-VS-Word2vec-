A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA Good food, restaurant is very small , but that didn't really matter. I liked the food  and the service was ok. The reason for 3 stars is I truly felt like they were overpriced. I wasn't impressed with the menu prices , especially compared to other Indian restaurants. 
May possibly do a take out in the future but not really sure. 

Overall , the quality of the food was pretty good though
