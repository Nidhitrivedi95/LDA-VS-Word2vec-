sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ What is there to say about Gandhi Roti that hasn't been said before? I used to work at an office around the corner and every Wednesday was Gandhi Wednesday. We would spend all morning talking about what we were going to order. Always, always, always chose EXTRA spicy butter chicken, but it's not like you can go wrong with any of the other options. At noon we would place the order and usually wait about 20-30 minutes before sending someone down to pick up. In fact, our boss is in the BlogTO picture of Gandhi waiting for one of those very pickups. The wait at rush time can be gnarly, so ordering ahead is key.

And then we would feast. And oh, how we would feast. Finishing a whole Gandhi roti is a spiritual experience which leaves you in a kind of half-dream state wondering whether what just happened *actually* happened or whether it was all just a wonderful spicy dream. The rest of the afternoon would be spent talking about whether we had conquered the roti or whether the roti had conquered us. Usually it was the latter.

Despite the butter chicken coma, it was always worth it. An absolute must.
