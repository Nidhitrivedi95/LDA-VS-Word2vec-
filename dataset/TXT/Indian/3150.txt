The owner walked around and  was very personable while asking  patrons how things were.  The prices are decent and food is pretty good. Casual is just what it is due to having to self- buss your table which I believe saves us from higher menu prices. :)  Note for some: The soda fountain is limited and weirdly located in the back of the kitchen;however, they offer canned sodas and bottled water upfront. Will check out next time we are in the area, but will not make a special trip.
