8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ One of the best Indian restaurants I have been to.  Not the best on a dish per dish comparison, but just a pleasant mix of friendly and quick service, quality and quantity of food, at great prices.

We were a gang of about 10 people and ordered about 12 different dishes with a bunch of rice, naan, along with some appetizers, drinks and dessert, and the bill was only 25$ each including tip.
