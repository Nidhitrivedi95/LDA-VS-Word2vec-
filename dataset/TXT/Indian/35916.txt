Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg I travel to Toronto quite often for business, and when I'm in the mood for moderately-priced Indian food for lunch, this is my go-to place.  It can be quite crowded for lunch, so make sure you show up just at the right time - too early and the buffet isn't quite ready yet. Too late and... well you know how buffets will go near closing time. 

Is it really closed now? I haven't been back to Toronto in a few months.
