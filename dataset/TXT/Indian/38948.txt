OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Great food and service! We let our server, Moses, chose our dinner for the evening. He was very attentive and definitely picked items that he knew would satisfy our palates. We told him to pick whatever he wants and we like it spicy!  We ended up trying the lamb seekh for an appetizer which had just enough spice and the presentation of them was great. They game out in individual shot glasses with a yogurt dipping sauce on the bottom. Very delicious and got gamey at all. He also ordered fresh naan for us and I've had naan at other Indian restaurants and their naan was my favorite. Came out hot and just right! And our entree he chose the chicken tikka masala. It was very good. I can taste the tomatoes and the chicken was very tender. All that was left was the sauce but I insisted on getting a doggy bag for it because it was so good and I wanted to dip our left over naan in it. Overall a great experience!
