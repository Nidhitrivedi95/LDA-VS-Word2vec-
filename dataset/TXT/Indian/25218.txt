hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q We arrived at 1pm, for the lunch buffet special. There was no one managing the restaurant and there was very little food at the buffet. We called in the back for a waiter and went to grab the scraps left on the buffet. All of the food was incredibly dry and tasted very old, as if it had been sitting out for hours. After 20 or more minutes of waiting, no food had been added to the buffet. After numerous complaints over the next half hour, they finally brought out exactly 2 pieces of tandoori chicken, a small helping of butter masala and they didn't restock on anything else. I brought a family of 4, and paid $46 for our meal. I have never been to a buffet where there was nothing to eat.
