CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ DO NOT, I say DO NOT go to this place....In every aspect it is a bad place, we went there for breakfast at 10 am, it is advertised to be till 11 am and they said that we have only one item....no apologies, did not care, worst customer service.....there were only 4-5 other people there and they kept repeating that 'we have run out of everything', when we asked for the manager, they said we will call the chef, then after 10 mins came out and said 'chef is busy preparing lunch'. How pathetic, and this has happened before....Place also has no ambience and have to stand in line for the food. Last time we went there, don't it will last with this attitude...Food is OK, nothing to talk about. Plus portion sizes are way too small, it looks inexpensive but truly its not. They made us wait for ever for that one item....
