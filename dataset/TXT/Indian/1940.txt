-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ worst food in entire Brampton with worst service and rude staff.. the waiters are very harsh.... typical desi style... had a very bad experience twice... and when u say plz call your manager.. they just say.. "do whatever you can".
Try other restaurants in the are.. 100% better food and very friendly staff...
This is the worst restaurant i have ever tried in my entire life... too much oily and stale food served.. they think they have monopoly.. but not now.. will just say never step in at this place
