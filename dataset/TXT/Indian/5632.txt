3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg I have allergies and was phoning around to many different places to see who would be willing to leave them out of the food.. not even the expensive restaurants said they would be willing to. This was the only restaurant who said it wouldn't be a problem, which already made me very excited.
We had a group of 17, there was a bit of a wait since everything is prepared fresh..but so worth it!!! The food was amazing. I love indian food and know the difference between good and bad...This food was something else. I had baingan (eggplant), aloo gobi  (potato and cauliflower) and chana (chickpeas).. everyone else had a mix of veg and non - veg... everything tasted exceptional. My husband who doesnt like saag (spinach), loved the palak paneer and he also liked the butter chicken and the lamb biryani. 
I love that moment when you bite in to food and you get this whole rainbow of spices that leaves you in anticipation of what you are going to taste next. 
If you are not in a hurry, but want to try/eat truly good Indian food.. Please try this place out. It's not fancy or anything, but the quality of food is truly high. Svaadisht!
