yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg I have been coming here for over 10 yeas and love this place. Prete is the owner and does a great job running this place. We have never had a bad meal here, and when it comes to Indian restaurants there are plenty of terrible places in Phoenix to visit. This however is not one of them. I have eaten Indian food all over the world; Germany, London, New York.... and this ranks at as one of my favorite.
