c_ZDTkfDlfzLm0a3osk1ow Now we've got 3 Indian restaurants within a mile,all very good. I suppose the demand is there especially from non Indians who are discovering the vast and flavorful menus offered by these eateries. We checked out Indian Paradise 2, NE corner practically of I-17 & Bell next to an old shell station. All I can say is these guys have got it right. North and South Indian, Veg & non veg, chaat masala ,wholesome fresh food in a clean relatively new setting that used to be the Black Bear Diner. The ambiance is decent,and the service is great, with good presentation in a clean open well lit space. The buffet is the usual route, on a first visit and as of now the best value in town at $7.95 Mon. thru Thur. and $10.95 on the weekends for wonderful grub that'll please any palate. That's not the only unique feature because they also offer a dinner buffet at similar prices. Yes by all means, skip a meal before and the one after, because this'll fill the day and you won't regret any of it. They also have a group dining area you can reserve for company or family events. Great addition to the Valley  dining scene. I think I saw a mini bar over to the right, so go do it and give us your take.
