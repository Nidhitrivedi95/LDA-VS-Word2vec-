DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg So, I have been giving vegetarianism a shot the past couple weeks. Pescetarian may be a better word, but that is neither here nor there. I was invited to join Amber W's Vegeversary on Friday night and this was the spot she picked. I will admit, I was a little scared by the veggie/vegan only at an Indian place. Being the good Yelper I am I decided a new place to review would be enough of a draw. Kidding Amber :) 

I arrived a little late and the table had already ordered, but the server came by with a menu and I, along with my brother and a friend, were able to order rather quickly. The table had ordered some apps of Cauliflower Manchurian and Batura, which is a large puffy bread. The cauliflower was great and the bread reminded me of the skin Goldmember eats in the Austin Powers movie, but it tasted great. 

My brother and I ordered the Vegetables Manchurian and the Onion and Hot Chili Uthappam. The veggies were mashed together into a ball and then sauteed. Very good with a little bit of a kick to them. The Uthappam was a giant pancake with onions and other spices. It was really good and I could have eaten the whole thing myself. It reminded me of a potato latke. We shared other dishes at the table with everyone else. There was a pretty wide variety of dishes. Some kind of spinach, a dish with peas and paneer(awesome, BTW), and couple of others that I wouldn't begin to find on the menu without help. Rice is brought out with all of the dishes and it was cooked perfectly. 

We divied up the bill and it was very affordable for the amount of food we all got to eat. The place will not be a staple on my regular rotation, but if someone says that is where we are meeting for dinner, there won't be any hesitation going back. 

Minus one star for the sub arctic temps where I was sitting.
