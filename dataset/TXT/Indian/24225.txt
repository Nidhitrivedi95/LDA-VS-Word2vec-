gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA We first ate at the Udupi Cafe this past winter and were really disappointed....that it took us so long to discover it! 

The food is beyond delicious, everything is vegetarian, and the service is great! 

We've only ordered off the menu once, and everything was superb. However, because my husband likes to try lots of different things, we mainly come for the buffet ($9.99 on the weekends). We go to the lunch buffet at least once a weekend and have gone to a few of the Tuesday Night special Dosa Buffets. We absolutely love the sweet lady who works there and always treats us like family when we walk in. 

The buffet selections change from day-to-day so if we taste something really good on the buffet, chances are, we won't see it again for months, but we could always just order it off the menu as well. Some of my favorite items are the vegetable biryani rice, a creamy dish similar to mutter paneer, but with potatoes and peas instead of paneer, and a really delicious sauteed cabbage dish. Also, the masala tea that is part of the buffet is soooooo delicious - if I could handle all the dairy, I'd probably drink 100 cups!

With the buffet, they serve gigantic masala dosas - flat rice crepes filled with curried potatoes (similar to samosa fillings). I love to dip parts of it into the cilantro chutney sauce. Yum!

I don't know that much about the regional differences in Indian food - a lot of other Yelp reviews mention that it's Southern Indian food. I did notice, the first time we visited, that we didn't see the "typical" Indian fare on the menu (ie, tikka masala, naan, etc.). It seems to me that the kind of food that is served at Udupi is more plant-based (lots of veggies and greens and chickpeas)m, which we happen to love, but might not appeal to those who prefer the more rich Indian dishes (like pieces of paneer cheese in creamy curry sauce).

The Udupi Cafe is a gem!!
