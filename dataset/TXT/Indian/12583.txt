AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw Anytime I'm in the neighbourhood I try to stop by and grab a few samosas. They are awesome...especially when they are fresh and hot from the deep fryer.  One time when I was waiting a lady gave me a sample of the pakoras and they are fantastic too.  Love this place.  Usually end up eating them in the car so they would get five stars if they had a few tables.  However doing this would probably mean changing locations and change might mean they switch something else up so maybe it's best they don't rock the boat...really the ambience isn't much but the samosas are worth it!  I'm glad they are on the expensive side because if they were dirt cheap I would eat more of them ;)
