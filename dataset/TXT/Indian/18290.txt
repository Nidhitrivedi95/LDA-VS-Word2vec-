EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Hands down the best place for Indian and Pakistani Cuisine. The chicken tikka masala was amazing and full of flavor. Service was also great and very prompt despite being very busy on a Monday night. They were able to accommodate my party of 10 with ease and deliver on excellent service. Would definitely come back again.
