9y2MS2VyXZzFRi2zGV0AFg I called the restaurant to book a table for me and the missus and was assured that it was ok to use my recently purchased nCrowd voucher. However, on arrival it was a different story. I was told that the voucher had to be printed, despite the fact I was showing him my confirmation code on the phone. After a lengthy discussion in which I refused to go home because we had paid for a taxi to get there, we were finally granted permission to dine, provided I could forward the email on to the manager for him to print.
The food finally arrived, and half way into our meal the grumpy manager came over wanting me to forward the email. So, interrupting my meal, I did so, but he couldn't find it in his inbox so told me to resend it. While I was doing this he snatched my phone from me and attempted to do it himself, though it transpired he's not great with technology. He then hovered over our table for the duration of our meal while attempting to find the email on his phone. When he finally retrieved it he couldn't figure out how to send it to print.
Feeling by now, a bit disgruntled, I went to the toilet and when I came out the waiter was, well waiting, to tell me that the manager wanted me to go behind the bar to use their computer to log in to my email account so I could send my voucher to print.
The whole situation was farcical from start to finish, yet I still intended to tip the waiter who was very friendly despite the way his manager was behaving. However, when the manager thrust his chip n pin weapon at me I accidentally left the tip for him in haste! So, friendly waiter, if you're reading this I'm sorry.
I should also add that the view is dominated by a Novotel hotel, NOT the Royal Yacht Brittania, as described online. The decor is a bit on the tacky side, and I can't remember what the food tasted like!
