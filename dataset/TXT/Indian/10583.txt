A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA f you haven't eaten a dosa, you must head over to Little India and look for Udupi Palace. It may not resemble much of a royal palace with it's basement location that more reminds you of a bare bones banquet hall but seriously, no one comes for the decor!  They know their dosas with a variety of 15  to choose from on their menu alone!  This is even the home of the annual "Spicy Dosa eating contest" where every summer, dosa connoisseurs alike gather to gorge on these delicate Indian crepes. 
Honestly, this visit to Udupi Palace was an education in Southern Indian vegetarian cuisine!  Now carnivores, there's really no meat on this menu but trust me, once you have tried the different dishes on this menu, you will start to crave them like I do.
