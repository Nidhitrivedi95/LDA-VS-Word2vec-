Xl2zyEFXHSHS4Xpo6ja4BQ One of the most terrible restaurants ever! For the record, I know a thing or two about Indian food and this was by far one of the worst. We're vegetarians. We tried the daal, mixed veggie curry, malai sabji, naan, raita, veggie pakoras,bhajji, sliced mushrooms. They all tasted the same and greasy. The malai kofta had no kofta. Just potatoes. The service was poor with the person just being crummy to us. My child was eating lunch and he was banging on the table with a kiddie spoon that I had brought with me. While I was trying to stop him, another waiter comes running to declare that we shouldn't damage his tables. Just grumpy and mean. The portions were ok for us. We ordered 5 dishes for 4 adults and a toddler.  But can't imagine this would be enough for folks with bigger portions than us. Definitely won't recommend or won't go back there again.
