fHqJZK0D9E91ltD62SwzSw Tried the evening on Sunday. Obviously a bit dearer in the evening but great selection of dishes. Service fast and friendly. Must try a home delivery sometime.
Lunchtime a few minutes ago  delicious Thali was a complete meal for just 6.95 (if you have the vegetarian one). Going again on Monday ! (today is Thursday )
