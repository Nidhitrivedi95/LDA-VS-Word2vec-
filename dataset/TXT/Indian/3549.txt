0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ My brother recommended that I try this place after he had gone several times and was consistently impressed. 

My table ordered a plate of butter chicken, chili chicken in gravy (they give you the option between gravy and dry), which both came with a heaping amount of rice on the side. Note- it doesn't mention that rice is included on the side with meat dishes, so keep this in mind when ordering your dish! We also ordered a lunch special, chili shrimp with rice on the side, and a can or pop. All of this after tip cost around $37.

I really enjoyed everything!  My favourite was probably the butter chicken. I found the chili chicken just a tad bit too spicy. If you find you can't really handle a lot of spice in your food, try to steer clear of the green peppers included in the chili chicken/shrimp dishes. 

Also good to mention - the service was great. Received our dishes within a reasonable amount of time and they were friendly as well!
Furthermore, if you're planning to order take-out, if you pay with cash, you'll receive 10% off!

Great authentic flavours here in Mississauga!
