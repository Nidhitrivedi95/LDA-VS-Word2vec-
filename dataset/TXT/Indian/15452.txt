CRgCV0KUx40uW_j_b0p-MQ Food is good, service is slow. Like way too slow. Their veg platter says veg seekh kabab, which their chef doesn't know even exist. The platter just has three mushrooms, and I didn't find even one. One of their server asked me what's wrong and never back to my table. We had to keep asking for water to be served and it was served after 5 times or more regular reminders. Then we had this amazing waitress Mena who followed up with everything and made my visit worth the money over all I would give like 4/5 to food but 1/5 to service.

Will I go again, yes because of the food but would make sure I take something like monopoly deal to pass time while waiting for food coz it takes a lot of time.
