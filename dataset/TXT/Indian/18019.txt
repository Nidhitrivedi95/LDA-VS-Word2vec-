ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ The buffet lunch is very reasonable, with a good selection of meat and vegetable dishes, breads and rices, salads and condiments and Indian desserts. Especially pleasant to have clean plates for each round. The buffet was not too spicy. If you ordered off the menu you could select the heat level. Look forward to returning.
