1PfNM_6ouYvNEbAukY76EQ Awesome food ! Great service!! You do pay for the ambience and the presentation! We had dal pakwan which was tasty, the KB  chat platter was fresh and yummy, the sizzlers plater KB was good. My lil guy loved the masala coke and veg Manchurian. The flooda was nice. Will come back for sure !!
