-MpXo24qYu4DazQXDrs2oA Excellent South Indian food choices... kind staff... loved the food. Definitely something to go for considering they are open right from breakfast time
.... spoke to owner about her Vision for the place and how they want to serve clean food.. I definitely recommend to go give this place a try!!!
