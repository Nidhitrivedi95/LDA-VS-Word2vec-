PGo6eHLGAKNL_XNajkwc-w The quality of this family run restaurant is astounding. I think it's the best Indian restaurant and take out in the Edinburgh area. The food is bursting with flavour and so beautifully made. The staff are really friendly and it's obvious the restaurant us a family affair. The food us great value for money and they deliver. The restaurant is beautiful and cost and on the main bus route to Edinburgh. The restaurant is famous in penicuik and they even been known to take school trips to try Indian food. I would recommend it to anyone !
