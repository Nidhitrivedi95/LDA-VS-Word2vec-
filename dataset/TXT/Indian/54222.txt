VuW81oFt6-X9-vMYFYJY6Q I just visited the place today, the place is very small so don't expect to find a table to eat there, you will have to take out. I tried their sheik kabab as an appetizer, I was expecting something dry and crispy, it turns out to be more of something steamed, and I ordered a chicken tikka masala it was suppose to be spicy, but I found it really sweet and lastly the chicken biryani, that was actually very tasty.
