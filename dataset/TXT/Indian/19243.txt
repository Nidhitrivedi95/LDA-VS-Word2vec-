Went here for dinner with a friend before a show at the cabaret. It is a very unassuming looking restaurant and was not very busy. It took our waitress a little time to get over to us, but we mentioned that we had a show and she made sure to bring our food out as quickly as possible. 

We got the samosas, which were huge and delicious. We also shared the chicken tikka masala and the chana masala at spice level medium. I love spicy food, but if you don't I suggest going lower on the scale because even at a medium, these dishes had some serious kick!  I loved the chicken tikka masala. So much so that I took the leftover sauce over rice home just so my hubby could try it! We also got the garlic naan and poori. Both were delicious and helped to scoop up the delicious food. 

The portion sizes were also very generous for the price and my friend and I were each able to have a to go container from what was left over. 

I can't wait to go back!
