ecid5p4yhTEJbWEJTuzX3Q This little hole-in-the-wall is a great option for vegetarians, as their many veggie meals are really affordable (starting at $4.99, I believe).
I was disappointed with the chicken curry; the flavours were pretty 1-dimensional, and there was lots of dairy in the sauce (it was not butter chicken).  I wonder if that's changed under new ownership... I should try it again. 
The fish & chips is definitely not the best in the city, as is their claim, and for what you get, it's slightly overpriced.  
The last time I went, the TV was blaring at a completely ridiculous volume. 
The decor is pretty rough, but the value for money really helps to make up for this. 
Too bad the original owner's gone, he was really nice!  He gave us free gulab jamun once!
