Review: I was a little hesitant to try Namaste since I'm used to a more traditional setting for Indian food, but since I'm down with Indian food and always like to see vegetarian restaurants survive and thrive, I gave it a shot.

On the positive side, the food had familiar flavors and seemed to be of good quality. No complaints there. The gentleman who took my order was friendly and helpful and the 3-ring binder with photos of the food was a nice touch.

I typically order my food (Thai, Indian, Mexican, etc.) at a medium spice rating. Apparently "medium" here is quite a bit hotter than what I'm accustomed to. Keep in mind that this is based on only one visit here, but I will definitely be trying "mild" next time.

One slightly disappointing aspect of my visit came when I explained that the dish was much spicier than anticipated. I had eaten about one third of it before reaching a point where I couldn't go any farther. It became apparent that they were not willing to remake the dish -- something that is a pretty standard accommodation when there's an issue such as this. He offered a couple of other options, the first couple of which didn't help. Finally some veggie rice was extended and that helped to tone things down a little bit.

In the end, I wasn't as happy as I would have been had they simply offered to cook up another dollar worth of chickpeas for me, but I'll be back to give it another try.
