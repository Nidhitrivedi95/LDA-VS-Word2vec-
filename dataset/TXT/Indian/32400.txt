LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Lunch at Salem's is excellent.  I have always got my fix of authentic arab/mediteranian food from their original location in Oakland.  This location is MUCH,  MUCH better!   There is parking.   It is impecably clean.   The space is huge.   The food is more varied and tastes great!  The service is way above any cafetria syle restaurant!   It is definately a place that makes you feel like you belong.....no matter who you are!

If you like mediteranian, indian-style food....you have to try it here.   It tastes great, feels real, and is inexpensive!
