NaooRxi0BfTu8n1X2yxbRA Awful. Just awful. 
I am an open minded vegetarian and was told to try this.
What a mistake.
Waited too long for a table. Just stood there like idiots waiting for a table. 
THE PLACE WAS NEAR EMPTY!!!
When seated the waiter spoke very broken English. Thats fine. A dear friend is from India and I have learned to decipher (?) what he is saying thru his thick accent. I'm cool with this. But FFS talk to us!! Didn't ask if we had questions, didn't explain anything. Had to Google EVERYTHING. 
NO REFILLS. 
Now. The food was wonderful it was the service and being stared at that sucked. Lets all stare at the tattooed white people. *smh*
