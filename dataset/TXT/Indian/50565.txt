Butter chicken was a tremendous hit, as was the tikka masala. The Masala is different from other places I've eaten it at, especially because this dish felt more like a mix of a tandoori sizzler and tikka than it did the madras sauce style dishes I've had.

the Chicken Tikka itself had huge pieces of chicken. You won't be hungry.

Rice and naans were flavourful and the staff was excellent. Very helpful and kind and overall, a great experience. Great value for the money too.
