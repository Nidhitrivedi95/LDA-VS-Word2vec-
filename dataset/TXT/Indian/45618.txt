ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Last weekend, I found myself in Ohio where I read some AMAZING reviews on yelp for this Indian spot. It did not disappoint. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but inside it is very homey. There is limited space. I think the place holds about 50 people unless there was a back section I was not aware of. Everything was delicious from the naan to the lamb saag to the tandoori chicken. I highly recommend if it you are in the area. The servers were friendly and attentive and they want to ensure everyone has the best experience.  

Tip:  You can order every dish on a hot scale of 1-10 (10 being the hottest) and they can give you a sample of their sauces to see what you can take!
