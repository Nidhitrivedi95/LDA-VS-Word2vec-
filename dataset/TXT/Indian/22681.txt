GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw I went in to this little Asian cuisine with great excitement and expectation, but I kinda okay with their service and food.
I went with my friends and had started with CHICKEN SPRING ROLLS, PRAN PAKORA then had CHICKEN MASALA with rice and green salad
Starters were lovely, but the main course was honestly not good.
Not so great compared to lots of other Asian cuisines around there.
HTH, Thanks
