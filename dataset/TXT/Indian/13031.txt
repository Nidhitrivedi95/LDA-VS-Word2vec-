b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw More recently opened and serving more South Indian food.. Including delicious dosas! I had the Rava masala with a perfect coconut chutney. We also enjoyed the Gobi 65. Service was very friendly too. Would definitely recommend this spot! No liquor license so you'd have to go to their other location for that ;)
