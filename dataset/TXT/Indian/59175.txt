yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I tried the lunch buffet and I was not the least disappointed. The food was delicious and the waiters were very attentive. The buffet offers about eight different dishes, which may seem like a small selection, but the quality of the dishes leaves you more than satisfied. I have been to buffets with a greater selection of dishes, but the chicken and vegetables are not as fresh and I end up with a stomach ache. The complimentary naan bread alone is worth the visit. The restaurant itself, the food, and the price are right. A must go to restaurant.
