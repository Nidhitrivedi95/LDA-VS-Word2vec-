DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ The food doesn't have any love and does have a lot of fillers in the sauces to make it seem bountiful and thick.....like cornstarch or something.The quality of the food is really bad and cheap and the chefs have a lack of skill with authentic indian flavor. Its like Costco Indian food. Ive given it three chances since its the ONLY indian food restaurant close by. I ordered off the menu adn have also tried the buffet. to me its actually gross and watered down....cheap food. there are hardly any vegan options and nothing new and exciting. I will say that the atmosphere is nice...too bad the food is awful. i drive to concord or Charlotte to find something palatable. We need more good Authentic Northern/Southern Indian restaurants. The waiters don't listen either. so you don't get what you ask for.
