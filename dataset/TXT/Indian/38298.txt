OlJODULZWPGLZP_ntZfSfQ Consistent quality and service. Love in all the details. Big portions. Complex flavour that is made by someone who really understands cooking. I'm vegetarian and they always make me extremely happy. Even going so far as to make special dishes for my fussy 4-year-old. Love me some Shapla.
