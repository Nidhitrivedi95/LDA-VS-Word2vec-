s8N66BJ9P-sqhisX47o1Sg I had my second visit to this place and it was one to talk about. 

First off when ordering,  prepare to wait 20+ minutes. 

The most recent time I ordered paneer with roti.   I thought we would get a decent sized curry as the order came wrapped with the paneer. 

Once I opened the roti I noticed they give 5 small pieces of paneer with a heap of undercooked peas in curry as a filler. All this for $ 9.95. 

For those people who have never had curry or roti,  you may not notice.   But this place deserves one and a half a star,  but I gave it a two as I didn't go prey to the porcelain God's. Makes me wonder if people who reviewed this place actually know the taste of curry.
