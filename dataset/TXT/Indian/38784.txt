OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This review is for their lunch buffet which I must say is a steal! Reading the past reviews it seems like this location is a hit or miss. Most of the gripe is from the customer service. Which is a shame because it seems like I was smothered with good customer service. 

This place has been on my bookmarks for awhile and I'm glad I got to try it out! 
It's got a very modern feel going on with it while not giving off a pretentious vibe. 
Customer service was very good, we were constantly checked upon. Food wise everything was above par. You have to try the goat, and the butter curry!
