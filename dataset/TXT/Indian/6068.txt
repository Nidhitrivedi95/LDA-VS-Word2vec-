3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA A must-visit restaurant when in Vegas and craving for Indian food. The food portion is huge, fresh and tasty, restaurant is hygienic and the service is prompt and impeccable. We were a group of five comprising of my husband, my MIL and my parents. My family can be a bit fussy and choosy when it comes to food but they all thoroughly enjoyed the food served here. We went for a vegetarian thali, sev puri, momos, chilly chicken, and chicken curry with assorted bread. No disappointments whatsoever! We were served by Hari and Krishna. They were both extremely courteous, prompt and accomodating when it came to our preferences. Special shout- out to Hari who went out of his way to give us the best service possible. Highly recommend this restaurant for its service, ambience and taste. Definitely worth giving it a shot!
