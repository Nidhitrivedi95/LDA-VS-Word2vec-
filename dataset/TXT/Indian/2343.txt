_Q0JeKDrzldpBUgswhlLyA I'm not quite sure why there are bad comments, I've never tried their catering food but a friend recommended this place years ago to me and my family and I absolutely love getting our sweets here. The owners and people are genuine; yes it may be pricey but the times I've gotten any sweets it was quality fresh sweets. It's a tiny place but they're very sweet people. Their samosas are sooo good.
