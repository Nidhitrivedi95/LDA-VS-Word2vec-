UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I went to this place recently for dinner. They have good looking food but average tasting. Salt was not right in all the items we ordered. Table service was not good too. For some reason the waiter was in hurry to clean the table and indirectly putting pressure on us to finish sooner.

While we were having food, there was incident in restaurant. One of the guest fell while her chair broke during getting up. Waiter serving us saw it and did not even bother to extend help or ask if she was OK. He just moved to serve other table. That was bad as other guests had to help the other person get up. Even manager did not seem too concerned when the guest complained.

For the price they charge for the food and based on other reviews, I expected lot more. I would not go again.
