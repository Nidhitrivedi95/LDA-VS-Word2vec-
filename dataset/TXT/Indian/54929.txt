wowGDYsOpR_mIMMFDL-qhg All dishes taste same. Owner is a bit rude. We went from Etobicoke to this place which is quite far just for Undhiyu but he reacted a bit rude. I know it was my mistake I should have called him before going there as he said we have to inform him first and place the order over the phone but since last few days I was having cravings for Undhiyu. He could have been replied in a better way rather than being rude.

Plus these people are really really slow!!
