Garlic Naan bread was enjoyable, goes great with the entree as they are sauce like and great for dipping.
Palak paneer was creamy and mild. While subtle it was still a great choice.
Paneer Tikka Masala, spicy but packed with flavor. These dishes went great over bismatti rice as most indian dishes do. Upkeep on the place was marginal but I'm not nibbling on the drapes or sucking on the table cloth. Water tasted fine, which is important, I drink a lot of water when out for indian.
