gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We had dinner one night and came back a few days later for the lunch buffet.   Both were excellent. We've tried a few other places on the strip but this place is far better.   Worth the short side trip. One of the best indian restaurants I've been to in a ling time.   Service was fast courteous and friendly.  Food was authentically delicious.
