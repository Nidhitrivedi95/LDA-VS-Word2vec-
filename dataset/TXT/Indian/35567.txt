MWffCS7UkTUj9yDMy4jaLA Went there for lunch today with a friend. Definitely will not be going back due to the overall atmosphere and the attitude received from the staff. It almost felt like they were doing us a favor by serving us. 

We were the first ones to arrive at the restaurant. The owner was sitting at one of the tables - no hello, no welcome. What a great way to treat paying customers. We seated ourselves and helped ourselves to food. The food was quite salty and felt like the curry went through several reheats.  Because there was no water jug provided at each table, you either had to flag for a server or wait till they notice your glass is empty and fill up. There were two servers - one male and one female. The female was no-where to be seen. Seems she prefers hiding in the kitchen. The male server was busy chatting up with guest at a particular table with no regard for others. We flagged him for water once, he served it. We flagged him for water again and that is when we got the icy attitude. If you don't want to serve water, then leave a jug at the table, for god's sake. I am sure we weren't the only customer feeling the salt and the need for water. Just ridiculous!  We paid at the counter and promptly left. The female server again showed no courtesy - no thank you, nothing. I am not asking to be treated like a queen. I am just asking for basic courtesy and service.  

This is  huge shame especially considering this was my second visit and I brought a friend along with me. It was her first visit. As soon as we left the premise, the first word that popped out was - Boy, I am never going back to that place.  

I don't expect things to change given the owner himself shows poor customer service skills. 

I also think they put too much salt or MSG in their food. Its been a full two hours since I left and I have already drank at least 5 glasses of water.
