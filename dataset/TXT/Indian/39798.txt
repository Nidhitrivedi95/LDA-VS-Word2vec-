P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg I had their tom yum soup and it was not good. One of the things I love about this soup is the colour but the colour on this one was runny and had no eye appeal, and the same goes for the flavour. It had no flavour and tasted watered down, and had a foul metal like smell. Not pleased at all. I bought the large shrimp one at $10 and had to throw it out after one spoonful. 

The crispy beef was pretty good but I expected a greater portion size.
