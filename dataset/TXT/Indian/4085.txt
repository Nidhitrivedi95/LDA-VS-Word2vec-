16-gsPZnaBJgFi9Le-i27w Pretty good. 

Good service, very clean restaurant. The best thing we ordered was the Amaya Prawn appetizer. Delicious flavour and the prawns cooked to perfection. Great value. 

Butter chicken has great flavour and chicken was really tender and juicy, but the dish overall was a little bit on the sweet side. Saag paneer was good. Loved the garlic naan... Super garlicky and fragrant. 

Overall a good experience. Would I come back? Maybe. Is there better Indian out there? Of course. It was good but nothing stellar to write home about.
