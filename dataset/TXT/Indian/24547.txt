H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ Had a little date night tonight with a cute girl, went back for more Hakka Chinese tonight, but wanted to try some new items. 

- Manchurian shrimp and chicken rice (white meat)
- Chilli Chicken (dry, no sauce)
- Hot and Sour soup

My goodness the chilli chicken blew me away, phenomenal. Crispy, not greasy and very flavourful. Manchurian rice was excellent and the soup was also good. $21.75 with tax for two patrons and we had leftovers. Fantastic!
