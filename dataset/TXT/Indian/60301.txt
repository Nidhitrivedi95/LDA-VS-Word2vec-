ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Even as an international student on a tight budget, I was able to be a regular at this restaurant. The prices are reasonable and the food is delicious! I've been eating here at the lunch buffet twice a week for almost two years and I've never seen them run out of anything. The staff is highly professional and take care of you well. 

This is a fantastic restaurant. Love this place!
