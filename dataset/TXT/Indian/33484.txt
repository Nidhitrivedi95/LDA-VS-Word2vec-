LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw I can only attest to the lunch buffet. First of all, the price is right. After tax it is $8.75. Between this and the one on King's Drive, it's pretty much my 2 go-to for Indian lunch buffet. Jaipur has good naan, a tomato soup that goes well with them, and the little fried chickpeas patties that are very tasty. There are typically at least 4 entrees options (vegetarian & chicken mostly) plus the must have tandoori chicken. This is a solid quick lunch spot when you're craving a little Indian.
