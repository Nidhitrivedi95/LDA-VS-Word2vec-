RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg retroreview from Sept 2015:  went here while visiting my bf in Charlotte because one of his friends said it was the best Indian food ever! SO i went in expecting to be disappointed because come on ...Im indian and a pretty bad ass cook.  But to my shock this place was REALLY good and had unique stuff I'd never seen in any Indian restaurant before.  FIrst and foremost was the fact that it had specialty indian inspired cocktails. If you frequent indian restaurants you'll know that the drinks menu is usually not very extensive if even in existence at all.  So we got two cocktails that were not only good as "indian cocktails" but I would truely rate them as some of the best cocktails Iv ever had....sadly I cant rememebr what the were called and even looking back at the menu now they dont have them list! ARGH!!
Im starting to sound like an alkey! so ONTO the food dang it...
we got chatpate tikki chole as the appetizer, he was skeptical as it was vegetarian....but i told him that doesnt matter with indian food! And boy was i right cuz it was sooo yummy we practically licked the plate. 
For dinner we got chicken makhani and lamb curry with some rice and naan. I know boring but it was his first time trying indian food (double gasp!!! - he was dating an indian chick the situation needed to be rectified ASAP). ok back to the food.... it was excellent and very good portions of everything. We had to take some home, mainly so that we could still get dessert ;)
We got a tried and trusty Gulab Jamun and it was exact yummy finish that was necessary to such an awesome meal.
