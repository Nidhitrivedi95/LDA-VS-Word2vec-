B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ Got a bad rep for customer service but they were great when I went was there.  Made sure my water was refilled the whole time. Smiles and welcomes you. 

Buffet was okay.  Went on a Sunday.  Unique Chinese food but don't  really have the basics.  And the Indian food only had two different curry.
