gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg We stopped in for a quick beer, and wow were we happily surprised!!   This is a fantastic family run restaurant with amazing flavors.   We had appetizer 6, which is a spicy cauliflower dish with onions, peppers and lots of complex flavors.     It is a must have if you get a chance to go there.

Looks like they have a very large lunch buffet for those interested.    Also tried three sauces - the mint, a tomato and a coconut all of which were some of the best flavors that we have ever had!

We will definitely be back soon.
