bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A I enjoy coming here for lunch occasionally.  I like Indian buffets (unlike Chinese buffets, which I abhor!) because of the variety of ingredients and dishes I get to sample that I otherwise may not order if it was a-la-carte.  

This place specializes in Vegeterian Indian food (a very typical thing) and I've had some interesting meal combinations here... lots of legumes, leafy greens, curries, all mixed in with vegetables and occasionally tofu.  Nothing has really ever stood out with the food, but it has never been a bad experience.

The facilities are another story.  I was there recently when they ran out of TP in the lady's bathroom (I actually checked before using THANKFULLY!!).  I alerted the girl that works the front desk and she was completely useless... she said she'd refill it and it never was refilled.  When I asked her again (after holding my bladder throughout my meal) she said they were completely out (really? how are you OUT of TP?? who manages inventory for this place?).  I can only imagine that if someday they were out of hand-soap, they'd handle it the same way.... which means your cooks could be making your food with dirty hands.  GRODY!
