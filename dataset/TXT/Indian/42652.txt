RA7Mw5ZXTHKlpDfMyHs9ZQ I will never order from This restaurant Again period. I've had wwwaaaayyyy better Indian food then this, I'm not Indian but the way they cook lacks so much flavor and the texture. It just didn't work for me, I ordered take out. The tandoori chicken wasn't too bad, the butter chicken lacked flavor and was too salty (I like salt, so I won't complain).. It made the naan bread taste even better! The tikka chicken Masala Sucked! I'm surprised they are in business with food like this, but I guess others like it.. Meh..  I'm sticking with Tandoori Flame or Tandoori Time for my Indian fix.
