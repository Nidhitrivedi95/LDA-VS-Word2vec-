Butter chicken $11.50 and garlic naan $2.50

The portions were large. There was more than enough sauce for the naan. A decent amount of chicken. Great flavours. The garlic naan was huge and fluffy with a nice doughy texture. 

The meal came with a some chips as an appetizer I guess. It was pretty tasteless but dipping it into the butter chicken sauce made it more appetizing. 

Very good but I have yet to find an Indian restaurant that can top Bombay Bhel.

Solid 3.5 stars
