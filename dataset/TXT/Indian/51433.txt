UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Incredible. Great service, atmosphere, and food. A magical place for vegans and people that are gluten free. The menu clearly states all allergen info and the server was knowledgable. Food: egg plant, okra, and yellow lentil dish were amazing. And gluten free bread! We went twice in 4 days. Highly recommend.
