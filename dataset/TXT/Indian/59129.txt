yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I came here for the lunch buffet on a weekday. The food and customer service were both decent, but I'm giving them one star for the management's ridiculous antics.

I had a coupon for a free buffet which I'm guessing they tried to compensate for by tacking on 18% gratuity to a party of five. Is that even legal?! There were no signs on the menu or by the cash register to justify this. The host didn't bother to tell me that gratuity was added to my total, and the receipt wasn't itemized. My receipt only listed a "pre-tip total" when they had in fact already included gratuity in the total. I had to ask why the total was so high, and that's how I found how that I was already charged for tip. They're just trying to gyp their customers. No thanks.
