zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I've been here for lunch and I have to say I prefer it over the multitude of Indian Buffet places in Oakland. Food is fresh, flavorful, and well portioned. Their lunch menu has a great variety without being intimidating for some one with little to no familiarity with Indian food. Staff are very polite and food comes quickly. A a great lunch place on Craig St!
