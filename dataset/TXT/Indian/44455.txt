rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg After being in Montreal for 4 long months I just lost my South Indian food virginity @ Thanjai. This is one of the really good South Indian places if not the best. They specialize in Dosas. 
      Dosas are crispy Indian Crepes made with rice. They are served with 2 different chutneys & Sambhar (Lentil curry). They do 51 kinds of dosas. If you get any of the "Masala" versions, they come stuffed with spicy potato mix. Also try their Chicken 65. Its YUMMM. Chicken Biryani is great. So is the Pepper Chicken. My only complaint is that the pepper chicken isn't boneless. Also instead of the naan, go for the Parotha. 
      Why didn't I get Naan???? 2 reasons....... One, its Naan of your business...... And two, Getting a North Indian dish from a South Indian restaurant is not a great move. You'd be disappointed.  I'd say order the Parotha instead. Its much much better than naan. They have lots of other things on their menu, But i'd rather stick to the things they specialize in. Definitely will be back to try other south Indian dishes
