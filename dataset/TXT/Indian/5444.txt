2ZmZbmsTRHogSZR-nJY_Fw I just noticed that another Indian restaurant was open at the same location as 2 previous failed attempts.  Apparently the 3rd time is the charm because this is a winner.  We did take out so can't speak to the buffet but the food was fantastic.  We way over-ordered but wanted to try a lot of things and they were all great.  The Samosa's were smaller than usual but there were 4 instead of 2 so they were fun to eat and tasted great.  Next we had their signature Goat dish, Laal Maas.  Goat by nature is a bony dish but this was much leaner than usual and the sauce was complex and perfectly spiced.  We also had the Rogan Josh.  Again, the meat was lean, tender and tasty with a perfect sauce.  Not seeing our favorite, Channa Masala, we tried the Delhi Matka Chole which was delicious.  The chickpeas were cooked just enough and spiced well.  The Konan Gobi (Cauliflower) was also very tasty.  We also had a side of Raita and a bread basket which is a mixture of 3 breads that were moist yet not greasy.  Finally, the rice was also flavorful and a great accompaniment to the sauces.  We will be back.
