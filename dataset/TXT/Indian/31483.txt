Try the sadeko masu, it took me back to my days back home in India. The chicken korma was excellent and so was the lamb chatnan. The butter naan was pretty good as well.

This was the closest thing to proper Indian food I've eaten in a long long time. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.

I'm definitely coming back.
