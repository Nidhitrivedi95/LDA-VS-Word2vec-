rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Ok. Not the biggest Indian food fan, but it was good. Naan was great. Tandoori Mixed Grill was good, though the beef was different. A chicken dish with peppers, onions & curry/spices was very tasty. Got "#5" heat for both dishes but this second dish seemed hotter. We could probably have gone a little higher on the heat scale. Overall, a pleasant lunch experience.
