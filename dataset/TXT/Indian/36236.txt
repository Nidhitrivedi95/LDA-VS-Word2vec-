NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ This was so yummy! Great to have a mix of Nepali and Indian dishes. The papadums were a recommended started for the table. Yummy mango lassi, and super soft tasty tandoori fish tikka. Portion not very big with this one but perfect accompanied with some naan or (yummy coconut pineapple) rice. It was quite busy so luckily we could make a reservation for us 6. the only downside is that we had to ask 3 times for water for the table but I am pretty sure that was just bad luck as the waiters were generally very nice and accommodating.
Will go back for sure, recommended!
