OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g What an incredible experience! Totally worth the walk or drive from the strip :) for 12 bucks you can have for lunch some of the most delicious Indian food you can possibly imagine. The food was excellent, and the service was also great! Carlos took great care of us and the best part is that he walked us through the entire buffet and explained what each dish was. I truly recommend this place and will come back every time I come to Vegas! Five stars!
