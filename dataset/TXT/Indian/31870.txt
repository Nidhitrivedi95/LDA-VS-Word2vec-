kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Shame on me for thinking the other reviewers were just picky about their Indian food.   Everything you'll read here is consistent with what has been said before.  The food is "healthy" Indian style.  It's okay, but definitely lacks the authentic flavor that traditionally bursts off your plate when you eat Indian cuisine.  The Naan was more like pita bread and the curry seriously tasted like stew.   The Tikki Masala sauce although not as good as the traditional was good enough to eat as an alternative.  If you're going to go to Bombay Spice, go for lunch, it's just not that exiting of a venue to waste on dinner.  Even though the food was just okay, the service was great, so I can't possibly rate them at less than a 3 star.... After all they did deliver "Healthy" Indian food as promised.
