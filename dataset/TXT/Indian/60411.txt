ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I love going to Passage to India, especially for the buffet.  When I can see the food I am about to eat, it makes all the difference in the world.  The buffet selection is varied with entrees, salad, and dessert items.  Or, if you prefer, you can order from the menu.  Lunchtime is pretty busy any day of the week so if you need a few big helpings of Indian cuisine, you can't go wrong with Passage to India.
