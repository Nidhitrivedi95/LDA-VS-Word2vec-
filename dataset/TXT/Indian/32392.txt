I've always wondered where I could buy a bone marrow - Well look no further. This is the place to go. Looking to buy a Goat Meat? Lamb Meat? or even simply a chicken - Yep! This is the place to go. 

The prices are very reasonable compared to other Grocery chain Stores. Even though the prices are not fixed and could change depending on the availability - it still beats other stores by couple dollars/lb.

Besides, you can also find all sort of spices and masalas including various South Asian food products.
