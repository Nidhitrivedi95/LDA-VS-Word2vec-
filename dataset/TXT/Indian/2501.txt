02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ My go-to Indian food place. The staff is always attentive and friendly. My bf left his credit card in the restaurant once and a hostess chased us down as we were about to drive away. The food is great! It's nice because they adjust the spice level for you from 1-10 and the lunch buffet is relatively not spicy.  I usually order chicken tikka masala, rice, and garlic naan and I always have leftovers for the next day. This is a welcoming place and a good restaurant to introduce your friends to Indian food.
