Served in the back of a mosque. £3.50 for a wonderful steaming chicken curry dish that will fill you up (unlike so many places around here). The garlic nan bread is also delicious, except I'm usually too full to eat it. The only downside to this amazing place is that the seating is outdoors under a tarp, so if it's a  windy and cold day you should either bundle up or get it to take away and eat it somewhere warmer.
