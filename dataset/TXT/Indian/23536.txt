gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I knew I had to try this place the moment I opened my car door and all I could smell was the wonderful aroma of curry and other various spices you experience with Indian cuisine. We arrived for the lunch buffet  which runs from 11 to 3pm for $10.99 per person.   They also serve dinner from 5 to 10pm.  For me, a buffet is the best way to experience food you are not familiar with.  Trying to guess what will look and taste good by reading a menu can be next to impossible.   

I thought the Everest crew did a great job during my visit today.  The staff was efficient and friendly and it looked like only two people running the front of house of 30 tables or so.   The food selection was a good variety of one side that had all vegetarian options and another with meat offerings.   They featured about 12 different menu items including basmati rice, tandoori chicken, chicken Tikka masala, lentils, and one of my favorites was the pancake like balls soaked in syrup.   All of the offerings were hot and flavorful.   Once again a good reason to experience the buffet is because the food always comes out fresh, hot and often when you have a full restaurant. 

Once we were seated the server brought out a fresh basket of Naan bread.  So happy they brought this to the table the bread was hot and had a perfect char on the exterior for extra flavor. Yum! Speaking to server on the way out he said they change some of the buffet offerings daily so you might have a different experience each visit. I plan on going back to Everest very soon and I recommend you try it also.
