daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ Absolute lack of respect for customer's time. I called this place for a take-out order and was told it'd be ready in 20 minutes. When I go there in 20 minutes, its not ready. Well, its fine, things happen and I pay for my order and wait for few more minutes. After 10 minutes, nothing, after 20 minutes, I check with them and get a response saying its getting ready. Now I see that folks that paid right in front of me (for dining in) get theirs served, while my order that was placed at least 20 minutes earlier (if not more) wasn't even started. Then the cashier explains to me that they prioritize dine-in orders than take-out orders. If they had told this to me earlier, I would either have not ordered a take out or preferred to dine in. The whole purpose of ordering in advance to save time is lost. Shame on them. And the cashier didn't see that its wrong to prioritize dine-in than take out orders.
