3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA i wish i could rate more but i cant. i was there on saturday for dinner and then later on sunday for lunch buffet. Before i start i would like to say that i am vegetarian and i am only saying from this perspective. when we were there on Saturday for dinner it was nice and comforting everything was on point so we decided to return today for lunch buffet! But no it was a wrong choice this time. It is the worst buffet that i ever had in US. the food waa not fresh and it tastes pathetic. 
sambar was as thick as a gravy of shahi paneer, punjabi kadi was as sour as lemon and it is super thick too with no dumplings in it. 
then we tried kofta and its same no taste: very thich and same with yellow daal. BTW there were few more (aloo matar,corn saag) and they were equally horrible. we ordered breads and they were also not properly cooked we have to ask our server to cook it properly. Mind it we didnt had any trouble yesterday over the dinner. When we informed about our disappointed to the management they started giving diffuse excuses and just said sorry!

i dont think the sorry was sincere ! 
i have grew in delhi and i know how the delhi food tastes! i am not returning back again and will not advise anyone!
