K8dYoXbGDWJr_vSlVwDN1A 1st time having Lamb vindaloo and I was hooked! It didn't seem like a big portion at first and thought really? This is it? But by the time I was half way through dipping the great sauce with my fresh naan, I swear the button on my pants wanted to fall off. The service was great and the gentleman was very helpful. He would always refill our water without us even asking. I've always liked things like that. 

The Chicken Tikka Marsala was also top notch! Soft pieces of chicken, onions and green peppers. Mmmmmm! So if you're in the area you have to check it out :)
