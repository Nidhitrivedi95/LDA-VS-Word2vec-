sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Meh. I don't know what the cult following is about. The curry I had was pretty ordinary, a lot of potato bulking it out (it was a lamb curry) and a small serving for the price. They wouldn't swap out the rice for naan instead. Not hugely impressed, but I'm sure they are not going out of business anytime soon - they're always busy.
