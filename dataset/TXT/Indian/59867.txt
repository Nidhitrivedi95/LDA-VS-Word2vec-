ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg What a great place. These people who run this place are extremely pleasant and attentive and the dinner was fabulous.

We couldn't figure out what we wanted as everything sounded so good, so we ordered a couple bowls of Mulligawnee soup and their non-vegetarian dinner for two and Garlic Naan. Everything was cooked to perfection and their timing of serving as we went through each course was completely on-point. Awesome!
