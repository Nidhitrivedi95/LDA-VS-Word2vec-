e8_Xt-ldpDgWHn92s3rBaQ I was excited about trying this restaurant's food after seeing the reviews. It's pretty close to the house and the prices were fair. Well, the good stopped there.

We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, and some naan to go and ate at home. The balance of flavors was so off we barely finished our small plates and were done. We NEVER do that with Indian food! We're always going for 2nd's and 3rd's! Tikka Masala is like crack to me. I will eat and eat until the food is gone! I couldn't believe how off this recipe was. And the Lamb had a razor sharp bone chip buried in the sauce that I ended up biting into! This is unacceptable when you're making everything from scratch!

It tasted like they weren't using fresh spices and the flavor was very earthy but in a dirty way. Not good at all. I should have noticed that there wasn't a soul in the restaurant when I went to pick it up - just the owner running the register and his wife cooking. I was the only order. You would have thought they would be happy to see me, but that's not the feeling I got. It seemed like they were in a sad mood. I hate seeing a restaurant do poorly. I hope they taste other Indian food in the area and tweak their recipes, because I will never come back when it tastes like this.

Not to mention the restaurant is filled with row after row of empty metal shelves that used to belong to a dollar store (stickers still on shelves). I have no idea what they were doing there. Must've been at least 8-10 giant shelving units.

It's sad when I can make a better tikka masala and vindaloo from home using Fresh & Easy simmer sauces. Next time when we're hankering for amazing Indian food we're not gonna mess around and go straight to Marigold Maison.
