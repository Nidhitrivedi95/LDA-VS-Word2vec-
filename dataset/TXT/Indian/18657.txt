Luckily, on my last few take-out orders, Flavors of India has trusted me.  We're both pretty happy to finally be in a trusting relationship.  

I've only ever done take-out here and to be honest, it has always been the same dish- paneer tikka masala.  I love that they add chopped onions and cilantro to the masala mixture.  The rice is your standard Basmati.

My interactions with the employees have been efficient and friendly.  This is my current go-to for take-out Indian.
