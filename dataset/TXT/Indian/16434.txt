diXqpz9WOr4WLQq6uvARkg Absolutely loved this place
The ambiance very well done. 
I went to firungi for a friends birthday party. 
The food was just excellent and beautifully presented. We had the butter chicken fries( my fav of the night) and chaat for appetizers. 10/10
For dinner we ordered the daal, chicken 65, chicken karhai, and paneer saag 10/10

Also ordered sweet lassi was too thick and they wouldn't serve it a light bulb like the other drinks.
