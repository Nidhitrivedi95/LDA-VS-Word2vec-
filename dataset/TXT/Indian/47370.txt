TD3IX1KfkJ3X-llJ9sLunA I've always wanted to try a restaurant that serves only dosas. The interior was pretty small which I didn't expect, so I suggest to call in for a reservation if you have a big group. We were lucky to get table for 6 without any wait.

We had ordered Chilly Idli, Idli, Rava Dosa, Family dosa (4 Feet), Chai, Mango Lassi, Masala Dosa. I fell in love with the Rava dosa because they had made that to perfection, I don't think the Rava dosa lacked anything, apart from the chutney being too sweet, for me atleast. (the quantity was less too). 

The most exciting part for me was the family dosa because I haven't tried a dosa that is 4 ft long. When I got my 4 ft dosa I was disappointed. It didn't seem to be 4 ft long, it definitely was smaller than that. Also it was paper thin and was very crispy. So, instead of this, the Masala dosa would be better.
The Mango Lassi was the worst from all that I had tried. It was sour. I told the server that I didn't like it so she didn't charge me for it. I appreciate that gesture. I usually don't like to send dishes or drinks back but that was so sour and lassi is meant to be sweet. I just had to return it.

To end my lunch experience, I ordered Masala Chai which saved the day. 

I don't mind coming to this place for the Rava Dosa but this wouldn't be my first choice.

Service: 2.0 ( It was pretty slow even though there weren't many people)
