vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg The "tapas" name is deceiving, because they're just really Indian appetizers that you'd find anywhere, but the food at Waterfalls is pretty decent and apparently they have good drink specials too, which only really makes sense considering they have a nice big patio in Kensington Market and it's an effective way to get people to have a seat, have a drink, and hey, then maybe those apps/tapas will sound good too.

I had the "famous" butter chicken which was quite tasty (and they allowed me to order the lunch special after hours, not bad), my wife had a chicken tikka sandwich. Both of us were quite happy, though as I recall it was the fries that she liked more than anything else, which seems almost strange.

The service was a little slow given that it was not a busy day, that's the only drag on the rating, but that's really the only knock I could give it. Overall, I was quite happy.
