KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Mixture of Indian and Canadian food. Had the tandoori chicken burger. The underused sweet sauce and the overused white sauce made the food less appetizing than it could have been. The fries and samosas were alright, nothing great. Based on the price and location, it doesn't seem worth another visit. 

The room isn't big enough to fit all the people waiting, but the service is fine. Overall, it's okay.
