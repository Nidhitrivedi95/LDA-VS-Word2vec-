Besides, their non-vegetarian dishes actually have more than two little pieces of meat. Our beef vindaloo had a generous helping of beef. We accompanied the vindaloo with butter chicken, naan and raita. They had a mild chicken karahi that my young daughter enjoyed. The place would be a wonderful choice for business lunches since it has lovely decor and fast service. We will definitely be going back again.
