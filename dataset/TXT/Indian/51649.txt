UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA 5 stars all around: ambience, cleanliness, service (shout out to Biru who helped us order the dishes we couldn't remember the names of), quality (SO, SO FRESH), and flavor (we tried the papadum crackers with chutney, garlic naan, chicken tikka, tandori chicken, garbanzo bean dish, rice pudding, and chai). My husband and I will be a regular!
