RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA I absolutely love tikka masala, but I've been struggling to find one without chicken. This is the first time I've ate at taste of india. I ordered take out and got the paneer tikka masala and it was incredible! The sauce, paneer, everything. My friend ordered  the chicken tikka saag, I tasted a bit and it was wonderful too! 

Only thing I wasn't the biggest fan of was the aloo paratha nan. It seemed to lack flavor and was a bit rubbery in texture. However we ordered regular and garlic nan as well and they were both wonderful-totally made up for the aloo paratha!

Needless to say, this will now be my go to for Indian food in Pittsburgh. Awesome, awesome, awesome.
