eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw What a wonderful vegetarian buffet. I never thought veg will be so delicious. Went there on weekday night and the place was still quite busy.

Food was fresh, wait staff was quick in getting the empty plates cleaned up and refilling drinks.

Food was delicious, fresh and available all the time.
