Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A Pros: $ 9 for buffet
Cons: After reading the rave reviews, I finally wanted to give it a try. We drove for half an hour for the buffet. It is a small place, inexpensive, but there was not much of variety. Some of the dishes were good, but the whole idea of buffet is to taste more variety.

But, if you are living nearer to this restaurant it could be a good option. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place, even though you will be paying only $9 for buffet.
