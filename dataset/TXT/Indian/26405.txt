The moment we were handed our menus I noticed everyone in our party squinting. If you choose to dim your halogens to such an extreme, you need to choose something other than a 9 point font for your menu. I have 20/20 vision and I found myself tilting my head around so my shadow wasn't blocking the menu. Just strange, almost claustrophobic.

This place touts itself as modern-Indian cuisine, and based on the presentation and preparation, it is very non-standard fare.
The plating is elegant and and some of the food is quite good. The samosas were very tasty, however you get 2 small ones for $7. Saag Paneer, which is essentially creamed spinach and farmers cheese, goes for a whopping $15. That's way overpriced, in my opinion. I had the lamb traditional style for my entree and I have to say it was the blandest lamb ever. For Indian food, the spices were missing and the lamb was tough. It was also cut into strips like some kind of stroganoff, which was bizarre. The spicy chicken slivers were very delicious and 4  alarm spicy. This was quite a contrast to the lamb which was so flavourless. 

All in all, it was an interesting experience, but the prices of their food were not justified by the quality or flavours. It just didn't work for me.
I'll stick to the traditional mom & pop Indian restaurant next time.
