KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw What an amazing place to go eat at. My second time here. The flavors of perfectly executed cuisine await you as soon as you open the door. The samosas are over the top tasty and beautifully prepared. The butter chicken mac n'cheese is another one of my favorites. Having enjoyed lunch with smaller groups, I got to see a nice selection of foods out of this place and everyone was thrilled with the flavors and portions alike. If you're in the area and have room in your belly, you need to stop in here. I can only recommend it.
