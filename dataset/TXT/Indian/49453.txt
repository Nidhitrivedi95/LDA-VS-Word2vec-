tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Tried almost everything on the dinner buffet. Everything was simply fantastic. But my FAVORITES were the chicken tikka masala, palak paneer and the mango lassi. All the meat was incredibly juicy and tender. They had TWO lamb dishes! Never have seen that at a buffet. Perfect amount of spice in every dish. Great service and hot garlic naan brought to every table. Ended up eating more than I should because it was amazing tasting. I'll be back for more!
