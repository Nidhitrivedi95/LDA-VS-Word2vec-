-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw Totally amazed that this place offers free chai with a meal! The Thali was super tasty and the price was just right. Plenty of food and a all veg assortment of food. 
Tons of groceries you can pick up as well. 
This place is a must visit when you miss home cooked veg meal. I can now leave in peace back to LA.
