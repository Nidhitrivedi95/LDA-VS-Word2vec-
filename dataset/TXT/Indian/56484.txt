xSuR0FK8cHzBLXowCV3Pyw Feel free to disregard this review if you aren't here for the samosas or the sweets.

I've been here at least a hundred times for both. The vegetarian samosas are only 40 cents and are always fresh! They come with two sauces, both of which are very good. It's my guilty pleasure, but I come here whenever I want to get filled and don't want to spend more then $2. When it comes to the Indian sweets, again, freshness is key. They are consistently fresh each time I buy, and they have a wide variety to choose from. The price isn't bad either. 

I've yet to actually sit down and eat a full meal at this place, and I don't know why, given how much I've liked their samosas and sweets. Maybe I'll visit in the near future and update this review, but for now, it gets a full five stars.
