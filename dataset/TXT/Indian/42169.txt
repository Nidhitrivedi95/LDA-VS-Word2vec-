qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Came here when opened many years back. Not sure if it is still an all you can eat. I've been meaning to return but haven't found the right foodie partner to join me for some Indian.
My memory of this restaurant was a very busy yet enthusiastic owner who was happy to serve around their grand opening. I called in and asked if they have palak paneer? He answered no, asked if I'd be coming today? I said and I would be there soon, he replied then I will specially start making palak paneer for you my friend.
And sure enough he did. Excellent food and price when I went. Hoping to return soon.
