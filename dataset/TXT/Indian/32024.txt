ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg Im not sure how alot of people are rating this place good, but this place was terrible.

Service, food, interior decore, everything was bad.
The lady there was quite rude and over charged us telling us that the price was the old price.... Which means you need to update your god damn menu.

Nothing there satisfied my cravings for some delicious vegetarian indian food with my boyfriend. Definitely not coming back there... And I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT. Do yourself a favour.... Save your money and cravings somewhere more worthy..... I swear to you.
