0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ For years I made peace with mediocre hakka across the GTA. Even the once so popular places in the east or west end lost their charm and flavour with time and popularity... 

Until now!  The hunt ends. Fresh, flavourful, delicious hakka has been found. Well actually many years ago we did get take out from here but never had a chance to come back. Now I'm kinda regretting not coming back sooner. 

We ordered three dishes so we could take some home for tomorrow. The chilli chicken was great!  The spice and pepper fish was crispy and fresh. The Manchurian noodles had the perfect amount of spice and flavour. 

Chilli Chicken House will now forever be our go to hakka place. Move over, other Wok and Rolls...
