fVbZptKCH2lIRS56M1zc6g I wanted to hate on this place based on the first time I visited for take-out and I was completely ignored, but I just can't.

Came here for the buffet lunch.  Note that lunch starts at noon and continues until 3:00 pm.  I came for 11:45 and they were not ready.  This time, as I entered the venue, the owner greeted us and pointed us to a table.  I looked up at the ceiling and saw chinese umbrellas and lanterns hanging.  I look to the left and I see a great view of the Heritage House on Brittania.  I really liked the ambiance.  We were then served with cold water.  Given, we were the first customers at this place, so maybe that's why we were actually attended to.

I was really interested at their green chicken tikka and was hoping it was on the buffet menu, but it wasn't.  Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried.  Loved the goat curry, the meat was still stuck to the bone, which makes for a juicy and flavourful meal.  I also loved the garlic fish, which was cooked hakka style, with curry and sweet and sour flavouring.  The spinach with paneer was also great along with the peas and paneer, which were a little bit on the spicy side.  Chaat papri was great, tandoori chicken and naan were also tasty.

So overall, I do like this place and I will try again.  I'll come back for takeout for the green chicken and see if I will be completely ignored again, which I hope for their sake, they won't.
