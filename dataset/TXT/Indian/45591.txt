ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw How in the world does this place have 4 stars?  I feel like I'm in grade school again and its opposite day.  Because this place is the opposite of "yay! I'm a fan".  (I'm not a fan.)
I have been to several Indian buffets (not locally) as well as traveled through India for a month.  Now granted, nothing is going to really compare to the food I had while actually in India because the flavors there were just as vibrant as the colorful surroundings but India Garden might as well have hamburgers on their menu for as authentic as the food was.  I went for the lunch buffet and its placed in this weird, unlit area.  There are only a few things offered and none that I tried were good.  I know buffets have to be careful about adding to much spice so that they can accommodate varying taste buds but I felt like I was eating a marinara sauce.  The naan bread was decent and brought to you table side.  The rice was average.  I mean..its rice...
My only guess is that because there seem to be so few Indian restaurants around here people don't know what they're missing.  If you have ever had good, flavorful Indian food, don't waste your money!
