FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q The food deserves 5 stars, but the service really brings it down.
                                                                                                                                                                      
We were there several times for lunch buffet and never try their dinner. The service has always been pretty inattentive and sometimes unwelcoming, so never will try dinner.

Their naan bread is super great, always made fresh, so sometimes you gotta wait a little bit; most dishes are above level good--their chicken dishes are tender most of the time. The use of spices is excellent and exotic. I never tried fried food and they do look a bit soggy but again I can't tell. Dessert is always the same but I'm not bothered by that.

This is not a huge buffet, but the food they offer is great.  I like it this way because one really doesn't eat that much.  
 
The thing we don't like is the service, as mentioned. Sometimes servers don't even smile and come and go without saying anything.  Plates on your desk remain there.       

I don't think their servers do that on purpose, it's probably just the Indian way? However that does make the dinning experience sometimes uncomfortable.      Another thing is, when the food is empty, refills are slow or missing. It happens on weekends as well, days you pay more.

We still come back because the food is still pretty good. It's just such a shame that                                                                                                                                                                                                              they would have been such a great restaurant!
