MDiH8mNfMCRV_UHGZ3VXxQ I arrived after lunch when only the mall workers were here shoving their food down on breaks.I had the tikka chicken.The flavor was ok but some pieces were a bit chewy with poor cuts of meat.The naan was tasted like it was frozen and reheated.The basmati rice was cooked nicd.The mint chick pea salad was not good.I ate a few bites and gave up lol.I ate half of my meal and tossed the rest.It came with with green sauce that I didnt like or could identify.The staff was very nice despite the food.
