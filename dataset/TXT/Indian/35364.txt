muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw Hands down the best!  Since leaving London we've been unable to find any Indian food that is comparable to Tandoori Corner in the Streatham Common, South London.
Mohamed, the head chef, is top shelf.  Very modest and a fabulous cook.  Happily he spiced up my last meal, the Chicken Karahi, to perfection.  Also the Beef Nihari I had the first time was excellent.  Genuine chef making genuine Indian, Afghani, Pakistani food.  A rarity here in Phx.  My newest favorite Indian restaurant!
