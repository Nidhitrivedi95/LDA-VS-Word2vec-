qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA I only either come here for sangria or breakfast. Sometimes at the same time...nah,  not really. 

I love the Red Room for the chilled out, dark, nicely decorated aspect. The sangria is great, the drinks are well priced. The food is a bit questionable though and the staff aren't the friendliest. But like a lot of people have already mentioned...it's very much a student hang out and I think for that it fulfills its duty. If you're going to make a night of it though, I would suggest walking the extra five minutes to Nirvana. Same owners, way better place :)
