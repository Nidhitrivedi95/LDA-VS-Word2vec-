hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Good food.  Never oily and has great flavors.  Curry has a little heat to it, which is nice.  Fresh nan.  

Very intimate little restaurant, perfect for lunch discussions with colleagues or a nice dinner date.

Service is a little hit & miss, but it doesn't take away from the quality of the experience overall.
