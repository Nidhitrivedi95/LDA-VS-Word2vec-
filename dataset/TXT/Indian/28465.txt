J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ This place is little and between a row of many Indian Restaurants on Queen St. :)

The buffet can get crowded, tucked in the corner area of the restaurant. 

The dishes are all prepared fresh. I especially liked the Chicken Curry, Beef Curry, Chick Pea Curry, Tandoori Chicken, Flat Naan, Rice Pudding, Fruit and Custard, honey desert balls.These were exceptionally good. Only let down was the butter chicken, this was too sweet. Too much Ragu and sugar. Maybe that how people like it but not me. 

Service was spot on, fast and friendly. Will go back if I'm in the area.
