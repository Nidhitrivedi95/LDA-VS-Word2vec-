Some friends of ours who were in town were here on a layover after flying in some very rich and famous passengers.  

A dinner night was in order and I was excited to hear some tid-bits of their adventures.  We picked this restaurant due to convenience and walking distance to their hotel.

It was late on a Sunday night so the restaurant had only a few guests.  I didn't  have time to Yelp it but so happy to see many of my Yelp friends have been here giving it great ratings.

Service was very, very friendly.  Food was delicious.  Service was prompt and attentive.

Chicken Tiki Masala and lemon rice was fabulous.  We ordered some tasty garlic naan and it was soft, chewy and warm. Yum!

The side of rice that we ordered was enough for a table of four. I asked how big the rice bowl was and he motioned like it was a small bowl-but trust me-like us you'll have too many leftovers. 

We also had the stuffed mushroom as an appetizer and I wouldn't order it again, it was almost like a puff pastry with cream of the mushroom soup on top.  

We each ordered a dish and it was overkill despite our attempts to share.  Three beers, four entrees and an appetizer will set you back $135 so share share share and save save save.

A free Mango Lasee comes with a Yelp check-in so I took advantage of that-and I'm very happy that for free it was tasty. Thank you!

This restaurant is hidden in a strip mall near the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino.  If you're in the hood and looking for some yummy Indian food come here.
