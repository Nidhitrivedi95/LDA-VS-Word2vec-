49sbCG7F2jvqJsfG6-N8Rw I was looking for a good buffet closer to home for that brunch excess on an occasional weekend, and discovered Spice Affair! Great selection of meats, lentils, veggies and desets, and very authentic north Indian flavors. Been back a couple of times since then, and the quality seems consistently good. A very good find, and at $9.99, a great bargain!
