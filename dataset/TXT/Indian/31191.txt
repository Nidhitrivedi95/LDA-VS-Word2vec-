kMgdZVLzAXM1JQwFsPXIlg Soooo Good. Love this place because its arguably the same quality food as big names of Indian food in Toronto such as Banjara for much cheaper. I recommend the Lamb Madras Masala if you like spicy and Tikka Masala if you don't. There are plenty of vegetarian options as well. Last tip, you get to choose rice or roti with your meal, if you are very hungry or just want value for your money get the roti, you get much more curry/meat and hence is more filling.
