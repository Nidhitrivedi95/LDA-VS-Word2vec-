7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ This is my favorite Indian restaurant and as it is my favorite food at this present time, l have tried all Indian restaurants in Charlotte and surrounding areas. We have around 5-6 Indian restaurants in the university area where l live. To me this is the best. Right now l have 6 restaurants close to me and 4 of them are on my street!! Lucky me!!! I always eat the buffet because l love trying all the interesting dishes. Many Indians eat here too!
