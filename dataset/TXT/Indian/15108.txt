CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I went with a friend to the buffet last week. Sometimes with buffets, everything has a similar flavour. Not at Dhaba. Here, every little thing has been given the most wonderful taste and presentation. These people understand hospitality. I felt like a treasured friend when I arrived. It is a remarkable. I love the range of food offered at their lunch. 
Their dinners are great. I went there for lamb curry one evening. Wow! That is amazing. This is absolutely my favourite spot now.
