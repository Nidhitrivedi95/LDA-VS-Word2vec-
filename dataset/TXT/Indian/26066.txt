Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw This is a hidden gem! And now especially hidden because of all the LRT construction on Eglinton. But search a little bit and you'll find some deliciousness. There is a sprawling menu of flavourful delights, and an indecisive mind always go to the thalis. We decided on fish curry and tomato eggplant curry as the main currry. If you pick the thalis, be prepared because there will be a lot of yummy food coming your way. The thalis come with rice, naan, several veggie curries such as lentil or mixed veggies and a small dessert. The tomato eggplant was the delight of the evening with the eggplant and tomato melting together and into the potent and flavourful spices. The fish curry came with lots of what looked like salmon. The fish may have been a touch dry, it was flavourful and the sauce made up for any lost moisture. The naan came out piping hot and with a nice char. It was definitely useful for mopping up all the rich sauces. The service was prompt and cheerful, but not as frequent as I'd like. I needed that water to put out some of the fire from the curries!
