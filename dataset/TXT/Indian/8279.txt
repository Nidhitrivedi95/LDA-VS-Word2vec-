7LNuQqjcjAn0bBlGHIiQzQ Hey all,

Okay, firstly let me say, I'm very genuine the reason I'm writing this review is based on the order I just received I'm hoping it spares someone.

I just spent upwards of $70.00 and got 2 chicken dishes (vindalloo and butter chicken, aloo Gobi, malai kofta, garlic naan and rice).

There was such a tiny portion of chicken as to be unheard of. There was 4 dumplings in the malai kofta (it's about $13) and they were awful and pasty. The $4 odd dollars for he naan, well flavour was good, but there was 1 piece. No folks no joke. $4 - one piece of naan bread.

Over all food was sub par, and extremely over priced for what you get. There is much better to be had elsewhere.

This restaurant used to be good, hence the reviews, and I can't speak to dining in but the take out, in the words of Gordon Ramsay "DAMN!!!" Well that and %^**%%}}!!!?? Rip off!!!
