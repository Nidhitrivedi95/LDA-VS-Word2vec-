S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Never name a restaurant after a person that was famous for fasting. If you happen to eat at this dump that's decorated to be some type of indian EDM dance club, you will probably end up like Ghandi and want to fast for the next several days. The one and only waiter was so big and tough looking and acting that it seemed like he should have been a Sultan's bodyguard instead of in the customer service business. What I want to say is that this guy is the world's worst waiter but is so intimidating that I wouldn't dare complain about it (to his face). Their prices are too high for low quality food. We ordered two very different dishes and they tasted almost identically the same. I hate this fucking place. I hope their tandoori oven melts this papadum shack off the face of the earth. Fuck you!
