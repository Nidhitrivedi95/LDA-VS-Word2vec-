S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA I found New India Gate through a Yelp search. I was impressed by all the good reviews and decided I had to try it.
My husband and I went last night on our date night. The restaurant is clean and modern looking. We were greeted by one of the owners (it's owned by 2 brothers). 
The brothers were so personable and fun. They make you feel like you're an old friend and were always available for drink refills or for extra mint chutney! 
We ordered a variety of food. We started with the vegetable snack plate that had a variety of deep fried yummy snacks. Very good and nicely seasoned.
The goat curry is delicious. The goat meat is so tender and the sauce is yummy. We ordered the basmati rice which was light and fluffy. The shrimp korma.... I will sing the praises of this dish! The shrimp were fork tender and the gravy is the ultimate comfort food! Order the garlic naan so you can soak up all the goodness with it! 
We were given a sample of the sweet mango lassi. It was thick and creamy. I could have downed a gallon of the stuff easy! 
We opted for some dessert to round out our meal. We ordered the gulab jamun and the pistachio kulfi. The gulab jamun was good. A little more dense than I like. But the kulfi.... wow! It was so delicious! You HAVE to try it!
We will definitely be back to try more of their food!
