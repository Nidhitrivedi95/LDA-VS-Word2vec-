o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw The food is delicious, and they have a bar now!!! The prices are fair. I'm a very picky Eater and so are my friends, but everyone I always invite (because it's my favorite place) has no complaints and they actually enjoy the food!! Its really far from my house but the drive is worth it.
