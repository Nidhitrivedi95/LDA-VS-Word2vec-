JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Picture it: nine hungry Yelpers after an Elite event up at the Speedway. Christi K fired up her Yelp app and found this little hidden gem. A solid 4.5 star Indian restaurant in Concord? We had to go check it out. 

First things first: your GPS may take you to another little shopping center across the way where there is an Adam and Eve. Please note that Aroma is actually in the strip mall next to Friendly's. #TechnologyFail

Shout out to Tonya P for leading the ordering charge. She's my go to every time we hit up an Indian restaurant. Our order: channa bhatura, paper masla dosa, baby corn manchurian, regular naan, garlic naan, kashmiri naan, dal makhani, aloo gobi fry masala, butter chicken, chicken chettinadu, and some adult bevvies. I was the only one who wanted the baby corn. What can I say? I'm from Nebraska. I liked it and I think it was a surprise hit for the table. The shining star overall was the butter chicken. So damn good. Looks like I'll be finding reasons to drive up to Concord just so I can get this dish and some garlic naan. 

Despite the large group, service was good and seamless. Our server was nice and helpful. He was able to keep checks separately flawlessly. He gave us all dessert. I can only describe it as a donute hoIe soaked in some kind of sweet syrup. 'll be back. Seriously, who wants to go get butter chicken right now?

One other random note: they are closed on Mondays.
