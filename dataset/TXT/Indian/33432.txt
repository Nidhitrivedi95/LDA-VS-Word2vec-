LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw I am a recent fan of Indian food and have only had three places that serve it and no expert on the matter. As such, I would say this is very good and the staff is very helpful. 

This was my first Indian food experience and I have came back on many occasions. I always come for the lunch buffet (M-F 11-2:30, S-S 12-3) and they always have a big selection. They boast that they have 45 items which I am sure includes the condiments because there are usually only 10 main dishes (50% vegetarian). The Naan is some of the best I have had.

They have a big menu for lunch or dinner (Tandoor, Chicken, Lamb, Seafood and Vegetarian).  If you have never had Indian food I would highly recommend this place for your first meal.
