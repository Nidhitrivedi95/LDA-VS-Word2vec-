Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Well I'm an Indian so I might be a bit too finicky about indian food. I went in the afternoon and the buffet was okay. There were no special indian dishes just the regular stuff. This place actually reminded me of home cooked food. I didn't like the ambience but the staff was very generous.
