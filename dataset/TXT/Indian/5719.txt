So flavorful and spicy but not too much that you couldn't enjoy the flavors. My friends had the goat curry and chicken mango chutney curry. We all shared of course,  the mango sauce was amazing. The goat curry was very flavorful. We also had the Naan, we each tried a different selection, plain, butter, and garlic, all were great.
