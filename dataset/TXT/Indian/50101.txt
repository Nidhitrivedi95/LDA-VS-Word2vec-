U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw On holiday in Montreal, I searched for an Indian restaurant that served dosas and came up with the Bombay Choupati which was in slightly unfamiliar territory for me. After a few GPS misdirections, I finally found this gem and was overwhelmingly surprised! The mango lassi was creamy fruity and delicious.  The vegetarian lunch special plate that I ordered was excellent!  I am heading back next weekend for more more more!!! This is the best Indian restaurant outside of Mumbai (IMHO).
