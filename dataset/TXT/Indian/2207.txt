_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA I've never dined in. Only ordered through Ubereats. I freaking love this place. When I order it, my whole family gets excited. I just reheated the bhindi, spinach, biriyani and tadka dal and it was orgasmic. All slopped together. Real Indian style lol the Amritsari fish, mirch chicken, chicken 65, and everything I listed above are REALLY GOOD. Some GREAT. I'm actually intrigued to dine in now looking the pics. Perhaps I'm only privy to a delivery menu. And I simply can't have that lol This place has never let me down. And I'm Indian
