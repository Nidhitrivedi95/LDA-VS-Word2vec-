C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I got the Spicy Peanut and Cilantro Chicken. 

I came for lunch on a...monday, I think(?) at about two. Wasn't busy, which was good. Food was delicious- simple, flavourful, fulfilling and delicious. I also had a glass of sangria and really enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.

Definitely a good place to take a vegetarian friend to, since their choices seem to be pretty good for both meat eaters and non-meat eaters alike. A good spot to enjoy a relaxed evening with a date or maybe a friend or two, as their dinner menu looks pretty good.

I also like how they have a variety in hot drinks that extends beyond coffee and/or tea. The menu has alot of variety and options too, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.
I'd definitely come back
