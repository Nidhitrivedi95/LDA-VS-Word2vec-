Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw I asked my indian friends to take me to a superb indian restaurant in the city and they took me here, so i had extremely high expectations. Overall, it was good, but it didn't blow me out of the water. Maybe it's because my heart is set on indian food from Penang, Malaysia, where I had the best indian food in my life. Or maybe it's because the things that they ordered weren't my kind of thing I would order (lamb roganjosh, seekh kabab, chilli chicken) and when i asked for tandoori chicken, they ordered it bonelessssss for heaven's sakes! (Chicken tikka boneless). Boneless is always so dry! Anyway the only thing that I really enjoyed was the butter chicken. And the naan was good. The chilli chicken was too sweet for me (and maybe cuz i had preconceived idea that it would be similar to Hakka chilli chicken which is stupendous and spicy and salty) , the lamb was meh, the seesh kabab was good I guess but not amazing-give-me-another-one-fantastic. So yea everything was just standard for me, still nothing that persuades me to fave some indian dishes. But later on my friends told me they had asked to tone down on the spice, to "accommodate" us non-indian eaters. Sigh. Anyway, ill continue my search for amazing indian resto in Toronto!
