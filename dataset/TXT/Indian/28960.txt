jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Great Indian food. We are a family of five visiting Las Vegas. Our kids like Indian, but are picky. They ate every bite. We kept it simple with chicken curry and chicken tikka masala with naan. We picked this restaurant after reading a lot of reviews on yelp. We very pleased with our choice. Don't gamble on an Indian restaurant on a great trip to Vegas. Take your family here!
