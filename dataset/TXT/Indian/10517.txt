9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw Admittedly, last night's dinner was my first-ever roti. It was also concequently the first time that, a la Lisa Simpson, I could see through time. I like my heat but holy hey, that "medium' was suicide-wing level. One star removed for having to deface the delicious flavours with ketchup to help it go down. 

(Side note: The masala fries were fantastic, and did not require any sort of ketchup dousing.)
