_qQYIW24-8nWwjg9-uL0LQ Great for takeout! I work nearby and they're pretty decent at having my order ready within 15-20 min. Their customer service needs a little work sometimes, but overall they're acceptable. I like having the option of an "individual" or regular size. Chicken vindaloo is good, nice spices to it. Love the daal tadka and the naan is very fresh and tasty. Pakoras are also top-notch. They never seem to be all that busy for such a large restaurant, but they do have good food. Will continue going and trying different items.
