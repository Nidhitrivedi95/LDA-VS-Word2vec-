m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw I was surprised by how much I liked the food.  My first  time there far exceeded admittedly low expectations.  My last Indian food experience (Basmati) was terrible.  Chicken Korma was tasty, mildly spicy, and as tender as I could imagine.  Samosas, 3 chutneys and naan were great.  Service was leisurely, but not bad.  Our wait missed a couple clues, like presenting the check promptly, and collecting it the moment a credit card hit the folio.  We were there nearly two hours, and not in a hurry.  This might be a problem if you're fitting lunch into a lunch hour.   Decor is nice, friendly hostess,  There's a lot to like here.
