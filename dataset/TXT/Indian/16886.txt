DN_cXMaeAUFFLm6eUOsNWQ I would not go to this restaurant cozy of the service, even on less busy day the service is terrible. The servers don't even bother to take orders over sitting for 30 mins and nobody coming to get order I decided to leave. That was last visit to this place, food is good but service omg terrible.
