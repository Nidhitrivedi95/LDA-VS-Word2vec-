MKCbZC6KR4oxA4LOQAVdhw Went there yesterday for lunch and it was really great! Price point was solid for a good amount of food. I ordered the Fry Girl (spicy) and I loved it. The cashew curry dipping sauce was great. I will say that their version of "spicy" is not really spicy at all. I also wouldn't mind if you could have an option of adding chicken to this sandwich (I'm not sure that you couldn't ask and they would oblige...but there's no mention of it on the menu). Still excellent though. The outside was fluffy and crispy and warm, and the inside was ooey goodness with marsala potatoes, cheese and cauliflower I think. The hubs ordered The Frankie with chicken and he loved his as well. We also got a spanakopita and it was the best I've ever had. Definitely going back! The owner was also super friendly and attentive. I hope this place sticks around and extends its hours!
