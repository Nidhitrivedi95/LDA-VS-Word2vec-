Food- ok to horrible .(some items of the buffet were fine). 
Service- waiters and the people working looked so sad and gloomy as if they were all stressed out.The food items in buffet were either mis labeled or no labels at all.

It's good they are not located in San Francisco Bay Area else they would have been out of business long time back ;)
