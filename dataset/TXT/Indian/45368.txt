s8N66BJ9P-sqhisX47o1Sg After driving by this place for the last two years, I had a roti craving and needed to satiate that and my curiosity. Thanks to these Yelp reviews I decided to try Roti Time. I am so glad I did! My experience was consistent with previous reviews.  The place is plain inside, but clean. The smell inside this place really got my taste buds excited... the wait for food might be welcomed by some!  The order process wasn't clear, however. I called in my order and don't recall hearing an order number but upon arriving people were quoting theirs. So be prepared when calling in...

I ordered just the butter chicken roti and it was fantastic! I have not stopped thinking about it :) I was pleased to find that it didnt have too many potatoes and would call the mix 'just right'. Give this place a try and enjoy.
