ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA This place rocks,     I have taken many out of town guests here and they have all said the same thing, EXCELLENT !  and quite the surprise ! 

I have never had bad food from here,  once I did take out and they made my Chicken Tikka Masala  to spicy,, I called just to let them know the kitchen made a mistake,     THEY insisted on driving me over a fresh order ! ! !    I went back instead, ,  since I only live a few miles away.   MY fresh order was waiting on me,,  AND a few extra things !  :)  

Im going tomorrow for take out !  Dang this made me hungry  LOL
