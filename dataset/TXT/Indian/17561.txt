The food is tasty and the service is friendly and very fast which is good as you don't have to hang around for a while waiting for your order. The menu is very expansive and they offer a set menu for two people with starters, main dishes, rich, poppadoms and side bits for £15 which is very reasonably. The main dishes are in the region of £5-8 and they have good selection of veggie dishes to. 

HOWEVER, they failed a health inspector report in March as the staff failed to wash their hands and there were mouse droppings on the floor. The owners have since said that have completely cleaned up the place, but it does make you think twice about going there fore food which is a shame as the food is quite wonderful.
