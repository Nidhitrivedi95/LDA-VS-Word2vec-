NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I am a fan and I've FALLEN IN LOVE with this place. This is an Indian take on chipotle and I must say I might not be going to chipotle anymore lol. I'm visiting from California and I wanted to try something Indian haha. I wish they would expand to California. This restaurant will never disappoint. Will make you come back for more. I am Indian and never had something so savory and so GOOD!
