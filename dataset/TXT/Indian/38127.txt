ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I went for Lunch BUFFET today. Saw on their website and it was $11.95. Food was 4/10. not much option for veggie/vegetarian. Water was on the floor, I saw one person slipped while taking food (in the buffet line).

When the final check comes, it was $14.95 + tax. I asked your website says, $11.95, so why its $14.95, I got answer, sir its holiday special. I was like, so its special for you, not for customers and also their website was not updated. WTFF. Also, I went for 
LUNCH BUFFET @ 1pm and not for Brunch Buffet.

Avoid this place if you are a veggie/vegetarian. In the end, you will be disappointed.
