FTQJaBRZLttdYvYTKgqEFg This is an excellent place for Indian food. It's near the office and I had it a few times on my own and also from office team lunches. 

I've tried a variety of dishes and nothing was ever bad. I've had dahl, chicken korma, tandoori, goat curry and the list goes on. The portions are very respectable and each a la carte order can probably fill up 1.5 adults. Meals come with either naan or rice. Get rice or extra naan cause 1 naan is not enough to soak up all that wonderful sauce.

Price wise you are looking at $13-17 per dish. It's more expensive than a lot of Indian lunch buffet but you get quality here. And besides, 1 dish is more than enough for 1 person. 

I will come back whenever I have a craving for indian food.
