Creative cuisine.

Attentive and charming service. 

Warm ambience. 

They create food as mild or as spicy as you wish.

Casual and dressy. 

Okay...one negative...the music is a wee loud. We were in the front by the window so I've no complaint but would not have been thrilled in the back. That said, no one complained in the back and it was busy. I'm probably just getting old. Sad. 

I've been twice and my guests who live in Toronto loved it.
