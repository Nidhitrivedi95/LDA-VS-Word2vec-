Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA If you're a Student living in Toronto, on a very tight budget and in need for good food? Well look no further! This is the place for you! It's cheap, fresh tasting, good on flavors and as well good service! I always have my food on takeout due to the ugly Decor, but not let that fool you! The Food makes up for it! The food that are ordered are: Chili Chicken with gravy, Manchurian Chicken,  Chicken Fried Rice and Chili Paneer and all that for a decent price! Will come back again!
