UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg The combination of price and quality makes this my favourite Indian place in the city. The butter chicken, shahi shrimp, and naan bread are amazing. I've honestly never had a dish here that I didn't like. The restaurant also has bell service, which is another nice touch. The reason I'm giving this restaurant 4 starts out of 5 is that many of the services seem to get easily confused. On multiple occasions, they've had a great deal of trouble splitting the bill, and sometimes forget routine tasks, such as serving papadum as a free appetizer. However, this doesn't stop me from coming back or bringing friends here for dinner.
