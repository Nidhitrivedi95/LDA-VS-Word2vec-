Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q We came here on a weekend afternoon. The place wasn't too packed. 

We ordered the Chicken Mirch Tikka , naan and butter chicken.
During our wait, they offered us some papadum and two dips while we were waited. The dips are tasty and a good starter before we start our meal.

Our favourite is the chicken Mirch TIkka. It is so juicy and moist. 
The butter chicken is a bit too dry. But the curry itself is good. 
So we kind of combing the meat from mirch tikka dish with our naan together.

We will come back as It is our second/ third favourite Indian restaurant in GTA.
