KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ 5 stars purely because of the cult power and following of this place. Its an institution, most of the food is good but steer clear of any of the curries which are too oily because they may not be fresh. Opt for anything that is cream based (such as the butter of Kashmiri chicken). It's also a great place to hang out for some Chai and Pakoras or Samosas which are quite delicious.
