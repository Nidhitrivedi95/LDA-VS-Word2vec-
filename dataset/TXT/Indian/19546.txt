FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg We have tried many different indian restaurants and this one is definately top 2. We had veggie samosas to start which were hot and delicious. For the mains we had chicken vindaloo, baingan bharta (eggplant) and the beef korma. They were all so good! The peices of beef in the korma were so tender and fall apart in the rich sauce. We over ate from how much we were enjoying ourselves. The naan here was incredible. We upgraded to the garlic naan and the way they make it here has so much flavor and its huge! 
To make the experience even better we were served by the owner who took such great care of us. He knew it was our first time there so he explained what he thought was good and what foods compliment eachother most. We will definately return no questions asked!
