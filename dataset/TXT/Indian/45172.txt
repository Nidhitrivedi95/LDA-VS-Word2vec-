S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA I have a new favorite lunch spot. Wow the food was fantastic. I sampled almost everything on the lunch buffet and my taste buds are dancing. The goat was sumptuous and the tandoori chicken is as good as I have had anywhere. There is also plenty to love if you are vegitarian too with a nice array of vegetable dishes spiced to perfection. Not over priced or over spiced. Lunch buffet is $7.99 (currently on special for $6.99).
I'll be a regular here.
