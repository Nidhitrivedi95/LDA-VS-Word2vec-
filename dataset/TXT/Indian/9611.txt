8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ Loved their butter chicken!! fantastic sauce, juicy white meat, just perfect with their delicious rice, it was really fantastic. Sadly I have not tried anything else here so all I can comment on is the butter chicken, which again was delicious!! Naan was also good but small, and if I was to complain about anything, it would be that there could have been more chicken, there was easily 3x more sauce than the chicken...
