-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Great food and amazing service. The ambiance was a little lackluster but I would prefer great food over ambiance any day. We had a friends birthday dinner here and everything we ordered was cooked and seasoned very well. Food arrived quickly and we were checked in on frequently. I would come back again and recommend this place to anyone.
