TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA When the craving to have some Indian food hit us...we found ourselves at Tamarind to try some of their offering. 

Located in Greentree the decor of this restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.Tamarind claims to specialize in North Indian, South Indian & Indo-Chinese cuisines.

On being seated we were quickly greeted by our server who was attentive and friendly. We decided to try the kebabs & some Indo-Chinese dishes. The kebabas.. were delicious! I absolutely loved the sheekh kebab! It was flavorful, succulent with the essentials a great kebab should have! We also tried the tandoori chicken which was pretty good.

 From the Indo-Chinese cuisine, which is basically Chinese food cooked with Indian spices, we tried the chicken 65 & fried rice. These were good but extremely spicy for my palate even though we requested medium spicy food. I wished it was less spicy so I could have tasted more of these dishes instead of washing my bites with water and mango lassi. My friend on the other hand, who has a better spice tolerance devoured his meal. 

Overall, it was a good experience... especially for the price. Will definitely come back for more!
