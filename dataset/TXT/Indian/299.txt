-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Had dinner here tonight. The best Indian Food I have ever had, and I have eaten Indian food everywhere in phoenix. The servers were so attentive and they brought us complimentary dessert. I loved the chicken tikka masala and the paneer was to die for. I also highly recommend the garlic naan and the naan with indian cottage cheese. This place really deserves 10 stars, not just 5. The atmosphere was great. I really hope that this place does well; they certainly deserve too. I am glad that they are in Tempe!

Thank you again for all your kindness tonight!
