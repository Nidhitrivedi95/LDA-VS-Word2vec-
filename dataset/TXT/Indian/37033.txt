o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I ordered the paneer wrap, and it was one loud the best I've tasted. The service was quick and the server was helpful. The only reason I'm not giving a 5-start is because I've only been here once and it was when there was only one other table occupied. But I definitely look forward to introducing my friends here!
