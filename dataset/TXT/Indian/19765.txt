FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Hands down best Indian food in Madison.  I feel like I have said this before about another Indian restaurant but this time I mean it!   I think the thing that elevates this place is a couple of things: the level of service and the quality of the food.

The set up of this place isn't like other Indian buffets.  The space is huge and is decorated really nice.  It is a great place for a date or just to decompress during lunch.   The quality of the food stands out above others. The flavors are great and the food is perfectly seasoned.  One thing that I like about this place compared to other places is that they don't water down their lunch curry's.  I have been to other places and it seems like this happens a lot.  This place doesn't seem to do this so you are getting the full flavor of the food.

I usually order take out here and get the goat curry because it is seriously the best around.  Nice pieces of meat and really fluffy rice.  Another thing about this place is that the service is outstanding.  When I call in they are so polite and patient and the same when I pick up.  The person at the counter is so pleasant and we usually chat it up a bit before I leave.  

Madison has SO many options for Indian food.  This place however is head and shoulders above the others!
