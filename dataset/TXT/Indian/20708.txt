g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ To the gentleman serving me, please don't get upset cause I didn't get any alcohol. If I'd like to take leftovers, I'd appreciate it if I didn't have to pack the food myself. I think it should be taken to the kitchen, and then brought out magically packed!  That's how other restaurants do it! Magic!! 

App platter for 2 only had 1 samosa and 2 of everything else. But why?? 

Smells really good outside. Food wasn't bad. I guess my curry is with the service. OK it doesn't work as well as beef... 

Don't you dare only get a mango Lassi to drink! 

I'm sorry next time I'll buy two bottles of wine! Please just don't make me pack my food at the table again! :'(
