gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I love Indian food but we usually go to India Palace so when I got a $25 off coupon, we decided to try them out! I am so glad we did!  Their prices seem to be slightly lower than India Palace and their portions were definitely much larger.

We had the vegetable samosa to start- it was a tad salty but with the two chutneys, they really balanced out.

We also had:
Chili Naan- was good, not spicy at all

Chicken Tikka- same as tandoori chicken but boneless. It was good, some pieces were a little dry but overall pretty good.  I don't understand the french fries on top though...that kinda threw me off..hmmm.

Lamb Vindaloo- delish.  Lamb were actual pieces of lamb, not the ground lamb like some places use.  Very flavorful, not too gamey.

Aloo matter- potatoes and peas in a sauce, again, large portion and large chunks of potatoes

Overall- everything was excellent, medium spice still gave all the entrees a little kick.  I just asked for hot sauce on the side to add to my food since I really like it spicy.

Will definitely be back, next time with my daughter as I know she will really enjoy it!  No butter chicken on the menu but think I'll try the chicken korma next!
