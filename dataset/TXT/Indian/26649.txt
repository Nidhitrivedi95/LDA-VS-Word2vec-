iDCAMAg7XPBx2g-82AIsgg So I'm sure everyone knows the whole story. Mr Butt used to be a partner and split to start his own restaurant away from the original King Place. I stick to the classic - Butter Chicken Combo which is delicious!!  Not the highest quality by any means but delicious. The food here is definitely better than the original King Palace but it might not be worth dealing with the crackheads that are constantly hanging out near here. I was walking towards the restaurant and got cornered by a couple of crackheads and almost bullied into giving them money. Definitely not worth it. I really hope Mr Butt relocates because the food is sooooo good.

4 stars instead of 5 because of all the crackheads.
