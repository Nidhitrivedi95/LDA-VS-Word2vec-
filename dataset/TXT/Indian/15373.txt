ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ The food is good, the service is HORRENDOUS.

We were there on a Friday night and imagine that, the place was completely empty.  We had a female server who too forever to take our orders, and then promptly forgot about it. About 15 minutes later, with no lassi or appetizer on our table, a male server came up to us and gave us the menu....we told him we already ordered and he looked confused.
20 minutes later, our appetizer (chat) came. It was good. another 10 minutes later, our "chicken" vindaloo came, and it turned out to be beef. We didnt complain. We did, however, after another 5 minutes, asked what happened to our sweet lassi and mango lassi and our saag paneer. 10 minutes later, the mango lassi came. another five minutes, came the saag paneer. We again asked for the sweet lassi and it finally came. We also asked for water from the start and that never came.

After finishing our meal, we waited approximately 10 minutes hoping to see our server, who disappeared. I finally waved down the female server who looked at me, and then walked away and never came back. I had to go to the bar to pay. 

What would have been an enjoyable meal was completely marred by the service, or lack thereof. I think there are way to many better indian restaurants to put myself through the torture again.
