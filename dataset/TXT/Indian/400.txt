-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g My wife and I went after getting a $30 for $15. We went to Nandini for dinner. (They do have a lunch buffet that we want to try out soon).

Good: For an appetizer my wife ordered the Chicken Pakoras which were great, rich, flavorful and had two dipping sauces one like a chili pepper paste and the other a sweet tangy sauce. 

For dinner she had the Palak Paneer which was VERY fresh and VERY good with a side of rice. 

I had a serving of Lamb Naan (again very fresh, and very good) and the Spicy Shrimp Vindaloo for dinner. The shrimp were big and cooked perfectly the sauce was great as well. (also had a side of rice). I also had some Mango Lassi which was probably some of the best I've had.

The owner gave us complimentary samples of tea, a crispy bread (can't remember the name) and a delicious desert (deep fried dough balls in syrup). 

Portions are a good size, the menu is well-priced, and very reasonable for the quality of service and food.

We will return with or without a groupon. 

For those of you "spicy-phobes" you can order your dish mild, medium, or spicy. As someone who eats spicy foods on a regular basis I can tell you the spicy isn't unbearable, it'll clear out your sinuses and still has a great flavor. 

Bad:

None really, I wish I had more room for food. 

Final thoughts:

It's a great place to eat and I highly recommend going there. Some of the best Indian food I've had since moving here in July of '13.

If I HAD to have a "complaint" the only thing I would say is: They don't have any alcoholic beverages, I wouldn't mind seeing a few Indian beers on the menu, as I really do enjoy Indian beer.
