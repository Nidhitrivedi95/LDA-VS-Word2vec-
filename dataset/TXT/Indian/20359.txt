FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA This place has excellent Indian food. I am no expert, but it's authentic and each dish is so well prepared. The staff is friendly and accommodated take-out, no problem. I've tried several of the dosas and they all are tasty and freshly made. The chili idly was spicy and very good. The saag paneer was some of the best I've tasted. You can also tell this is a great spot because all the local Indian folks eat here! Highly recommended!
