SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Bye far one of the better Indian food places I have been to 

Chicken wings with dipping sauce -- OMG the sauce is amazing caught myself dipping the naan bread into it. 

Chicken samsosa - was good just a little less stuffing but great

Green and red sauces -- the green dipping sauce was soo good almost tomateo salsa like and the red wing was amazing 

Also had chicken tandorri -- really good not dry can pull apart chicken. 

Dessert naan 

Overall very excited to learn about this place, really great food spices and all. I have been craving Indian food since I got introduced in Phx. This beets them hands down. 

Will be back Great taste, Great Flavor etc..
