kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I came here when they first opened for takeout. I was very disappointed in their service as it took 30 minutes for my food to come out (even though the restaurant seemed empty). So when I came here a second time for takeout I was very happy to see that their service has improved a lot! My food only took 5-10 minutes this time - Yay!

I've now had the Volcano Chicken and the Panang Curry with Tofu. Out of those two the Panang Curry was definitely my favorite. The sauce that came with the Volcano Chicken was too sweet for me, however the Panang sauce had just the right amount of heat/sweetness. All of the veggies and proteins are cooked very well, my favorite is definitely the sweet potatoes mixed in. I also ordered 2 Crab Rangoons on my last visit. They were okay, not the best I've ever had but I would order them again.

For quick and fairly cheap thai food, this place hits the spot!
