YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ My favourite Indian restaurant in the city. Just because of the convenient location and the great tasting food, the place feels like home. The Chana bathura is beyond amazing. The non-vege thali is pretty decent, however they increased the price recently. The butter chicken and lamb curries are super delicious and I prefer their naan a lot more than their chicken biriyani. The chicken biriyani includes the same chicken from the butter chicken, rather than legs making it less tasty. The naans are very fresh and fantastic to eat with the curries.
