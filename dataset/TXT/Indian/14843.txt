cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Great for any of the winterlicious menu in terms of value and offering. Every item was AMAZING.
Service was a little short for a packed resto.
I dont know about the ala carte but I am thinking its a good sign...

Cocktails were horrible (watered down). Stick with wine and beer
