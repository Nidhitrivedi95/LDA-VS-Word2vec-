YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A We love trying Indian food while traveling and make it a priority to try some from every place we visit. This was a fantastic restaurant located conveniently near St. Lawrence Market. The service was great and we had no issues throughout our meal. The food was fantastic and the butter chicken in particular was delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and would definitely come back if we're in Toronto again!
