Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I was in Parma visiting a friend, and we ordered dinner from here. I'm Indian, and I generally have lower expectations from Indian restaurants in the USA, because I understand the constraints they may face in terms of culinary talent and access to ingredients, and also the pressure to appeal to a wider audience, not all of whom can handle copious amounts of heat and spice. Also, most "Indian" restaurants in the USA are really just focused on Mughal and North Indian food, which tends to be heavy. 

Having said that, the takeout from Jaipur Junction managed to trip over the low, low bar of my expectations. We ordered paneer tikka as a starter, and navratan korma and shahi paneer as entrees (both of which were served with a naan), and we ordered an extra naan as well. 

The packaging was terrible, and all of the containers were topsy turvy by the time they reached us. I took out the paneer tikka (supposed to be a dry dish), and it leaked orange colored liquid everywhere. The paneer itself was dry and tasted of nothing, and the accompanying onion masala was only slightly better.

Orange stained mediocrity was the theme of the meal. The shahi paneer was absurdly sweet, with chewy chunks of paneer, and all the naans were slightly soggy. The navratan korma fared comparatively better, with an abundance of veggies and a curry that had a semblance of spice and flavor.

I ended the meal really wishing that I had made the effort to drive out to Choolah, another Indian restaurant in the area that I had visited on my last trip, and was blown over by.

I get the urge that Indian restaurants have to pander to a broader audience, but it would serve Jaipur Junction well to at least be a little authentic!
