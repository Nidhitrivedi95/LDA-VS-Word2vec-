Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg The food here is quite solid Indian food. It may not be exceptional, but I really enjoyed everything. The mango lassi was particularly good. I also really liked the atmosphere. It was a bit fancy, but not stuffy or overdone and felt more modern than many Indian places. I would definitely return.
