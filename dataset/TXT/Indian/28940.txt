jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q The lunch buffet was amazing.  We showed up at 11:00 and had the place to ourselves.  The food was hot, fresh, and the service was impeccable.  Though a very nice selection, I think I tried almost everything on the buffet.   The goat and butter chicken were my favorites.  The restaurant was on the second floor, which was a little hard to find, but had a great view of the airport.  Having never been there or have looked at a menu, I was extremely impressed how reasonable this place was considering the experience I had.  I would highly recommend them.  My only concern was how few of people were there at a prime lunch time.
