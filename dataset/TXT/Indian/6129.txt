3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Awesome!  Awesome! My fiancé and I eat a lot of Indian food back home (Queens, NY) and I'll say this food is better than most we've eaten in NY. Sooo much flavor. Sooo many chooses for the buffet lunch. We visit Vegas often and were getting tired of eating like tourists and have decided to eat where the locals go. Everyone here is friendly and smiling. Very nice people. This is a family owned restaurant and we spoke with owner for a few minutes. Our water was always topped off and with so many food choices we practically rolled out of the place. We will definitely eat here every time we're in town.
