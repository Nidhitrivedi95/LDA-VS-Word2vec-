Tushar and Bina Shah put out the best pure veg Indian food imaginable.  Their selection is always varied, with splendid dals and vegetable dishes, and always a few sweets.   The crowning touch though are Bina's hand made breads; they really lift the experience into an ethereal realm.  Her dokha is scrumptious too.
