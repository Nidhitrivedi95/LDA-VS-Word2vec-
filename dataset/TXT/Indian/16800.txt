DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg My friend recommended this place since she's vegan. If you haven't been to a Indian restaurant before, I would start here because their price isn't too bad. I paid $12 dollars for lunch and it was all you can eat (vegetarian and vegan) foods. When you arrive they will ask you if you want their bread which is like a pita that has potatoes in the middle of it. It's very good! I also tried their mango drink, I forgot what it was called but it was alright. I've had better. I think I would only go here for lunch not for dinner because that's just too much food for a late dine.
