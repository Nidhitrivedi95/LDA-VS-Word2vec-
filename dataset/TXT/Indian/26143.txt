We ordered around 8 items, which is quite a bit for five people. Even though we were spending quite a bit of money there WITH reservations, they were constantly trying to rush us out. Halfway through the meal, they would come up to us and ask us if we wanted to pack it up. We said no, we are still eating. And they came up to us a few more times after that WHILE we were still eating! If you want their food, get take out, they will prefer it.
