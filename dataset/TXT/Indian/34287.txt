MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ This is a great restaurant and I don't understand why it isn't busier. The location is great being just off of Pinnacle Peak and Pima Rd. Unlike many Indian restaurants the decor, crystal, plates, silverware are really nice and elegant. They have lovely indoor and outdoor dining options.

The cuisine is simply outstanding. The quality of the sauces, meats, vegetables is top notch. Our waitress was delightful and the owner/manager came to our table and he was very nice and knowledgeable about his cuisine and Indian cuisine in general.

This place has to catch on because I get the feeling that if it started getting packed, it would be one of the more popular restaurants in Northern Scottsdale. We will be regulars.
