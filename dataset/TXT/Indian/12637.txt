B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg First time going yesterday for lunch. AMAZING, the flavor the service, the price and again the flavor! We had Chicken Kabob's as appetizer, chicken done perfectly and the chutneys that came with it were delicious. We had Chicken Curry and Paneer Masala. The flavors were amazing. And our final bill was so reasonable! We definitely will be going again and again!.
