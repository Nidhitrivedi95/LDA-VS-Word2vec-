cQ5flA0MB40EKI78rtrNlg Went for a late supper with a couple of family members on a friday. The restaurant was empty ...hesitated for a moment seeing that they had no other customers at the time. Given that the only other option was Lahore tikka (which has okay food but terrible service) - decided to give it a try.

The owner was very polite and she had some great recommendations. The menu itself is short but has all the essentials. Food was cooked up fresh and served in about 15-20 minutes. The waiter also promptly took drink orders and refilled waters during this time.

We ordered a fresh ontario lamb curry and a chicken curry, as well as some bbq items. Everything was delicious. The food had lots of flavour and the spices weren't overwhelming. The naan bread was among the best I've had - soft, chewy and melt in your mouth good, and the lamb curry was perfect (no smell). Best of all, the food wasn't overly greasy and oily - the kind that makes you feel sick after.

Only recommendation for owners: the lamb had mostly bone and not much meat. Even though it was tender and flavourful, it may be short on quantity for customers looking to order "family style" to share.

In short - would I recommend this? Yes. And over most of the options on gerrard.
