ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Stopped by for lunch before heading over to Kohl's for some shopping because the girlfriend simply loves it more than anything else, well, perhaps not as much as coffee.  
The lunch price was $10.99 p/p and that part I like.  I wanted a King Fisher beer to go with my lunch, but alas, they don't have the bloody liquor license yet.  The jolly owner says they will soon.  
The food was good.  The presentation was nice and the place was clean and bright.  And thank god Bollywood was not playing on the TV
