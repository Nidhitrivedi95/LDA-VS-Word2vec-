CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ Good job Masala Bites. The reason I say this was we tried out this restaurant about 2 years ago when it just started and not very happy about the taste of food and happened to give it one more try last week. The food is very different now... good choice of buffet both for veg and non-vegetarians. The taste is far more better and I would say perfect now and I remember the staff who are just as courteous as they were years ago... always smiling and welcoming.
