ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Oh my god! I never had this bad of service before in all my life. The restaurant  is empty but we had to wait almost forever for our food. First, they brought us frozen bottled water because the tap water tastes like garbage, so I complained about the frozen bottled water and they sent us a second one to fix the problem. My son even tried to use the candle to melt the ice in the first one...anyways, when they gave us the check, I was surprised to see that they charged us for two bottles !!!!!! Other than that, they did not bring the right dressing on the salad...only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food was ok. 
I will never come back to this restaurant again ever, because of all the stuff I mentioned previously. The service was lousy!
