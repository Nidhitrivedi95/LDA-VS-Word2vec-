However I have to say the food was fabulous . Also the service was top-rate the prices were very good for the quality of food we had. We had the saag paneer  a combination plate,  naan  , salad  a bottle of wine. We tried the desserts and they were amazing. I wrote down the name of the desert but now I can't find it but the were little balls that had honey over them. We will definitely go back again to try some other dishes.
