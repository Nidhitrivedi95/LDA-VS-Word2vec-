wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw Sindhi might not be the most authentic Indian food experience but I really enjoy the more modern vibe with minimalistic deco.

A twist of Indian's street food which is quite unique compares to other Indian restaurants in the area.

We arrived for late lunch (after 3 pm) and since the restaurant was not busy, we had full attention and service from the staff.

Prawn Koliwada ($9) - Huge prawns cooked perfectly!
Sharmaji Ki Chaat ($6) - Really interesting contrast of taste and texture 
Sekanjebin ($3) Dried Plums & Mint Cooler
Masala Cola ($3.50)
Sindhi Rabdi Falooda ($6) 

We really enjoyed the food and the dining experience. Definitely coming back to try out other items on the menu next time when I am in the neighbourhood.
