ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I now have hope for the future of Indian food in the USA, why? Because I tasted it tonight. 
Copper offers a smaller menu than most, but what there is, is exceptional in taste and presentation. 
Samosas are traditional in flavor, but unique in presentation, and in a delicious sweet and savory sauce. 
The Goan prawn curry was the exact heat one would expect from a Goan dish, and a elk balanced use of spices gave a great flavor. 
I always reserve judgement on a curry house until I try the kulfi, in Copper 's case it is very different, presented with quartered figs, and a couple of fruit paints. Although I missed the cardamom and pistachio reduction, this was a good alternative. 
The service is very attentive, if you sit in the front the floor leans quite considerably and I found myself putting my foot out to steady myself, but the building is old and definately has charm from the outside, while housing a contemporary interior.
