K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g This place is used be very good but as more and more people going to this place owner has taken things granted. This place is getting worse and worse day by day. Customer service is getting very poor. Rates has been increased. discriminating behavior towards Indians. Ordered mango lassi but served water with yogurt and some color in it. Asked to bring pickle get the time we done with the dinner and so on........ I am sure how there are positive reviews for this business.

Please don't go to this restaurant any more.
