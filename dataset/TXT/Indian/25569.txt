Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA The meals my boyfriend and I ate yesterday were very good. The fish and chips portion is massive and the best tasting fish I've had. The batter wasn't too greasy and it went well with their house made tarter sauce. Bangers and mash tasted just like the pub near my flat in England. I'm not a fan of mushy peas, but the taste was fairly good, and the mash was seasoned really well. 

What brings the place down is their service and lack of knowledge. My boyfriend enjoys trying their different beers, but yesterday he mentioned that the waitress never seems to know anything more than the names of the beers they offer, except for one particular type that she knows the flavouring of it but not the name. 

Overall, this is a nice casual hangout spot. The food is not outstanding but still good, and hits the spot if you want some English comfort dishes. They always have room to sit, though it gets difficult when a football game is on. They sell Crabbie's ginger beer too, which was exciting for a non-beer drinker.
