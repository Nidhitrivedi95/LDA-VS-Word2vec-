I felt the food relied a bit too much on salt. Other diners complained of spiciness - I think it's more saltiness that comes across as spicy. I just knew food was salty when I ended up guzzling down a fair bit of water when I got home...and my fingers swelled so much I wondered if they used MSG.

Service was excellent - most attentive and extremely friendly. Sadly, I won't be coming back because of the overkill on salt.
