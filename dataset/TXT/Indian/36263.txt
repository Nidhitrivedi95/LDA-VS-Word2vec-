NwLIEaqEz-9kcHkseLsfiQ You know this place is solid by the amount of circling cabbies. Open from dinner until around 5 am, Mehran has been around for a long time, and has survived a couple neighbours in this tiny two-store plaza (Mr. Tasty, anyone?). Interestingly enough, its newest neighbour is Guu, and I'm always amused to see groups of young Asians hungrily dining in here as they wait out Guu's painfully long lines.

I don't bother with the combos on the menu board, and a typical order is: one order of tandoori chicken (which consists of a breast and a leg); channa masala (chickpeas); and some naan or rice. Depending on how many others I'm dining with, there are plenty of options in the window, and these can change daily. The meatballs are a treat when offered. Meat curries and other veggies are all solid.

Tip: you can call ahead to order take-out. For some reason, it takes them 10 minutes longer to prepare your take-out order than it should, especially since the food is already prepared. The waiting sucks if you don't call ahead, but you can always people-watch the hungry crowds at Guu.
