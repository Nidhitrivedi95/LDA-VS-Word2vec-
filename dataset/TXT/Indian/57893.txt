yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw 0 STARS from me for this place. .Found a piece of chicken in the Achari aloo. Enough to put off my Family, who are all vegetarians.The owner still had the audacity to charge us for all the other entrees ordered by us. Simply awful service and unhygenic cooking conditions

If you are a vegetarian AVOID this place at all costs!!!
