oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw If you don't look closely, you might miss The Mad Greek. Their sign is microscopic, unfortunately, and they are a bit off the main drag in the Cedar-Fairmount neighborhood.

Having said that, this place is well worth hunting down. This place is great! The parking is in the back, and it's free. 

One particularly notable thing about this restaurant is that their service and food is excellent at all hours of the day. I've been here at noon for lunch, in the evening for dinner, and late in the evening for drinks...and each time, I've been impressed.

I really like the Gyro Platter--it comes with a salad and pita bread, and I've found that I always eat plenty and still have a sizable amount to take home for lunch the next day. The dressing on their salad is especially good...mmm. I've never had any of the Indian dishes, mainly because there are several other great Indian restaurants in the area and I know of no other Greek restaurants.

My only caveat is to make sure not to sit in the area with the patio doors in the wintertime. Plenty of cold air still seeps in, and it can make for an unpleasant dining experience.
