OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g My sister came to visit and went to URBAN TURBAN indian cuisine, the food we selected was great, everything was delicious. Carlos our server was very polite and attentive to what  asked for, the owner Bhushan "TURBANATOR" was on site and came out and talked to us we enjoyed his company, chef Tarun Kapoor came out and asked us how everything tasted, if food was cooked properly and if we enjoyed it. Felt very welcomed almost VIP status. The atmosphere is relaxing and desert was great too we had the brownie with icecream. Great food! Will definitely be back for more
