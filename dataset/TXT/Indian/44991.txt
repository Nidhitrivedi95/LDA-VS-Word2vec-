S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Excellent food, we have eaten several times for dinner and had a great experience each time.  The saag and korma, my wife and my traditional favorites, we're both superb, and they did a good job with the naan.

The owner enticed us with some free samples of the mango lassis and we became converts.

The only unusual thing for us was rice was not included so remember to order some.  Even with this, prices were quite reasonable for high quality Indian food.

I do not typically like buffets so have not been here for lunch
