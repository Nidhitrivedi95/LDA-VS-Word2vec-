aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ The decor and food presentation are very nice, and the food is alright - but for the portions they serve, the prices are downright criminal. I walked in off the street and asked for the most popular item - it was an $11.29 Butter Chicken Kathi Roll. While the roll was decent (chicken was pretty dry but flavours were good), the size of the thing was comparable to a McDonalds Breakfast Burrito. I'd call it a snack rather than a meal. It's too bad the place doesn't sell these rolls for $5 - there would be lineups out the door!!
