RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w The inches this place has put on my waist. I LOVE it so much. Sure the potions are small and the dishes are a bit more expensive than most places but every time I've been here (and it's very often) the service is amazing, the food is delicious and I have yet to have a complaint. 

Love the vibe and feel of the place post renovations too. What I like the most about this place compared to other Indian joints is that they pay a whole lot of attention to service. 

I also love that it's very authentically Pakistani. Not South Indian or Indian; PAKISTANI!!!

My recommendations are the fish masala, the paneer tikka masala, chicken karahi (my favourite in the city it's hard to get this right in my books but they do!!), lamb biriyani. 

The dishes I would never order again are the daal, the peas, and some of the vegetarian options are a bit of a let down. 

Going there today in fact!!!! Nom nom nom
