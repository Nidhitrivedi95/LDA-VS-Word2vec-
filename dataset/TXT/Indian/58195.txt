yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg I have have been here several times and always had a wonderful experience. Yesterday I stopped in for there lunch buffet and was served by one of the sweetest servers I have ever known. He was new, to this establishment, but i kniw he has much experience. I feel awful I can not remember his name. I believe it was Mahi, but I am probably wrong. Regardless you will know him by his bright smile and endearing personality. He also has a constant need to recommend  you try more of this or more of that, before I knew it I had consumed 6 of the brown dessert balls. I am not Indian but but I can tell you that the flavors here are FULL of wonder. I have tried them all and enjoyed everything. Paneer, is wonderful. Tandoori chicken juicy. The nan bread is delicious and huge! I can not give enough praise.
