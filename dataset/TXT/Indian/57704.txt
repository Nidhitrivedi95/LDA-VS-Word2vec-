yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The food was great.
I was using a groupon and called ahead to make a reservation.
We were seated promptly. The tables and settings were beautiful and really added to the experience.
The menu was quite long so I just ordered a recommendation that I read from someones else's review. I ordered lamb curry. It was good.
Everyones was very happy with there meal. The only reason I am not giving a fifth star is the price. It is pretty expensive and I do not think I will come back unless it is with my parents or i can get my hands on another groupon.
The food tasted really authentic and the environment was great.
