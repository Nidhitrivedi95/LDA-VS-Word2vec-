CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ This weekend I was in Charlotte and my friends  suggested to try this new indian fast food. At first I was surprised and had my doubts  - haven't heard of any Indian fast food! But actually when I went there I was amazed to see nice ambience and clean restaurant (certainly comparable to the american fast food chains)
Price wise and quality wise - it's the best deal !! Have never had this good quality Biryani for $6 (good quantity, egg, raita and curry included) 
Since I do not live there and am from Herndon, VA. I would suggest the owners to please open a branch in Herndon,VA as we don't have any Indian "fast food" chains and also your prices and quality is certainly unbeatable.
