g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ A friend was raving about this recently opened up place and my friend me dragged me up here.

We were at Colaba junction on Friday eve and it wasnt too busy. I was expecting a kick-ass vada pav but was disappointed as the vada was double fried and stale.

Pani puri came with a great presentation and three different types of water but they all tasted pretty bad. 

Chaat was the only high-light. 

They are new and should improve on their some key dishes pretty soon before they lose customers
