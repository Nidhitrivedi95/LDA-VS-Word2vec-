You can tell a good ethnic restaurant when it is full of those that know the food the best: the natives/expats -- check. A couple of recommendations to bring that extra star. First, identify vegan options on the menu. Next, be friendlier. One of 2 guys will typically be our server, the smaller guy is much more welcoming and helpful, the other never smiles. And a combination of the previous mentioned opportunities, learn the menu and know which items have dairy and steer the customers more carefully. Naan has dairy, don't serve that to vegans.
