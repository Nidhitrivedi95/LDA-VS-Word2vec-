emNQ1jxMev2NzIcP2wdfgg Food is tasty, but slightly overpriced in comparison to the portions they give out. Apparently the owner of this place doesn't 'go the extra' mile to make their customers happy. Ordered boneless ribs, came with side of spicy fries and salad. Asked if they could instead forgo the spicy fries and in exchange provide much more salad, healthier choice. I mean salad can't be that expensive right? Gotta be cheaper than potatoes? Well I think not, waiter says he's unable to fulfill my request, little conversation later states that these days no one worries about their health. That made me laugh, think he hasn't been paying attention to what's been happening the last 15 years.
