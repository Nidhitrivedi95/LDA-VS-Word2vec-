nQRl39v-SrVDd2qDXvD1zg Very nice Indian restaurant in Inverness.

Went there during a 2-day visit to Inverness and Loch Ness. Agreeable decor, fair selection of different dishes (including many vegetarian options for those of us so inclined). Had a starter (chicken chat) and a mains (mixed Tikka grill). Both dishes weren't huge, but well prepared and tasty. Usual sides.

The restaurant doesn't look like much from outside, but is actually fairly agreeable. Staff are friendly, too. On weekends it does get busy, so reservation is recommended.

A short walk from the city centre. But then, ANYthing in Inverness is a short walk.
