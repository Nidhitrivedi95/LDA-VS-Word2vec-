2KkTzafNqkEKr5VTjsR3hw Hubby randomly pulled into this plaza and parked in front of New Spiceland Restaurant. He was hangry and sent me inside to grab something quick. I was the only non-Sri Lankan/Indian person in the place; food must be pretty good.

Going in blind (no Yelp research) I had no clue what to order. I threw caution to the wind and ordered the following:
- Veggie samosas 3/$1 great flavor. The outside reminded me of a thick wonton wrapper. The bad part was it wasn't even warm nor crunchy. 
- Milk Hopper - made to order, it came out hot! It reminded me of something between a crepe and pancake with a delicious filling that tasted like it was made from sweetened coconut milk. Oh so good!
- Masala tea was served piping hot, not wild about the combination of spices.

All the above came out to less than $5 and kept the hangry monster at bay. Next time I'll try something from their hot table, and I will ask if they can make a fresh order of samosas so I can bump up their rating
