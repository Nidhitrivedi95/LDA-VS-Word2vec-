S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Since moving here from San Jose , California my kids and I have been on the hunt for good Indian food.  Our search is now over.  The lamb was cooked to perfection and the Shrimp Curry was very delicious.  We usually get vegetable Samosa's however tonight we tried the beef Somasa which were amazing.  I usally do not see Beef on Indian Menu's, however it is a nice addition and look forward to trying some of the beef dishes on the menu.  The service is impeccable and the two brothers running the front make you feel like family.  The atmosphere is very inviting and the place is very clean.  Also the first really good cup of chai I have had in awhile.  This is now our go to Indian food place!!!  Now to only find a really good California style Mexican restaurant and our household will be total happy campers hahaha!
