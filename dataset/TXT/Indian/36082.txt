NSaTps4xn23kPyGzjrMa4Q Being a Pakistani guy samosas are a standard snack, and throughout my life I've been looking for the best samosas in the GTA. I think my search is finally over. I cannot recommend their vegetarian samosas enough. I would not get the meat samosas as they aren't the best. The vegetarian ones are out of this world and are hands down the best you can get anywhere nearby
