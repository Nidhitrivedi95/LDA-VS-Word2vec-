ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw We had lunch at India Garden this afternoon...excellent choice.  The food was delicious and the service was impeccable.  We were a bit aggressive with our spice level when ordering and the sever quickly recognized it and brought out two sauces with bread that we could test first.  How great is that...he didn't want us to ruin our entree...and of course we both dropped our spice level down.   The food was hot, perfectly spiced and absolutely delicious...and of course there was the naan, yum! I live in  D.C. and will definitely come back to India Garden next time I'm in town.
