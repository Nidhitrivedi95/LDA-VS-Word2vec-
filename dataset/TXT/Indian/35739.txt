nAnpTnodDchSl9H0f6R2pw Bhoj is a somewhat hidden, somewhat small Indian restaurant just a bit north of downtown. The service is really good, friendly and quick. However everything about them is just average. Quality, price, interior. So it would struggle to be anyone's favorite. It is just a regular option. However I think the prices are too high to be that option for most people.
