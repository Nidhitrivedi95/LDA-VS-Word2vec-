TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw we got the rack of lamb dinner - without knowing that it was enough for two people, we also ordered this masala dosa or whatever you call it (a huge crepe looking thing stuffed with potatoes and onions).  the lamb was delicious! and the rest of the food was just ok.
i am curious about their lunch buffet - probably would go try it sometime, but don't think i will be back for dinner.
