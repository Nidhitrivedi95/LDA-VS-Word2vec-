TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Have been here thrice, always for their lunch buffet. The price is decent and the food is awesome. Their food is not too oily and they bring really fresh bread to your table. The ambience and the music is a nice touch too.

The mango pudding is so freaking delicious it takes you straight to heaven.
