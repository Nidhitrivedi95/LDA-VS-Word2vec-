Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I've been to Delhi palace quite a few times now and am always concerned with the consistency of the place.From my most recent experience, I had a take home from Delhi palace last week (paneer masala.. a vegetarian dish) and it was awesome... With expectations soaring high, I went there to have lunch buffet yesterday and it was by far the worst Indian food I've ever had in tempe..All the Indian restaurants in tempe rip you off for sure..but they can try to at least provide good food for the money they take.. stale would be an under statement to describe the state of food there yesterday..The same paneer masala that i was praising about was there in the menu and i was a happy soul until i took the first bite of roti with that curry..It was awfull!!!!!!!!!!!!!...none of the dishes in the lunch buffet were atleast near the average mark..The deserts they ha only added to the misery of the lunch.... I am just praying for a 'Consistent Tasty Indian Restaurant near ASU'
