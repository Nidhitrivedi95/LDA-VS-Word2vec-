CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A I wrote a 4 star review of Taj after having been several times. But after going a couple more times, I really had to come back and change this to a 5 star review.

I can't even believe how LOW the prices are (compared to other Indian restaurants I have been to in Madison) and how great the food is. 

I have never been to Taj's buffet, nor have I ordered any dishes with meat in them so I cannot attest to any of that stuff. But speaking for the vegan food on the dinner menu, I love Taj and never go to any other Indian restaurants in town anymore. I once went with a friend to Maharini (at the corner of Broom and West Wash) and we were so unhappy we went to Taj afterward to get some pakora!

The pakora (an appetizer technically, but usually makes up the bulk of what my friends and I order) is just the best thing in the world. The samosas are great (and both those items are so cheap) and the entrees I have ordered (usually spinach, eggplant and mushroom in various combinations) were great but not all that large of portions.

1 thing that would make this place even more amazing is if they had vegan naan, which I can never find anywhere!
