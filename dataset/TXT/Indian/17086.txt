DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Nice Indian restaurant. Customer service was nice. They gave a detailed description of the dishes when they served us. We ordered so much that day. Everything was so delicious. My favorite was the chicken tikka masala and vegetable korma! The prices are a lil pricy but worth it. I feel naan should always come with the dishes instead of a separate order. Other than that, we will def come back!
