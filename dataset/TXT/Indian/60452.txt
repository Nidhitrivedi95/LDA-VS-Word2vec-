ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw Stopped in for a quick drink but ended up having 3. Every one was well crafted with fresh ingredients. A lot of different gin drinks plus other cocktails. They make their own tonic which was a pleasant surprise.

Had their version of grilled cheese and tomato soup. Just like the drinks, the food was very solid.

The bartenders were very knowledgeable and did a great job interacting while making the drinks.
