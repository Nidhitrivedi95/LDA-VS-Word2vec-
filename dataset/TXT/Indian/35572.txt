MWffCS7UkTUj9yDMy4jaLA The food is amazing here!! The atmosphere is not the greatest, and it often looks like it's closed from the outside, or you're the only people in there, but the food is really great. We got the lamb saag and rogan josh and they were both excellent. I think they also have a lunch buffet, never been, but I'm sure it's delicious. I've always been curious if they have a big lunch crowd, because the dinner crowd is semi nonexistent. But still, great food and worth a try if you're looking for great indian, but definitely don't go for the ambiance.
