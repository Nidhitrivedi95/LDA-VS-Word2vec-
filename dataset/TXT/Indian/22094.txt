GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Yes, yuuuuussss you made my list. 

On a Sunday, when vaguely far away breakfast brunch options are only legal in other counties, you, consummate professional, invoking me in with  hot tea, warm atmosphere, and friendly service. 

Ask, if you don't know. Aditya, my counselor, proved to me there are still flavors out there. Experiences to be had.

It should be added that I notoriously hate yogurt, and potato and grapefruit ( it's not a grapefruit, is not a fruit, it's a fucking lie). 

And somehow they made it all work. 

Cheers man. To Aditya, to the cook, bring that shit, you guys prove that American food still sucks.
