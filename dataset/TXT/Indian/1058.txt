-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw I usually write reviews if something is too good or too bad. I go here because it is the nearest non veg Indian restaurant to my neighboorhood.
In this case, I can say 5 star for Biryani  and 1 star for service and ethics. 
Other than Biryani, palak panner is good. Rest items are not good. Chicken Biryani comes in 2 style viz. a Regular chicken Biryani b Special Chicken Biryani. ALWAYS go for regular chicken biryani, because special Biryani is nothing but flavored rice with  pieces of boneless red pepper chicken. 

Now coming to service part, ok its usually self service style. I can't expect a service of 5 star restaurant. However there are 2 hosts, one guy (aged between 25 - 35) he is fine, another guy ( aged over 35) he is very  rude and he don't know what are professional ethics. When I order something he behaves as if he is doing some huge favor to me, and Once I went to the restaurant between 9:20 pm -  9:30 pm, he sees me as a criminal and rudely says KITCHEN IS CLOSED(In Caps intended).
