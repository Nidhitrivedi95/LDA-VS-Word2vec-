The place is very busy.... you may have to wait in queue for quite long, and the food takes another 20~30 minutes to come to your table. But this wait is definitely worth... the food is delicious!! The tastes are quite different from the other kaboob places in GTA. We ordered Behari Kabab... well-marinated beef, cooked on charcoal fire and served on a sizzling platter. Also had Maghaz Masala (cow brain, cooked with spices), this one is quite rare to find in GTA I believe. 

The service is good, the servers are very attentive and prompt.
From the parking lot you can get the appetizing aroma of the kababs... I would suggest, take off your jackets and keep them in the car.
