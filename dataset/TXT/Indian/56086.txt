xhLtkZafbRB8o3kN7nw5wg This has got to be one of my favourite places for Indian food in Scarborough. It's clean, it's cheap, people are friendly, and it's authentic.

I've been here a couple times in different scenarios -- big groups, as a couple, gotten take-out -- and I've never had a negative experience. The food is delicious and staff are willing to help you out with decisions if you're not sure what to order. Last time I came I had a platter of a bunch of different veggie dishes (chana masala, saag paneer, and a veggie curry I think) and I was so full by the end of it that I almost had to unbutton my pants.

One thing that kind of sucks is that my clothes reeeeeked of Indian food after sitting in there for dinner. Maybe I'll stick to take-out, but I won't stop going because the food is THAT good.
