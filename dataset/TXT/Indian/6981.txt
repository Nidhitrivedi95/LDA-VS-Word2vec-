It's a phrase you will hear every time someone walks up to the counter. It's his way of saying, "Go ahead, tell me what you want." Or he's trying to tell you to hurry up and that's his polite way of communicating it.

Sri Lankan food is stupid spicy, and may not be for everyone, but I am a huge, huge fan. Well, I should say I'm a huge fan of things like the Kothu Roti (Roti + egg, chicken, beef, etc. + spices all chopped up into a delicious dish). If you are uncertain about what to order, get the Egg Kothu Roti and some Mutton Rolls. You cannot go wrong with either of those menu items. Unless you cannot handle any kind of heat. The prices are really cheap (in my humble opinion). The average meal (or snack) shouldn't set you back more than $4-7. Or at least that's about all I've ever spent when I stop by. And the flavors are on point, adding to the overall satisfaction in knowing you didn't spend a lot of money. The cutlets are not great though. I would avoid those things, because it's mostly potato acting as filler, and very little meat to speak of.

Also, I'm not usually one to call others out about their reviews because "opinion," or "freedom of speech," or some such nonsense, but WTF to the other review for this place. There aren't any actual complaints in the review, the pictures (and captions) show love for the mutton rolls, he admits that he pops in every once in a while (which means he doesn't hate it). And despite all of this, Annapoorna still gets a "Meh"? Criminy... This is why people hate Yelpers.
