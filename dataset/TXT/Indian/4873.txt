2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Who would've expected a nice restaurant in Heartland eh? Out of all the places that it could've been, Heartland? Regardless, parking can be tricky here. It gets pretty crowded, especially with the traffic from all the other stores. The decor in the place was spectacular. I would definitely come here again just for the decor haha. 

Not gonna lie the food was delicious. We'd gotten the Avani Chili Fried Shrimp and the Mangalore Coconut Curry. (Yes, I cheated my vegetarianism that day.... my mom forced me to lol) It was awesome. Really good. Definitely different from normal Indian food I've had. It is indeed a fusion restaurant. Be warned, the curry, if it says it's spicy. It's spicy haha. Coming from a guy who can handle his spice, it had the decent level of spice. So for all of you who despise spice, BE CAREFUL! YOU DON'T WANT TO DIE! The shrimp was definitely different, spiced with ginger, and onions, and omg just a must-try.

I'm only giving this place a 4/5 just because I felt this place was a bit pricey, but definitely a second visit is in order. I would definitely go back and try all the different things they have to offer. Simply delectable.
