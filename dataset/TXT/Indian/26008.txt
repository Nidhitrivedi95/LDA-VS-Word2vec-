i3rdifli2uVDfAn5-E4jmg The food was very good  but hella spicy so be prepared! The food was decently priced and has perfected quantities. 
However the restaurant it self isn't so hot, the waiters and staff weren't very reliable. It is a very noisy restaurant with people lining up inside for takeout. Even with reservations it was cramped and close.

But overall the food was excellent and I would definitely go again .
