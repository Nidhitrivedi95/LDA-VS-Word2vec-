gJliACNKY4rK30BTMIzwsQ We visited due to the excellent reviews on trip advisor....We were not disappointed! Even our taxi driver had had it recommended countless times via word of mouth! 
Service was excellent. Lamb was slow cooked to perfection & Naan bread was super! Theonly let down was that we had ordered from the meduium section and the curries were not at all hot. They were very good though. Thank you for a delicious meal! We will definitely recommend to our friends & be back next time were in Edinburgh. Great to see a family restaurant doing so well.
