iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ Always a stop when the extended family is in town. Food is great for all types of eaters. Quantity coud be more per meal for the price but taste is savoury.

Service can be better, all the wait staff and the cashiers look like they hate their life and are never happy especially the lady working. Ruins it for me as I normally get take out after work and dont need the negativity, so switched to Faleys a block away.

I would recommend the food as takeout, maybe once a month or so...
