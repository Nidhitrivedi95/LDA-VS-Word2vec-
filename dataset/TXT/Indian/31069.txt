KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA Was really craving for Wonton Noodle soup closer to Midland & St. Clair and found this restaurant on Yelp. 
Read mostly good reviews about other foods however none about Wonton Noodle soup so decided to have a try.
Restaurant was clean, & staff are friendly. 
The Wonton noodles though are not the thin type that I am used to but it is okay. The broth was good and so were the pork wontons.  Would return again to try the other popular items on the menu.
