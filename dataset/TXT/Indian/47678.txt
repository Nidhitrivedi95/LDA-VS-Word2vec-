TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Came here to eat lunch because we had a restaurant.com voucher we needed to use. And it was during the lunch buffet so we couldn't use the voucher. We checked in to get the mango lassi so my bf and I did and then they told us we could only use one per table but they ended up giving us the second one anyway. The masala wasn't spicy at all and the karahi was okay. We didn't even eat half of the karahi. We ordered medium spicy. The older lady was our server and we couldn't understand anything and she was rude as well. She didn't even crack a smile! The older man with glasses was nice. He was the one who gave us a free mango lassi and another on the go.
