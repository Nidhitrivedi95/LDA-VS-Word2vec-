F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w I seriously don't know how some Indian restaurants in the US get Butter Chicken wrong. Everyone like Butter Chicken--Indian Food lovers and non-Indian Food lovers alike.  This is one of those places who just didn't get it right.  While visiting Pittsburgh, we decided to eat here on our first night.  We ordered the butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and lamb keema. As I said, the butter chicken did not taste like any butter chicken I had ever had before.  The sauce was very watered down, lightly bland, and bright yellow (vs the typical more orange color).  My bf was excited that they offered Keema, which apparently isn't offered at a lot of Indian spots.  But sadly, it wasn't all that great.  My lamb vindaloo however, was delicious.  Super spicy and plenty of tender lamb.  Good sized portions as well, as wel had leftovers at the end.  The mango lassi was also yummy and very thick.
