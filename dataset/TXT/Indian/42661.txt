RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Blue Taj has amazing food in a unique atmosphere. The wait staff has great suggestions, like when to get sauce on the side etc. If you don't know Indian cuisine then tell them the protein you like and they'll help you. The cauliflower appetizer is beyond amazing. It's a crispy cauliflower with a red chili sauce. They offer take out if you don't have time to sit down.
