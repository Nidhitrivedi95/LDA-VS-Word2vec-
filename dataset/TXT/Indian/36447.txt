NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg For being Indian fast food (rare!) in the Cleveland area, Choolaah knows what's up. The food is fresh, location has a clean, bright, modern aesthetic, and there are plenty of vegan and vegetarian options with health info clearly marked. I also love how much of the kitchen is transparent and you can see the large ovens at work! As an Indian Clevelander, I'm proud to have this here! :)
