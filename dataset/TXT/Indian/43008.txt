rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA If you're a freak for Paki food (as I am!), this area of Suburban Toronto is the place to be. So many places to choose from. The manager and most of the front desk staff at the Hotel I stay at while I'm in Scarborough are Desi, so I ask them their opinion. The first time, they steered me to a Hakka place called Tangerine, just a few blocks away, and it was fab. (Q.V. my review here). This time I said I wanted a different place to further my experience of the area. They told me to go here. (Actually right next door to Tangerine).
Couldn't have been a better tip! 
Ran into a Desi family who say they drive a long way from the other side of the city just to come to this place. Nice folks to talk to. I let the Father order for me. What a feed! Had Beef and some Veggie stuff, great Rice and Naan. Fabulous!! Didn't catch the names of the dishes, but it doesn't matter-I asked him to order me a selection that would put the best of the place before me. Sure did!
Decor? Not much. And you've got to go to the counter to get your food. So what? I'd walk around the block for stuff this good. No booze either. Again, so what?
This place is in a strange (at least for my Chicago ass) little shopping area. It kind of looks like if you are not Desi, you might be in the wrong place, if you know what I mean. It ain't like that. Everyone is most friendly. 
Glad for the recommendation, Mr.Manager! Spot on!
