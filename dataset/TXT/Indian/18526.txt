eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg This restaurant is good and close, which is why we frequent it.
Not the best Indian I have ever had, but still damn good.
The decor is pretty standard, they have a full bar and a couple of TVs, one in the dining area playing Indian music videos which are always fun to watch. The staff is very friendly and attentive.
The menu is pretty traditional, as far as Indian goes, Naans, Jasmine rice and Vindaloo, Tandoori, Masala, etc., with plenty for vegetarians and carnivores.
Dinner is always good and the lunch buffet is not bad, either.
The prices are reasonable and there is never a wait.
As many times as I have been here I have never had a bad experience.
Give it a try and see what you think.
