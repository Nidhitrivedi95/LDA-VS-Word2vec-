I understand that Hakka cuising uses starch to add a glaze to their sauces, but not like this. 

I was there with my family and we ordered hot and sour soup, Manchurian chicken, fried rice, another beef disk, and I think chow mein. It was really disappointing. 

The hot and sour soup was thick. Like mucus. The heavy corn star consistency. Really not appetizing. 
And same with the meat and their sauces. I couldn't eat more than a few bites. 

We ate at the restaurant and it was stupidly crowded with people picking up take out orders. Like people were almost leaning on our table. We didn't finish out food and packed the rest to go. 

I don't think I'll be back...I've had far better food for the price. My parents weren't a fan of the food either.
