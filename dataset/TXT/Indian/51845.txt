UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I'm a huge fan of Mint, I've tried other Indian restaurants, but Mint seems to have the flavor down packed.  I gave them 3 stars instead of 5 because the service could be a lot better.  I know it's buffet style for lunch, but they tend to let your dirty dishes stack up and they take forever sometimes to bring the naan to your table.  The food is absolutely delicious, but the buffet isn't keeping it warm enough.  Either they are putting the food out luke warm or the warmers on the buffet line aren't heating up properly.  If they could get these two things going I'd definitely bump them up to 5 stars...
