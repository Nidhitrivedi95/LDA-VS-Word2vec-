Bombay Spice is not one of them.   Not only was the food unrecognizable as Indian, but it legitimately tasted awful.  We had the "Chef Sampler", which allowed us to try 4 out of 5 of the different sauce/bases that the facility provides. We had the curry, the spinach, the tikka masala, and the korma with broccoli and vegan chicken.

Pros:
* The appetizer, though it didn't taste similar to typical Indian food, was not bad. We had the Lentil Towers. 
*  The wine selection was fairly sizeable.
* The service was wonderful.
* The curry, though it didn't taste like traditional curry, was relatively palatable in comparison with the other dishes.

Cons: 
* The naan is actually toasted pita bread.
* The tikka masala was not well spiced and was very sweet. It almost tasted like over-sweetened yams pureed.  It wasn't just disappointing as tikka masala sauce, it was also legitimately disgusting.
* The spinach may have just been salted, cooked-down spinach and water. It lacked any spice at all, save salt. It had a lot of salt. 
* The korma was incredibly sweet. It tasted predominantly like sugar water and truly nothing else. The chunks of mango that were included in the sauce were practically savory in comparison.

Needless to say, this restaurant is not one I would recommend.
