2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw If you're looking for cheap Indian take-out, Samosa King is the place to go!  There can be a long line because people are lining up for their samosas and other fried food. 

They have 5 samosas for $1.  They put it in a paper bag and the grease soaks up the bottom of the bag.  The size of the samosa isn't that big, but what can you ask for, you can't find samosas for cheaper elsewhere.  

Tandoori chicken is $3 each.  Nicely flavoured. 

Daily special: three veggies plus rice for $2.49.  I wanted aloo gobi but they ran out.  They have about six veggie dishes to choose from.  I got chick peas, spinach and I don't know the name of the other veggie.  The veggies tasted good, however, the rice was a bit hard. 

They have a wide selection of desserts.  I'll def come back to check this out!
