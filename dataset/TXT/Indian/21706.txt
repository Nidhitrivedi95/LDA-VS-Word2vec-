GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g We have lived in the area for 7 years learned of this place only 6 months ago. Turns out it has been open for 3 years upon talking with the gentleman running the place.  My wife is vegan; I am not but always up for tasty grub. This place did not disappoint. I had the #24 Chole Dosai while my wife had the #43 Vegtable Curry.  We also got a side of #57 Malabar Parotta (bread/naan) which is to die for and could be a meal in itself. 

We were both so impressed with portion size (left overs came home for a much anticipated lunch the following day), flavor (loved the chutney bar), and friendly service. The gentleman on multiple occasions queried about or satisfaction. 

I give this place a very solid 4; maybe 4.5. The only thing that would make it better in my opinion is the ability to order an Indian beer and if the prices were a little lower. The atmosphere is on the casual, informal side which I like. Our dinner was $20 for 2 with leftovers. Very reasonable for dinner for two.
