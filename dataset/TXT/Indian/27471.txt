IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA The food at Noor is pretty great - and as already explained by Emily T. the portions are perfect for if you want a guilt free pig out of delicious indian food in a one person banquet.

Anyway, the food here is great - if a little over priced in my opinion, especially in comparison to other indian take aways in the area. Dont write it off yet though - while other places are cheaper, they lack the authenticity and generaly very hight quality food that Noor offers. 

Choose wisely.
