A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Being South Indian, we know our dosas, and this place didn't disappoint. For starters we got the plain vada's with sambar, they were good but a bit dry. We then ordered a masala dosa and a plain dosa. Both we're delicious, especially the nasal filled one. We loved it so much that we ordered another one! 
For drinks we got fresh lime water. For some reason they added masala in them (why ??), but we asked them to change it for the real thing. The service was great. 
Overall if you like south indian food this place is a must !
