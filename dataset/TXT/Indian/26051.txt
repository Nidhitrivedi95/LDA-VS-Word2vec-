i6N0e1zVhkQvof_acn85Og Went here for the first time tonight (we got takeaway) and the food was delicious. The staff was friendly and very kind, and the young guy serving me suggested we get delivery next time to save us some hassle. I would definitely eat here again. My favourite dish was the veggie pakora - they were a little salty but quite good.

Of note, when paying debit you are prompted to tip and are not given the option of zero tip - I don't usually tip when ordering takeaway so I feel this was a little unnecessary.
