YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw After attending a Friday night event with friends... we used Yelp to search out something close for dinner. Indian sounded really great, and we had not tried this place yet. So glad we did! Not only was the food phenomenal, our waiter as well as the staff who came to our table to chat.. were extremely pleasant and helpful in assisting us with our likes/dislikes. This was a major plus for our experience! They do serve a buffet that at the time we came was not open. So this will be our next visit so we can try everything! Absolutely recommend!
