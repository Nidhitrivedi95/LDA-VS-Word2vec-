JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Looking for a place outside the normal in the Concord Mills area and ran across some great reviews on yelp for Aroma.  Me and my wife's food was delicious.  After the owner gave us some recommendations since we are not Indian food professionals we left with a full belly and very satisfied with the service!  Highly recommend!
