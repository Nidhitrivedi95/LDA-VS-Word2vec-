4scx_rtI9RZfFHWUxqPuHw Mirch is a quick spot to grab food as it is right down the street from our apartment downtown.  I ordered the chicken biryani and hubby went for the lamb vindaloo.  We also had two orders of garlic naan.  

I ordered online and then went to the restaurant to pick the food up and bring it home.  Online I owed more than what the restaurant waiter told me I owed.  When I gave a quizzical look he stated "oh yea, online the price is always more."  Word to the wise, do not pay online, pay when you pick the food up - they don't tell you it is extra if you pay online first and then pick up - they just do it. 

Anyway the lamb vindaloo was great, and the garlic naan tasted good and they give quite a bit for the price.  Although the chicken biryani was ok, I would never order it again.  

Decent food, but I'm still on the look-out for excellent.
