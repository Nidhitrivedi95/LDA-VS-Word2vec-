FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw Recently visited Chutneys as it is in our neighbourhood. There are not too many places around us like this one. Impeccable service, spotless clean environment, quiet and peaceful to relax over amazingly-tasting food. Both my boyfriend and I have ordered appetizers, paneers, pakoras, and butter chicken with fragrant rice. What a feast. The food was plentiful. Both of us took a small box of leftovers. 

This place is not cheap though. It does take a good bill to enjoy a full course supper, but it is worth every penny. And once in a while, why not treat yourself to this deliciousness.
