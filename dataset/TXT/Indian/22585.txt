The menu is clearly labelled with vegan items and we were informed that some of the other items can be made vegan if desired. 

My husband had the samosas and masala vada appetizers and said both were great. For his entree, he had the special vegetable curry and enjoyed it. I had the spinach dosai and it was very good. The chutneys had more depth of flavor than other restaurants I've tried. 

I'm so excited we tried this restaurant and will definitely be back! There are so many more dishes to try!
