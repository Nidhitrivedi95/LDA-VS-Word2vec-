rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ Didn't think this place would be to great even though I heard awesome reviews I thought it wouldn't be authentic. After entering pukka I was pleasantly surprised with there authenticity 
I was aware it wouldn't be "real Indian food" 
But it was close and even if it wasn't authentic the food was good. They added a nice twist to Indian food
