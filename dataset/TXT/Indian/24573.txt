H_xtDKsVhAGTAdMguD5LtQ This restaurant in a strip mall has very good vegetarian south Indian food from Tamil Nadu - dosa, puri, idlies etc. Their menu is not large (considerably smaller than what is on their website) and the restaurant is quite  plain in decor (although clean). However, their food is excellent and authentic and reasonably priced (you get 3 chutneys & sambar with the masala dosa.) My south Indian son raves about their food and says it is better than Udupi Palace on Gerrard Street. Takeout prices are even cheaper. Note: They are closed Mondays but open until 10 pm. Recommended
