qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Excellent value for this Indian buffet we tried for the first time this weekend.  $11 for all you can eat buffet 7 days a week!  I really enjoyed this place as it seems less spicy than some other places.  Selection includes tandoori chicken, vegetarian samosa, paneer, butter chicken, chick pea masala, papadum, onion pakora, gulab jamun.  Fresh naan is brought to your table.  I liked how they had watermelon in the fruits section for dessert (rare to find these days during lunch buffet).  This place is quieter than other buffets I've been to probably due to the location, this I like very much.
