3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA The best service I've ever received at a restaurant. And delicious food! Please go! 

We came for a late dinner, stayed past closing, and received freshly made, free desserts. Not to mention outstanding service throughout. 

Each dish was absolutely excellent, and SO FRESH. Our friend ordered the tandoori chicken and loved it. It had few spices, came out on a sizzling hot plate; great for anyone scared of eating Indian. 

Recommend the chick pea bread, rice pudding, and carrot desserts.

Couldn't say anything better. (Thank you!)
