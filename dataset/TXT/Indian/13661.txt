bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A This is new hotness out of phoenix. They offer flavorful food on lunch buffets. And it seems to be (i) pulling a lot of people out of their houses to come and enjoy the food (ii) taking away buisness from other indian joints.

Weekend (friday lunch buffet through sunday dinner) food quality has been great and consistent. Most items have their unique flavors and textures. Weekday dinners - quality is not consistent.

Service is generally sloppy. They have not figured out the co-ordinate system of the place they own. What is table # X and where is that? How many # of people Y are sitting on that table X and what each of the person ordered and in what order. I believed they found themselves unprepared to the high clientele they attracted based on the quality of the food.

Quality of food however easily over-rides this sightly negative aspect which is already improving. And the sloppiness offers something additional for us to chuckle about at the table. 

the other thing I rate food joints on - is whether the food feels too filling in one or two round. Its better than most other places in the valley.

North Indian appetizers are not great. Have not sampled dessert menu enough to write about it.

its all vegetarian. Suits me - i am a vegetarian.
