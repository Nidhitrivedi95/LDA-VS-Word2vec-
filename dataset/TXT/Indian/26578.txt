ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Copper is one of my favorites!!!  Today for lunch I had one of my favorite Soups:  Roasted Red Pepper!!!  The first time I dined at Copper around 2006 I had this soup and enjoy it on many dines, it is very flavorful, creamy fantastic!  They do not have it every day for lunch, though they used to have it every night for dinner.  This soup inspired my "Soup's ON" list - It is that Wonderful!!!

The Entree is the one I usually get (more than half of the time) Chicken Tikka Masala: Chicken Breast cut into chunks and downed in a creamy Curry (I'm guessing a coconut cream/ tomato base with many spices) You can order it Spicy hot if you want, though they are sometimes hesitant to get it real spicy!  Basmati Rice and Naan Bread finish this entree well!

How about some Dessert or is everyone ready to go home?  You can not leave yet!  Take some of that Naan home and get ready for:  Sweet, Creamy, Tart, Rich, Complex, colder and coldest, Kulfi!!!  First is Kulfi Neapolitan (a pyramid of Kulfi's) Top layer is Pistachio, 2nd layer Mango and bottom layer is Vanilla.  Next three Desserts are Bailey's Kulfi, Pistachio Gelato and Lemon Sorbet!

The service was Superboy on Indian, which is a great compliment and the best way to say it!

Chicken Tikka Masala is a "Gateway Curry, so.... You know!
