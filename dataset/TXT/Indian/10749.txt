A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA Wanted to hit up a new Indian food place and decided on the Curry Garden. At first glance, the inside is not exactly glamorous but again it's about the food right?

I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Bhatura, and Garlic Naan. It was delicious! There was plenty of Paneer in the dish (deliciously fresh) and the sauce was great. The Bhatura was made very well, but make sure you eat it when it's hot (so good for dipping). The Garlic Naan was good as well, with a generous amount of Garlic.

All in all this place had great food and service, although the design inside was not great, it was clean.

Look forward to coming to this place again if I need my Paneer fix :).
