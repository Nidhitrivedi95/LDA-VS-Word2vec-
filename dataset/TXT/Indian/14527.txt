C4HVXYYyiBeSUnrpnEZz5g My boyfriend and I decided to try out a new restaurant in Harmarville aka fusion. It's a Tuesday night around 7 & we are completely the only ones in the restaurant. Small town understandable but for some reason just awkward. We sat down I'm guessing our server was the owner~ just gave off that vibe~ I ordered a simple grilled chicken sandwich and he ordered a cheeseburger. I am very picky so after I ordered I got nervous but literally said to him right after we ordered "you can't mess up a grilled chicken sandwich". I was wrong- I tried to cut the sandwich when it came and I thought perhaps the knife was just dull but, no the chicken was hard as a brick and i tried eatting it but it was so difficult to tear apart or chew. Only to make matters worse we realized a little after placing our order she never asked my boyfriend how he would like burger cooked and low and behold it came out mooing, granted he doesn't mind he's the opposite of me- not picky at all. It looked as if it hit the grill for a solid minute. Sadly, i can't see us ever returning but- bright side the fresh cut fries were great!
