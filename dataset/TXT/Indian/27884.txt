IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Absolutely delicious. Nice quite friendly atmosphere. We had the chicken and filet kabob and it was out of this world. Lamb shank was outstanding. The fish melted in your mouth. Best rice that I have ever eaten and the portions were huge. All 6 of us left happy and full. Wonderful staff, outstanding family owners. Love to go back again and again Thank You!!!
