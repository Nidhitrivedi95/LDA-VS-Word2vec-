m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw I got the mango lassi and Bhuna chicken and it is the best Indian food I have had here in champaign Urbana area. The service is good. If you're looking for a good Indian restaurant, hands down this is the one. My friend also got samosa and it looks really good. Overall a great place to eat!
