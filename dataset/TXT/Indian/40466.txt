PQTtKaBK_WdvLm-zp4fQ1g The place was packed which is usually a good sign. I walk back to use the restroom and observe the kitchen staff in tank tops. Uh oh. Then I proceed to the buffet. Limited selection but I dive in anyway.  Head back to my table and one dish is cold. The other is luke warm. No one comes by my table for a good 10 minutes to check in.  This is not a professional restaurant owner. Must be a rookie. I won't be back.
