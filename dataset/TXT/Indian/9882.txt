9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw Around the corner from us and I love Indian food so had to try it. Had no idea it has such a following from its east side location that they opened a second location on the west side due to popular demand!
Very nice interior, open and comfy. My husband and I tried the Chef's Tasting Menu as we have only eaten Indian food a few times (although I make a mean Tikka Masala at home).

The vegetable pakoda was amazing appetizer. Favorites from the tasting menu were: tikka masala, lamb vindaloo and tandoori chicken w/ yogurt. Their garlic naan bread is fantastic, definately needed a second order!

Oh, and they also have an inferno menu featuring ghost chili peppers. All I can say is YUMMY!

So as to not ruin my entire palate for the evening, I just ordered the Inferno Naan stuffed with paneer cheese. If you like heat, you will love this bread! Definately has alot of heat, but not debilitatingly hot. 

And a self-service beer and wine bar? How can you go wrong with that!

Been back a second time already with out-of-town guests, they really liked it too.
Definately making this a regular for our dinners out!
