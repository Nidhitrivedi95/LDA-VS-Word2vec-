VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Scottsdale. The most recent visit, November 6,  we were seated immediately and our Groupon was graciously accepted, contrary to other reviews. And we didn't go just because we had a Groupon. My husband and I are very familiar with Indian food but our dining companion had never experienced this cuisine. Thanks to our congenial server, Bobby, this dinner left a good impression ... Tandoori-pesto naan, veg appetizer platter, vegetable biryani, lamb tikka masala, saag paneer, roti, raita,  The food was top notch, as was the service.  I must admit, however, that we do not go on weekends when the belly dancer is performing - too noisy and distracting. !
