NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ The food quality was superb, and the portions were big as well. I ordered the chicken curry, rice, and garlic nun; and I could barely finish everything, that says a lot, since I'm a generous eater. I wish I was staying longer in Edinburgh so I could try some of their other dishes. I really enjoyed the decor, and the soft music.
