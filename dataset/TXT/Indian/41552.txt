q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw This was my first experience with Indian food, but my dining companion is well versed in the cuisine.  I very much enjoyed the new flavors and spice combinations.  The female owner (?) went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and once she learned I was trying Indian food for the first time, she brought out a sample dish of a menu item different than what we had ordered just so I could try another flavor.  Super thoughtful and absolutely created a positive impression of her restaurant.

I enjoy supporting small businesses and the combination of good food and great service will keep us coming back.

The restaurant decor is sparse and pedestrian, but the service and food quality more than make up for the ambiance.
