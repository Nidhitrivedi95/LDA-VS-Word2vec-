V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg HATE IT. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. 

I got the curry bowl (butter chicken and rice) for $9 in a small container. What was even more ridiculous was a piece of naan costed $2.75. I cancelled the naan and ended up paying 10 bucks for just a small container of food. I should have gone to subway and easily enjoyed a combo for $9. Nevermind all of that, the employee on cash was giving me attitude for asking why a piece of naan was so expensive. He was on his phone while I paid and did not acknowledge me after that. Horrible customer service.  My mom cooks better indian food than this. Even the Indian food on Gerrard st is cheaper and tastier than this place. If anyone rates this place more than two stars, they do not know real Indian food! 

NEVER GOING BACK. Complete waste of money!!!!!!!!
