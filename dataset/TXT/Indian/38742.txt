OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I went for the lunch buffet today. Veg items and meat selection were on two different serving tables  food was fresh and looked very appealing. The garlic naan was out of this world and came with buffet. Carlos my server was knowledgeable about the dishes and was attentive to my needs. I can see myself going back. Good Job!
