7dZtL9I_AsTQ1pc6t9TTyA Tip:  Unless you plan to order a Kathi Roll or a Rice/Salad Bowl, it is better to go with a group and order a variety of things!

Located in an industrial area in Matheson E/Satellite, just north of Centennial Park, Chaska is a twist on Indian street food.  Very similar concept to Sindhi.

You order at the counter and when your food is done, the workers honk on horn.  It's quite loud.  A couple of the workers did greet us and ask if we needed any assistance with the menu.

Menu consists of kabob rolls, rice/salad bowls, more snacky type dishes (chaat, samosas, lentil patties), & drinks (lassi, chai).  There are veg/non-veg, white/brown rice, & gluten-free options.

We had:
Samosa Chaat - Basically chaat stuff poured on top of 2 samosas.  Samosas were veg and sorta meh.  Thank Vishnu for that sweet/tangy sauce.  South-East Asian friend said it was a bit too sweet for her, but I didn't mind.

Pav Bhaji - 2 smallish, fluffy, toasted & buttered hamburger buns that came with a side of lentil/tomato based curry.  I really liked the curry, especially after adding the squeeze of lime!  There was also a bit of butter cut into the curry.

Panna Mango Drink - from the fridge.  Unexpectedly savoury and gross.  Tasted like liquified chaat with a hint of mango.  When someone came to check-in on us, I told him that my friend didn't like the drink and that I was actually overcharged.  In turn, he went to the fridge and got her a mango lassi which was more "normal".

Cutting Chai - Tiny.  Ok in taste, could've used more spices.  I can't emphasise how small this was.  I've had rinse out my mouth, at the dentist, out of a cup larger than that.

I cannot speak of the size of the rolls/bowls, but the snacks/drinks were on the smaller side.  Snacks were perfect...as snack portions, as opposed to full-on Hungry Man/Woman meals.  Drinks, c'mon, need to be supersized especially the Chai!
