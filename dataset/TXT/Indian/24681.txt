h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Decided to stop by for lunch with a buddy.  In terms of being a celiac.... this place may raise your anxiety, but in return you'll be able to try some tasty food.  So, my encounter started a bit poorly with a small language barrier with the waiter.  Basically, I tried to explain that i was gluten free, which somehow turned into him thinking I wanted my food for free and that I was a student.  I will say he did cheerfully address my perceived questions, even if the explanations made no sense in terms of my actual questions.  Before we both became overtly frustrated I asked to speak to someone else, which resulted in me speaking to the chef.  The chef said " everything is gluten free, " and then rolled back to the kitchen.  So, like many in the celiac community, this made me rather uncomfortable as clearly there were items containing wheat ( the naan).  Anyway, I was with a buddy and decided to be brave for once ( while still picking a relatively safe menu item).  I chose the chicken tikka.  Though the waiter did offer me naan with it (which i declined), and growing anxiety I did try the dish.  The chicken tikka was in a thicker sauce (looked like it might have been reheated, but no judgment) than I'm used to and I had approximately five chunks of chicken in total in the dish... The rice was well cooked and when paired with the sauce it made an addictive combination.  The chicken chunks were rather large, moist, and shredded well.  Best of all, to my delight the chef was correct.  No contamination issues and i'd vouch for the gluten free nature of the chicken tikka.  In review, if you are gluten free and feeling brave you might want to try Prince of India.  If you aren't gluten free... well the buffet looked really nice and as I was informed by my buddy it was pretty tasty.
