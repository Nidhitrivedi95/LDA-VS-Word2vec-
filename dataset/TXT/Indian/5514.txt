3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw From the start, I would have given Kama a 4 stars because the food selection and the quality was good, but the service (or lack thereof) sort of killed my vibe. 

My friend and I went on a Tuesday evening for their buffet. 

The place was not full, nor empty either. 

DECOR 

The place is in a basement and it feels like it. A bit difficult to find the entrance, and once you get inside, it's dark and you come across these massive couches in the middle of the dinning room, next to a jazz scene. 

FOOD 

Good selection, you find all the classic dishes and they bring you naan (classic or garlic) directly to your table. The food was very hot, it didn't appeared to be there for hours and tasted good. 

SERVICE 

You could tell the staff was not sufficient. I saw only 3 people running the dinning room and terrace, + they had to help refurbish the buffet and prepare drinks at the bar. The lady was very nice but the two other guys just seem like they couldn't care less. 

We had to ask 2 times to get some naan and waited 10 minutes for our bill. We then waited another 15 minutes for someone to come and take the payment. Slightly fed up, we went to the bar to pay and had to wait another 5 minutes. 

I hope they would get more people on the floor to provide a better experience. 

Overall, a good filling meal for less than 20$ (including tip)
