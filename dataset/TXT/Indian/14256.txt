c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Don't let the dingy signage and interior deter you - the food here is tasty! Some of the best naan I've ever had, and it's fun to watch them make it at the front of the store. Every dish we have tried had lots of flavour, and they don't hold back on the spice either. Great butter chicken, lamb curry, dal and veggies, and a dish we'd never had before with ground beef and peas that was really hot. 
You can also get naan sandwich/wraps that are served with a wicked tangy hot sauce.
We've done take out or eat in - eating in worked a bit better because the various curries get easily sloshed together on the walk home otherwise.
Friendly and quick service.
