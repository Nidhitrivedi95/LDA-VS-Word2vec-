b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q WOW!  I'm shocked at the negative reviews regarding flavor, authenticity, wait and selection!

I've eaten Indian food all over the US, and Arizona.  I find this to be one of the very best!

Now, if you want to slam decor, I can't defend it.  If you want to talk about the odd service... I hear ya.

But, overall, this is my family's favorite restaurant... And my 17 year old daughter is one who usually tries to find 'chicken tenders' on any menu at any restaurant.  She loves the chicken korma here - we all do!  And the birhyani... OUT OF THIS WORLD!

Rating food alone - 5 Stars.  Reality check though.... service and decor have to take a hit.  Still, 4 stars is appropriate.
