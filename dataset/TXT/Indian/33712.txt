lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw Hmmmm sadly this place fell FLAT on the taste totem pole!!! When I walked into this place I wanted to be blown away by the spices, the heat, the aroma... But you know when you're eating something called "gun powder" fries and yawning... That it will be down hill from here.. 

So I got carried away before knowing what I was about to taste and ordered the following below...which I know seems a lot for one person and it was...

Mango lassi $4.95
Beef Phav $11.95 with side of gun powdered fries
Sev puri $ 7.95

Soooo all I have to say after eating the above is ... Were you ever disappointed in nutriment in front of you where you were too lazy to get up, get another item, or even more disappointed to ask for a refund... That you found yourself engaged in Boredom Eating.... Well I ate because I was bored of these solids... I wanted to cry on the inside and fly over 7 seas to India so I can apologize to the country of the mockery this place was making of it!!

This place gets a 2 star for the location and the decore... The rest should I say more?!
