-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw I love indian food and I am used to eat a lot of it. Thali is very small and usually packed so most of the time, I call in to order and go pick up my food.
I've tried almost everything but I stick to the butter chicken as it is my favourite East-Indian dish. 
Naan bread is usually not that warm which sucks because it would taste better if it was served very hot.
Be careful, 80% of their food is very spicy!
+++: they sell Thumbs Up :).
