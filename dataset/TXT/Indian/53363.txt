VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg The atmosphere here was great. Very laid back and relaxing. The live belly dancer was a nice touch. The food and service in the other hand was not so great. I got the Chicken Biryani (Number 41) and wren brought the food out was impressed with the portion until I found only 4 small pieces of chicken in the mix the rest was veggies and rice. The service was either to overboard or none existent. Asked for a drink and 30 minutes later got my drink but when ordering the waiter asked me 10 times what I wanted when I told him I needed some time. Overall atmosphere is a 5 star food and service 1 star....
