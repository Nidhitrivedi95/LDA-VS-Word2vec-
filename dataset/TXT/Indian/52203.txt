UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This experience was head and shoulders above Bombay! I absolutely LOVE this restaurant

Their lunch buffet lists if the dish is gluten free or vegetarian! A rarity, and totally awesome! All of their meat is halal.

They will give you papadam at lunch if you request it

The staff here is insanely friendly, and very attentive (but not annoying)

Their chicken tikka masala is amazing! Great sambar, idly, pakora, chutney, salad... Everything was delicious! I found the mattar paneer to be rather devoid of flavor, but in all fairness, I got here shortly after they opened and the dish probably hadnt had time to sit and develop flavor. 

5 stars on the lunch buffet, hands down. Will be back for dinner.
