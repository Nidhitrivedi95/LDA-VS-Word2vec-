NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ Came here thanks to the yelp reviews and had the best meal out of our whole week in Scotland! We ordered the Tandoori Chicken and the Chicken Korma, with rice and garlic naan. Both meals were delicious! The food took a little long to make it out, but once it was served it was obvious as to why. Perfection. The chef also came out and greeted us to make sure the food was alright. You won't go wrong here. Plus the 15% off check-in deal before 5pm is a nice bonus!
