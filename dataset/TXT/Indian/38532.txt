OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I did take out a few nights ago and was supremely disappointed.

The food itself was okay, 3.5/5 stars. The order was ready quickly and we got in and out very fast.

But then things go downhill. The spicing of the dishes was inconsistent at best. I ordered medium and got what would be considered hot at most places, but then one of the dishes was ordered medium and was exceptionally mild. The lack of predictability in the seasoning is a bit concerning. The place was empty when I picked up (8PM on a Saturday night) so it's not like "we were busy" would be a good excuse either.

The food is also a terrible value. Let me be clear that I don't expect portion size to scale with price. Not at all. I'm happy to drop $25+ on a smaller entree if the quality is there. But to only include two very small take out containers of rice for four entrees? And a $8 side dish of broccoli includes just 4 florets? It's stunning that they would cheap out on things like that. The entrees themselves were fine, but with how hot my dish was I needed more rice to thin it out. I've been to many places where I got better food for less money.

The next time I'm craving Indian in Las Vegas, I'm heading elsewhere.
