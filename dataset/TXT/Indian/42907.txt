RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Went for lunch with a friend. Great meal and service. Just enough food for lunch and even got to bring a little home. Rice and bread were plentiful and full of taste. Definetly going back to this one. We had the chicken methi curry which was very good and another chicken that was in a spinach sauce that was very good - the two complimented each other well.
