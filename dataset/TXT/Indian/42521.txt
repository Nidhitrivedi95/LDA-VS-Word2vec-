Service was bad. Slow, no waiters came to ask how the food is or offer water refills. The restaurant was not that busy so that is disappointing. 

I don't like the service or food but I keep coming back here to get take out.

UPDATE: Make sure you read your RECEIPTS carefully.. they seem to automatically add a service fee/tip.
