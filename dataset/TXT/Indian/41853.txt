QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg For an Indian who craves good Indian food, it is not always easy to find in Pittsburgh. The Mintt is probably my favorite place to get Indian food in Pittsbugh, second only to Udupi in Monroeville.

I've eaten here three times- once a proper off the menu dinner, and twice at the weekend buffet lunch.

Pros: The food is excellent. If you want to try something other than the standard vegetable-in-cream-sauce type food, Mintt is your place. The chef is from Hyderabad, I believe, and he brings that flair to some of the more unusual dishes they serve.

For our sit down dinner, we had the whole eggplants in the sesame sauce, and they were a revelation. Indo-chinese vegetable manchurian is a specialty of mine, and I can safely say that Mintt's is finger-licking good.

Off the buffets, we really enjoyed the paav bhaji- spicy curried mashed potatoes with buttered, toasted bread, a street side snack which is not a common find. Same goes for the tava vegetables this time- very nicely done. The desserts are good and not watered down.

Cons: It's your standard ethnic restaurant, in that service can be spotty, and the buffet table may not be properly stocked with the right kind of dishes. The chai, while excellent in flavor, has been lukewarm both times. 

For the sake of the food, though, I would gladly overlook these little hiccups and return to Mintt each time.
