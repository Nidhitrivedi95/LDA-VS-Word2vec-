TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Finally found an Indian place we like, thanks Groupon! We've tried so many places. Love the flavor of the chicken tiki masala here $15. Garlic naan $3 is crispy and garlicky..yumm. Rice tastes great but cost an extra $4, it's a big portion though and you can share it. Would go here every week if it was closer!  Craving it now as I write this review!
