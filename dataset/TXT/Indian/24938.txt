H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ My wife and I eat at Karakudi at least twice a month.  We come back because the food is outstanding and the service is always great, both in attitude and attention.  Sam treats all customers as if he's known them for years and he soon makes you feel that he has.  Whether your a first timer or a regular, Sam often surprises his guests with a complimentary menu item, including their addicting coffee mousse. In addition, if your're a wine drinker, Sam is also very generous with his pours.  Truly great food, warm staff and always a fun meal.
