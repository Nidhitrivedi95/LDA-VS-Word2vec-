PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA I've been coming to this Indian restaurant for years, despite the multiple name changes, some bad customer service experiences, and even a stomach ache or two. BUT, I'm happy to report that the latest iteration of this restaurant is pretty darn good. At least at lunchtime. For a measly $10 you can choose from an all you can eat buffet, which features tons of different types of entrees, including a large selection of vegetarian options. (which are in a completely different buffet line) The naan is always freshly stocked and there are even a couple dessert items intermingled with the other dishes. 

On my most recent trip, I was one of only a few non Indian patrons, and I took this to be a good sign. If you haven't been to this ever-changing restaurant in a little while, give it another try. You might just like it this time around.
