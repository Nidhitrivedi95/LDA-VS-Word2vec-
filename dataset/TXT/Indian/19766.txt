FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw I have only been to Swagat for the lunch buffet. In my opinion, the lunch buffet is the best Indian buffet in town.  The foods are more flavorful than some of the other buffets with a good variety, and the foods tend to change more on a day to day basis than some other buffets. I'll go out of my way to go here if possible even though there's an Indian restaurant much closer to me.

The buffet is 7.95 on weekdays and 8.95 on weekends so it's a good deal!
