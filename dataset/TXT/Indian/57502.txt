yD2jmBrBPbLJ2yN3lQQHjw While living in US Wangs was one place I really missed and once back it was the first restaurant I went. Their Hot and Sour soap, beef Chili, Chicken Manchurian and many other dishes are just awesome and very generous for the price. You have to understand that it is not the conventional Chinese but the Hakka or Bombay Chinese which is different from the regular mainstream Chinese restaurant and I like it better this way. I am always willing to go there and already have been dozens of times.
