kMgdZVLzAXM1JQwFsPXIlg This is one of the most underrated Indian Take Out places in the city. My colleague is a regular at this place and this has become my dinner every weekend since i tried it for the first time about a month ago. The rotis are hand made and the perfect blend of flavour and spices. They recommend calling ahead so you don't have wait for your food. Even if you do wait it's totally worth it. Beautiful pictures on the wall and the folks are always ready to talk to you. Butter Chicken Roti is epic! Biryani Rice is amazing. They have one location at Harbourfront which i will check out soon. The guy at the counter - Anuk is so warm (not very common in Indian restaurants) that i thought he's probably the owner. If you come here more than once a week you just say your name on the phone and they know your order. 
Keep up the good work fellas.
