WmtJ1bArMGPPLdwsIPahBA This is an amazing South Indian restaurant , both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes are great. If you are someone craving for authentic South Indian food , this is the place. If you want to have thalapakatti style biriyani which is popularly made in south Tamil Nadu , this is absolutely  your destination. We are definitely going to try the Wednesday night unlimited biriyani day. I can now say we found a hang out place for our Friday night biriyani cravings.
