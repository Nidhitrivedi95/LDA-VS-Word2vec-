KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw O-M-G ....I need a moment to just reflect on the amazingness that I just ate!



Been wanting to try this place, finallllllllyyyyy it's gone in my belly and now I'm feeling oh-so-satisfied! 

Do you like Indian food? burgers? Fries? Sandwiches? Wings? Ummmm hello, you will love it here!! The shitty part about being a foodie and eating by yourself is, you're limited to how much food you can try (unless you can really eat)....but the best part about having friends and family who love to eat just as much as you is, that you can try so many things on the menu! 

We ordered loaded butter chicken fries, veggie samosa chaat, dosa burger, Punjabi burger and the cheesecake samosa....all of it = YUM! My favourite and MUST TRY is the butter chicken fries *drool*, sooooooo effing good! It's an item I'll definitely order every time! That's right, I'm gonna make it a point to try everything on this menu!

UGH. I CAN'T
