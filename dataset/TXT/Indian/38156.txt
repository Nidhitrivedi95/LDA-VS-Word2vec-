ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Several of us visited Origin India last Friday evening and we were all not impressed. 

Average Indian food, small portions, slow service and expensive for what you get.

 The waiter was slow and there was only a handful of tables with customers which should have been the signal to try another place. We were hungry and figured we would give it a try. Will certainly not be returning.
