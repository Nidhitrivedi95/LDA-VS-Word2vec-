2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw As an Indian, I have experienced indian take out. This is just like any other take out at any other indian restaurant. Nothing fascinated me. Only dip I faced was their horrible customer service. When entering, i quickly got in the line. However, they were taking orders of people behind me before taking mine. They did not take my order until 10 - 15 minutes in line. When they took the order they dont even talk to you. No eye contact. I get it, they could be tired or have had a long day. But at least respond to what I want so I don't get the wrong thing. In the end, you have to go back to the one cash counter where they announce your order and bill you. It can be chaotic because alot of others are waiting for their orders to be announced. There is no number system. They will say your entire order and what you got and if that is yours, you pick it up. If one can handle their horrible customer service and is there to eat indian food which tastes like any other indian take out then go for this place.
