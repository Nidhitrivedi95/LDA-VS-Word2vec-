16-gsPZnaBJgFi9Le-i27w I love Indian food but always have the financial debate of should I really pay 50.00 for what would be 30.00 at the lunch buffet.  But when its cold and damp my body just cries out for some spice and heat. I recently took the dive and ordered from Amaya and I will say that it was very very good.  Just the right spice, heat and soooo tasty.  I had Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken and Beef Vinadloo.  The price was reasonable for the "Dinner to Share" and the delivery person was friendly and polite.  I would say that the dishes could use a few more pieces of meat in all that sauce but it was good none the less.  I would recommend them to anyone looking for Indian in the area.
