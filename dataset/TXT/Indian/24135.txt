Gtw-SpnhyNa0TwNETlysyw We went a few weeks ago with a Groupon.  I ordered a Dosa that was about the size of my right arm!lol  That really surprised me!  Check plus for presentation!  It also came with a veggie soup.  BUT, I asked the waitress if I could have potatoes in the Dosa ALONG with the veggies.  She said yes, but when it came out it only had potato in it.  Womp, Womp.  My friends opted for the buffet.  Overall nothing was really amazing and it would have helped if the waitress would have informed us about the buffet being an option for the Groupon instead of us having to ask about it.  It would have saved us some time.
