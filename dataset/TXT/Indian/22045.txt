The serving staff here couldn't satisfy the rats in Karni Mata Temple they are so disconnected from their customers. Ask about a dish and get a bland, uninspired description. Want a refill, good luck getting your server's attention. Manage to catch one of the other servers, he walks off because you're not in his section.

Considering our party was one of three tables in the place, there's no excuse for rude, crappy service. 

A plus is the naan. It was delicious and I'd come back for that. As take out only.

Conclusion - Phoenix has a plethora of average, run of the mill Indian restaurants and this place blends into the crowd. With bad service and an attitude that you, as the customer, don't matter - do yourself and this restaurant a favor and take your money somewhere else.

TIP: If you're in the area and open to new things, try the French restaurant next door. Great service and good food. Now I understand why I watched person after person go in there and not Tandoori Times 2.
