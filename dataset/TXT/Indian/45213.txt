S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Fantastic! We are so glad they are "back". The sons of the original owners have reopened in a new location with a slightly "New" name. We had Paneer Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Tandoori Chicken and Vegetable Pakora, all were excellent. The flavor and spices were so delicious we could barely stop eating. The interior is also a big improvement over the old location, more space and updated design. We will definitely be back on a regular basis.
