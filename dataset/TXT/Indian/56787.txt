xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Ok, I came here to check out the fry bread. It's a bit different than we have in the Pac NW, thinner, more like an elephant ear. I am used to thicker, doughier fry bread. However, as this was my first fry bread in three years since visiting home, I'll take it, and try not to cry over being homesick. To go with the fry bread I got a bowl of the green chili, and it had amazing flavor. Just fantastic. Spicy enough to make even me happy. 

The price is right, and it's like a little touch of home for me when I was far away from home. I'll take it, and be happy.
