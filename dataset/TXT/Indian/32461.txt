I ordered tandoori chicken which had basmati rice and a side salad. It was tasty and a nice amount of spicy. The potion was incredible! I also got a side of grape leaves which were cold and I love them that way. They were basic but good. The baba ganouj was good but I've had better. I like mine a bit less bitter. And the veggie samosa was DELISH. I would definitely get more of those. All and all, I'll order from here again and try something new because I feel it would all be good!
