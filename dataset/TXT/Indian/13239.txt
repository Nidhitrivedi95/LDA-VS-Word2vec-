B9QJToIrPjRAUuPoemMUNg Really tasty authentic Indian food... we order for delivery once every couple of months whenever we need a good curry 'fix' :)

Delicious fresh ingredients, generous portions, and very reasonably priced, especially the 'dinner for two'.  My fave is actually the Aloo Gobi, although the naan and curry chicken are really nice too.  Hubby's fave is the Lamb Biryani.

They get busy sometimes though, so I always ask before I place an order just in case, how they're doing!  (I think they must have big parties or something once in a while and won't deliver, rarely though I suppose...)
