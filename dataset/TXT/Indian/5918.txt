3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Subsequent to a long day at work and with a gift certificate in my love's hand, we were on our way to cash in at Delhi Indian Cuisine. It was a bit of a drive across town for us, but we would soon discover that it was well worth the drive on this blustery night in Vegas. When we arrived it was rather quite with only a few tables of guests, but we were welcomed with a warm greeting that soon transformed into thorough service in their clean space with simple yet pleasing ambiance.

We took most of our server's suggestions after talking about our likes and dislikes. Most dishes have a spice range from one to ten. We opted to stay right in the middle and asked for some separate spicy sauce to add...the spice on the side was very spicy, just the way I like.

We ordered Garlic Naan, Nepali Vegetable Momos, Butter Chicken with dark meat, Lamb Dhansak, Baingan Bharta, and Mango Lassi. Dinner also comes with complimentary Papadum & Chutney. Everything was delicious and exotic. 

My favorites were the Momos and Butter Chicken. The Momos are Nepali dumplings--folded fresh and juicy with curry dipping sauce on the side...I enjoyed these dumplings very much, especially the excellent wrapper of the Momos...not too thick and not too thin.  I am used to Japanese and Thai Curry but this Indian Curry was made of different layers of spices and full of great flavor. To cool it all down we had a Mango Lassi...made with Yogurt and Mango...yummy.

According to Yelp Reviews, lunch buffet at Delhi Indian Cuisine is must...so I am planning to come back to satisfy my appetite for Indian meals.
