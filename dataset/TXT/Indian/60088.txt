zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw Went to Kebab Mahal during a visit to the Fringe for a snack. I love the mixed pakora which is served with salad & sauce. (Cheaper then you'll get at any of the Fringe venues)We ate in the garden outside the shop as it was mobbed. The interior is not in a great decorative state but any time I have hjad food from here it has been excellant. Try it for yourself & see!
