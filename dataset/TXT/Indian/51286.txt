uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg I was very disappointed in my meal today. I often order the daal fry. Today I was shocked. It was pretty much spicy water. No onions and zero texture. You could have just ordered watery soup. I don't know if chefs have changed or they just didn't really care. We were the only people there so it's not like "busy" can be a reason. My mom ordered a wrap.  Apparently you now make it yourself these days?! Today was NOT a "wrap"
