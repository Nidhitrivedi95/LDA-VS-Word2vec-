Came here as a friend recommended this place and gf was craving Indian for a while therefore we decide to try this new place.  The decor of the restaurant is plain, however clean, at 2pm it is packed with people it's usually a good sign, we sat down and the waitress hand us our menu, the price on the menu is very affordable IMO, however as the waitress explains the restaurant is newly opened, the menu currently does not have any pictures.  That is fine, as we were recommended dosa and poori from our friend, we ordered both of them and asked the waitress to recommend one more to us (since we have 3 people), we ended up with protta, we also ordered  the dessert and masala tea.

The food came out fast including the dessert, and here's my comments:

Dosa:
It tastes great, crispy, freshly made, like a giant spring roll with flavors to it, in addition, there are few sauces for u to choose for dipping purpose, my favorite out of the 3 dish

Poori:
Thin crust, but soft and fresh, this is perfect for dipping sauces, I am like the variety of sauces they provide, as well as the taste

Protta:
It looks and taste totally like Chinese oil pancake, and very filling, I believe this is also great with dipping sauces, especially the tomato sauce which seems to be homemade?

Dessert:
It has a gooey texture to it, and a bit on the sweet side, however this is a dessert I never seen in other Indian restaurants, that being said, I only have visited handful of Indian restaurants therefore perhaps it's a common dish in many restaurants?

Masala tea:
Downside is you have to pull the tea yourself, I asked the waitress twice to realize I need to pour from one cup to the other, which is exactly how we see southern Asian restaurants perform the pull milk tea in front of u, except in here you do it yourself, BUT for 1.50 I am not complaining at all, not to mention the tea taste pretty good as well

This restaurant definitely have some rooms to improve like decor, but definitely a recommendation for the price and taste
