ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ What a great spot!

As I continue my tour learning about the excellent restaurants in Oakville (that apparently I have been missing my first year of being a suburbanite), we found Coriander Green! 

This place is a gem - it's an upscale Indian restaurant, with friendly staff and a welcoming atmosphere - as soon as you come in the smells are intoxicating! 

We tried a variety of dishes, accompanied by a Kingfisher beer (which they serve in copper mugs!). Everything was delicious, flavorful and balanced, with one thing really standing out - GARLIC NAAN!

I think this is the best garlic naan I've ever had in my life. I said it. 

While prices are a bit high (from my Toronto point of view), they are really on par with the area. 

I wouldn't hesitate to come back!
