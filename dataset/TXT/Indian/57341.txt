ybawte9OmM1n5z1ouNaIUA My wife and I ate here while on our honeymoon, and we loved it! The waitstaff was exceedingly friendly and helpful and the food was terrific. My wife has a serious nut allergy that extends to chickpeas and lentils. which make Indian food difficult. But the manager at Vinyasa went out of his way to help us find some dishes that were completely safe and delicious. If you are looking for great Indian food, in a well run restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere, I highly recommend Vinyasa!
