UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ 1ST thing my review is based off the sunday buffet. 2ND thing I did not eat till I hated myself.
THE buffet did not have many items but what they had was good. They definitely make the food for gringos as there was little to no spicyness. 
The paneer was  good albeit  a little sweet. Theybhad some spinich with lentles and potatoes, had good flavor with cumin being the most pervasive. 
The butter chicken and curry chicken we're very tastly and did not seem overly greasy.
I did not feel like I ate baking soda. If you are wondering what that means, my Indian friends tell me that some Indian restaurants that serve buffets  add a little baking soda that you fill up faster.
The chicken briyani was excellent and seasoned as it should minus the heat.  There we're other dishes but I did not partake. 
Service was attentive, my water glass was never empty. Well worth 10$ coupled with instant gratification. Thank you please come again.
