LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Have I just been completely unobservant, or do they purposely make their buffet an inside secret that only regulars know about? We came here near closing time on a Friday night, wondering if we could get anything before they closed. We casually asked about lamb shank, and the guy told us that we can get it when the buffet starts. Now the heating counters at the back made sense! So I guess they do this buffet on Friday nights after the regular closing time--whether this was a special event or one that is more regular on other days, I have no idea. I don't recall seeing any other signs or reading other Yelp reviews about this.

So we stayed and waited about half an hour (they didn't officially get started until past 8:20), and people kept pouring in over the next hour until the place completely filled up. At $15 a person (they price by the pound if you take out), it really was a good bargain. Most of their items are the same as on the regular menu, but what really stuck out was the lamb shank that we originally wanted. Huge bones with a lot of flavorful attached meat. What more can you want? 

Some of the chicken items were pretty dry, so I'll probably avoid that for future visits. They also bring out some soups, desserts, and a salad and fruit bar. So this was a pretty standard (but awesome) buffet.
