UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA My recent discovery and my recent all time favorite Indian lunch buffet for only $11.99. This place is a bit small, you have to come early or wait in line. During summer months they have patio dining that relieves over crowding. The value and the quality of food is excellent. You even get a choice of naan. There are a varieties of vegetarian dishes, and a handful of meat dishes including lamb or goat and of course the usual chicken curries and chicken tandorii. Dessert is also included.
