XAKZ6ADzAvK_IaFojW4wpA This place has good customer service, but the food isn't upto par.  Quantity for the price and way too much.  The seekh kabob, and kheer are the only dishes I liked.  Other dishes made bearable to eat only because their Raita is good.  Didn't like the Lentil Burger, way too much carb and dry, lentil in a bun?? It's a nice try for a fast food joint, but it's not close to typical Pakistani street food.  The flavor needs to be a little bold.  for 4 adults and 4 kids we spent about $225.  only because the food we tried wasn't fulfilling, or tasty so we tried other things on the menu.  we took left over for about 2 adults home.
