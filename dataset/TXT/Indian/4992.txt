2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Quick review

We did a take out once, and I am not going back again, we ordered butter chicken mild, it was chicken sunk in watery milk or cream they put in to dilute the curry. 
if  a restaurant cannot make a dish mild, they should just say so, also how and why the cook would do that to a dish and then serve it ?

anyway it gets really busy, and i felt like the staff was pretentious and slightly rude
it felt like they think that the restaurant is really high end, but to be honest its not, and even if it was they should put customer service first  and focus on food quality

Thanks for reading 

PS, they charge $3.00 for a naan, I found it to be little odd
