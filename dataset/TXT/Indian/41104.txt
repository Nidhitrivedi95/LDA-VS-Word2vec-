PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q This may be my favorite Indian Restaurant in the US to date.

Over the years, I've had several friends who live in Pittsburgh. One lived right down the street from India Garden, and she introduced me to the restaurant. Every time I go back to Pittsburgh, IG is a must-stop.

Not only are they open super-late, which is really nice if you have a student schedule, or happen to be rolling into town after a 4-hour car ride late at night, but dinner is half-off then, too! And its delicious Indian food, with a pretty wide variety of options, including a good vegetarian selection.

If only this place were in Austin. We could use some better Indian food here.
