z1RP-_vmj00EunHu9YA4-Q This is a fantastic restaurant and as long as you are not eating on your own, the prices will be very reasonable too. From Sunday-Thursday, if you eat in the restaurant, they have a great offer where you can get a free meal basically. If you order one starter, you get the second free and this applies for mains and desserts too. When me and my friend came here, it actually worked out to be one of the cheapest curries that we have actually had when we divided the cost between us. 
In terms of the quality of the food, it hits all the right notes too and I found that the papadams were light and crispy and the chicken rogan josh that I ordered was full of flavour, with a good serving of sauce to compliment the tender chicken. The drink prices were however, a bit steep, my friend paying £1.20 for a can of coke, but I only have water with my curry so I didn't have fork this out fortunately. I will definitely be coming back and making use of this great offer soon.
