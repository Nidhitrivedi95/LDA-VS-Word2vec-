ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Hit and miss. Food not always consistent but is really good when they're on their game.

Service is okay. A bit awkward, feeling as though they're not understand everything I'm saying. Sometimes it take a while to get the waiter's attention when it's busy.

Place is a little worn down but feels like one of those hole in the walls where the food is really authentic. It doesn't look like enough seating but they do have seating at the back as well.

I've try to change it up once in a while but have stuck to the chicken masala dolsa. So good and hearty. You can manage to eat it with a fork and knife but there's nothing wrong with using your hands. The wife is always happy with the variety of vegetarian selection. The naan bread is always fresh and just one piece is always enough.

Always have come back here when I crave Indian cuisine.
