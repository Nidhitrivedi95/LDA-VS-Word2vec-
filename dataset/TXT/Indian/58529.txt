YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q Having just ordered for delivery, I can safely say, the service from this place is terrible. I ordered from them over an hour ago and called to see if there was a problem with the order. The guy who picked up VERY rudely demanded what my address was, and when I didn't understand what he had said, he promptly just barked "WHAT ADDRESS" into the phone. He then proceeded to let me know it would take another 15-20mins, making the total delivery time 2 hours, which is over two times longer than their original claim.  The guy then, without anything else to say, just hung up!

At this point, regardless of what their food is like, I will no longer be ordering from or eating here ever again. This was only my first experience with them and I already regret it. Definitely not worth being treated like S***.
