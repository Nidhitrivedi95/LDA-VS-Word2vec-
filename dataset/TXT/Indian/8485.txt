7NurnM6G9b_2jTEKpIkQpg It's a take out restaurant, my husband and I just wanted to grab some express food and go. We lined up and waited to order. The server asked everyone about their order in the line except us (the server just ignored us!). During this time, someone in the line already grabbed their pre-cooked food. We walked all the way from the entrance to the casher, and ordered a veggie roti and a noodle. The guy confirmed the order with us and went back to the kitchen. Within 15 mins, there were 3 cashers came to us and double checked our order, and went to the kitchen again. After 20 mins of waiting, one female chaser were still asking what our order is!! One of the male cashers expained that because we are not the usually customer, we kinda did not know how to order...

SO, GUYS, IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE, THEN DON'T, CAUSE THEY DO NOT TAKR THE FIRST TIMER'S ORDER!

I gave 1 star for we finally left with one of the items.
