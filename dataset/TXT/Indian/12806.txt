B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg I think I could eat here every day and not get bored.
The staff is informative and helpful. The samosas are brought with a sampler of sauces, each one is fantastic. It is mouth watering good! The garlic naan is very tasty.
My husband's co-worker ate here everyday for 3 months while she was here for business. I can see why, the items on the menu are delicious. 
This place is a MUST for anyone wanting to experience the best Indian food in town!
