82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA I came here and tried the 5-course set tasting menu and was very pleased. For 36$ you chose one soup/salad, one starter, one meat dish, one veg dish, and one dessert. The menu had a dizzying array of choices so I requested the waiter to choose for me a set of dishes best representing the restaurant - with a request for spicy. 

The first dish was a lentil soup with a clear base and very spicy with coriander. A nice taste to set the tone for the meal, hearty and warm. I requested spicy and they obliged with this dish - which was the most spicy of any dish served. 

The entree was garlic shrimp. This was a miss for me. The sauce combined with the breading on the shrimp ended up being a mushy mess with a strange consistency. The shimps themselves were nicely cooked once you got through their soggy exterior 

The veg and meat dish were served together. The meat dish was a very nice lamb vindaloo. The lamb was tender and very flavorful. The vindaloo curry was excellently spiced and not too greasy. I do wish it was a bit more spicy though. The veg dish was another lentil based dish with saffron, coriander, and garlic. A nice combo, but the taste could use some more pop. As a pairing with the lamb vindaloo it was good, but on its own I would find it a bit bland. 

The waiter picked an excellent progression of dishes and the tastes went very nicely together. The service started as a bit indifferent, but warmed up over he meal with my waiter. Another waiter stood in for the dessert order and we were back to the indifference again. The decor of the restaurant is pleasing and would be a pleasant place for a group of friends or a date.
