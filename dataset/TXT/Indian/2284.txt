_nmOWqgx_KdLrj5pehDQmg Without a doubt one of the best karahi dishes I have eaten. I ordered the beef karahi and the beef was extremely tender and full of flavor. You can taste all the flavors as they dance on your tongue.

- well priced
- friendly staff
- good variety

Will definitely go back if I'm in AZ.
