5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA This place has been a new discovery for me, as it is close to the Indian grocery store. I went there a few weeks ago with friends for a sunday lunch buffer. It is a small restaurant, and the buffet is limited to just 6-7 dishes. What stands out about this buffet is that inspite of the limited food offerings, everything was very delicious and reminded me of a home-cooked Indian meal that we were accustomed to having in India. Another thing I loved about this place was that they served warm naan and pooris (puffed fried bread) in baskets straight to our table. The owners were very nice and the prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this place... try it for yourselves on a weekend for lunch
