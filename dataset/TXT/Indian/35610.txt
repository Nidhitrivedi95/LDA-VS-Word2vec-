N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg The Grand Canal Shoppes food court is somewhat always in a state of flux. The No1DP and I visit the Shoppes at least ever year for the last four years (partly because we end up staying at the Palazzo for his conference) and while we can count on staples such as Johnny Rockets, Subway and Wasabi Jane there's always one or two new business that open up that replaced the businesses that closed. Curry Pot was a new addition for this year.

Their slogan is "American made, authentically Indian". While I haven't eaten at enough Indian restaurants to make informed decisions about its authenticity what the No1DP and I can tell you that this was one of the better Indian places we tried. No1DP's also picky about his Indian food as he can get a good plate back in Japan. He was initially hesitant about my choice because his stomach doesn't go well with bad Indian food but I had a good gut feel about this place. Considering the affluent environment of the Venetian|Palazzo complex it has to cater to a wide range of ethnicities. The menu options are more limited than traditional Indian curry houses but what's unique about this particular Indian joint is their limited South Indian options. Normally traditional curry houses are staffed by people from the northern part of India so you wouldn't see masala dosa served here.

CURRY POTS: Served with cumin-saffron basmati rice, naan bread, salad.
- Chicken Tikka Masala (Chicken, Creamy Tomato Sauce, Red Chili Paste, Herbs & Spices)
- Classic Chicken Curry (Chicken, Onion-Tomato Sauce, Ginger-Garlic Paste, Herbs & Spices, $12)

No1DP got the tikka masala while I got their classic curry chicken. As mentioned we enjoyed our plates because not only was it delicious but it was also one of the healthier options in the food court. We noted that the curries were at least moderately spicy (which we didn't mind as we're used to moderately spicy) - we didn't specify spice levels and we don't know whether this could be adjusted for people who can't tolerate spicy food. Portions were quite big for a curry dish as there was a generous amount of chicken and a good amount of sauce for the "naan". We could have ended up sharing a curry pot and it would've been adequate for lunch.

We did note a few concerns with our dishes:
- The "naan" that was served was actually pita cooked in the style of naan. Though it was still a good bread and went well with the curry sauce, the business does advertise themselves as "authentically Indian". I would think Indians would have an issue with this.
- The salad contains too much onions. Needs more greens. I didn't mind this as much as I love onions with my curry and it was sprinkled with cumin.
- The No1DP ate one of the peppers and it was enough for him to be bothered by it for at least 5 minutes. As he's somewhat lactose intolerant mango lassi was out of the question and had to get rid of the lingering spice with beer. Upon inspection I noticed there was quite a bit of green pepper seeds in the salad. Again I like my spice so this wasn't much of an issue but I don't know how a person with a lower tolerance of spice would handle it.

Even with mild concerns the No1DP and I would come back here for a quick lunch should we be in the area. Hopefully this place does well enough so we could come back here again next year. I was bummed that I couldn't go back to Anchor Bar (last year's food court lunch), so I hope tourists will be more open-minded to try food court Indian.
