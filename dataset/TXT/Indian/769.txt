-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg Can't really rate the food. The service is sub par and it's incredibly loud, so much so that I had to leave. The ambient music is at level more appropriate for a cocktail lounge and it didn't help that the next table had three out of control kids. The menu is elaborate and looks good but I don't like dining at daycare.
