qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA There's a Green Room up on Bloor, and I don't know if there's any relation between them, but the décor and menu is very similar. It's got cheap pitchers of beer and cheap Pad Thai. There's a patio in the summer, but again, it's more of a cozy winter spot. People most commonly go there before or after a show at the El Mocambo up the street. It's in the perfect local and good for all budgets of course
