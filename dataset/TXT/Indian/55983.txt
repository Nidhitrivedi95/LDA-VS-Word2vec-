XcgLpUOMkK2PoaUmieHR6A I tried this place yesterday night, the restaurant it self looks nice inside however it was empty at about 7.  I orded take out, got the butter chicken and lamb saag.

The butter chicken was pretty standard, nothing special and lamb saag was awful.  It had no flavor and no spice.  The naan seemed like it was cooked in a pan then microwaved, very soft and flat.  It should be fluffy.  

Overall if you aren't use to indian food, this place would be fine, but if you are like me and love flavorful spicy indian food, this is not the place.
