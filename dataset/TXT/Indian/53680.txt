ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA I am really thankful for this amazing meal and fabulous service. We were guided through the menu and were able to try an Indian dessert that was delicious. They have a lunchtime buffet that I really want to try. It's a cute little place with great food and they play music videos while you eat. It's a very cultural experience and I highly recommend eating here.
