KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ WOW, this was seriously delicious!  Although I would say that I am a bit of a foodie, for some reason I have not ventured much into Indian cuisine, but this place has made me a believer.  I went there for the lunch buffet this week, and although I didn't know much of what I was putting on my plate (aside from the tandoori chicken), I have to say that I absolutely loved everything that I tried.  My favorite part was the end of the buffet that the server kindly explained was a selection of chutneys.  I took some of each and really enjoyed the kick of flavor that they gave to the other dishes I was eating.  The mango and cilantro chutneys were my favorites, oh and also the coconut chutney...  Anyway, will definitely come back here with my husband for a weekend date night, goal- to make him a believer too :)
