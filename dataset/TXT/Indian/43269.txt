RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg I've been to a few India food places in Seattle that are little wholes in the wall and all of them have been really good. I've seen the reviews about this place and decided to take a chance on it. I have to say while the service was nice, I didn't enjoy the food. Granted we are in vegas and the prices are sky high here, but for a small bowl of curry that I got here for the price that I paid,  I could of gotten the same bowl with a side of rice and nan for that price back home. With that, to each their own. All I know if you like India food just take a chance. You might have a different experience from me.
