GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw We are regulars here.  Any place that my 6-year-old daughter will go to that doesn't have an indoor playground must be good.
Love the Chicken Tika Masala.  Spiced to order.  Last few times we went, they did not have the 'Flying Horse Royal Lager', which is a bummer.  Would give 5 stars if they didn't 'nickle-and-dime' you over the rice and naan - should be included with an entre!
