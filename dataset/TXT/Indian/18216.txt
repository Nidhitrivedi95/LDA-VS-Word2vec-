EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg We stumbled on this place by accident.  We had left Circus Circus and wasn't really for sure what we wanted to eat.   So when we first walked in, everyone stared at us, but the manager was friendly and set us down and took our order.  The food came out quick.  I had a gyro, and my husband had the tiki marasala.  It was really delicious!  The kids had pizza (I would not recommend, it kinda looked like the stuff you get at school lunch) .  We would definitely go back!  The price was decent.
