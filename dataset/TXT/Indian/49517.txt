tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA First time to the India Oven. Been at the Indian food place down the street and really like it. But I think India Oven is just a tad better. Service was GREAT! Went for lunch and had the buffet.  SO good!  We were never looking for a server to get more naan! I enjoyed everything I had. I had to practice some real restraint to not go back for more, but I didn't want to overeat and end up falling asleep at my desk.  You gotta try this place. Can't wait to go back.
