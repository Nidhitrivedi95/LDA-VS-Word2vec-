q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw This review is for dinner that I ordered to go -   I will go back for lunch (buffet style) soon and update my review.

The owners are SUPER nice and friendly.

Chicken Tikka Masala was very tasty, big chunks of premium meat. Spices were good. Only draw back was there werent many pieces of meat, maybe 5-7.

Naan  was slightly above average, two large halves.

Dinner portions seem priced high, since they don't come with rice or naan. I spent $15 for these two items.
