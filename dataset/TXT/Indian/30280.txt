K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g This place has been teasing us for awhile now. Every time we go to the 24 Hour Fitness in the same plaze the smell of yummy Indian food wafts over to us and tempts us to either forgo our workouts entirely when we park or completely cancel it out when we walk out of the gym. Last night we decided to treat ourselves for dinner and made our way here since we've been craving Indian food for quite some time - we have yet to find our spot for this type of cuisine in our area. And we will probably still be hunting...

This place is not bad by any means. It is spacious and clean with lots of tables. Service is decent - not the quickest but not unforgiveable. The variety of menu items is great and their saag paneer is some of the best I've ever had. Their garlic naan is pretty darn good too. I only wish that an order comes with a little more bread for the price. Overall, tasty food at decent prices. 

The only downsides for us is that it's completely vegetarian so if we're craving chicken masala that goes unsatisfied. Thus the reason for our continued search for our one top spot for Indian cuisine. Not to say I won't be visiting this place again... I can totally see myself stopping in after a workout and picking up some naan bread and saag paneer to go. Now that's something to look forward to while on the treadmill!
