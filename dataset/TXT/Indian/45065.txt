S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Buffet is really good. Tikka masala, chicken curry, curry pakora were all very good. Naan was hot and fresh and tasted sooo good, your choice of garlic or plain. They don't skimp on the naan either. You got 4 large pieces at a time. Others only give you a piece or two at a time. I was able to try both and actually liked the plain better. Servers were very friendly and took my plate as soon as I was finished and kept my glass full. I guess a family owns it, mother, father and two sons. The dad is legit with a turban and a huge smile ready to get you what you need. For desert I had some of the best rice pudding I have ever had at an Indian buffet, and you can never go wrong with the gulab jaman. All you can eat for less than 10 bucks! I'll be back soon!
