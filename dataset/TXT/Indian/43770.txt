RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA I love this place! Its the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh! I absolutely love the chicken tikka masala, it is sooo good!! My boyfriend and I ordered take out once and I like spicy rating of 1 and he likes a 7 and when we got home and tried it they were both sevens. So if you're really sensitive like me, make sure to double check your order. I would definitely recommend Taste of India! I also really like all the vegetarian options!
