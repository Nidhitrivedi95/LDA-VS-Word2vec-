Hz6pXloEBWboBaJuEpk0JQ Great restaurant with wonderful service.  We decided to try this place out for a quick and casual dinner and loved it.  I had been to their Chicago location many times and was hoping this place would be just as good... and it was.

I had the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and it was everything I wanted.  The portions were just the right size and the sauce was delicious.  

The service was wonderful and surprisingly better than some higher end restaurants.  We were seated quickly and never really had to wait long for anything.  

If I get a craving for something ethnic while in Vegas, I'll be checking this place out!
