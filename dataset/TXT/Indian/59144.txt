yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug this review is for the lunch buffet.

this is a nice-looking restaurant, big buffet- there were lots of choices, and definitely more vegetarian-friendly options than nearby mint. i think they are a little better than mint in terms of sheer flavor and spice-level- while still not where i'd like it to be, it's a little more flavorful than typical indian buffet food.

the malai kofta was good and so was the aloo gobi- the latter had a nice fresh gingery flavor.

naan was served PIPING hot but our second basket didn't make it to our table until we were almost done eating. the service was a bit tricky in general- several different people waited on us, and there was no coordination between them, and they could be a little slow. at one point we waited like 15 minutes for someone to get us drink refills, and then right after we asked one guy to get them, another was asking if we wanted refills. it was confusing and inefficient.

it's somewhere between 3 and 4 stars as far as vegas indian buffets but i am erring on the side of less stars because of one glaring buffet omission: paneer. where was the paneer? :(
