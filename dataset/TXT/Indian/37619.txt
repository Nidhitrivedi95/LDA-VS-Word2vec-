OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Darbar was almost a 0 star review for me. I walked in at 9:50PM and was greeted at the door with a: "Kitchen closes at 10PM; we're closed."

...wait. Yelp says 10:30...

I'd walked about a kilometer in - 12C. Wtf.
I think my sadness and confusion must have been obvious as I stood by the door trying to use Yelp to find an alternative in the area. As an out-of-towner, I'm reliant on the Internet because I won't know about local places offhand. As I was dejectedly looking for dinner, the lady at the bar offered me to order carryout. Whew.

I took her up on the offer and ordered shahi paneer, rice, naan, and raita. Everything was okay, but not overly delicious. The raita was really different than any I've had (either from home in the US or India); I wasn't a fan and didn't eat it. The shahi paneer was very watery and the rice felt rather undercooked. Nothing that rendered the food inedible though.
