mfnmy_M3D5ElkgJD_TxoCA Despite looking like a sushi restaurant from the outside, this place has great craft brews, really friendly staff, and excellent food (complimentary popcorn!). I hope they change up their outside appearance so they attract more customers, I also think the music needs to be more mellow. Overall, I recommend it and will be back to try their brunch this weekend
