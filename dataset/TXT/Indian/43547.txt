rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ I'll say off the bat that I'm not an expert hen it comes to Indian food, but I've had it a few times, even in India and Malaysia.  
4 of us had different dishes and all of them had very soupy sauces with little meat or, for one of the dishes, vegetables.  
It was a little on the pricy side as far as places where you order at the counter go. 
2 appetizers and 2 entrées, an order of naan and just water to drink came to over $35.
The place is BYOB, and I have no problem with that.
I'd probably go again, but it's not on my highly recommended list.
