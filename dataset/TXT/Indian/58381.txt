YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ I live nearby, so I've tried this place a few times. I think their dinner and lunch standards are quite different. I enjoyed my butter chicken (the chicken kinda melts in the mouth, the curry is not spicy enough, but I would rate it 8/10.), I didn't like my lunch set special which I had on another visit, there was BBQ chicken included - the chicken meat was so dry it is just not worth buying it. Yet, their salmosa was amazing to me (someone who never been to India), i went in sometimes just to get salmosa.
