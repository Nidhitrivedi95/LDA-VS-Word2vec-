o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw OK, this is my new favorite Indian restaurant.  I'd been once before, a while back, but this time I was blown away.  Not sure if my taste changed or the kitchen changed, but  all three of us that went thought the food was OUTSTANDING.  We had the Papri Chaat as an appetizer.  The waitperson said it was Indian Nachos.  Wonderful!! You want to lick the plate.  For our meal we had the Dal Makhani, the Matter Paneer (which is by far the best I've had since I've been in AZ.  I think the total best is in a hole-in-the-wall in Berkeley CA.  And by the way, we pretty much did lick the bowl. Outstanding sauce.).The Hakka Noodles were a keeper.  I've never had noodles at an Indian restaurant before.  It won't be the last time.  he Garlic Naan was garlicy and hot (temp hot, not spicy hot) and the Roti was so cool and refreshing. The downside?  We over ordered and were on our way to the theatre so we couldn't take the leftovers. Our waitperson was so helpful and  pleasant.  I'm sure she probably wanted to boot us when we got into a hairy discussion re the spicy-ness of the food.  Extra attraction at no extra charge? The BIG Asiana Supermarket next door.  I'm sure I could have spent hours just wandering.  Anyway, if you're an Indian food fan, check out Saffron.  And if you're not, it's a good place to try Indian food for the first time.
