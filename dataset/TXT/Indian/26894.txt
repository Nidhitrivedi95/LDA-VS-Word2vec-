iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I am a sucker for some good Indian food.... well really, any kind of ethnic food! I have always heard some amazing things about Marigold Maison and when I finally had the opportunity to try this place I knew I had to go!

A few must trys! Their Samosa Chaat - which is a samosa with chickpea, onion, tomato, mint, yogurt, & tamarind. It's delicious and almost a deconstructed Samosa! The chicken tikka was delicious, as was their lamb Goan Vindaloo, made with wine, red chilis, curry leaves, and mustard seeds! Their naan was a knock out as well!

Highly recommend Marigold Maison
