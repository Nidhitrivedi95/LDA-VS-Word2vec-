NwLIEaqEz-9kcHkseLsfiQ Awesome Indo-pak food, that's really cheap.

This place is my spot for cheap eats after a night on Church Street.

It's on Church closer to Adelaide.  Not really hard to find. And parking is usually okay around that area. 

There is not much as in decor for this place.  A decent amount of seating, which gets pretty busy at times when the bars close.

The food is already prepared, you pick out what you want up at the front counter and they bring it to the table for you.

The quality of the food is not the best that I have ever had.  But it's pretty damn good, especially when you had a lot to drink.  

The staff is really friendly and the food is really cheap, what's not to like?
