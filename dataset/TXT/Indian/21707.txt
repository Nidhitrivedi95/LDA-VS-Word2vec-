GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g I love this place! I'd love it more if it was a few miles east, that is closer to my house. The dosa was wonderful, the puri with chick peas was divine. The thali was good although the okra was tough. I liked my uttapam but it isn't the best I've had. I would prefer silverware over plastic and plates over paper, oh well. Woodlands is my new favorite stop for Indian food in the valley.
