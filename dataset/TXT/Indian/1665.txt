-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Horrible and Overpriced. We ordered 2 entrees with naan and our bill was $45. Maybe that would be acceptable if the chicken tikka masala didn't taste like a can of Campbells tomato soup. Absolutely no flavor nor tasted authentically Indian. I'm sticking to my favorite, India Oven on Gilbert Rd. The quality there is fantastic at a more appropriate cost.
