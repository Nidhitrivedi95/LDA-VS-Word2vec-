xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw Cleveland Tiffin was a really fun experience. We were looking for a restaurant that would have a lot of vegetarian options and were very pleasantly surprised to discover an excellent Indian restaurant at a very accessible location on Warrensville Road, near 480.

The prices are very reasonable. We ordered a samosa, chana masala and malai kofta. Everything was very good. They will adjust spice however you'd like and next time I would request to take the spice down a notch on my order of Kofta. 

They do only begin preparing the food when you order it, so I'd suggest making sure you allow enough time. It's not a place that would be a good fit if you are in a hurry. 

Also - while we chose to dine in, I think it would be an excellent place to carry-out from in the future.
