J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I always enjoyed going to Little India but faced an unrealistic situation.
One of my friends came from out of town and I wanted her to try some good food in Toronto and decided to take her to Little India..But little did i know..They embarassed me so much and I wouldnt want to go there again.
My friend asked them if their meat was halal as i recalled that this place offered that. But when she asked to see the certificate (she explained later that in many countries that she visited, many places would claim that but wouldnt be able to prove it) and they got all funny on us and rude and defensive. my friend was trying to calm down the weightier as he was freaking out. That really bothered me of how they dealt with this situation and i asked him to calm down. But he was extremely rude to the point i got up from my seat and wanted to leave. I asked politely for then to apologize to my friend for the bad conduct but that went in vein. 
I always enjoyed the food there but embarrassing me and lying about your certifications isnt professional at all.
P.S the certificate turns out to be back from 2010 and they haven't renewed it since then. So them claiming they are halal, is bullcrap. There needs to be a check for these restaurants to see if they are in compliance to what they advertise.
