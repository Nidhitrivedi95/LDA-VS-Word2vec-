2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw What should you get at Samosa King? SAMOSAS obviously ;)
They have the best samosas in the area, both quality and price. The price has been the same for many years 5 samosas for $1. 
Samosa King is the best in the east end. In the west end, there's "Samosa & sweets factory" which is also 5 for $1, similar quality or maybe a bit better than samosa king IMO.
There's always a line up at Samosa King, be prepared to wait. Their other indian dishes are decent as well. I have yet tried their sweets so I can't comment on that. 

Highly recommend this place for samosas ;)
