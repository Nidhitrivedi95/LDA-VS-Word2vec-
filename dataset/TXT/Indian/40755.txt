pX7ftE5CySOa-5cpuJl_ZA I've been looking forward to try this place.  Love the restaurant. ..very modern and casual. Not a lot of sitting, but all the necessary. 
Food...i was craving gobi aloo, though they didn't have it, they were able to cook for me a very nice vegetables curry, with cauliflower. ..it was yummy! Rice was perfectly cook, yogurt sauce - raita-  was superb.... only thing was "different was the bread, im used to Naan. ..and  they serve it with Paratha, which was ok, just different. 
I will be back for sure...and by the way, their pastries look awesome, didnt get to try them, but i will *)
