LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng I came here for dinner with two friends. We ordered samoas, chicken curry, a lamb dish, and a lentil dish. The meat was juicy and flavorful, and I loved how the dishes were family style so that everyone could share. The lentil dish came out cold, and when we told the waiter, he immediately brought out a new one! Food and atmosphere are great! I don't kmow why other reviews were commenting about the saltiness of the food.
The only downside was the air-conditioning and the organization of the restaurant. The restaurant either didn't have the air-conditioning on or set the temperature really high; I was heavily sweating and felt very uncomfortable while eating.
As for the organization, we were asked the number of people in our party by three different hosts and there was no obvious communication made between the workers. We also had four different waiters who asked if we were ready to order as soon as we sat down, and when we were ready to order no one came so we had to flag someone. As a waitress myself, I am used to waiting on people in certain sections of the restaurant and making sure everyone is happy for efficiency.
Conclusion: food and atmosphere are great! AC and organization needs some work done.
