NSaTps4xn23kPyGzjrMa4Q 5 stars for location only. Rest the owner tried all his/her best not get even a single star. Reason is obvious .first impression. A day before some one referred this location.amazed to hear pakistani sweet in heartland area. But soon u enter inside.all your proudness just fishoooooouun. Door glass,showcase glass full of greasy hands impressions, chairs upside down on tables with full of dust. Easy to imagine the status of ' clean' kitchen ( out of access and sight). Show case was also ' decorated' with different real estate cards. Ordered qeema samosa, price according to market. But quality was questionable. But must say jaliabi was good and sweet. A very little job to clean n keep clean (at least the glass with windex)will boost the image , impact and customers.
