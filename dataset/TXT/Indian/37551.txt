OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Excellent place. I ordered the Thali with butter chicken, and it was fantastic. Every single item on the plate was delicious. 

I would also say they served the best Tandoori chicken I have ever tasted, hands down.

The people who run this restaurant are very nice, and were very patient with our loud and likely annoying group. All in all, our dining experience was excellent and I would go there again in a heartbeat.
