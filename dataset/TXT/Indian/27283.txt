Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q If you have hours to spare and are not hungry this is the place for you! Food here is great. We had butter chicken and lamb korma  along with samosas as well as rice and breads. Tastes fresh and authentic. First time we ordered delivery it was slow but this time was outrageous. We had to wait 2 HOURS for the food to arrive. Eating at 10 pm at night is not ideal! Upon ringing the restaurant I was told the delay was due to them only having one card machine (insane in any restaurant let alone on a busy Saturday night). I was told during that call the food would be another 15 minutes.  Had to wait another 45 minutes from there. When it FINALLY arrived the delivery man had the nerve to put an automatic tip on the machine even after I said I wouldn't be giving one..he then ignored me and did it anyway. I then had to tell him again. Fancy expecting a tip..how about after making your customer wait 2 hours you offer some compensation but no. Nothing. Such a shame as the food is good. Will not be returning again!
