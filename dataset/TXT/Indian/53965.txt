VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME OR TASTEBUDS!! This is by far the worst food I have ever had. I ordered chicken tikka which shoulders up with just pieces of chicken. No thari (curry) or anything resembling the traditional dish. The matar panned and bhangin was absolute garbage as well. The most tasteless Indian food I have ever had.
