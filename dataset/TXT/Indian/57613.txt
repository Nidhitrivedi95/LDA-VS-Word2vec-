yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This is part of India Plaza.  As you would expect, it is an Indian restaurant.  Punjabi, more specifically.  I had heard good things from Indian folks I know, but it took me a while to come in.

First, don't confuse the cafe next door with The Dhaba.  It's all part of the same plaza, same owner.  But the cafe has a much different menu (much simpler).  

The Dhaba is relatively small.  Perhaps 10 tables.  Reservations are a good idea if you want to be sure to get a table without waiting.  The ambiance is simple, understated.  The plates and utensils are rather unique.  Metal plates (with some sort of different metal rim piece).  I'm assuming these are traditional.

The menu is quite extensive.  I didn't really know what most of the items were.  There is vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian.  But no beef, which was not really a surprise.  The samosas were very good.  They were served with a chick-pea dip (or soup?), that was also really good.  We played it "safe" and went with vindaloo and tikka masala, and both were excellent also.  My wife did have the mango lasse, and she said it was good but not as good as India Oven.  The rest, however, was better.  The naan bread is not included, you have to order it.  It's good, but I think it should be included as it is in most other Indian restaurants.

Now for the bummer:  the price.  The Dhaba is probably 30% more expensive than the next best Indian restaurant we've found (India Oven).  Maybe 40%.  It was all good, but definitely pricey (despite Yelp's scale being "moderate"...at perhaps $20 per person including tip) compared to others in its category.  If you use "Groupon" they sometimes have one for The Dhaba, and it really helps.  The one I've seen you pay $20 for $40 of food.  We went over $40, and the final bill (after Groupon) was about what I would expect to pay at India Oven.  Is it worth it?  With a Groupon, Yes!  Without, well, that's up to you.

It is really good Indian food.
