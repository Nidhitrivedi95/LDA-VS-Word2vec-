NSaTps4xn23kPyGzjrMa4Q Rude and absolutely inconsiderate staff. Worst staff ever. Didn't even have the odacity to mention to people, who are waiting outside their store for an hour while fasting I might add, that their menu is done. No samosa no pakora nothing. Had to find out by a crummy little sign NEXT TO THE REGISTER, that their food is done for the day. If they had even a tiny bit of common sense just out that sign up at the door and save themselves the angry mob. They were asking to be screamed at. Have no sense of consideration.
