K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g This is an update to my previous review. I have given it one more star than before because i found a way to only experience the food and avoid possibly bad service...go for the lunch buffet. The buffet is decent and as mentioned before the high scores are due to its location in this part of town.
