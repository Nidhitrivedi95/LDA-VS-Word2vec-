llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Why is it that in Madison the Chinese food is so lousy and the Indian food so good? Swad does things very well. The real difference is that the people who work her really seem happy that you are there. They make eye contact with you and are friendly. Most of the other ones rarely speak to you or even look at you once you're seated for a buffet. I tried most of everything at the buffet and like all of it. They did have a couple of soups that I didn't like and the music choice that noon was annoying rock of some kind but all in all a great unpretentious place. Try it.
