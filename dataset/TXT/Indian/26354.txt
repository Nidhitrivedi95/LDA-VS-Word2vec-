ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Love Copper!!! It's tucked away in a cute house on East Blvd. Each of the front rooms in the house provide different dining spaces, and offers a cozy atmosphere. The food is fantastic. We started with the Potli Samosas which is just enough for two people. My husband ordered the Tiki Masa chicken dish and I ordered the Spiced Vegetable Curry, and you must order Naan bread with your meal. The dishes were so delicious and flavorful, and enough that we had leftovers. Definitely suggest going here....it's definitely in my top ten 5 for Charlotte! We will be back for sure!
