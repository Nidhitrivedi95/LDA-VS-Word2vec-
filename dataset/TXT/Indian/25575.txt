The rest of their stuff was fine by pretty mediocre, although the tandoori pomfret fish were well cooked. A real shame as the place is very smart and the service really rather good.

Overall, we said: "Kasturi isn't worth the visit. If what they are serving is "gourmet" Indian, as they claim, there are a raft of Indian places that should be expecting Michelin stars, any day now. Back in reality land, Kasturi should be walked past and pitied, because the tram works will likely mean it doesn't get a chance to mature and improve. But as things stand, they are contributing to their own downfall, in no small measure."
