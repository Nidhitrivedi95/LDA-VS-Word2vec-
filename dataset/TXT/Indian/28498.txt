J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Service: Friendly staff and they were patient in answering my questions. 

Ambiance: Restaurant is made up of two room packed with tiny tables, but still cozy and warm. 

Food: There were 3 of us so we ordered the Meat Combo for Two with some extra Naan. The waited allowed us to switch the Butter Chicken with the Vindaloo ( but we actually ended up ordering butter chicken later on as well, just to try it).

The Sizzler: The meat was delicious! My favourite was the shrimp and reshmi kebab! The flavour permeated the shrimp and it was insanely tender, and the kebab was well cooked and seasoned. 

The rice pulao was nothing worth noting. The naan was really good- and according to one of the guests the highlight of the meal. 

Our vegetarian option was chickpea curry, which was mediocre. The curry lacked dimension, maybe a squeeze of lime would have helped. Mind you, I am indian and also comparing it to the chickpea curry I get at home. 

The chicken currys were the real disappointment, both of the curries were overwhelmingly sweet. The vindaloo was way too sweet to be called a vindaloo, and also the flavour profile was very similar to butter chicken. The butter chicken, was also like dessert, resembled the vindaloo, just with added cream. Both currys were just alright, but a disappointment for a highly rated restaurant. 

Probably will go back if I am with someone who is trying indian food for the first time and we are in the area as the restaurant offers safe choices, but never for myself or with my family.
