ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw We brought in a groupon here Thanksgiving weekend--I simply don't know why the place wasn't super packed! The food was delicious, aromatic, and on the unique side for Indian. They carry a great wine selection. The service was impeccable (it almost put the strip's fancy restaurants to shame, no joke), and the decor is awesome. I definitely recommend this place to locals willing to venture close to the strip and deal with the traffic, but also tourists like myself who are sick of waiting in line and paying too much for mediocre food elsewhere. 

I'll be back next time I'm in town!
