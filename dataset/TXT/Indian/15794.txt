cY70RdP5w6gxRhY-wZ681A This Pakistani restaurant has great prices (kebabs are $1.79 each) and I've enjoyed their food in the 2 visits I've been. The biryani ,kebabs and naan are excellent and not greasy (unlike the very overpriced Lahore Tikka.) They also have a good variety of tandoori items. As other reviewers have commented, it does take a while for the food to arrive (it's prepared while you wait, you can see into the kitchen.) The decor is quite plain but OK. The female owner is quite friendly.
