-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw no frills ricey indian. meh. great spot for that sweet mango yogurt drink. wishing they were still in tempe; magic lost since the move up here.

#stingy on the meat. if they run out, they'll give you extra rice. WHAT?!
#i'm not an expert on indian, but that rice is soggy for my taste.
my indian friends say it must cook for hours to absorb the flavor, but they also say it should not be mushy like that.

--but that mango yogurt drink is a mean, sweet, beautiful thing. go for it.

#wishing that when you ask for a 20 on the 1-5 spiciness scale, that they'd give it a bit more effort.
