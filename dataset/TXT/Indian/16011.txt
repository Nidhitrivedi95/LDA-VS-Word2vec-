dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q I will not be returning here. Every time I go here I order pretty much the same thing off the a la carte menu: naan, rice, butter chicken. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. Sometimes it watery, poor quality, sometimes it's better quality. Sometimes a lot of good quality chicken, sometimes less fresh tasting and/or less meat. Maybe they have different chefs following different recipes. Or maybe they are sometimes scooping their to-go orders from their dinner buffet? Yes, I think that's it.
