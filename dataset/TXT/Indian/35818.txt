nJj6lNHq30xYDsCfLughCw Quick Review-I have been there few times, I had tried their Veggie Thali, and mutton Biriyani, The Thali was great, but I would not recommend the Biriyani.
I read somewhere in the reviews, that one person had ordered their Biriyani more than once. Wow! Quick description: Basmati rice drenched in turmeric, cloves and I think cinnamon ( it tasted bizarre ) with thinly sliced stir fry meat, sorry to say that is not any kind of Biriyani, and yes I had South Indian and Sri lankan Biriyani before, and it does not taste or look like what they have over there.

Overall 
The service was good
Stay away from the Biriyani.
I probably would go back and try their Dosas
