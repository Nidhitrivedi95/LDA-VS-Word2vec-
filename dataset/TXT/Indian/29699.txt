jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg Vegetarian Menu : made us sick.  

We should have complained and left but we ate it and forever regret it.

We ordered 4 Vegetarian entrees and all were OLD VEGETABLES ( I eat fresh vegetables every day so I know when I'm served old vegetables). 


We went there on a Friday night and from 6:30-7:30pm there were only 3 other patrons.
