DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ Week 2 of my "Indian Food Obsession". I have eaten some type of Indian/Pakistani food almost every other day! And I'm still not over it!

Today, I got take-out from Sweet India: butter chicken, rice and naan for the kids and goat biryani for me. Some mithai too, including a rather uncommon petha (candied winter melon). 

My goat biryani was delicious. Plenty of tender morsels. Well-spiced rice. For $4.99, it was just the right size for me (about 2 cups of food). I'm supposed to be on a low-carb diet, lol.

The kids said the butter chicken was delicious but didn't care much for the naan. Said it was a bit gummy. I wonder if the texture was bad because it had been wrapped in foil and taken to go?

Rice and naan cost extra, which is good if you are trying to watch the carbs.

There is a small seating area now for dining-in but it's still a basic place. 

I will be back!

Footnote: the boxes of sweets from various places had been piling up on my kitchen counter. Today, I noticed that Sweet India's box is gone - although it was the most recent addition. Guess we liked it the best. My favourite sweet was the Special Barfi. It tasted like saffron. I will have to go back and ask them. And get some more. Might as well pick up some goat biryani and butter chicken while I'm at it!

Sept 2016: 

Sweet India has finally moved into their shop and unfortunately, the quality has been affected. The butter chicken was dry and tasteless (boiled breast meat?) but the death blow was the barfi - I put a piece in my mouth and had to rush to spit it out. It was covered in GREEN MOULD!
