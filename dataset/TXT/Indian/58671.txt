YNut5B1o3FDtcdzwf9F_bw Ordered take out for the first time yesterday, I've never ordered dine in or through the application. We ordered the chicken biriyani and malai kofta. Dinner doesn't start till 6pm but the  phone line was turned off for more than 15 minutes after opening. Paradise is located in a small complex which can easily missed due to construction road blocks. It is in the same complex as Flying Saucer and Cookout. Veg and Chicken entrees are mildly priced but anything goat or seafood is mad expensive, they should consider bringing the price down. Our order came to about $28 including tax, pretty expensive.  

The biriyani itself was a good portion though there were 3 huge chunks of chicken that took up half the container it was served in. I wish they would consider a boneless chicken or remove the meat from the bones. In order for biryiani to be good, you HAVE TO order DOUBLE MASALA, SPICY. Dish can be pretty bland otherwise. It also comes with raita and some other sauce. The other sauce was too bland for me, I didn't like it. The malai kofta was very good, the sauce was creamy and on the sweet side as it should be. The actual dumplings themselves were also very good, came with 4 dumplings in the container. I wish more dumplings could fit or the price was reduced, this dish was pricey for the size. 

Will be trying more items from Paradise. Cheers!
