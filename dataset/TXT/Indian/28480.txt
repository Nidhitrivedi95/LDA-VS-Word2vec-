J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Have received confirmation by an Indian friend that this place is the real deal, and as an outsider, I would like to agree. Absolutely the best butter chicken I've ever had, and served with the plain paratha, is a perfect Sunday night staple.

Have tried spicier fare that did not disappoint, but it's hard to break my pattern here.
