Rk82QHtWp268GM93qWj3dQ The lunch buffet at Spice 9 is just wonderful! Each dish was clearly labeled and everything was very fresh and kept fully stocked. It was a nice mix of vegetarian/non vegetarian dishes.  The wait staff was pretty standoffish but I was fine with that.  A huge improvement over the express location uptown.
