KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ The paneer tika masala & chicken 65 are amazing and the people that work here are wonderful! The first time we came in we were served promptly, and attended to. I love northern Indian food ie shahi paneer, mattar paneer. I asked them what was equivalent. Happy the manager suggested the tika masala. It was great! We have come back once a week ever since. Great customer service, great people, yummmmy food.
