The items I ordered: 

- SAAG CHANA ROTI - very tasty but I didn't take their words to heart when they said their temperature levels are off the charts. The hot is insanely hot. 
- BUTTER CHICKEN ROTI - Very tasty and definitely a good dish. I went to medium this time around. much better in terms of the heat. Flavor was good and the quality of meat they used was good.
- LAMB JALFREZI ROTI - really tasty as well and nicely prepared. However, my only knock on it is that they kept the fat on some pieces and I found that the strong lamb flavor came out a little more than I would like. 

Overall great food.

I would also like to add, that this last experience of mine was the best. Not because of just good food BUT I ordered in advance and mentioned that I would be dining in with my colleague and they had everything served and divided up perfectly for us the moment we walked in and had the biggest smile. 
The frontline staff genuinely make you feel welcomed and provide good service.

Thanks,
