KvRh-exPg_KegOM_HXeskw I was driving by and decided to stop in.  Didn't know what to expect so it was indian curry and ice cream.  Interesting concept.  I ordered a chicken curry to go.  As I was waiting, I sampled the indian flavored ice creams.  They were AMAZING.  Don't bother getting the chocolate/vanilla standard flavors.  The rose petal ice cream, mango, and pumpkin ice creams were insanely good.  They make the indian flavored ice creams in house.  

So I ordered a few ice creams to go.  When I got home and tried the curry, it was alright.  The chapati wasn't that great.  If they upped their paratha/chappathi/naan game and made the curries solid, this joint would be popping.  

BUT, come for the ice cream.  It's the best.
