f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Great food! We ordered take out and they forgot one of the dishes and of course I realized it after I got home. I called the restaurant and told them what happened and they delivered the missed entree to the house...great customer service! Food is legit Indian taste just as good as what's made at home and spicy levels are appropriate! Definitely going back!
