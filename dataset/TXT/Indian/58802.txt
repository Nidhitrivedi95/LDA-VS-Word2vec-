yOi6Lrcm9EnbVxMj0lNSnQ Best indian food in town. Have been having dinner here for a long time. Favorite dish is their chicken tandoori, very juicy and flavourful!  The meal always started with a complementary pickled carrots with papadum. The staffs are always welcoming and friendly. Usually we would order combo for two- you get two meat dishes, one vegetable dish, appetizer and desserts. It came with rice, nann bread and salad.  It's a lot of food and great value!
