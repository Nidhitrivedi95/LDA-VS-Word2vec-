Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I love this place. If only we made it out this way more often. The naan is sensational, the lamb saag was some of the best we've had.  Also tried the chicken vindaloo which was a hit, even with our six-year-old son.  My only complaint is that I felt like the service was a little inattentive. Still, I would definitely return.
