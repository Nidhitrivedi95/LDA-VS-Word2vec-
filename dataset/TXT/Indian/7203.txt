5eDg_Y2N6aU_k7tIxoFXTg Wow, great Indian food! The Lobster Masala tasted very delicious and is my new favorite dish that I have ever tried at an Indian Restaurant. Some of my family is Indian and this is our new favorite Indian spot to go to when we go out for dinner with the family. There is nothing more authentic than the food served here, and the place looks great too! Looking forward to my next delicious meal here! A++
