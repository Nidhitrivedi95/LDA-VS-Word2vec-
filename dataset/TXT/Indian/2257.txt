_n5gPknmF6_WBrFngFb21w Even though yelp showed less than average stars for this place, i still went here to give it a try. We ordered a mysore masala dosa and the two stars i gave are solely for that. Shahi paneer was listed a specialty dish in menu but it tasted aweful (gravy was pure cream). We ate two bites and left it all there. A couple things I want the management to know if they are reading this review:

1. Your servers should make sure and ask customers how the food was,they didn't.
2. When serving food on table, their fingers shouldn't be touching the food. I saw a server put biryani on someone's table and his thumb was half way thru in biryani. That's unacceptable 
3. Sambhar served was cold, it was still
Cold upon asked to reheat, pay attention to details
4. You gave us  rice and the serving bowl had rice sticking out outside the bowl, pay attention to presentation
5. If you mail coupons to invite customers, make sure to honor them rather than finding ways not to honor them. Result is I won't be coming back and won't shy away from sharing my experience with others
