2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA The location is gross inside and I saw a cockroach climbing the wall. The food was tasty, but I woke up the next day with a killer headache -- which makes me think that they use MSG. I only gave this place two-stars because the food WAS tasty and I devoured it...but I won't be going back!!!
