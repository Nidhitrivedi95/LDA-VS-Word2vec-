cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Tried this restaurant on August 27, and will go back.

The food:  Started with the Mango and Clemintine Salad and the Vegetable Chatt.  The salad was good, but not fanastic - the dressing needed a little more work to make it stand out.  the chatt was, again, good, but not a real stand-out.

The main courses however, were very good.  I had the Tandoori Chicken, which was utterly perfect.  I'd go back for it in a heartbeat.  My partner had the Lamb Shank, which was also very good.

No desert.

And the naan is served generously - order 1 for two people, but will be plenty!

Service was good, but not exemplorary.
