GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I would want to give 2.5 stars but rounding off to 3. We ordered a delivery from Amazon restaurants. This place had lots of reviews, hence wanted to give it a try. 

We ordered Tandoori chicken, chicken keema and chicken korma. Both the curries came with rice. The Tandoori chicken to my surprise was really good, the meat was tender and juicy, really enjoyed the chicken. The keema was a disaster, there was absolutely no taste, it was bland and regretted it for ordering. The korma was alright for our taste and was better than keema. 

I would want to give them a chance and try other dishes considering the scarcity of good Indian restaurants in the valley. The price is pretty decent for the quantity.
