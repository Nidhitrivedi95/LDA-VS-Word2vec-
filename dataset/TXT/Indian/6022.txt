The staff was very attentive by keeping our glasses full and giving us as much naan as we wanted. The garlic naan is delicious and they have a bunch of vegetarian options. My boyfriend eats meat and he was surprised with how many meat options they had as well. I'm so happy I tried  this place, it's soooo good!
