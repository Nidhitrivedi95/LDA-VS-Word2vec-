gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I used to come to this building all the time...when it was a Burger King.  This was my first visit since Mt. Everest took over.  I went for the lunch buffet.  The selections were somewhat limited, but the food was pretty good.  They bring naan to the table.  Those who have eaten at other Indian buffets know that this is a nice touch, because it seems that you always have to wait and fight for the naan if it is on the buffet line.  The workers were friendly and efficient with water refills and plate removal.  Strangely though, they did not come to refill the soft drinks.  

Like I said, this used to be a Burger King.  With that being considered, the decor was nice.  The white tablecloths are a nice touch.  The parking situation can be a bit dicey as it is located in front of a busy market.
