tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This is the best Indian place in town! Everybody there is very friendly and helpful.

The food is also great, they have everything from a salad to lamb vindaloo. The garlic naan there is the best, but if you aren't a garlic person just ask and they'll bring you plain. For desert they have rice pudding, mango pudding, last but not least warm cheese balls. 

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who's looking for an Indian restaurant!
