uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA Been here twice and had very different experiences both times. 

The food is decent, South Indian fare. Not spectacular but not awful either. The prices and portion sizes are odd. My husband ordered a vegetarian korma and parota combo and got only one inedible parotha. At 11 bucks , a bit rich, especially compared to similar Indian restaurants in Tempe and Chandler. My Onion rava masala was huge and quite decent. 

Last time the lunch buffet was a better experience, though again mixed reviews on the food.

On my last visit, the server  was a lovely, smiling fellow who was both enthusiastic and available. Today, we had a grim lady who was serving the two occupied tables in the restaurant. I had to go looking for her  as the restroom was missing hand towels and toilet seat covers. She was not able to give me a napkin and it was just simpler to root around in my bag for one. 

Both times there haven't been many people and I am going to be headed to other South Indian restaurants where there is less pain and better, cheaper food easily available!
