g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA I've been wanting to check this place out for a long time and finally made it a point to come by and pay them a visit. It is really close to our house and I needed a new place to chill.

This is both a small restaurant and a good looking custom cake and pastries sanctuary. Check out their photos to see all of the delicious cakes and sugary yummies that they make. 

Inside is small with a menu that can be navigated with a scratch of a pencil on an ordering card. I got the impression that you place the order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Nothing fancy or sophisticated. Just fresh food with some tasty desserts to finish off your meal.

The menu has a few combo plates, several appetizers, a few pizzas with some hip flavors and another specialty called Chaat. Many of their dishes are designed for those who are on a meat free diet and actually taste very good. They even have some cool daily specials.

Ordered some meatless Samosa Chaat for a starter and was amazed on how good it tasted. The combination of textures and flavors were delightful. Next ordered a Chicken Tikka Pizza. My stomach was hungry and I needed a little more to eat. The pizza was a fusion of of flavors from India and Italy and served hot and fresh.

Ordering was a bit confusing at first and the place looked like they got slammed the night before. Will definitely come back and try out some of their other items on the menu. The desserts in the display cases looked amazing. ORDER UP!
