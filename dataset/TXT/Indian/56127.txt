Fresh, homemade Indian food that's not too greasy or salty.  I could tell because I didn't have mud-butt afterwards!  Many Indian restos makes my stomach turn (lactose/too oily?) and Feast of Dilli, didn't, so it passed my test.  :)

Strengths:
-  friendly service with a smile!
-  food arrived relatively quickly after ordering
-  fluffy naan (HUGE, fresh from oven, beautiful texture)
-  gravies (both Butter Chicken & Vindaloo sauces tasted distinctly different.  In particular the Butter Chicken gravy was really good!)

Meh:
-  coriander chutney that came with papadums (I've had better)
-  Mango Lassi ($2.95, tasted weird too me, a bit too acidity/sour.  It actually bubbled over like a mini volcano soon after it arrived on the table) - unless they change their recipe, SKIP IT!
-  presentation made it seem as though the portions weren't that big.  They used basic white bowls, the ones you'd find at Chinese restaurants, to separate the raita, main, and just threw rice/salad on a plate.  Could've been better & more authentically presented on those one of those stainless steel thali trays.

I'd definitely visit again if I was up for an Indian without any hesitation!
