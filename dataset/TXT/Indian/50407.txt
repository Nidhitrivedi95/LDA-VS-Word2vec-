UBv8heCQR0RPnUQG0zkXIQ The combination of tender flesh and devine aroma is how I would define the Dum Chicken.
I have been for sure hooked by the restaurant permanently. 
Proper , Authentic Haleem and Kheer were equally amazing and mouth watering. 
What makes this place even better is the host of the restaurant who caters according to customers needs.
