7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ A group of us from work had lunch here today for the first time.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food.  Because it was lunch it was buffet style (I hear dinner is sit down affair so I may be back to try that).  The plates reminded me of camping, they are all tin/silver , even the cups and small dishes.  I tried just about everything and all was excellent, my favorites was the butter cheese (paneer) and also the fried cauliflower.  I was too scared to try the goat though.

The main reasons I knocked a star off was because the selection was a little bit light, both Aroma and Tulips (the two other places we frequent in the area have larger selections).  Also, the Naan was burnt but that could have just been that batch.

I will most certainly be back for another visit.
