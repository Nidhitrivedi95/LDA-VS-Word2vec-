gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA Being a vegetarian, I am always happy to visit this place!   My only wish: they had a "cheat sheet".  Lots of Mexican restaurants have a 'glossary of food' and I think it would be helpful if Udupi Cafe had something like that.  I have eaten here a few times and I'm always pleased!
