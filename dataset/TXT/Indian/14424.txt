C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA When I walked by Kalendar's for the very first time, I was attracted by their patio. Tastefully decorated with plants, flowers and hanging gourds, their patio was super cute and romantic for dinner and drinks! I went there with my roommate and we had a corner seat. Normal street level noisiness since it is on College St. 
Food was alright. I ordered their "scrolls" which looked pretty good. Loved the cheese but it was a little watery, so watch out! Definitely used a knife and fork for this one lol. Their portions were actually pretty big so I only finished my salad and half scroll for dinner. Saved the other half for the next day's lunch! 

Only downside is that the food took Foreverrrr to come out. We went there on a Sunday evening at around 5:30pm so I'm not sure why it took almost an hour for our food to come out... I had to ask the waitress a few times. Just make sure you aren't super hungry when you go there in case there's a long wait for the food!
