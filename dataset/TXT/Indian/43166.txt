RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA I had never really considered coming to this place until me, and a group of friends booked a table to celebrate the end of the semester before exams. A lot of them had been before, and generally the feeling was that the Red Fort was a good place for a meal and BYOB drinks.

As we arrived, two things hit me:

1) This place was waaay smaller than I had expected, and while nicely decorated it really could have done with using its space better as we all were crushed into one area and couldnt really move - so we ended up eating without trying to move our arms.

2) Secondly, this place is HOT, and I have been assured that it is always hot but the air conditioning unit above the door never gets swiched on.

Anyway, to the food. The menu was large, but some what basic and uninspiring - but when our meals did come I really couldnt fault it, it tasted wonderful and there was plenty of it. Price wise I wasnt too shocked, which was nice - the entire meal worked out at around £11 per head.

So Red Fort does have nice food, if a bit limited in choice and insperation - but it really is too small for the large parties it caers for.
