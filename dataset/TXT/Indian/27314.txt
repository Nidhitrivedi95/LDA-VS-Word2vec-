ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w Having tried a range of Hakka restaurants in GTA, I can say this restaurant deserves a write up. 
Very nuanced dishes, prepared with care.

We ordered basil fried rice, beef green curry, chicken with assorted vegetables banana fritters, soups and Hakka chicken appetizer.

Everything was excellent, only caveat was some dishes were slightly salty.
