Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg This was our second time visiting this restaurant in a three day period. Indian food is one of my favorites and we eat it often. This is easily my favorite Indian restaurant that I've ever been to. The owner and staff are very friendly, knowledgeable and passionate. They go above and beyond in every situation. I cannot say enough about this restaurant. Everything we had from naan to the entrees were absolutely incredible!
