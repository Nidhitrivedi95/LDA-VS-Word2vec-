WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA Love the Roti here.I invariably have the jerk chicken because it is just so damn good.Being a carnivore I appreciate a solid serving of meat in my food and Bacchus doesn't disappoint and thet have an LLBO license for the days when you just need a beer with lunch,they are open late on weekends and the owners are super nice.
