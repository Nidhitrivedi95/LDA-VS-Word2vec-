0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ People here are super friendly and very efficient too!  Their food is very tasty and their lunch specials are great!  The range of their lunch menu is around $8.  

I do find that most of their food is breaded and I mostly ask for it not to be as that is also an option.  Their butter chicken is breaded and I'm used to non-breaded butter chicken, however it is quite tasty.  I would rate it a 4 in terms of tastiness.  The curry is not the yellow kind though.  It's more of the orangey type but still quite tasty.  You can also ask for extra spicy if you like. 

It is not a big restaurant and does get quite busy as it is a very popular Hakka Indian go to place in that area.  Lots of parking, so no worries about that.  

We do keep coming back here.  They are able to accommodate quick meal service if you are in a rush.  Definitely recommend a try here for their tasty Hakka food.
