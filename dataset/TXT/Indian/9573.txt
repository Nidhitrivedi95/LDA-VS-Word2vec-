8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ I can only assume from the blandness of the food that anyone giving this restaurant a high rating has been on a steady diet of over-cooked meat and boiled potatoes for the entirety of their lives. Also, I dare you to tell the difference between their butter chicken sauce and luke warm ketchup. The Sang Paneer was fine, but only after a liberal application of hot sauce.
