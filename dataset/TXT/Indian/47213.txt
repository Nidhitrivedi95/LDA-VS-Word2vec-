TBHpa0OX9WnWdlrti-KBxQ Heavenly Indian food! Went for the lunch buffet that had a wonderful selection - aloo gobi, tikka chicken, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, chicken mahkini, saag with chunks of tender lamb, paneer with chili sauce, two types of rice, and of course, raita, salads, green mint sauce, etc. Every dish was flavorful and well seasoned. I'd say about medium spice levels, but such a burst of flavor in your mouth! Really enjoyed the selection, preparation, and quality and will definitely come back and bring friends!

Back again May 21 for yet another excellent meal. Lamb with mushrooms, saag paneer, tikka masala, veg korma, and more! All expertly seasoned - bursts of flavor.
