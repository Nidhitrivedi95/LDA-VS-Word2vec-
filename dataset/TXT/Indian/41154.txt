PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ This is a nice restaurant it has a large variety of Indian dishes.  I like the fact that it had a nice fancy feel and would go here on a dressy occasions. 

There is a good selection of food and a very large variety of different types of cuisine. I truly enjoyed this place and I really enjoyed their variety of desserts as well. I felt that it was reasonably priced especially for something that gives you so much variety. I like the fact that they also have pizza and other random items in case you bring kids.
