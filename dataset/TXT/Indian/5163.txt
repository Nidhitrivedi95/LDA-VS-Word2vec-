I got the lamb madras masala (medium spicy - I really like spicy things, but asked if "hot" was Indian spicy or white person spicy. Dude said it was Indian spicy. While I could have *handled* something spicier than the medium, medium was quite spicy and actually absolutely perfect, as I was able to enjoy the flavours without crying. If you do not like spicy or have a low threshold, maybe order something else).

The first bite I was blown away by how delicious it was. An absolute beautiful blend of spices. I could barely handle how intense and amazing the flavours were.

Also, the roti was HUGE. Halfway through I was full, but it was so delicious I kept eating! I just could not let it go to waste.

I also had a mango lassi, which was amazing.

I am in pain because I ate way more than I should have, but it was just SO GOOD!
