zeykfCgUvy0LbgmVGjtCXw I had intended to visit the French restaurant next door, but it was completely packed on a Friday night so I went up the stairs to this Indian restaurant instead.  Wasn't very busy, but there were two large groups having a good time (both had wine, so they brought their own as this is a BYOB place).  

Ordered the combination dinner with dal soup, the soup was rather bland compared to what I've had elsewhere.  Next were some meat rolls with a small salad, and they were either dried out or overcooked, again somewhat bland.  For the main course, the chicken curry was spicy, but not in a pleasant way, just a slow after burn from the long red peppers.  The vegetables looked overcooked, but tasted ok.  The rice pudding for dessert was good, at least.  

Even though i only had water with the meal, this was one of the most expensive dinners during my visit to Montreal.  If you're traveling on to Toronto, save it for the lunch buffet at Dhaba, you won't regret it!  Otherwise, Indian food in Montreal doesn't seem to be that great so read plenty of reviews and choose wisely...
