Upon reaching the maître d' seats us. 
This is when things start going wrong, the owner turns up and refuses to serve us, we actually had to get up from our seat. When the owner left the maître d' offered to take order for a take away and then tried to push drinks on us ( not free, and no discount either).While we were waiting another person from the establishment suggested that we were pretty lucky that they were taking our order for a take away.
The food was pretty average, with the chicken chettinad tasting nothing like a chicken chettinad.
So to sum up if you wish to eat average Indian food and not feel welcome, Coriander India Grill is the place to be
