qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Oh Red Room. This place was a staple for me during University. I lived right down the street from here and I can honestly say I have had Breakfast and Dinner with beers in the same day here many o' times. Sad.. probably- but when it's that cheap why not? 

General rule, go for whats popular here AKA cheap sangria and pretty ok Pad Thai. Always my go-tos. 

If you've ever been to and liked Java house/ Green Room / Nirvana then you'll probably like this place too . Same general menu and vibes. Also They always have great tunes playing :).
If you're looking to get full and or a little tipsy on a budget check this place out!
