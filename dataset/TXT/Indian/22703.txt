GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw Went with my wife the week before the Labour Day weekend for an early dinner.  Just a couple of other guests in the restaurant so our service was very fast and  efficient.

We started with the Prawns Pakora.  Really liked the Mint Tamarind Chutney dipping sauce that came with it and even saved it to use for the main course.

We both had the Butter Chicken.  It was delicious with large chunks of moist chicken served in a creamy, buttery sauce that tasted great without the overdone curry flavour that seems to find its way into every dish in all of the cheap Indian places throughout Toronto whether you ordered a curry dish or not.  The Basmati rice it came with was nice and light and that's where I used the Tamarind Chutney when the butter cream sauce was finished.  It also came with a nice Thai salad which was incredibly fresh and crisp.  So why can't some of the bigger, richer restaurants and chains in this city ensure that their salads are this good?

The place is licensed so I had a Kingfisher beer and my wife had an apple Cider and they went very well with the meal.

Some reviews complain about the service, but ours was quick and efficient.  Our server was actually a little girl of 8 or 9 with an older lady behind her (grandmother?) to make sure she got it right and she did.

A fresh, delicious Indian meal for an affordable price (around $50) in downtown Toronto was a real treat and we will definitely be back to try something else on the menu.
