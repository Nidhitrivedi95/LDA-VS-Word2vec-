ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ By far the best Indian restaurant ever! I love how fresh and non greasy everything is. Awesome service and awesome food!

We've since ordered the lamb curry, butter chicken, chicken korma, plain and garlic naan, vegetable pakora and it was just all phenomenal! You have the option to mild, medium or hot spicy... And if you want to be adventurous you can do a mild to medium.... Which I think is just perfect for those who just want a little kick. :) Highly recommend this place!
