Love the medium spice chicken here and lamb! So flavourful and mouth watering. Service is a little slow but for a chill night when you are able to have a relaxing and chill dinner i highly recommend it. The portions are huge and you one hundred percent will have left overs and feel satisfied. Highly recommend. It's a tad expensive but the food portions are well worth it!
