Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Hands down the best indian food ever! My wife never had indian and can't eat lamb due to the gamey taste. We ordered the assortment plate of curries and meats. The lamb was amazing and my wife devoured it. Everything was delicious so much so we went back the next day before our departure for their lunch buffet and it was once again awsome and very reasonably priced. Whole staff is very friendly and the decor and ambience is laid back and mixed with history. Our server Kumar was the man and so friendly. This place is a gem amongst the overpriced hotel food and all the fast-food American and Mexican joints around.  This will be one of our stops everytime we are in vegas!
