aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q Get the lamb sub!!! It's incredible. Bread is warm and toasty, lamb chunks are tender and juicy, there's potato and vegetables to balance out the meat, and the flavour is amaaaaazing. I got medium spice level and it was perfect. Had just enough of a kick, but didn't burn my throat. 

Also tried the ground beef jumbo burrito...but compared to the lamb sub, it's pretty ordinary. I think if it was the only thing we tried, we would've still been really impressed though.

Guy behind the counter was nice, and food was made to order (it took about 15 mins for our food to be ready cause it was sizzling on the grill. Yum!). Only thing is the atmosphere, which isn't ideal for a sit-down meal, but great for take-out. 

With a name like New York Subs and Burritos, you wouldn't think it'd be Indian/fusian food, but it is, and boy do they do it right!
