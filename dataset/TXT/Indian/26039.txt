i68lkBrGgUVwOk-LSvMj_A Not bad.  But not good.  The food is a solid "fair".  The reason you find people who go nuts about Srees is, it is CHEAP.  It is C-H-E-A-P cheap!

I have eaten their food for lunch, since they had the one in Market Square downtown, closed about 1998 or so.  Now I go to the one on Murray in Squirrel hill, when I just want to taste something that vaguely reminds me of Indian food, I am in the area, and after a few bites, I do not mind throwing out what is left.

You get an entrée, with meat you get one more side, and a half slice of really lousy bread.  And in this case, I am being truthful.,  The bread slice you get with a meal at Srees is just meant to help in filling you up.  It is really bad, other than as a filler.

So, you can get a few dishes, if you go all vegetarian.  Or, if you choose the chicken with (usually) Garbonzo beans, you get one more side.

If I were on a really tight budget, like a student,  or was trying to make it to the next payday, this is a really good place that fills a niche.  But as far as being anything above "fair", it isn't.  Worth a try.  It is good filler if you just want a bite, or a cheap meal, but not "good".  

You get a LOT of food, for very little cash.  And THAT is VERY good, sometimes.  And hey, ANYTHING beats McD's or Burger Blech...
