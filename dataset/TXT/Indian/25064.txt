H4YK4AK3TimOFmv9GtqPGQ The best Indian food I've had downtown.  The buffet is constantly replenished with hot naan and other items.  Plenty of variety on the buffet.  Attentive service as far as drinks and plate clearing.  The food is hot and tasty.  This restaurant opened up where Curry Leaf used to be and they remodeled the front kitchen area slightly.
