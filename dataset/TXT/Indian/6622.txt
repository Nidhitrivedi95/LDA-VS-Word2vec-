483pQIBo1rxjZqms1s6V2Q I really enjoyed our meal at the Everest. We've decided to occasionally go out for dinner in Edinburgh since my partner now works there and, both being fans of a good curry, I took to Yelp to find a recommendation. Turned out to be a good plan.

We arrived at ~8pm on a Friday night and what surprised me most was how quiet it was. I'd booked ahead thinking this would be one of their busiest times but we definitely didn't need to. This is the only reason the place doesn't get five stars - it was almost awkwardly quiet. Perhaps it's one of those places that comes to life midweek?

Anyway, service was great. Prompt, friendly and helpful. Soon we were pouring over the menus trying to find something new to try. Although this is a Nepalese restaurant, they also have lots of classic dishes you'd expect to find in any good curry house. After some deliberation I opted for the lamb momo, thinking they looked like gyoza on the front of the menu, and the Sagarmatha Raksi Chicken. My partner went for the chicken pakora an the Kathmandu Lamb.

Everything was delicious. The momo were like gyoza, possibly a little softer and full of delicately spiced lamb. The chicken pakora were huge and tender. The curries were perfect as well and were just the right portion sizes.

I can't understand why this place is so quiet. The food is great and based on just one visit I already want to come back and try more.
