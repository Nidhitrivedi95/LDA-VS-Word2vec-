GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw This small place was quiet on a Thursday night. There's about 30 seats and only a few other people there besides myself. Service was quick but unrushed, and the food was great. There was some enjoyably mild tabla music playing softly in the background.  I was brought something that resembles a crunchy Indian taco shell, which was mildly spicy and very light. I ordered a tofu dish with fried vegetables, some rice and some garlic naan. Add a ginger ale and tax and the price was just over $21. But the issue was not that the price was too high for a dinner for one, but I ordered too much food. I ended up not finishing some of the naan, and barely made it through my great tasting entree. The herbed naan was marvelous, I really wanted to eat it all. The entree was served so hot it almost burnt my tongue, which is how I like it.
