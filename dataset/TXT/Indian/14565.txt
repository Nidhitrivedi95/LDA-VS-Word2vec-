C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw Just order delivery from this place and so happy with it. We ordered two of the combos and they were delivered fresh, hot and delicious. The curries were a bit on the spicier side which I really enjoy. It's a good amount of food, high quality for the price and very filling. Will definitely be ordering again!
