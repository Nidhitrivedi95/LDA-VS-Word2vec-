RU6E7WsAfsTRcjXxH1Lo5A Great new Indian place that's opened up next to Hawkins cinema off Scottsdale road and 101. 
Casual environment. Staff is super friendly. We ordered the wraps, a chicken and lamb. Both were made to order and tasted amazing. 
Owner who is also the chef personally cooked the food for us. 
Wraps were perfectly spicy. Meat was extremely moist and well cooked. The side chutney is perfect accompaniment. 
They also have other traditional Indian dishes you can try. I haven't had the chance to try these yet but will do it soon. 

Would highly recommend trying this place.
