I'd heard good things about Jaipur Grille so I made reservations for Winterlicious and dragged family and friends to try it out.

The interior: Thankfully doesn't reek like Banjara et al. It's polished but forgetfully bland. Soothing ambiance. We were the first ones there that afternoon, and it didn't get busy for Saturday lunch.

The service: Very attentive (just saw one waiter), friendly and accommodating. We walked in at 1pm  and were there till 4 pm!

The food: Was a tad disappointing. Mint chutney lacked mintiness. The dahi bhalla chaat (rice crisps in yogurt with sweet and tangy sauces) lacked sweet chutney. The tandoori wings (really looked forward to these) smelled like fowl. Not good.

The rogan josh was ok. Not terrible but nothing too praiseworthy either since it lacked fennel. The saag paneer lacked garlic and punch. It was ok.

The fish curry that I had was delicious: lightly sweet because of the onion puree and coconut and not because of artificial sweetener. The vegetable biryani won high praises from its consumer. The naan was really fresh. The mango mousse was quite good, not too sweet but still mangoey. The gulab jamuns also won praise from their consumer, but that consumer has 32 sweet teeth so it's no tall order!

My taste buds weren't too impressed. It's a one time deal for now.
