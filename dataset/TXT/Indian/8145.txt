7dZtL9I_AsTQ1pc6t9TTyA Yes it's great! We tried many things... Paneer Tikka, Bhel chaat tossed, Pav Bhaaji, Samosa Sliders and Cutting Chai. Everything was really good except Samosa Sliders... imli chutney was taking all the flavors of Samosa and I was not able to enjoy Samosa so at the end we had to leave because chutney was too much. I liked the fact that we can refill our cutting chai glass for free! Bhel chaat was awesome!
