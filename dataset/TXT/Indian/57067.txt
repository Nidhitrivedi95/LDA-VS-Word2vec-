Upon first glance, the shack-like eatery might not seem like the most appealing place to grab a bite, but sometimes it's the little crappy looking places that have the most authentic and best-tasting food.  Fry Bread House is one of those places for sure.

Fry bread is just that, fried bread.  It can be eaten in a number of ways, including as a taco shell wrap, and here, they are said to be the best in the state.  The fry bread is thick but airy and is folded in half to create their specialty dishes, fry bread tacos.  We tried the green fry bread taco, stuffed with spicy green chili beef, topped with lettuce and cheese, which was delicious.  My personal favorite was the chorizo taco, filled with spicy chorizo, also topped with cheese and lettuce.

Do not leave without having dessert.  The chocolate and butter fry bread is an award winning favorite, using their secret recipe.  It's basically a slab of fry bread loaded with chocolate sauce, butter, and God only knows how many calories.  We tried it and needless to say, it was amazing.

By the time we left, the line was out the door.  This is one of those places you come to indulge and try out the local cuisine.  We made it a pit stop on our trip through Phoenix, but I highly advise against making this greasy spoon a regular lunch spot.  

What it lacked in nutrition, it definitely made up for in taste.  Plus it was super cheap, and great for a quick meal.  I left completely stuffed, but I just had to try it all!  If you're ever in Phoenix, I have to insist that you stop in for a fry bread taco and/or a sweet!
