LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I absolutely love this place. There is always a long wait, so if you are going with a huge party..it's better to do reservations. I love their dosa's. The service is great and you don't have to wait too long for the food. Masala dosa and Mysore dosa are my favorites in the menu. They have some very unique dosa options...so if you are into experimenting this is the place. I will highly recommend this place for dosa
