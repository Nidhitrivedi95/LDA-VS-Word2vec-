Too much naan and little rice served on my veg thali; price could have been $12 rather than $14 and roti is usually served with the thali, not naan. But that's ok. It won't deter me from coming here again to try chaat, meat items and most importantly dosa's. Rather than spending $20+ on dinner meals at Blue Taj or other Indian restaurants, I'd pick Chaupati any day. It's more casual than others and perfect for evening meals when I'm lazy to cook.
