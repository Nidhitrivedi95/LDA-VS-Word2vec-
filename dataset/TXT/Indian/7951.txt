In terms of the actual restaurant it is more of a snack bar set up. Smaller groups (4 or less) are fine, otherwise it seems like the wait will be long. The decor was nice - sort of like an Indian diner. A lot of thought has gone into the food, drink selection and decor. It feels original. It's Wes Anderson's Darjeeling Limited x Montreal urban food scene.

There's sort of an uncomfortable reality of the place that was mentioned by another reviewer - Indian food by white people for (what seems to be) a largely white clientele. Overall, worth a visit as the food is impeccable, the atmosphere fun, and it inspires thoughts of traveling to India.
