wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Went the first night to try it out for great Indian food. (Based on all the reviews.) MAN was it delicious! The atmosphere is really nice and pretty with a nice setup in the restaurant. The owner happened to be there and had a nice chat with us since there wasn't a lot of customers at the time. (Cusses like a sailor but humorous too!) He even gave us free desserts! The only downside of this restaurant is the portion sizes run about $16.99+ for a small bowl with rice. Their naan is also terrific (they have assorted naan too!) Overall, if you want delicious Indian, and don't mind the prices, then by all means! Would definitely come back here again!
