RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Worsttttttt worsttttt restaurant in the history of mankind. Over-hyped and over-rated only by whites,  CBCDs ( Canadian born CONFUSED desis) (i said confused desis though I am Canadian, but I am not confused) and non-Lahori people who do not know what Lahori food is all about. The restaurant has the name Lahore , but it is an insult to Lahore and Lahori food. Lahori food is supposed to be flavorful  and full of aroma which this place's food lacks altogether.  Horrible. Biryani rice are as hard as nails, burned but undercooked tikka and kababs, Nihari is just plain beef stew not worth calling Nihari, Haleem is mostly just Daal and not haleem flavour. Extremely slowwwwwwww service with horrible wait time. All jammed packed with people who only know BUTTER CHICKEN is a Pakistani food. Lemme get t h is straight BUTTER CHICKEN IS NOT LAHORI OR PAKISTANI ITEM. Again butter chicken isn't a caliber to grade a restaurant.  Our $85 bucks were wasted. We would never go again. You dont need to pay $85 something dollars for lame food that is served in disposable plates and cutlery. Just do a reasearch on this page and you will know that all the so called good reviews were done by whites and mostly non-desi people and all of them are bragging about freaking butter chicken. Phhewwwww big deal.  See my review about Shaheen Tikka restaurant if you are interested.
