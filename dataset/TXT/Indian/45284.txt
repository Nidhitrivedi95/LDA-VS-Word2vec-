S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA The best Indian food in town. Everything is home made so they can accomodate allergies. The lamb korma was nice and zesty, had the 2nd hottest and the spice did not overpower the flavors. Bread was to die for and rice was great as always. Service stands out the most from my visit, they are attentive and personable. Perfect score for an excellent dining experience.
