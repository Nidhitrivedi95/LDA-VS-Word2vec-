DzYpjCOATXKYi1IsBLSPfQ This is a quick, cheap source of halal south Asian food. I got the butter chicken and chicken vindaloo. As you can see in the pictures, both were extremely oily and greasy. 

The butter chicken was overcooked, and the gravy/curry was disappointing. The chicken vindaloo fared slightly better, as the overall dish was tastier, but the potatoes were too salty, and it suffered worse from the oil issue; there was almost nothing in the container after the chicken and potatoes save straight-up oil. 

I'm giving three stars since the service was quick, the food was inexpensive, and the portions were a good size - the naans that came with each curry were large (though fairly tasteless). I'd be willing to give this place another shot.
