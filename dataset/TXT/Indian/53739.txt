ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA If you know Indian food, you know how hard it is to get an amazing dish, we'll this new place has the goods! The malai kofta has decent sized balls, the tikki masalas chicken was amazing, tender and full of flavor, the vindaloo has a great hearty flavor and the garlic naan i should have gotten more of, because my kids ate it all before i could get any! Portions are good,  the staff is friendly  (and not in that fake smile way, they are genuinely friendly) and I will be back for sure. Thanks guys for an amazing dinner!
