zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q I do love me some Pakistani/Indian food! Khyber Halal is a spot that i frequent and does not disappoint and its a family run joint, which i enjoy! My favorite dish here is the chicken biryani.  It's a nice blend of spices and they give you plenty of meat. They do seem to use a lot of white meat chicken; however, sometimes i do like the dark meat. If you are craving some decent indian food, i'd recommend this place!
