GRIRHR35knxFo0qySwIysw I have a mad crush on Curry Mahal and the adorable couple who run it. Today is the third time I have picked up takeout from them in two weeks, and as a rule I usually only eat takeout once a month. It's THAT good.

I am slowly working my way through the menu, but it's really hard because I like everything I've tasted so much and I just want it again. Like the crispy onion bhajis bursting with flavour... I can't NOT order them. I do not have that kind of willpower. And chana samosa... Do yourself a favour and eat it. The lamb, whatever sauce you choose, is so tender. The naan is epic. The mattar paneer converted my mattar paneer-hating husband into a lover of it, and we both get seriously possessive of leftovers. 

This food is so good that if you eat it alone you will find yourself speaking aloud, to the food, about how good it is. And asking it questions like, "How? Why? What is happening in my mouth?" 

Don't forget to order raita - you're gonna need it. I feel like the price is reasonable but I always order everything I want and then just eat leftovers for days so I'm not a great source. 

Shoutout to the super nice owners who are on the ball when it comes to allergies, special requests, and customer service.
