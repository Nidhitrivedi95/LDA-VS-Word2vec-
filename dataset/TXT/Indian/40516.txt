PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ Been going here for years. It's a great bring your own wine place. There is usually a line, but don't let that influence your decision to go there... the staff is hilarious and quick. I've tried 90% of the menu and its all pretty awesome. My typical order: samosa, pakora, chicken jalfraizi (great level of spice), basmati rice and garlic naan.
