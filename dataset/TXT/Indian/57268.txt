Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ DON'T EAT here. They are a bunch of CHEATS.  I ate there on a weekday night and the bill came to $13. I got a posted credit card transaction for $26. When I called them to check, they behaved like complete A**HOLES and would not respond to my questions. I have filed a dispute with my bank. If you eat here(which you shouldn't) remember to pay by cash.
