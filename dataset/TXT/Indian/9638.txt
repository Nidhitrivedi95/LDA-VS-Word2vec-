8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ I was a little wary of this place upon walking in, but by the time I left, stuffed to the gills and with a happy tummy, I knew I had to be back. Yes, the Butter Chicken is fabulous. How could it not be -- the place is called BUTTER CHICKEN FACTORY! However, although it's similarly rich to other butter chicken dishes you've tried, the version at Butter Chicken factory is more tomatoey and tangy. It's also a little more bland than other Butter Chickens I've tried. But the chicken is super tender, and you can get it in multiple ways: bone in or boneless, white meat or leg. 

The biggest standout, though, was the Tandoori Chicken. Maybe they should call this place the Tandoori Chicken Factory, because it was one of the most juiciest, meatiest, and largest portions I've ever gotten at an Indian restaurant. 

There were some things about Butter Chicken Factory that were a little off, though: there was a very VERY strong perfumey/incense smell that knocked me off my feet a little when I first walked in. To be honest, I almost wanted to walk about after that (but I'm glad I stayed). Also, my soda (pop, if you're Canadian!) didn't come with ice; they told us they didn't have any when we asked for some. That's a little weird. This obnoxious American needs her ice! ;D

But other than that, everything else was perfect. The people there were super friendly and nice, too. The menu has lots of options for combination meals to be split between parties of 2+, and apparently their lunchtime thalis can't be beat. 

I'm definitely coming back!
