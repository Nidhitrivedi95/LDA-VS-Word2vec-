The pakora was delicious but that green sauce hit the spot
The butter chicken was the most flavourful I've ever had.
Garlic naan was yummy and they even had onion naan that my hubby loved. 
Channa they made with the perfect level of heat.
Portion sizes are so big that we took the rest to go and have enough for another meal!
