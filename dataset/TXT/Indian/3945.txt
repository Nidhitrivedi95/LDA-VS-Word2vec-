0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw well i usually do not write reviews, if i do then either angry or really happy with their services.first thing first i liked the way they treat the people. there are few other restaurants in phoenix they do sell their product and done. but this place is different. been in USA for 5 yrs have tried lots of Indian restaurants but the taste was somewhat 'okay', neither satisfied and no complaints. KOHINOOR has the taste of INDIAN flavor, try their appetizer and you can expect what would be next thing to go for.my friends had their buffet it was too delicious and we already decided when would be our next team lunch. i would definitely recommend this place.
