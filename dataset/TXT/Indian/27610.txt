Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Just returned from my second lunch at Tamarind. Bhim and his crew have created a lovely atmosphere in which one can escape to India briefly. I particularly enjoyed the curries (shrimp and lamb), and am also a big fan of the naan for "mopping up". Service was quick and friendly. Bhim stopped by to check on us, and the "button"of coconut/cardomom  ice cream was a perfect ending to a well spiced meal. A hidden gem in Matthews!!
