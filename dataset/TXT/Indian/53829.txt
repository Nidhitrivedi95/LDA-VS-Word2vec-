It was a little salty in my eyes but we were practically ignored after they brought the dish.  Very little checking and rechecking for soda and water refills.  That said, my taste buds was flying all over the place since Indian food is one of the most flavorful cuisine in the world.  The owner recognized me and I really appreciate that.  Will be back again.
