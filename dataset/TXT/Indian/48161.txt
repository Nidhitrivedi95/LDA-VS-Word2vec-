TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA Ultimate south indian breakfast buffet! Totally satisfied with this place. The staff is friendly,the food is fresh, Dosas are crisp, chutneys are delicious and sambar is to die for! If you're planning to catch up the weekend buffet and don't want to wait then be there by 10.30 a.m.
