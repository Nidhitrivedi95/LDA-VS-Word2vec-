ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ I was a little nervous at first. It was slightly divey and empty for a Friday night. But it filled up after a while and the food was amazing. Had the lamb tiki masala, chicken Hyderabadi, spinach pakora, and paneer naan. All the dishes were great, five stars for each. Will definitely come back.
