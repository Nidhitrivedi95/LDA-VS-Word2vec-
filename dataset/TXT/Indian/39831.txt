pbnZqw5tHkZZBG5Ryys0yw This restaurant is clean and pleasant. The chaat is excellent. As a vegetarian, I can't speak personally about the butter chicken, but my companion said that it was a 6 out of 10. The pani puri was good, especially if you like sour pani - every place seems to have sweet pani these days and I can't stand it! It's clear that what they're going for is authentic, fresh Indian cuisine but some of the spice ratios seemed a little off. I suspect that the issue is that they don't have a lot of experience cooking large quantities of food. I'll be back in a few months and I fully expect to see improvement as they get more comfortable with cooking on a larger scale.
