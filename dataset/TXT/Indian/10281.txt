9n88Eyfp2wwJgGQGWakfCw Saw ads passing by the area for a grand opening, decided to check it out...2 items we requested for was 'sold out'. Their complimentary drink for the evening time celebrate was Mango Lassi - also sold out. The waitress offered us two free pops instead. We waited for 45 minutes for two appetizers....which were decent but certainly not worth the wait. There seemed to be too much chaos and pandemonium between the host, kitchen and servers for no apparent reason since the place was only moderately packed. The owner I believe, since he was dressed in a business suit only approached a few tables, seemed like he was appeasing and catering relatives/family friends more than regular customers or patrons there was distasteful especially given there were a few tables waiting on their orders for a while, he should've been concentrating on damage control but he was busy clicking pictures instead.  I give this one star as opposed to zero for the servers who were doing their best to keep things in some sort of order for the customers.
