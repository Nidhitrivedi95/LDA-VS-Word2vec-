B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog We thoroughly enjoyed the food we ordered. We frequently eat Indian food at home and usually order the same dishes. The tandoori chicken was super moist and flavorful. Samosas were wonderful. The sag paneer was less creamy than other places I have had it, but seemed to be a little closer to a stir fry. My daughter who loves chana masala thought it was just okay (less saucy and maybe the chickpeas were not as soft) but overall she enjoyed all the food. I would not say the food came quickly but it didn't stand out as way too slow either.
