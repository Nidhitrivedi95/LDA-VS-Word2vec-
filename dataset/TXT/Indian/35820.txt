nJj6lNHq30xYDsCfLughCw This place was great! True indian food!
Food was terrific and so spicy, just like in India!
We had the Vada with chutney, which was delicious. The fish and rice combo was enormous! we then had the mango lassi to counter the spiciness. All was delish.
We didn't have dinner that day - we were so full!
great value for your money. I'm usually not in the area, but when I'll go there again, I'm definitely coming back.
