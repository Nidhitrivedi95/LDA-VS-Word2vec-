xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw On the journey from Boca Raton, FL to San Jose, CA, I thought I'd be able to find some fry bread along the highway at some random stand or truck stop, but no luck.  I have only had fry bread once before, on a meandering cross-country alcohol and testosterone infused college spring break with some buddies.  One of them knew about fry bread and not only did we have some, but we got a recipe for it!  (long since lost, and never tried, but such is the folly of youth)

Haven't had any since college, so thought I'd get it while the gettings good (i.e. while crossing through states like NM and AZ which I never do).  I am no connoisseur of the bread, though it's good and greasy.  Cripsy too, which was my favourite part.  I had the bread as part of the House special, choosing the green chile stew.  I have been out of Texas and the southwest, so I was pleasantly surprised that the thing was actually spicy!  A perfect complement to the fry bread.

It was very good. I'm not saying it's a must-do in Phoenix, but it does fit along the lines of SW comfort food, while at the same time likely different from most food to which you are accustomed.  On a cold day (night) it would be a perfect dish.
