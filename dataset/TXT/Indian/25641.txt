hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Went for lunch. Way better than Origin India-no attitude (in fact the waitress was really nice) and not overpriced. The lunch combo is a great idea. You can try 3 dishes on the same plate and it comes with soup and nan. Didn't miss a buffet at all.  Everything was delicious, nothing was oily, greasy nor gristle-y.Got in and out within 35 minutes which is exactly what I want in a lunch place. Will definitely be back.
