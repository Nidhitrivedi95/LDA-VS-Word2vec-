MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ Someone suggested that we go to Bombay Palace since it's close to the office.  In all honesty, I've always been scared to try Indian food, for fear of not liking it.

I think every nightmare was lived with this restaurant.  As soon as you open the door, you smell this really strong aroma.  The blend of curries and strong sauces was unbearable.  

Needless to say this experience just got progressively worse.  It's a buffet, and I think it was $14.  Everything was just full of rich sauce that had this pungent odour.  
I took one bite and I felt so sick afterwards. 

Dining at this restaurant makes me want to add 3 stars to the rest of my reviews, because this was by far the worst dining experience ever.  I didn't eat anything, except  some bread without sauce.  I think they may have had some desserts, but I remember Indian desserts are just sugar on sugar.

If you like Indian food, maybe this is for you.  Even if you paid me, I wouldn't come back, it was that bad.  Even a 5 year old who puts random ingredients could make something better than the food here!
