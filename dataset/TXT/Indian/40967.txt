PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA Good food. I ate there everyday while I was in vegas. The only downside is the service staff. Once there was no one to take the order for 20 min even when there was no line. Another time their credit card machine was down so I had to go and get cash from the atm. But the food more than makes up for the bad service.  The problem I think is that the place is heavily under staffed.
