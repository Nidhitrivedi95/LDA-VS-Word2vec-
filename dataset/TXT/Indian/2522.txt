02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I went here for the first time with a co-worker as we wanted to try some Indian cuisine.  Co-worker has never tried it before and I've only had it maybe twice before this.

We enjoyed it for the most part.  We did the lunch buffet and sampled every single item that was offered.  At just under $11 including tax, I felt it was reasonable.  I found that many of the items were moderately spicy and this could be an issue to someone who is sensitive to spiciness.  Our favorite thing hands down was the veggie pakora - the deep fried mixed veggie fritter.  Their naan was also delicious and my second favorite thing.  Service was great - no complaints!

Yes, we would consider returning as time and mood allows.
