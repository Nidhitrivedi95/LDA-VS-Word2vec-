axGUBM5mgmFZQn85bMTVPA Great props to this strip-center Indian restaurant!

Randomly decided to give it a go at lunch.  The buffet on a whole was quite good.  The manager indicated that they keep the staples and switch out other dishes to mix it up.  The switch it up items are where they shine.  
Everything had great great flavor and spices.  PLUS (this is big one for me), they're not afraid of using spices.  The food wasn't "dumbed" down to satisfy  normal joe-blow-american.  Definitely some elements of heat to the items, but more so flavor.
Most definitely taking my husband back for this place.  It's worth the drive.
