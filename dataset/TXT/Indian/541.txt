-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g I'm giving mint indian just 2 stars based on my experience since they have bought the restaurant from karaikudi palace. I understand when you buy a business the first thing you do is recoup and that means a gradual increase in price. I'll start with the buffet, it's now 15.00 per person Friday thru Sunday, that's more then a dinner entree, I'm not sure they are using halal meat, I did not see the sight above the buffet, the Tuesday thru Thursday charge is now 13.00 dollars per person. The choices are a little different because of a new menu and chef, I was very turned off that they didn't have the traditional rice pudding for dessert, that is a mainstay of an indian buffet. Moving on with recouping, I placed a take out order and asked for some chutneys to go over the phone, when I arrived and got my check, I was charged 3.00 dollars for the 2, 1oz cups. I was a little disturbed about that being that tandoori times down the street would nver do that. To me that's asking for salsa or hot sauce and their should never be a charge for that. The decor has been updated but the service is sub par so it doesn't matter or make a difference, what's missing is Sam and Pandu, they were the face of the restaurant, I would have to say that the service factor has gone down having college students working in a fine dining establishment, not knowing when to approach a table to check in or clear dirty plates during the buffet service. I did notice plates piling up on the table next to us. The last thing I saw and agree with another yelper is the family and friends eating behind the bar, I have my opinion and I'll let all who reads format their own. I'd be happy to go back but they have to figure out a few things to improve/change to be a success
