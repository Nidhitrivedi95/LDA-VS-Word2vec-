OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Another 5 stars. This time is for their lunch Indian Buffet. As I promised, today I returned to Urban Turban to try their lunch buffet. Where else can you find unlimited portions of delicious Goat Curry, Tandoori Chicken and many other meat and vegetable specialties? And the price .... only $11.95. Toy should visit Urban Turban for lunch.
