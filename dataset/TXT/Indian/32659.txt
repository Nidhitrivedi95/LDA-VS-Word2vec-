LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Was here the week of Fourth of July. Widest range of selection of dosas. You name it, the have it. It was packed, understand they take reservations. I suggest you make one to avoid waiting. The wait could be really long- average 30 minutes. Excellent service. Because of the crowds they handle and the big group we had, they mixed up one dosa, but corrected it within minutes.  For dosas, I would rate it 6 stars but 5 is the max here.
