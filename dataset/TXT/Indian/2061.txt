_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg Guys, I have lived in different states, tried different  Indian restaurants. Being from India, I also know what they are cooking and how their food tastes like. 
I must say food is 2 out of 5 stars.
They had buffet and greed took over them and now they serve you small quantity of food for 7 bucks and also 9 bucks.

If you pay by credit card you will get a stink eye------ Beware.

I DO NOT recommended this restaurant. I also have doubts that they just say its a Indian restaurant but in actual it isn't.
