ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ I actually signed up for Yelp just to write this review.

I ordered from Just-Eat.ca at 5:30. 

At 6:45 I call to check on the status of my order. They say the driver has already left.

At 7:09 I call again, they say he is on his way.

At 7:25 I call again, they say to wait ten more minutes. I cancel the order. Let me elaborate - I am not a 40 minute drive from this restaurant, nor should the food have taken over an hour to prepare.

Two hour 'delivery' is unacceptable.
