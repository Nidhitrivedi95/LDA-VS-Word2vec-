My wife and I had their lunch special and was provided a full course meal for a great bargain. The meal started with a fresh salad. I ordered the lamb and it was tasty and didn't have the smell that most other Indian restaurants have I. Their lamb dishes. The sauce and garlic naan was delicious. My wife had the chicken tikka masala and that was great as well. To top off the meal was a clean rice pudding that refreshed the palate. Highly recommended.
