Had the dry with noodles as suggested by a fellow yelper and was very enjoyable, would return weekly if the drive was a little more forgiving time wise, will try to call ahead so food is ready when I get there next time and maybe I can make it a weekly staple while I am in the area on a regular basis for the time being
