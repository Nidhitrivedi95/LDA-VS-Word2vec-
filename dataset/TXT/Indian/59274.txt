yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I came on a Friday during lunch and had ate their buffet for $15. 

- Classy. high ceiling. fancy wine glass for water. nice silverware. 
- Great chicken curry! Not dry!
- Solid variety. Great taste.
- No old film over curries 
- Hint of spice! 
- To-Go buffet same price as lunch. $12.
- They had some chopped fruit, but didn't look too appetizing. 
- 2.5 plates, naan, and vermicelli pudding was enough to put me in a food coma..zZzZ
- I'd chose Mint if you come solo and want to yolo. But if you're +1, this is the place since you can use the $15 for 20 value and get the mango dessert from check-in!
