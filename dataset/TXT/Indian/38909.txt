OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This was the only restaurant open on Jan 1st, and the name sounded good and reviews were not bad either so decided to give it a try. So here we are me and my husband waiting to be seated. There was no body at the reception, so we figured it might be like a self service thing. We took the menu cards and seated ourselves. We ordered Chinese bhel, regular bhel, 2 Frankie's (one of them was vegan as mentioned in the menu!!), ragda chat. And pav bhaji.
We got 4 orders of the 6. Each order took 15 minutes to come out. There is so much chaos amongst the staff. They are not one bit friendly. I think one of the servers got fired, since there was a confusion in the order and we ended up cancelling it. The owner comes to us asking us about the cancelled order and goes inside. We hear yelling and shouting about our order. Then the server storms out of the kitchen using "f" words. I mean who would use such words in front of customers? 
All in all very bad customer service, even the owner isn't friendly. He had skipped an order in the bill, we corrected it, and there was no thank you for it. We are never coming back here. 1 is also too much for this place.
