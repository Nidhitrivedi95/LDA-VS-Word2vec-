iX0XUpk34WqHfUuLjPhR9g Nice little space with authentic dishes (curry inspired) to warm the palate on a cold winter day. Good assortment of beers on tap to pair with the dishes.  Dark & Stormy and Whisky Sour...both nice options.  Cozy and friendly no fuss atmosphere that delivers a wonderful plate.  If curry's your thing...this is most defiantly the place.
