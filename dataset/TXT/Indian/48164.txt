TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA It's been a while since i have been to sarvana bhavan and boy had i been missing out. I have been going to another very famous South Indian restaurant which has forgotten how to serve their guests lately and the staff seems to be very arrogant lately. 
Sarvana wasn't too busy at the moment of our visit on Sunday night at 9 and the food was delivered quickly. The dosas were delicious and crispy and sambhar was hot and just as i hoped. Staff has always been extremely polite at this place and i really enjoyed going back to a place that gets it right. 
Everybody in our group agreed that my favorite dish, paneer dosa, was the best they have ever tried. 
Will be going back there soon and telling all my friends about it too.
