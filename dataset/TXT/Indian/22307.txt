GmMZG6dsDqGVC275ZwD-cw 4 of us had lunch delivered at work from Sana.  I usually go with the vegetarian options with Indian food and today was no exception.  I ordered the aloo ghobi (cauliflower, potatoes and spices) & saag paneer (spinach with cheese cubes).  Unfortunately they ran out of spinach and I couldn't replace with eggplant dish as they were out of that as well.  She suggested the lentil curry dish and I was happy she did.  Wow, it was nice and spicy and perfect for eating with a piece of naan bread.  All my colleagues loved their dishes and like that the spice level is on the high side.  This will definitely be on my list of top Indian restaurants in Montréal along with Pushap.  The samosas are huge and very generous for the price.  Delivery was about an hour and all our bills were lumped together in 1, so we were left to figure out who owed what even though I asked for separate bills.  Furthermore he didn't have change!  Cash only.  Despite this hickup, I'm looking forward to my next dish.
