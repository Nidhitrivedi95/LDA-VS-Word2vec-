6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A I always feel like Indian food is kind of like pizza - that even when it's bad it's okay. For some reason, that's what I was expecting from a quick impromptu dinner I had here last week with my friend. 

Instead, we were both overwhelmed by how delicious all of the food we ordered was! We had garlic naan, vegetable biryani, masala dosa, mattar paneer and another vegetarian dish that I can't remember. Everything was awesome!

The service was great too! Everyone who works there was so friendly and efficient!

I definitely will be back and often.
