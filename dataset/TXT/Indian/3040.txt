0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I've been to the Dragon twice, and overall, it's good.

Pluses: Hakka cuisine, a blend of Chinese-Indian. The chili chicken was good, better the first time than the second time. Friendly staff, service is quick. It's right near Donlands subway, a very good thing during winter. The taste doesn't measure up to the other Hakka places I've eaten at (Federick's and Lin Garden), but it's not located in the middle of Scarborough so I can live with this.

Minuses: The cheesy decor and the tricky steps to the bathroom. 

Bottom Line: It's cheap, has generous portions and is obviously a fan of alliteration!
