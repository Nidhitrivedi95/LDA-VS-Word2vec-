jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw My Boyfriend and I are Vegans and we really appreciate restaurants who have Vegan options and who clearly mark there menu for dishes that can be made Vegan or that are Vegan. The food was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed all of it very much. The only thing that I am surprised about when reading the other reviews here, is that some people said the Spice level was zero. That was not the case for us. In fact, one rice dish we ordered was the lowest spice level of 4 and it was much much too spicy for us and we LOVE spicy food. The owner was very kind and removed the dish from our bill since we could not eat it. I just saw another review and I do agree that the falafels were a bit too dry. I like mine a little more moist. But other than those things, it was a very friendly environment with very good food.
