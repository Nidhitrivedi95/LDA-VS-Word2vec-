7LNuQqjcjAn0bBlGHIiQzQ I went to Agra Fine Indian Cuisine for a friends birthday dinner this past Saturday. They have P parking in the rear or you can park on the street but you may have to pay for parking depending on the time you are there.  Once I made it in I found that the atmosphere was good and the menu had a good variety to choose from. I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and the Butter Chicken with Garlic Nan and Regular Nan. The Lamb Vindaloo was pretty spicy and those who can take the heat will like this dish. I think it would be best served with rice. The Butter Chicken was really great. Only exception would be the actual chicken was a little bit dry, but the sauce was amazing especially with the Garlic Nan. I would come back just for the Butter Chicken. To those who like Indian food I would recommend that you give it a try.
