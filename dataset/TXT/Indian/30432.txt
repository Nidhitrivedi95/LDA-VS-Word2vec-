KCxdy3cm7H0jXnDhhPvBYw I hit this truck for lunch earlier this afternoon.  After glancing over the reviews, I called ahead to place my order.  I thought 10 min. would be sufficient, but the guy on the phone told me it would take 20.  So, I gave them 15 min. before heading down to pick up my order.

Based on others' recommendations, I ordered a small chicken tikka masala.  Given that the curry I'd ordered from the truck next door had been unbearably spicy for my taste at my normal spice level of 4, I decided to play it safe and order my dish with a spice level of 3.  I also ordered a mango lassi to accompany it, which I typically order with Indian dishes.  Both items cost $6 together, which is a bargain, even in Oakland.

Both the presentation and quality of the food at this truck were comparable to that of the truck next door.  The dish consisted mostly of rice and curry, with a few large chunks of chicken on top.  The chicken varied in quality, with some chunks consisting of questionable quality dark meat, and one chunk consisting of white meat.  The curry had a decent flavor and consistency, but was rather bland in terms of heat, which was a surprise after receiving super-spicy curry from the truck next door.  As for the mango lassi, it was similar to the one I received from the truck next door in its thin and rather watery consistency.

Although the food from this truck isn't something I'd go out of my way for, it's a convenient lunchtime option, esp. for college students and people who work at Pitt or Presby Hospital.  In addition to taking phone orders, this truck is on Tapingo.  Regardless of how you order, just be sure to allow enough time for them to make it, given that the food is MTO.
