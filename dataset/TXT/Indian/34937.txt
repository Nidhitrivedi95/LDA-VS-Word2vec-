Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Me and my mom went to dinner here tonight. It was awesome and mega yummy. 

Food wise we got the petite veggie samosas, which were delish, but a bit small. I got a lassi which was yummy. We also got rice and chicken tikka masala which was so good. I highly recommend. We also had naan which was nothing special but good non the less. 

Now service wise, it was great. Not only was it super quick, and my water was always full, everyone was super nice. We had the best server ever. Not only was he fantastic to talk to, very attentive and so sweet, he was also incredibly cute. I would def rank him in one of my favorite waiters ever. 

I cant wait to go back and eat their again.
