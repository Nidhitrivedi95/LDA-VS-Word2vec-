Nandini's website clearly states on the home page that the buffet is $8.99 every day. However, we were charged $11.99 per person instead. When I spoke to the manager he said that the price is higher because it includes soft drinks (which we did not even have). There was no menu stating prices, nor was there any mention of an up charge. The bill simply came at a highly inflated price.

This business is not honest and we will not be returning for this fact alone.
