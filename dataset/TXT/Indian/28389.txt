J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ We went there once and never again. I have tried good Indian food before and their dishes did not convince me. The pakora was ok but I tried their palak paneer and it was tasteless. No flavour, no nothing. The butter chicken was ok but not the best either. 
Their dishes seem to be a VERY light version of real Indian food (most likely intentionally) and I dare to say that it may be a tourist trap and yet they always seem to be busy.
 
I guess some people like it and some don't.

Still, I recommend to try other Indian places.

Note: I have never been to India.
