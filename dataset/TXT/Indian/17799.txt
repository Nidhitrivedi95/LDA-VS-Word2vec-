E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw Service was fast.  Prices are very reasonable.  The food is good by Champaign standards and OK by larger market standards.  I had the Chicken Vindaloo which had a nice flavor but was lacking in heat.  The naan was nice but just slightly burnt.  

I would go back if I was in champaign and jonesin for some indian food, but i wouldnt seek it out as a fantastic restaurant
