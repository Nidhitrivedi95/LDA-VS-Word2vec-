rxR93KtNb5vxGA17wiHd2w Khushi's has recently moved here from Victoria Street, and it's easy to see why it's doing so well.

Yes, it's true that Edinburgh has more than it's fair share of easy-on-the-pennies indian restaurants to choose from, but this place definitely ranks among the better ones. Even just from walking past the door, the smell alone makes you hungry.

It mainly caters for groups of students - it's the obvious choice for sports teams on their nights out or birthday meals, largely because they don't charge any corkage for bringing your own wine and beer (spirits aren't allowed). If you're not boozing, then you have to try their home-made fruit juice creations... I went for the Cucumber, Mint and Rock Salt, and although it sounds more than a little bit weird it was actually really tasty! The carrot and orange was a close second place.

The starters will set you back £3-5 each, and you could do a lot worse than the Sunhari Jhinga (king prawns fried in spiced batter... crispy and amazing). The mains range from £7-12, although they're not hugely imaginative - all the predictable dishes you'd expect to find on the menu in an Indian place. 

Being predictable, however, doesn't stop them from being delicious.
