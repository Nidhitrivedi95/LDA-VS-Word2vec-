kRAZ3PzNA8O_VrBI52FLKQ I have nothing but great things to say about this place. I usually don't eat cultural food besides my own but this place is amazing. Most of the time I buy the vegetarian meal. The veggies, rice, chick peas and of course the nan. The owner makes it quick and its always fresh.
