jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Amazing food and atmosphere . Great service and just killer food. Samosas, garlic Naan, chicken tikka masala , mango llasi! I was in heaven . It's weird placement of the restaurant , you take the stairs or elevator up to second floor and you are here. I would come back in a hot second !
