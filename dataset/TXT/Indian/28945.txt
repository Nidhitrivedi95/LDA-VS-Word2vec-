jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Second time at Pure Indian. something about their curries really draw me to this restaurant. Unique and flavorful. Quality curries I can't get at just any Indian restaurant. 

After being introduced to pure Indian I instantly fell in love given I work in aviation. I dragged another Flight Attendant along to share the joy of the spectacular views of the airplanes taking off and landing from the restaurant table. 

Some of my favorite dishes at pure Indian:
1. Saag
2. Tikka masala
3. Josh Rogan

Try their stuffed tikka naan for a twist on your normal naan bread next time
