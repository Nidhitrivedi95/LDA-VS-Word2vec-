XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Must have passed by this place a hundred times but never got around to going in till today. It was..."I feel..Like a big burger...With cheese..." [see sign advertising Chicken Tiki Masala Roti] "Oooohhh...I like chicken tiki masala!" Done and done. It was gooood. I asked them to make it spicy and would not be put off by their warnings. Turned out perfect. I give them four stars for now. Gotta go through the rest of their menu. Recommend if your in Parkdale.
