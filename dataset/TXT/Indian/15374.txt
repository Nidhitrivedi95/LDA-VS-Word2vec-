ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ An average Indian buffet. 

The pakroas are nice and crunchy and taste great! I like the sauce that you can use on them. The butter chicken is pretty good, as is the curry goat, but the rest of the selection consists of the average tasting usual suspects (chana masala, paneer, etc).

It's quite a big restaurant with huge windows overlooking the street, so I'm giving this 3 stars because of the atmosphere and good service.
