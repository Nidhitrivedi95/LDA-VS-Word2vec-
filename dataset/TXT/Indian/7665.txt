5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ I don't understand so many positive reviews for this extremely expensive restaurant.  The chicken in the vindaloo was so dry it was a chore to swallow.  The lamb in the khadai was like rubber.  The biryani was the blandest single Indian dish I've ever had.  No butter chicken on the menu?  Strange.   The chili pakoras were like two day old jalapeño poppers.  Really disappointed in this place.  Put a black eye on our New Years Eve.  No return visit here.
