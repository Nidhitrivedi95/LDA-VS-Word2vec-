I got the Thali-1 plate which includes 2 entrees and a side for $6.99. I chose the chili chicken and lamb vindaloo for my entrees and the naan for my side. I like spicy food, and these entrees are both considered "medium hot" which is why I picked them. The dishes did have a little kick to them (more so the chili chicken), but I would have preferred a little more heat. But looking past that, the flavors were spot on! The sauce for the lamb was extremely flavorful and great for soaking up with the naan. I also got a little taste from my friends' plates of the chicken tikka masala and chicken karahi, and I'd order them both in the future. Like I said, my only gripe is the spiciness. Since there aren't many dishes that are spicy here, I wish you could choose the spiciness level like many other Indian restaurants offer. Oh well! 

As for the atmosphere of this place, it is VERY casual. Just booths and mostly blank walls with the occasional random wall hanging. They clearly don't care about the decor, but I don't either as long as they continue to serve quality food!
