VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ Extremely shocking experience to the overall rating that is give to this resturant. Came in for buffet on Saturday evening, starters were stale, roti wasn't any closer to wht u would imagine for a Panjabi resturant..They are supposed to be the king of rotis...  Being an Indian  most of the veg and non- veg curry didn't taste for me any closer to what they are claimed to be. Meat tasted so stale. Then the disastrous deserts. Frankly over rated or may be its lost it's charm. NO GO!!
