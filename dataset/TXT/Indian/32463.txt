I opted for the chicken shawarma sandwich which was about a foot-long and also filled with veggies and mustard. The mustard gave the sandwich an unusual yet interesting taste.

I also tried the yogurt drink. As a warning, it is VERY salty. It's interesting to try but tough to finish unless you like salt...a lot.

The market portion of Salem's has more items typical of Middle Eastern food. You'll find rice, pita, beans, and a myriad of sauces and spices characteristic of food from Arabia and South Asia. The largest part of the market is certainly the butcher's counter. (I'd like to clarify that Salem's has a butcher's counter not a deli counter). The meats are halal and priced comparable to Giant Eagle. They do sell a few deli meats but no where to the same scale at which they sell chicken, ground beef, goat, and other butchered meats.
