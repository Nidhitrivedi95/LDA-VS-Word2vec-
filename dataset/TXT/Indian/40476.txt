PQTtKaBK_WdvLm-zp4fQ1g I'm so happy to have found Aachi! We have been so impressed not only with the quality of food we've had but also the service and company from all the people that work there. James is so nice and so knowledgeable about the food. I've also tried the buffet and is fantastic!!!!!! Great variety, price and the flavors. All dishes are incredible and vegetarian friendly! We will definitely make Aachi our number one stop for South Indian food. We really enjoy eating there and we always feel very appreciated!
