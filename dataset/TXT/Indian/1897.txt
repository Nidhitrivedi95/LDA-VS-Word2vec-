-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ I can only review their take out option as I've never had a sit down experience here. 
They have a very large collection of very authentic indian dishes (both hot and cold options) and it should be your first option if you're thinking of bringing something like samosa's or pakora's to a dinner party/potluck etc.

I made an order for 60 samosas and it only came out to a final cost of $33 (including 2 different dipping sauces!) ! So most definitely worth your money. In previous occasions where I've walked in to get some stuff, they've provided a complimentary box of gulab jamun. 

This is a place that I see a lot of Indians come for take out as well, so it must be a big hit in their community as well which says a lot about authenticity. 

Check out their menu online it's got everything there with prices.
