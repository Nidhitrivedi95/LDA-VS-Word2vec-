NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ Best naan I ever had. My main complaint is that EVERYTHING is spicy!!! Even the samosas. I love Indian food but can't tolerate spicy. I uses to go a lot until they started making everything spicy. I complained one time about how they told me a dish was not spicy and it was, they were nice and said sorry, but never offered to replace my order, so I've kinda stopped going because I can't keep paying for dishes that are too spicy for me. Too bad.
