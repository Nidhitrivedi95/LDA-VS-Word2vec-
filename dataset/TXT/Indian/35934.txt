nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ My fiancee often buys samosas here when we have large parties and the quality never disappoints. He always mentioned about the buffet so we finally decided to try it this weekend and we really enjoyed it! We had an early-ish dinner, we got there around 6pm on a friday night. It was still pretty dead so we were seated and served quickly. The friendliness and enthusiasm of the staff was "ok", however we were attended to often. The food selection is not as big as a larger buffet like "tandoori flame" but there were still enough options and the food was delicious!! The naan was made to order and it was really good! Also it was 16.99 per person.

Overal, food selection is smaller than bigger places but still great food, staff was "ok", and can't complain about the price! I would recommend this place and would visit again!
