82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Le Taj is the best Indian restaurant in Montreal downtown. They have an excellent selection during the lunch buffet. We were highly satisfied with all the dishes. Everything was freshly prepared and with the right amount of spices. Not only Indians will like it, but it will satisfy non-Indians as well. I will go back and highly recommend it. Staff is good.
