kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Our first visit to Bombay Spice was great. Their Indian/American fusion approach was interesting and there were plenty of options on the menu (lots of vegetarian and vegan options, almost everything is gluten-free). We opted for the "create your entree" option of selecting a base (rice/noodles), a sauce, and an "ingredient" (vegetables, vegan protein, or meat). Probably the only vegan chicken tikka masala you will find in the valley. The cafe ambiance was a little weird, probably not the best choice if you are going for a quiet, intimate meal. Service was pretty pokey (as expected after reviewing other Yelp reviews) so probably not a place we'd go if we were in a hurry. We enjoyed our meal and will be coming back.
