-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg I really wanted to love this place since I had heard so many wonderful things about it. I was a bit intimidated by the menu since it had lots of different things that I wasn't familiar with...and I've eaten Indian a lot.  We ordered the assorted appetizer which was okay...the breading was very doughy.  For entrees we had vegetable curry and chick peas and spinach.  Both were very tasty.  The thing I really didn't like was the service.  They put us in the back and pretty much ignored us.  Not good. Will I be back?  The jury is out.  Maybe I should give it another chance?
