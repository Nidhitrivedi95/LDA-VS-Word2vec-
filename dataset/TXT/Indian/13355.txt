bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug I've tried a lot of their menu items and overall I was pleased with the quality and quantity of their food and service. 
Tasty and flavourful food; lots of seasoning and yummy spices 
Very generous portions; I once shared one dish among 3 other people
Their decor has improved by a lot; a lot more modern and fresh looking
They have a lot of staff there so wait time isn't long and they're all very friendly 
Reasonable prices for the amount they're giving you 
I gave it 3 stars because at times their food is very oily and greasy. I found that usually this is not the case, but sometimes because they can be heavy-handed on that oil and the other flavours become masked by it
Overall I would still come back here to try more menu items
