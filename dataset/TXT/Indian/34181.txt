MDiH8mNfMCRV_UHGZ3VXxQ I had high hopes for this place but it fell terribly short.  I tried the 3 dish selection ... had the butter chicken, the spinach dish and the beef... with rice, salad, naan, and potatoes... I ate the salad, rice and butter chicken. I couldn't  stomach the other choices and I usually am able to eat even though I don't particularly like the taste.  The butter chicken was ok and the naan was soft.  I didn't finish the naan cause I tried to put the potatoes and beef in it to see if that would help me eat it.  I took a bite and didn't finish the rest.  I am not an Indian food expert ... I just like good tasting food lol.  I have eaten Indian food before so I have an idea of what good Indian food is and this was not it.  The staff member was very friendly though, but I wouldn't go back ... I don't want to say it was BAD, it just was not worth the calories...
