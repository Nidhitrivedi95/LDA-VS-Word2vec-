Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ Tasty and authentic indian food with traditional Indian decor is hard to find in this area.  We recently came here for a team dinner and were pleasantly surprised with the variety and quality of the food.  The chicken tikka masala is delicious and the vegetarian dishes are just as good.  Of course, the non-stop bollywood videos captivated our attention for hours.

The only reason this restaurant didn't get a higher rating is because of the lack of service.  There were only 3-4 parties in the entire restaurant and yet we waiting for a long time to get our food.  Service was slow and we had to ask several times just to make sure our order was not forgotten.  Nevertheless, I would definitely come back since the food was yummy and priced right.
