0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I'm not a seasoned Indian food connoisseur, but this place is great. 

It's simple and the owners are very nice. 

I've had great buffet food both times I have been there (once with a groupon). 

The shopping center kind of reminds me of a place where I might get mugged/kidnapped, but whatever.
