g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Am frequent to Scottsdale branch but Sunday we don't have it opened. So we visited Bell Rd branch. I have high expectations for this location as it should be the main branch. I am disappointed with the ambience firstly and the jalebi I ordered tastes oily. However I put the stars for their biryani and the quantity they offer. 

They can actually improve on the sweets section. But still I would try this place for their chat variety and the pastries :-)
