yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I was excited to try this restaurant yesterday because it's one of the few Indian restaurants that serves south Indian food.  I checked the times on the website and Facebook for dinner service and arrived during what I thought was dinner service. I was told the restaurant was not seating customers because of a private party, only takeout was available. Anyone familiar with south Indian food (ie dosas) knows it doesn't lend itself to takeout so I left disappointed and doubt I will go back. So my review is for poor service (why not post on Facebook that there is no dinner service?), not the food. I would advise anyone to call before making the trip to make sure you will be served.
