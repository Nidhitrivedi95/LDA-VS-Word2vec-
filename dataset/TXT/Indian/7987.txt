75HVFV2yYaaz0qH_KCgyFQ What a deal! At under $15/person for the all-you-can-eat buffet this is a definite stop while touring the shops along Gerrard Street East. 

Buffet selection is excellent. While I generally avoid the salad portion of the buffet (ice burg lettuce does not fit my idea of an Indian Buffet),  there are still over 20 traditional items to choose from.
