jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Ordered food through UberEats. 
They did not send the entire order and later just apologised and said that they cannot do anything about it. 

Really Disappointed. Better Avoid ordering from this place.

About Food: The butter chicken is made with boiled chicken and not chicken tikka. Disappointing.
