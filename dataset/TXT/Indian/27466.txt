IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA As a student living alone, I get take-aways regularly. Then I get annoyed because my bum isn't getting any smaller. Probably something to do with the take-aways that I don't stop eating until a)It's finished and b) i feel sick.

But Noor seem to have the solution! Their portions are quite small - perfect for one person! When I first got food from here (Chicken Korma, really creamy and delicious) I was kind of disappointed by what seemed like little amount of food I was given, but turns out it was perfect!!

They have a really extensive menu, it all looks delicious. I'm a spice pussy though, so I don't tend to go for the spice, but I'm told it's really good too!

They deliver too, which is great. They are even part of just-eat.co.uk so you don't even have to pick up the phone, order online!

I really like Noor!
