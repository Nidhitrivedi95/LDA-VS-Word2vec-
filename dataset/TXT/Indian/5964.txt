3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I'm so glad i decided to have Indian cuisine for the first time.  It was delicious!  I tried the garlic namn bread n the regular.  Regular one was my favorite.  The price was very reasonable. The buffet is the way to go of you're new to it.  I tried a bite size of everything then went back for seconds of my favorites. Loved the goat curry... but many others were great.  Namn bread is brought freshly made.
