0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w this is a nice spacious restaurant with low lighting and simple but nice decor, nothing all that memorable, but clean nonetheless.

we ordered the Non-Vegetarian Bhojan for two and to start we ordered the chicken momos.  so we had a mixture of indian and nepalese food.   the momos were absolutely deeeelicious.  they dough was cooked well (maybe slightly overdone, but if so just barely) so that it was soft and not overly chewy.  the filling inside was tender pieces of chicken and spinach i think.  that was very tangy, like it had soup inside or something.

then the waiter brought us one part of a our Bhojan.  that had a couple different kinds of chicken, like the tandoori, some boti kebab - which might have been beef or lamb, not sure.  the chicken was surprisingly tender and tasty in both forms.  the lamb/beef both in its form here and in the lamb curry to follow were overdone and too chewy, too rubbery.  what was to follow was the lamb curry, the mutter paneer, a raita and a couple of rice puddings for desert.

the sauces were pretty great, the accompanying veggies (though not substantial) were tasty, as they had absorbed the juices and accompanying sauces and spices of the meats.

the rice puddings were fine, tasty, but i dont think itd be my first pick of deserts in general.

all that was accompanied by 2 kingfisher beers a piece.  id like to come back here again, but id focus specifically on the nepalese dishes.
