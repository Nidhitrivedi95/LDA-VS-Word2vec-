ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Small selection. Tandoori chicken was not dry. Honestly this was the only thing I thought worth mentioning. I am not convinced that bringing a bloodhound would've helped me detect the garlic in the garlic naan. The goat meat must've been grass fed because it was mostly bony. I honestly don't remember eating anything there that I could think of. It was a mish mash of flavors. The rice dessert which most Indian restaurants do well is not done too well here. Too much noodle. Stick with Everest if you live in Summersville. And yes, they finally refilled our glasses of water after we paid the bill. My friend paid for lunch but I probably would've added Abe Lincoln to the coinage. Not paper Abe but copper Abe. 

I was looking forward to this place after seeing the high Yelp reviews. I guess anything is ranked better than nothing when there's slim pickings. I'm siding with slim on this one.
