A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA It's been a couple of weeks since we had dinner at Curry Garden but I promised myself I'd eventually write a Yelp because this little restaurant was such a delightful surprise and deserves some more fans. Husband and I shared two vegetarian entrees which arrived quickly, hot, and exactly as we ordered. Sometimes you just can't get the Indian restaurants to go easy on the hot peppers. We asked for something between mild and medium and that's what it was. The waitress was a perky young woman who offered good suggestions and an upbeat attitude. The roti was perfectly made and there was enough to take some home for another day. We'll be back!
