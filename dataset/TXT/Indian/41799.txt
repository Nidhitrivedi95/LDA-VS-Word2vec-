QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Well, my boyfriend was talking to the owner of the Indian Grocery on Greentree Rd and he explained that there was a new Indian restaurant opening up on Banksville with the chef from Tamarind behind the wheel. Needless we had to try it. 

I must say that it didn't excite me. The food was just adequate. I ordered something that I normally don't order (I'm a Mali Kofta girl) and it is a pretty popular item I'm sure. I've had better at the Days Inn down the road. That's pretty sad. The boy had soup and something else and just wasn't a fan. 

I think we'll be going back to Tamarind.
