TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw It's sad to walk into a restarting in which you are treated as if your money is no good. I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat during a lunch break from a work seminar I was attending at the hard rock. I picked this place because it was the first that showed up on yelp. My boyfriend and I drove over and the parking lot was empty. We walked inside and the waiter that greeted us seemed alarm we were there. He reluctantly gave us a menu. I put in my order and the waiter handed me a receipt and stated it was my check without having swiped my card. I didn't understand what this meant, so I asked should I swipe my card. The waiter again said the paper he handed me was my check and stared at me funny. I still didn't understand so I gave him my card. The waiter swiped it aggressively and stated it was declined. The waiter did the same thing with my boyfriend's card. My boyfriend finally asked the waiter could he do the swiping himself and guess what? Card approved! The food was absolutely delicious, but the customer service lacked tremendously. The 2 stars are for the food tasting so good. If you're not Indian, I wouldn't suggest visiting this restaurant. Seems like they only would like to cater to their kind and not all.
