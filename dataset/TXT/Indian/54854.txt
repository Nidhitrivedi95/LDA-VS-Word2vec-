We had buffet lunch here at The Host.  I had lived in the area for years but this is the first time I tried it.  I thought the selection was nice, though not as big as Chinese buffets (it is also less expensive in comparison).  I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken drum sticks and fish curry, but did not eat the naan as it was burnt on one side.  The temperature of the food was good and was well presented.

Overall a wonderful Indian buffet.  Service was friendly, nice seating area, clean washrooms.  Will visit again!
