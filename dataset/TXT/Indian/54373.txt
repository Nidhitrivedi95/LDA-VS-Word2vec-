Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A UPDATE:  After eating Indian across the country (literally drove from Cleveland to Los Angeles) I can safely say the five stars is warranted as described "..as good as it gets"!
This place consistently rocks the Indian grub! Ive been here three or four times over the course of a couple years and I have yet to have a bad experience with the food. In fact I find it hard to order because I KNOW it will all be good. You can tell everything is made in house including the samosas and the bread, a big plus for me. I wont go back to a restaurant that I feel like the food is "off the shelf".  Furthermore, its QUALITY eats. The flavors are rich and balanced. The portions are adequate, which is another nod to the quality.  I hate when restaurants load you up with a ton of food to hide sub par quality. I have never been unsatisfied with a meal here.  The rating is a solid four star, as I said the food is excellent, because the atmosphere is lacking, entirely. Don't get me wrong, I go to a restaurant for the food. I don't expect impeccable service or fancy appointments to enjoy a meal. This location has paint on the walls, that's it, no music, nothing. I will say this though, they recently moved into this spot (a year ago).  The old location (same shopping strip different space) had a mural on the wall.  Perhaps they have similar plans for the new space. 

To sum it up: Get there, immediately, with an empty stomach and a bunch of friends!
