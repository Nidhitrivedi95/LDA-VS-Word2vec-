ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ A friend just moved into the area and we decided to check out this joint! We are both HUGE indian food fans and this place did not disappoint.  

We both ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was very good.  the sauce was thick and flavorful and was mostly white meat.  I tend to like my chicken tikka masala with dark meat as i find it has more flavor.  anyhow, i ordered my dish spicy, but it was not spicy at all.  i find that when i ask for spicy at indian joints (and thai joints for that matter) they don't really believe me since its never spicy enough! i asked for additional spice to kick it up a notch and they brought out some jalapeno peppers.  It wasn't exactly what i was looking for, but whatevs.  

we also ordered the chicken biryani and it was very good.  you can tell they make everything homemade because the biryani was fresh! it had a great flavor, but was a little goopy, for lack of a better term.  it was still delicious though!

now let's get to the best part...the garlic naan.  YUM! damn, they know how to make some naan! 

if i were in the neighborhood again i would hit this place up, but i wouldn't go out of my way to get there.
