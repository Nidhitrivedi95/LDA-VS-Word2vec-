S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Had dinner a la carte here. For me, more than the food, it was eating here that mattered. Because, they filmed a major indian movie (tamil language movie) called Jeans (yes, the name of the movie is in English). This movie starred the beauty Aishwarya Rai. If she had visited here, then, me too wanna visit!!
Food was not bad at all. But, Tamba was way better (i think they are the same owners).
