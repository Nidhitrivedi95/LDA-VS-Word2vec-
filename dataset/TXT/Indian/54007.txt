VqJXm1NjJFYTNKtNp-h_DA I came in for a Shark 'n' Bake after watching Bizarre Foods. Not as weird as previously thought but man was it ever good. Lots of hot peppers, the bread was pretty tasty, the shark not so plentiful, but very flavourful. 

Next time I'll likely go for the Doubles as that seemed to be a real hit with the locals.
