XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw I used to date a girl that lived in Parkdale many years ago.  Losing this restaurant was one of the worst things about that breakup.

I probably cannot add much here.  I love the simple menu, huge portions and fair price.  I always remember the roti being super delicious.  And the restaurant was not a bad place to dine in either.  The owner was very pleasant.  

This is a good date place.  You can negotiate your two favourites and then share.  The wait (for the food) is worth it and gives you a chance to chat.  

Highly recommended.  I'd almost come up with a reason to come down from East York just to get a roti here.
