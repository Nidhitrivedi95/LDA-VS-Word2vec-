GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA This is about as good a place I've found in a while. From the fluffy perfectly baked naans to the rich curries with cuts of meat that remind one of what meat is supposed to be like, I've enjoyed everything I've tried here. From what I could make out this is a smallish family-run place (with a warm friendliness to match), but it seems to be expanding a bit. The decor is simple, as is the service - you get your own drinks and order at the counter - but that stuff is unimportant. What is really important is the quality, and this place delivers in every way.  If you like (north) Indian food, you'll find yourself at home - the spices and preparations are similar, though perhaps a little richer, and the names are different. And based on the Indian places I've seen in Phoenix, this place is far superior. I particularly recommend the Beef Achari, which was the first thing I tried there; I do want to try a biryani and see how that it, so watch this space for updates.

In short, if you want an awesome dining experience on a very reasonable budget, this is one of the best places you'll find, I guarantee.
