kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA We ate here on Friday 24 September, and were not very happy with the service or food. my wife and I are vegetarians and thought that this place would be a good place to eat, we do not eat onions or garlic and thought this would not be a problem as their website talks about fresh food.
When ordering we were told that pretty much every dish apart from the rice or nann was pre made and could not be made without onions and garlic, which was a big let down as all we could eat was the one panner dish.
We did ask if a fresh dish could be made but he said no as everything is pre prepared even the bhindi and paneer dishes and no other fresh items were available, but then our waiter did attempt to have made a jeera aloo dish with mixed veg which wasn't on the menu, so thanks to him for that.


 Finally, after paying a bill of £33 for 1 starter, two main dishes and two drinks we had to request the after dinner mints.


 In terms of service, this place is not great, but the decor of the restaurtant is nice if that helps.
