-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g If you're feeling a yearning for some delicious Indian food, look no further! The menu is predominantly South Indian but the North Indian treats such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Butter Masala and Kadahi Paneer are amazing as well. I was tired of the sub par Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area but Mint has definitely given me some hope. In terms of taste, Mint is definitely up there with the more famous and highly rated restaurants in places such as LA and SFO. If they keep doing this consistently I'll definitely revise my rating to 5 stars.
