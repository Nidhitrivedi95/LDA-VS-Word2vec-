KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Well first of, I was born and raised in India and have been cooking now for over a decade, so I'd like to think I have a good idea of Indian food. My fiance and I decided to try Passage to India today for lunch. We ordered the Chicken 65 for our appetizer. It was definitely not authentic, it was below average, too much cumin in my opinion and way too much cilantro. But the chicken was tender. We ordered it medium, it was fairly bland ( and I can't really eat spicy food).

I ordered the Chicken Biryani (boneless) and my fiance ordered the Chicken vindaloo, both medium spice level as well. I assumed boneless meant chicken breast, not dark meat without the bone. If I knew that was the case I would not have ordered it and paid extra for boneless chicken. It was full of cilantro (no brown onions at all) and it was more or a bland pulao than biryani. The rice was dry and undercooked and stale tasting. The waitress actually forgot to bring out the rice that is complimentary with the vindaloo and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes till we found another waiter who brought it out for us. This rice too was cold and stale. It definitely was not basmati (didn't have the smell or taste of basmati). Both dishes had no flavor, the vindaloo didn't taste anything like the peppery vinegary dish it was meant to taste like. I have a hard time believing the cooks are Indian.

The food overall was a complete disappointment and I would never recommend this place, especially not for the price. Save your money.
