I love Indian food but post wls it fills me up faster than any other food. Buffets are a waste because I can't eat much at a time. The rice bowl was perfect. It gave me some variety without being overwhelming and was fine for me to take my leftovers home. The food was tasty and the mango lassi was fresh and huge. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated. Would definitely come back.
