JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Well I can't review the food at all because we were turned away at the door. Now - I am fully aware that we showed up at 2:50 and they close for lunch at 3 and I would have NO PROBLEM being turned away except that a family in right in front of us - literally - was seated. In addition there were two tables of guests who had just received drinks, so they obviously were at the beginning of their meals. The only difference was that we are not Indian and everyone else was. The host was rude and not at all apologetic. Had I been alone I would have been a lot more demonstrative of the fact there I suspected some discrimination. I won't return.
