RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I love this place.  I feel like I'm an honorary member of Pakistani family when I'm there.  

It's a great place to go with a big group as it's casual and can handle disorganization.  Great for a summer day, the outdoor patio is welcoming. 

The food was great and very well priced.  The kabab's were the obvious winner of the dishes, in particular the lamb kabobs.  The butter chicken was your average fare. 
   
Among the vegetarian dishes, we tried the saag paneer, which was good but greasy, and the muter paneer, which was tasty but too heavy on the green peas.

The "special" tea was something to beware.  The pink concoction seemed sour, and watching them making the tea in the huge barrels on my way out made be lose my appetite a bit. Maybe it's an acquired taste.

Overall, a definite staple to add to your list authentic pakistani/indian food.
