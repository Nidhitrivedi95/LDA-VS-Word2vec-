auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Delicious lunch buffet for $10.95! Lots of variety on the buffet line (some chicken dishes, goat, plenty of veggie options, lots of dipping sauces that were so fresh, and rice pudding for dessert). The buffet included unlimited naan (choose between garlic or regular). Their naan was crispier than other naan I've had, but still yummy. Friendly service, awesome decor. Can't beat it!
