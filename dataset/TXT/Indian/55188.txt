Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Been here for both lunch and dinner and the food is solid enough here to warrant 4 stars.

Lunch is a typical buffet and the variety is generally quite good.  They also have, fairly regularly, goat curry as well, which most places don't.  It's on the bone, be careful, but the meat is tender and reminiscent of lamb.  The lunch buffet also has a few desserts (kheer!) and complimentary chai masala.

Also came here for dinner with large parties a couple times.  Service was great and the food is even better for dinner.  (No mass quantity cooking).  Our usual:  chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, saag paneer, daal, chicken curry, samosas, and loads of garlic naan.  The portions are generous and the food, all of it generally, is delicious.  The restaurant was kind enough on one occasion to offer us free gulab jamun after one big dinner, a very nice gesture.

But even without the freebies, this place still warrants a 4-star review.  The daal and chicken curry were the weakest dishes, the aloo gobi was somewhere in the middle, and the chicken tikka masala and saag paneer were excellent.  This dinner party was not so high up on lamb, but I've had their lamb vindaloo as well and it is spicy and excellent.

The interior is a tad dim.  Been that way ever since I've been going to this place.
