2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Mine was a mixed experience. We ordered Veg Chowmein, Murgh laziz and Naans. Chowmein was really good, one of the best I have had in US and Canada. Murgh Laziz was just ok. Given the Chowmein was good, we ordered Dry Chilli Paneer but unlike Chowmein this was a total disaster! It was too sweet and lacked all other spices or the schezwan taste. I checked with the server and she said that's how it is supposed to be!! I have never had that sweet a chilli paneer. For dessert we ordered Coconut fried icecream which was another disaster, smelled of old oil and old coconut.. We ordered masala tea which came after 45 minutes and was as if they made it in literally under a minute. The staff is not very customer friendly either. Our server was busy setting up the tables for next day although they had more than an hour left was closing time.
The one star is for the good Chowmein.
