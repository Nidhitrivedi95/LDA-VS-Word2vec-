P4h8kgy_48oE9vCHJc4BCQ I called the resto to do a pick up order so I could have it ready and bagged by the time I got there, but the lady declined my request so I assume they dont do call ahead pick up orders. 

Anyway, I got to Silver Spoon and it started to get quite busy after I came which was just before dinner.(5pm)
I ordered combo #3 for $7.99 which includes biryani rice, and two diff curry meats (I opted for two butter chickens instead). The lady at the counter was ok.. she was a little rude, and not attentive. I asked for two orders of naan and she came back with one. She kept saying I only asked for one and never told her two but I did. This kind of frusterated me. Lol

Portions are large. Foods pretty good. Butter chicken was spicy, but still tolerable considering I normally dont do spicy. Definitely a good price

I would recommend coming on Friday because they give two naans for free if you purchase any large Curry meat dish. 

Would come back again..when Im not in a rush (slow service).
