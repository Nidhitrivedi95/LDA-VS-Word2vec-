NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I went to this restaurant for lunch, honestly not knowing what to expect.   Fast food Indian, is how it was described.  I was skeptical, but now I am a believer.  Great atmosphere, quite busy, and impeccably clean, right down yo the high tech automatic hand cleaners in the dining room.  Food is very high quality, very well prepared, and good portion sizes.   The menu is smallish, but I suppose for food that is high quality and fast, that's a small sacrifice.   Overall, very impressed!
