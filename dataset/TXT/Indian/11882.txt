aTRnnM41SxIV-u4rUwceOg This is a strange little place. My 3 coworkers and I zipped in for lunch. It's a little hole in the wall with barely any seating and very little insulation. It was freezing in there. Take out is definitely the way to go here.
The bad. The menu is confusing and there are no prices. We couldn't see any printed paper menus to take either. The gentleman working the grill and cash was difficult to understand, and messed up 1 of our 4 orders. And he cooks one order at a time. So it took us a while to get out of there.
The good. The food is really good. The portions are huge. We could have fed 8 people easily. And the prices are excellent.
We shared some savoury doughnut things that were very nice. Also, the mutton rolls, which were ok. And the fried curry potato balls which were tasty.
My coworker got the Kothu Roti. The flavour was nice and rich, but she found the consistency a bit off-putting. The rest of us got the chili chicken. Even the mild spice has a nice heat to it. It is quite something to see him throw all the ingredients on the flat top. A huge amount of rice, a good portion of chili chicken, a leg of tandoori style chicken and a boiled egg. Wild. So much food. We thought that one order was for all 4 of us. All that for around $40.
We'll order more carefully next time, but we'll be back.
Cheers
