9cGvOaA1BYw-ByOXjNbu9A We visited Priya restaurant  today with the hope of tasting good Indian food. Glad to say our expectations were exceeded. The manager ( FEROZ) was extremely friendly and helpful.  The place was nice and  clean, the staff were very courteous. The food was authentic south Indian. The uthapam, Idly and  variety of chutneys ( mint,  coconut and tamarind) were excellent. The tandoori chicken  was flavorful  and yummy. The rasam  was as good as any you would have at a south Indian home for lunch. All the curries were uniformly excellent (my favorite was the kerala style fish curry). There was wonderful variety of veg and non veg meals  (gobi manchurian,  veg fried rice, chicken briyani,  egg curry, carrot and peas poriyal, spinach pakora, mutter panneer etc.). It was a very good deal for $13 per person.   The only issue i had was that the desserts were too sweet for my liking.
A special  note of thanks to Feroz.  We went to the restaurant with our 7 month old son and had some trouble getting a cab ride back to our place. He arranged some one to drop us at our place  which was totally out of the  way. Thanks for that. Look forward to visiting this place on a regular  basis.
