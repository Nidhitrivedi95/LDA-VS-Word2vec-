2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw I was feeling for some Indian food this afternoon and Avani never disappoints me! 

Although this place is a bit on the pricier side but I absolutely love this place, you pay for what you get! Their food is amazing, I especially love their curry and tandoori shrimp, yum! This is the best Indian food I've ever had. 

The decor of this place is pretty nice and the service was great! No complains! 

Will definitely be coming here more often!
