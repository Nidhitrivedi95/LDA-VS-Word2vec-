ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg FOOD:

PRO: Finally some spicy Indian food! Most of the Indian food here in Toronto, even if they tell you it's spicy, once you taste it, it is not really spicy. That's why I appreciated that they serve REAL spicy and tasty food here. They also have Kulfi here and it's also good. 

PRICE: 

PRO: Inexpensive, and you will get the value of your money coz the food tastes good.

AMBIANCE:

PRO: They sell Bollywood movies here. Very casual vibe, no need to worry about what you're wearing when you come in here. 
CON: Probably best to do bring and eat your food at home. This restaurant is more of a take-out food stop.
