We went for dinner last night and ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka wrap, seekh kabab wrap, lamb biryani and lamb spinach. The wraps are really good too. I preferred the seekh kabab wrap but the Mrs preferred the chicken wrap. The wraps are huge and very filling. 

The biryani was OK. The chef has his own style which differs from what I am used to. Lamb spinach was also OK. I think I was more concerned about getting back to finishing the butter chicken instead of trying to enjoy them. 

Restaurant itself is clean and cozy and staff is very friendly. The cook is very knowledgeable and very passionate about their food. Everything is cooked to order and based on your preference on spice. 

I will definitely be returning to try the meat vindaloo and butter chicken next time I have a craving for Indian food.
