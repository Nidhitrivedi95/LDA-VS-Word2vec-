OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Wow... there are over 200 reviews on Yelp on Darbar!

What can I add to it! First of all, one of the best Indian restaurant in Montreal. Today, we celebrated our friend's birthday and we wanted be authentic, so we took the sit on the floor. The mini tables were silver. The dishes were silvers, gold and copper. 

We had mango lassi, plain naan, Garlic naan (a recommendation by the manager... it was wow), madras lamb (spicy and delicious), chicken vindaloo (amazing), shrimp biryani (jumbo shrimps and very yummy), baighan bartha (smashed eggplants blended with great spices), ras malai (best milk desert) and masala chai. Everything was perfect! I ate so much, that I couldn't breathe anymore. My mouth wanted more but my belly had enough. 

The service was awesome! 

Highly recommended!!!
