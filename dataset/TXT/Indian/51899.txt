UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Lunch buffet was great. Not too pricey as well. Freshly prepared garlic naan was great too. Vegetarian options are little bit less but I guess how much one vegetarian can eat... 
It's okay. I Would give three and half stars to this place ( count my four stars as three and half really)
