rwuMWGqt7L5l5lDsOYv1dw I am eating my takeout right now, chicken tikka marsala and I forgot the name of the other. I've tried Bombay and I've tried one in Mountain View, California. I like Zyggyz so far. Since Zyggyz is much cheaper than Bombay, you can't really expect to have more substances in the meal. However the price is good and the takeout is so quick. They do open late, so it's a nice place for cheap and simple lunch or for your late night hunger. I wasn't expecting much quality from the food (considering price) but the taste still exceeded my expectation. Will try other dishs next time.
