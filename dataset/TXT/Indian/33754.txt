LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw 2nd visit, first time ate off the buffet and was decent. I was thinking if the food that's been sitting here all day is pretty good then I bet the items cooked to order must be great.. Sure enough was awesome. Tandoori chicken some of the best I've had! , chicken chili good, wing good. Asked i'll definitely be back for Tandori chicken and try some veggie dishes.. Place if for sure legit. Also prices are very reasonable. Def. Check it out.
