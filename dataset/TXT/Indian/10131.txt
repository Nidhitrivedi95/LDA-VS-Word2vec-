9K2FHkajUaTU4P2cfFJmGQ Honestly I would have given a 4 star because everything was good - food, service, ambience expect the billing.  So I walk to the billing counter to pay and show them the yelp check-in that gives 10% off on dining and this guy looks at my mobile screen like its the first time he is seeing Yelp and that I am trying to trick him into giving me a discount.  He asks to other guy - Yelp?  What Yelp?  Are we still on Yelp?  I was LOL and told them Yelp was the reason for my visit to their restaurant (I said this in the language the billing guy was talking to the other guy) and that's when I got his attention.
If Yelp was a person, it would have slapped the guy for asking who Yelp was.  ROFL.  So reality hits him and his face changes (since now he knows I can speak his language and understood what he was talking to the other guy in front of me).  He asks -  how was the food, give us a review please, that  its been a while since they checked their yelp page, etc., etc.,  I promised him I will write a review and here it is.  Makes up a nice story hmmm!!
Food - Was very good.  I found my favorite fritter here, its basically green chilli fritter, cut and stuffed with onions, cilantro and lemon juice.  Took me back to my country, specifically to that small shop in that street.
Vegetable biryani was very good too, great flavors and not too over powering masala. 
Worth the visit and yea may be I will go again.  Not sure! ;)
