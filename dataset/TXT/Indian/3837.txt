0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I'm a pretty big fan of Indian food and have tried a lot of the places in the area, but this one is hands down my favorite.  The buffet has a good amount of variety (it takes two trips just to try everything once!) and the food is high quality, but there are two things about this place that especially make it stand out to me: their huge samosas that are OUT OF THIS WORLD and my favorite thing on the buffet (make sure to try with the tamarind sauce on it!), and their dessert section includes some things you don't see other places.  My favorite thing there is the barfi, which again is almost impossible to find at other buffets.  The food may be a little spicy for some people - my mother can't handle it so when she wants Indian I reluctantly have to bring her somewhere else.  But if you're willing to drink a little extra water, or order one of their delicious mango lassis to manage the spiciness, then you have to try this place!
