DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I was overall happy with the food. We ordered the appetizer platter to try various things, and the only thing I didn't like was a hard round patty thing that was really dry. The variety of dips were great. I had the Malai Kofta (veggie & cheese balls deep fried, in a yummy yellow sauce), and it was awesome. Hubby had Palak Paneer (cheese & spinach sauce), and I found it bland but he said it was ok. Paratha stuffed with garlic was ok... the garlic was bitter. I've found garlic is bitter when it's gone too old so I assume that's what happened. 
Service was weird. Place was empty when we got there and the first person to the table laughed when i said we'd order the appetizers while we look at the menu, which is just odd. There were about 4 different people coming to the table so I don't know who our actual waiter was, but the only person that smiled and seemed friendly was the man who brought the food to the table. The rest were quiet and sort of like mannequins that moved. Nothing was BAD though, except for maybe the fly that kept landing on things.
When we left, one of the employees (who was missing teeth and looked like a meth head) was begging the host/manager person to stop payment on his paycheck because he didn't use the account anymore. He said he owed money in the account, so if the check deposited, the bank would take the money. I thought this in really bad taste... I really don't want to know.
