GC9Re0tKAnecMww3DB638g Sorry folks, I was not impressed. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to be.  

After having dinner at Flanny's we had an urge for something sweet to headed over to Jalsa. At the time we went the place was empty and the selection was very slim. I think it was a Sunday so that's understandable -- only a slight deduction for that. 

I inquired about the ice cream flavors and asked if they made some of the very exotic flavors that were there and she said no. Hmmm. That didn't resonate with me at all. If you're going to offer such different flavors, but you bought them from a vendor, how is that special?  It just seemed odd to me, especially if I'm paying THAT much for a scoop of ice cream. 

Second, my cupcake was not to die for. I don't remember the name and that's sad because again, a cupcake costing that much should be memorable. I think it was $3.00 or so. I could be that out of it and not realize that cupcakes are expensive. Regardless, they were too pricey for me, particularly in the calorie department.  

The space was nice and clean and the service so-so. I wish the woman working the counter showed more of her personality. Perhaps my experience would have been better. 

I love ice cream and my sweet treats, but I don't think I'm going back. I wish them all the best though. Small business owners have it so tough.
