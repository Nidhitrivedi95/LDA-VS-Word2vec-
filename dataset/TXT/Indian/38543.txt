OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Came in with a group of 4 and a groupon. There was some confusion at first if we could use it, but the nice lady up front welcomed us in. Our server Carlos was amazing, he recommended the dishes he liked and gave great customer service. Our food was delicious and the portions were very good. Our naan got a little too toasted/burnt which was a little sad as I always feel bad asking for things to be returned, but Carlos ended up brining us more out that was nice and soft. The place itself was very clean and the decor was really cute. Wish I lived in LV so I could visit more often.
