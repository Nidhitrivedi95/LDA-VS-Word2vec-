i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ Overall, it's a 3.5*.  Again, I've never had "terrible" dosa per se, so I'm not really sure what that entails - greasy, soggy, unflavourful?  Sometimes greasy, never soggy nor bland!

Atmosphere
Restaurant IS located inside a century home.  There are stories that it is haunted, but it's definitely a cursed spot because no business there, usually a restaurant, ever seems to last that long!  Entrance is around the back, near a small pho place, so park as close as possible to that area.  Be careful around the property because it seems as though some of the flagstone steps are crumbling.

As it's located inside a house, it is set-up more like an inn with different rooms, washrooms on the upper level, a reception desk that's separate from the dining rooms, etc.  A bit unusual.

Service
Warning:  They may *not* honour your Yelp check-in offer of a free coffee/dessert with a minimum of $25!  I showed it to the server and he said that that was for the previous location, he said he would ask his manager, and he said he would take it.  I was dining with a friend and he brought us 1 chai.

Due to the weird set-up, I kept on seeing the server's head pop into the dining room, quite often to see if we needed anything.  He did check-in a bit too often, but again, I think it's due to the dining room being cut-off from the reception area.

Server was very nice though.

Food
The idli/vadas were good and no complaints about the dosas.  My friend, who is Indian, said that she liked the sambar.  

I've been to Guru's and a coupla other places, so I think the food is on-par.  The chutneys that they offer here are a bit different.  They had a roasted peanut and a ginger chutney which I've never had in other dosa places.  So they were interesting.

Overall, no complaints, but the area/setting is a bit odd, but once you get over that, it's fine!
