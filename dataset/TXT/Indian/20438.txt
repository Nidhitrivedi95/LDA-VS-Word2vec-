FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ The groupon got us in the door, but the peanut sauce will have us coming back.  

While this is not my favorite Thai/Curry place, I do think they win out on a few choice menu items.  Faves being - Curry purses and the Satay.  I also love the use of sweet potato in the curries.  I was also able to ask for my dish to be a little more spicy, since 1 star was too tame on my first visit.

This is definitely a solid choice for eating and it is quite nice inside.  The food is great, but I found it a bit pricier than a curry competitor.  Maybe it's atmosphere that commands the higher ticket.  It's not outrageous, just a buck or two, here and there.

Solid choice for curry and the menu is dumbed down/Americanized for ease of use and ordering.  

I will be a fan of this place, consistent food, decent price and good variety!
