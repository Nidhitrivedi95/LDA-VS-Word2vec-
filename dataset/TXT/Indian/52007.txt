UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This establishment does not even deserve the one star I have to give them. 

The place was like a ghost town with only a few people eating there so there were lots of tables and booths to choose from. (this should have been our first warning) 

Hostess asked how many in party and would we prefer a table or booth, we said either is fine. 

Hostess then talked with Indian man behind counter for a bit and came back to inform us EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY RESERVED! 

No sympathy or cares whatsoever and was like communicating with a robot.

Browsing over all the other low yelp reviews I feel they honestly did us a BIG favor and there is no plans to ever recommend or return. 

***Mint Indian Bistro is also located in a very drug and violent crime filled neighborhood one can easily research online.
