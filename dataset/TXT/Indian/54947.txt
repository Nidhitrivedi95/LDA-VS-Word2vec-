wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw Food is extremely average and reasonable. The problem with this place is it's extremely disorganized. We had to wait 20 minutes to place our order in off-peak hours. To be clear there were only two customers in their restaurant. 
Next time, I will probably place an order to go. Their customer service is a huge disappointment.
