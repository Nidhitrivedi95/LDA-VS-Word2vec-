EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg The food is great and it's halal! I only eat halal food so I was very excited to find Kabob N More. We have been eating here every single day since we got to Vegas!

The service is not that bad depending on who is working. But over I all I recommend this place and love going here. Pricing is reasonable as well!
