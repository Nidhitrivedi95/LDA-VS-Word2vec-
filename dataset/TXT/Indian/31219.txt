kPjXA9lm7nQrn6UuPb5L-Q Came here for dinner with the family on a Wednesday night. It was fairly busy despite the fact that it was a weekday! This place is definitely a family favorite of ours due to its laid back and casual atmosphere. It has a decent amount of seating and you usually don't have to wait too long for a place to sit.

We ordered 3 thalis - 3 curries, 1 raita, rice, and a dessert item. The thali comes with 1 Naan or 2 rotis. I personally enjoy the Naan better. The food was delicious and the Naan was decent enough. My thali included Shahi Paneer, khadhi Paneer, saag, and gulab jamun. I liked how the food was full of flavor but not excessively oily.

One area of improvement that I can suggest is that the wait staff make less mistakes with the order. We had to wait close to 20 minutes because they didn't get our order for the roti correctly and we had to wait for a long time. Additionally, they consistently forgot a thing or two from our order and had to go back to get it. They were very nice but not very good unfortunately.

Additionally, the restrooms need to be cleaned better - they don't smell too great.

Overall - would return because the food is just that good.
