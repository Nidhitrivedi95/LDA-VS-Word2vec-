The decor is very sparse, but the food is amazing, and the portions are very generous. I had the chicken biryani, the chicken curry, Chana masala, beef kabobs, naan and samosas. Everything was delicious and well spiced, and the owner was very friendly and helpful when I wasn't sure what I should get. The 2+ person combos offer a great variety for a great price, when most Indian places force you to get a single dish at dinner prices. Will definitely return :)
