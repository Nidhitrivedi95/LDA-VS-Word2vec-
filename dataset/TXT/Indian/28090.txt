iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw I was at the SEMA show and they didn't really have anything vegetarian friendly aside from pizza and may be some snacks.  Looked up this place and glad we stopped by!  The food was delicious... got the masala potato burrito, two Samosas, fries, and a desi  bowl for only 20 bucks. On top of that dharmesh (the owner) and his wife were super friendly. Thank you for the satisfying, vegetarian  meal!
