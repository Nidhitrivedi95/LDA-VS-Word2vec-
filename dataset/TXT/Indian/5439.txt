2ZmZbmsTRHogSZR-nJY_Fw My daughter and I went and tried this today after being told it was a new restaurant. The last time we were in here we had the pleasure of watching the owner scream at a customer and follow him to his car yelling. We never went back. 
We were happy to hear that it was new owners, new name but still Indian food.  We were really happy with the food and the service and the best part was the chicken tikka was made with white meat.  The naan was not the best I've had but it was good enough and the only disappointment was there was no rice pudding on the buffet. Loved the masala tea! :-))
