OScYt1v7Z31I5uzISnistA $5.99 lunch special for a chicken/duck/goat/etc roti + a free double? To be honest, I'm not entirely sure what I'm eating but this place was extremely good for a value and very filling and tasty (but definitely not healthy) lunch. Everything was hot and made fresh to order. Watch out for spicy, it's really spicy!

My only qualm is that the roti with duck came with a lot of bones. I'm aware that ducks have bones, but it's hard to eat with the bones inside the roti.

Lots of seating room available and usually ample parking space in the plaza. Order, grab a seat and show your number when they come to your table.
