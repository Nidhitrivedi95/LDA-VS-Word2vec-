uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw This here is restaurant which uses a legendary name. This is kind of franchise now, which reminds my dad and father-in-law about their Student days. This name is famous as the first owner started this business selling Biryani on a roadside in a Pakistani city to students and then it grew from there.  

I came here with the family so we ordered a bunch of stuff to try. Although they have quiet a bit of seating the design frame of the restaurant is more of a take out location. The food is packed as a take out order but they do give you disposable plates and cutlery if you want to dine in. The restaurant was clean and their was plenty of parking. 

After looking into the menu, we decide to order Chicken Biryani (offcourse), Chicken Karahi, two types of kabab and some naans. The food was very fresh and hot but the service was extremely slow in bring the food out.  The chicken biryani was very good but even the mild was very spicy and could cause a heartburn. The other stuff were average but hot and freshly cooked!

For my Muslim brother and sisters - they are halal meat!
