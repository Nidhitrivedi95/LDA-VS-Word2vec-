wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw This place is amazing!!!!   I don't think there is a better Indian restaurant than Taj Mahal. Excellent atmosphere, food is out of sight. Full bar, wine selection is good and for the quality this place is cheap. There were four picky women at the table and none of us could say one bad thing except we were too full!!  Don't even read a review if it's not a "5" those people have no clue. 
Frequent there often, we can't afford to loose a good restaurant like this.
