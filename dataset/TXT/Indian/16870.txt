DN_cXMaeAUFFLm6eUOsNWQ More people  less space ,feels cramped in there .   The. waitresses dont have any knowledge of waitering , they are haphazard , and non polite bunch. The manager seem to be either not aware or just turns a blind eye on it or may be his hands are tied. They should be hiring proffesional waitering staff .
The food is good .prices are cheap, I think that is the only reason they STILL getting indian customers   (majority of people living in the area are indians)  who will compromise  to bad service for good deal .
