RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg One of my favorite Indian food restaurants in town.  Originally I went for their buffet.  Overall their use of various spices and having dishes on the buffet that are a little different made it a hit for me.  The buffet was a little to spicy for my taste, my mouth was burning, but others said it was right at the borderline, spicy but not too hot.  I went back and ordered a few dishes with a "very mild" spice level and found I really liked it.  I love Swad, but I think I think I like OM even better.
