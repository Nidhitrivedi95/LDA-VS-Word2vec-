-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw I go to this place regularly because i love biriyani.I never tried any other food except biriyani from here and i must say that the quality of biriyani is getting worse day by day.the rice they serves always half cooked .This weekend i had chicken special biriyani where the meats of that was not properly cooked too.and also it is good if you take out your food because the place is totally poor maintained.
