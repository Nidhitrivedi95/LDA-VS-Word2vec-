A number of friends (including fellow Yelpers) have raved about this place in Parkdale and suggested that I try it since I live in the neighbourhood. I have to say, I wasn't that impressed. 

While the prices are very affordable and the portions are large enough to either share or save for next day's lunch, the service and taste were just 'OK.'

I ordered the saag paneer roti (medium spice) and my dinner companion ordered the curried lamb and rice. Not knowing all the ingredients that go into saag paneer, I thought the little tasteless squares in it were tofu when they were actually small pieces of cheese! 

Our server was attentive but had just about as much personality as a doorstop. 

Are there any honourable mentions?
- You could probably feed a small family of 4 here for $10
