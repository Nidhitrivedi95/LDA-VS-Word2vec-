0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Just ordered to try a new Hakka place in Mississauga, Ming and eddies were my frequent stops. I read the other reviews on yelp and online. We ordered chilli chicken, crispy beef, manchurian noodles and a couple spring rolls. I had to call them when I got home...why u ask? To tell them the food was awesome!! Great portions and fresh ingredients! My new Hakka spot for sure!! The staff was really nice when ordering too.
