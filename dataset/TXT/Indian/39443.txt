OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I have been going for more than a decade.   I'd have to say that the quality has suffered in recent years.   It's hit or miss... not as consistent as before - especially w/the chilli chicken.  

That said, House Shrimp, House Beans & Hakka Chow Mein remain one of my favourite dishes anywhere.

Chilli Chicken on rice for $8 beats Mcdonalds etc. any day for a quick lunch/takeout.
