FOOD - While the food was good and not too spicy with over 2 dozen choices on the buffet, they had less than average service, they did not ask once if everything was okay, did give us water in a carafe.  We were the only customers in the place for most of our visit.   When we asked for our bill, they pointed towards the cash register.  The décor may be nice, but the rest of the visit did not live up to what could have been the start of a long customer/restaurant relationship. 
SERVICE - Did not honor coupon (Groupon), we complied with all the fine print - I looked before we left and there was no sign indicating that coupons could not be used for buffet.  Tried to use it for lunch buffet at the Charlotte NC location on a Sunday.  Restaurant did not honor coupon, said it could not be used for buffet.  I even asked them to show me where the coupon said so - they could not find any limitations listed.  Not honoring a coupon that clearly did not exclude the buffet left such a bad taste that I don't want to go back.  If they don't want coupons for the buffet, then the coupon fine print should say so - changing the rules is just plain dishonest.
