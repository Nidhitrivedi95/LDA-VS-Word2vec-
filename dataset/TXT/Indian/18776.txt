emNQ1jxMev2NzIcP2wdfgg I RECOMMEND:  the beef samosas at Simba Grill- they are the kind I've grown up around, distinct in their own way. Very meaty and hearty.

There also lots of other treats and meals available. The website is great.

Someone mentioned Simba's is overpriced and I agree.

Another yelper commented that these are not traditionally African but rather Indian dishes. Couldn't be more wrong. Nyama choma, Ugali and some of the other dishes are only typical of East African cuisine. Tanzanian food is heavily influenced by Indian flavours/dishes because of the long standing presence of Indian Tanzanians so it's ignorant to not see the beauty in this gastronomical blend. 

So if you're new to this- Don't knock the labels, just open up and try it out. 
If you're not- It's not quite a taste of home but it's cheaper than a flight out, right? 

EXTRA TIP: One thing is for sure, this place is shabby so order take out. The space is off-putting. I'd give it a 4 star otherwise.
