RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA I love Taste of India. Maybe I am biased because it is in walking distance from my apartment. In my mind, the food holds up with some of the better Indian restaurants in DC. I mostly get paneer or chickpea dishes and they've all been solid. Good atmosphere, service, etc. If you just want solid Indian go here. Simply put.
