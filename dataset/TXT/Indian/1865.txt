-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw Checked this place out again for a second time.

The first time? Food was crap, place was unhygenic and service was just really unfriendly.

Second recent visit? Oh boy how do I start? 

The service is still self serve. Although it really wouldnt hurt having a cheery person behind the counter. It will still give the place a nice restaurant vibe instead of the "whats your order/the total/your order will be at the end of line" Hmm..

The place however was a bit nicely kept this time, and more cleaner. I happened to visit them in the hottest of montreal summer heat days and them not having an AC or big windows just really didnt make me want to stay longer.

The food itself was a biiig negative to me. And honestly its not even that cheap. I found the prices standard in general. There are various "cheap" desi restos around  the desi bazaar location. So by saying that you are getting what you pay for is a lie. My mango lassi didnt even cut the mark of being a proper lassi (extremely sweet and watery).. and I only had ordered chana samosa. I dont know what they were playing here because my chana samosa was not even chaan samosa, they just put the daal with half raw samosas, a little yogurt with just a load of mint chutney. Mint chutneyy???  I couldnt even go half past the dish. On being a desi person and having eaten Various versions of chana samosa, I have never even seen a fusion style have mint chutney in it. I tried my husbands thali a little bit, and even that didnt taste anything special. I understand its hard to put a little bit changes in a dish especially when youre dealing with Indian food but they can at least try a bit more variations in their dishes :) On a positive note I think the place has potential if they improve the food quality for the same price.

Verdict: If I want to have home cooked indian food, I can just stick to my own kitchen.
