QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg My brother told me about this new Indian restaurant that just opened it's doors on Banksville road - home to a slew of other Indian shops.  I was eager to try it out, as rumor is the restaurant is owned by the former head chef at Tamarind.  I have always loved the food at Tamarind, so I thought i would give this place a try.

Food: Delicious, and fairly priced.  They have a very good range of food (North Indian, South Indian, and Indo-Chinese).  Their Indo-Chinese is to die for.  I ordered their Veg Hakka noodles, it's was very spicy and flavorful.  We also tried the Veg Manchurian, a different take on the typical Gobi Manchurian.  It's quite soft in the center, but a welcome change.  I've been there twice, and both times as I was happily satisfied each time.  They also have different types of Indo-Chinese dishes, and North Indian dishes that I haven't seen elsewhere. 

Give this new Indian restaurant a try - you won't be sorry!
