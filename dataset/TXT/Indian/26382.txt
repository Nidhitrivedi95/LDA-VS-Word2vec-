ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I moved away from Charlotte two years ago and I really liked the city, but Copper is the single thing I miss most about Charlotte. The food is amazing and the service is excellent. It is legitimately my favorite restaurant anywhere. Get the Chicken Tikka Masala made spicy with garlic naan, you will not regret it.
