PQTtKaBK_WdvLm-zp4fQ1g It had a super buffet for a Saturday!  I loved every morsel of it.
Keep in mind it's south Indian so it'll be on the spicy side,  But everything has amazingly bold flavors. The staff were so nice, they helped my grown daughter choose her food since she is new to Indian food and doesn't like spicy.
 I'll definitely be back.
Go try it!
