lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw We got the dahi puri and the fish for lunch today. it was pretty empty around noon on Monday but by the time we finished eating, the place had started to fill up quite a bit.

The dahi puri was perfectly refreshing for a hot summer day, with its cold yogurt filling. I loved the mix of the crunchy shell with the creamy yogurt, but after twenty minutes the bottom of the shell started to get soggy and leak--so eat quickly.

The fries were very crispy and there was just the right amount of spice in the seasoning. Though the fish was fairly tender, I thought the sauce was a little bland and needed a stronger sauce. Overall, good food for a decent price.
