IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA In an attempt to give this place a fair shake I sat back and thought, what I can do to highlight the positives about this experience? The food  is not overly flavorful and not terribly bland, yet lacks the expected spice entourage associated with Indian Cuisine. The Lassi be it salt or Mango is sour. I personally did not mind it much though it was unexpected. My guests were not so impressed. 
The Garlic Naan was very mild and our Mali Kofta was neutral on the flavor scale. The Paneer Tikka fell in the same neutral category though the cheese was very plump and firm. 

No dessert on this visit.

If you enjoy neutral flavors and do not deal with spice well this may be a good place to go. With such a diverse selection of Indian Cuisine in Las Vegas it fell in the lower spectrum in comparison though I would consider bringing a hesitant friend with a soft palate here.
