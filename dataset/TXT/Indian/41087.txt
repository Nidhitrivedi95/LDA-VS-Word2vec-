PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q I guess I'm in the minority, but I was never all that impressed with this place.  The best Indian food in Pittsburgh?  Hardly.  I found it pretty low quality, not very fresh, kind of greasy.  The staff was pretty unfriendly, I didn't feel welcome there.  The one redeeming quality is that it's half price after 10pm, but it's often packed, dark and loud by that time.  It's a decent place if you're having a night out in Oakland and want some cheap drunk food after hitting the bars, but other than that I'd avoid it.
