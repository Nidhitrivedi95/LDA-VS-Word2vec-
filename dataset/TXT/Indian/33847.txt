LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng Walked in last night to dine and the host stared blankly at me for 30 seconds before he asked me if I had a take out.  Was seated and he was quick on filling my glass of water and handing me the menu.  That's when it all started to go wrong.  Asked what beers they had; liquor license pending.  A sign on the door would have helped.  Browsed the menu and set it aside; usually a clear indication I'm ready to order.  Nothing happened for over 5 minutes in spite of my waving to attract someone's attention.  Some of the waitstaff were standing around doing nothing. Eventually I ordered a Avocado 'Jhaal' Muri for an appetizer and a Mysore Masala Dosa for mains.  The dosa appeared 2 minutes later with no sign of the appetizer.  I sent the dosa back and waited another 5 minutes for the appetizer.  'Jhaal' in Bengali means hot (chilli hot).  This appetizer was neither hot nor very flavorful.  Ate half of it (I was starving) and set the plate aside, suggesting I was done with it  Another 10 minutes passed till I grabbed a guy clearing an adjacent table and told him to cancel my dosa order and grab the check.  Not once had a member of the waitstaff stopped by to check on my table, after the appetizer was served.  A couple of minutes later the owner / manager showed up with the dosa and 5 other folks in tow.  I explained my displeasure at the poor and what clearly appeared to be racially biased service.  There was no shortage of waitstaff and the attention paid to non-Indians was staggering.  To their credit, the apologies were fast and furious and they did offer to comp the appetizer, which I politely declined.  They have promised changes and only time will tell.  I will visit again as they are the only joint in town serving dosas and hopefully they will have their act together.  It will certainly help if the waitstaff brushes up on their English skills too
