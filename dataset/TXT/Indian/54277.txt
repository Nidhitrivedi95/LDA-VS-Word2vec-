vX8L0KhrqjqpU6o1tBhAwg If I could give an -10 I would horrible service, we couldn't get a table for 10 and the place was empty, they put as in a corner then we asked again getting annoyed and they moved us.  We asked for water and they said why didn't you bring it from the other table.  The employees weren't happy taking our order.  Who was ever in the back sounded like a party in the kitchen.  -10
