wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Best Tiki Masala ever, hands-down!  Decor is nice and modern and the waitstaff were friendly and efficient. 
We dined on a Thursday night and it wasn't too busy at all.
One of us had the fish curry and one had the tiki masala (medium spicy) and while both dishes were delicious, the tiki blew our minds.
We will be back!
