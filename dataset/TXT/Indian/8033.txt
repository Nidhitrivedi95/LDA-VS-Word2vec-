7BIbvCkI7AXQMVC1-DHpCA I'll try to make this succinct. 

Decor - F
Service - B+
Food - A

I went there on a Friday Evening...I was 1 of 4 people in the entire restaurant. Their location makes them difficult to locate, which is too bad because the food is really good, and the servers were attentive.

Onto the meat of the review:

I ordered the Vegetable Samosas, and my dining partner had the Meat Samosas. I also indulged in an Indian Beer (when in Rome, right?). I should have refrained from an appetizer because WOW were they big! 

Still though, this afforded me leftovers which I am just finishing up 3 days later. Anyway - The food really is good. The portions are large, and the variety is wonderful. The servers were also very nice. They're helpful and willing to answer any questions you have about unfamiliar foods.

Downside - Oh boy the decor. I am into hole in the wall places as much as anybody --- but the track fluorescent lighting was headache inducing (literally, as well as figuratively) and the fake dusty flowers on each table don't really motivate one to put food in their mouths.

Now, I know what the owners might be thinking "Our food is good, so who cares?" But ...Consumers do. We're spoiled by modern, effortless, clean looking decor - So spruce it up a bit folks, and your food will make more of an impact, and more importantly - You'll get repeat business.

I will probably get take out from them in the future...but sitting there was rough.
