It was fairly empty when I went there and it took the waiter forever to come get my order. I had plenty of time to look at the menu and ordered my food and drink at the same time.

The food came out fairly quickly. I got the Chana Marsala. It was well made, pretty spicy and interestingly had veggies in it. A nice touch. The naan was overdone. It was fairly crispy and had obviously spent too much time in the oven.

The service was horrible. Didnt see my waiter after he delivered my food. Had to hunt down a different server for a refill on my Pepsi and I had to find somebody else to bring my check and take my money.

I would probably go back again, in hopes that I get better service. However the food is highly recommended.
