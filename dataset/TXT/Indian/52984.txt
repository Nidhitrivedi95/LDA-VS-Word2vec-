v4ZVAIDgE9ZXhMcpx8tctw Hmm I came there on Easter Monday on 3 pm ish and the place was dead with us being the only customers. My waitress was actually really polite and I had my first proper "bengali" service. Overall Kudos for a great service experience as compared to other desi restos. They have a full bar as well. 

The food was the best part in this restaurant. Apparently the chef there was Indian. In any case I was absolutely amazed. I had ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, with Lamb Korma and Begun Bhaji (Eggplant curry?) and each of the dishes were better then the other. I was impressed especially more with the Lamb Korma as it really was one of the best I ever had. The meat even though wasnt really tender but the gravy was done superb. Portion sizes were moderate, and I agree with other reviews as well that they really are overpriced.

They also give free delivery.

Last tidbit on the atmosphere....this is where I think the place has a lot of room for improvement. First major drawback is that the place is in the basement, therefore making the environment extremely humid. I am very sensitive to these environments, so coughing and having a blocked nose along the way certainly was not helpful. There was not really a good ventilation system from what I could see and on top of that heating the place was not at all a good idea. The place itself is not really that big, and I found it to be a bit cluttered and overcrowded. Either way I was happy with a good friendly service, and food especially considering the place was dead.
