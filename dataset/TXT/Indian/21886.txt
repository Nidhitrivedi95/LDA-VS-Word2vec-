gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Stopped by here with other yelpers after CMYE at Vanguard. It's tiny, tiny place, and I'm actually surprised we FIT in there, but I'm glad we did. The gyros looked really good, but I'm the sort who ends up with more gyro meat and sauce on my shirt than in my mouth. ;P 
Ended up trying the chicken kabob.. boki? I think. It came with pita bread, rice, and a small salad, for under 10 bucks. Everything was delicious, the flavorful rice, the chicken, the pita bread, everything. Will definitely be coming back.
