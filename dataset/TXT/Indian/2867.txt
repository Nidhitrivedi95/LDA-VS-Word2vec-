0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw I highly recommend coming here ONLY during the lunch buffet. It is a pretty good value and always delicious. Fresh naan is served upon arrival and the buffet always offers some type of chicken curry or masala and tandoori chicken,palak paneer, veggie curries, salad, sometimes goat curry and a few other options. It also has Chai, but it isn't good. I don't recommend coming for dinner. The menu is a la carte and a bit pricey for what you get. The portion sizes are very small and you don't get any rice or naan. We ordered a goat curry dish and chicken curry dish and there was only about 5-6 pieces of meat in the dish servings. They ran about $13-15 too! We expected a lot more for that price. I think rice and/or naan should come standard with dishes here (especially in that price range). The service is always spectacular and super friendly.
