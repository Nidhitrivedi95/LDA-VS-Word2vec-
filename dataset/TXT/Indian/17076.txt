DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew This was our second visit and again....excellent experience.  Super service, quality of food and reasonable prices! Place is excellent from inside.... clean and very welcoming.  Friendly staff and kids friendly.  Music was just perfect, not too loud.  We were greated and seated right away.  Offered menu and took order within 10 minutes of seating - despite having busy Saturday night with an ahour from closing.  Food came in next 20 minutes and it was just delicious...fresh, perfectly spiced and made.  Nothing was over nor under cooked.  We were only 3 but after us party of 7 came and they were greated and served in same manner.  It was just pleasent experience both times.  Thus, I highly recommend this place.... 

Cheers!
