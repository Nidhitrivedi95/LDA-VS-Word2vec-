t4Keeuv3zkLShSgYSRYmdw I am such a large fan for Caribbean food!!! I drool for it anytime I see it! Due to my wife's distinct infatuation in not trying new things, I rarely get to indulge! 

However, being that I have been traveling to Toronto in the past few months for work and having to stay over! I have found this place around the corner from my hotel thanks to a friend! 

Today I had the chicken Roti! Mmmmmmmmmmm! Nice, subtle flavors with a large Caribbean kick! When I saw the menu.... It was so difficult! Hope they save a seat for me when I come to town! Cause this is the place for me!

The ladies that are running this place are such nice people! 

SO RECOMMEND! GO AND GET SOME!!!!!!
