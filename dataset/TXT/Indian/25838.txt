hzumXofKoqICLsHETI1LAA Called to check what items they had on their Sunday buffet as we had a large group with many vegetarians. The person that answered the phone (I know exactly who he is but am not putting his name in my comment to avoid getting him in trouble) responded rudely saying that I would have to personally go and check the menu items at the restaurant and that he was not going to give it on the phone. The only advice I have for this person is "chill out dude". There are many other nice restaurants in the area and I am taking my business elsewhere because of your poor attitude. I know you don't really care if the restaurant looses my business as you are an employee at this restaurant.
