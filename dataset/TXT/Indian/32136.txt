LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Been here a few times for dinner and take-out. Food is always excellent. My favs, Chicken Makhni, Chicken Korma, Aloo Mutter. The samosas are really good but only if eaten with the chutney and raita, otherwise it's pretty dry. My 4 stars is based on the food.

The restaurant space/decor is pretty sad. Not sure what the space used to be but there are ugly track lights on the ceiling - almost like stage lights. Walls are dark. But whatever, right? As long as the food is great. However, I did go in for the lunch buffet once, and the buffet is set up next to the bathrooms. Is it a problem? Well if you're a mental germaphobe like me, then YES it's a problem. I get that space is limited but a little remodel would really increase the dining experience.
