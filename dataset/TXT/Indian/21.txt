-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g We are so lucky to have this fabulous restaurant in our neighborhood! Delicious tikka masala, paneer saag, naan and don't forget the beer. To go orders are ready in a flash and have saved me from cooking on multiple occasions. The owners and staff are incredibly courteous and the serving sizes are very generous, if you haven't been here it's a must try!
