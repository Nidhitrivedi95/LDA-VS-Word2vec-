-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw OMG. This place is fantastic. Hubby and I shared the curry fries and not kidding best fries ever. Home made, hand cut, crispy and flavorful . Get the sauce on the side and just dip so they don't get mushy. He had the burger and I had the Rasta wings. Both were phenomenonal. We are going back tonight to try the more exotic menu items. Love the locals/divey bar vibe. Everyone was super friendly. Oh and free shuffleboard!
