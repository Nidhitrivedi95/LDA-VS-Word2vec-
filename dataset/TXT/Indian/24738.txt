h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Prince of India has a solid, though not expansive, buffet. Last dinner buffet I had there included very good chicken tikka masala, saag, tandoori chicken, excellent chili chicken, turnip masala, vegetable korma, and channa masala, plus a small salad and dessert bar. Rice also, of course. You also get unlimited self serve soft drinks included in the price.
At lunch, there is naan on the buffet, but at dinner you get fresh naan of your choice, which is a delicious upgrade. 
The buffet food is always good, but could be a bit more aggressively spiced. I understand why buffets are never spiced "hot," but some dishes here could just use more flavor. 
I have had a la carte several times, and it's excellent. However, as with other Indian restaurants, the portions are really small for the price, so I tend to stick to the buffet. 
UPMC and student discounts, too.
