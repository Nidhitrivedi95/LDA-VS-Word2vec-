We were able to find one of the last tables here, many other places were full. The restaurant itself is romantic and has a very nice decor as well very good service. This is a nice date night place.

The food was just okay, they kinda have a fusion thing going on. Like here is your Italian grandma and your girlfriend/boyfriend whatever in the kitchen next to them making two different things that may not flow with the meal. They bring it out, clash of dishes! Then before you know it everyone isn't talking and it's awkward......Yeah sometimes it works, here it didn't.
