sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ alright.. 

I went to this spot today for lunch and got a Chickpea/potato Roti with mild-med spice.. its amazing. and I'm pregnant so I mean it.

the only thing is a fresh one came out to $10 ish but its listed for like $8 .. taxes? anyways its still good though and very filling so I guess its worth the price. I've had only a quarter of it and I'm good, likely be snacking on this all day.

Make sure you check the 1 day old roti's in the counter where you order, they'd come out to $8 probably with tax. that's my next go-to.

Def coming back here. Baby and I approve.
