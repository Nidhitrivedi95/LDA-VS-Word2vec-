gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A If u don't recognize me I probably haven't been here before #justsaying. 

Waited 2 b seated ... A bit.

Waited @table & got up to find out #lunch only #buffet. Cool. If you want something ask...they probably wont ask you...

After that...

Best #naan ever but no option for garlic? (Unless you ask)

Water unless you ask for something else.

Food.... GOOD!  Plentiful.  I'm getting used to a little spice, but it didn't overwhelm my tastebuds!

Rice pudding a little thin & underdone but still...cream & sugar...c'mon.

I think this restaurant could #moveonup.

##bollywoodmovies on TV on wall with sound!  Not too loud.  That would be a fun #theme night!  #dinner & #amovie!

Solid adventure.  Great value!
