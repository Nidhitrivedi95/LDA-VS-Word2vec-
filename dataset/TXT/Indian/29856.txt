jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Very disappointing. One of the worst meals I've ever had and I'm usually pretty forgiving. My friend and I came expecting to have Indian food. Apparently they only serve that on weekends (???) so we had questionable Mediterranean food instead. My veggie panini was almost inedible. The chicken and hummus my friend had were just ok. Service was pretty bad too. I understand they just opened and figuring things out and I could see they mean well but still... I was embarrassed that I took my friend here. This place has potential but they need to train the staff and have a complete/revamped menu.
