KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Great variety to chose from and they are very flexible in terms of being able to pick up to 3 meats when ordering. Service was quick, maybe because it was not busy when i was there. Store is relatively clean but the furniture is a bit old. Food was decent but very oily. They are open quite late for those who have late night cravings for curry. I would give it a 3 star but give one more star because of the variety you get to pick from.
