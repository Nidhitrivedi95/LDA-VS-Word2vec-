epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg Best Roti in the city. Great, filling vegetarian dishes at affordable prices. 

We litterally stopped people walking down Dupont and asked where their awesome smelling take out was from. It was here. 

My choice won this time: Malai Kofta Roti. Top notch. Wife's choice was also great, just not quite as great: Daal Pakora Roti. 

We got take out this time but will be back to enjoy a meal with the Kingfisher beer (also spotted they have Cheetah). 

Thoroughly recommend this place.
