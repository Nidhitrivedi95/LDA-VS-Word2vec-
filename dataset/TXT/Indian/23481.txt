gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A With so many high reviews, I had to come and try for myself. Took my Fiancé here a few weeks ago. We were not disappointed. The food here is awesome. 

This place is located off the strip. Next to a Spanish grocery store. 

The inside was not appealing at all. Very tiny. Small little tables in the center with booths wrapping the walls. Very very casual dining. 

Service was pretty good. Food came out fast. Very attentive. 

As for the food - We ordered pretty much everything they had to offer:

Chicken Masala - Not the best in town, but good

Chicken Tikka - Very good

Lamb Josh Rogan - Very good

Garlic Naan - Fire

Biryani Chicken Rice - So good

We ordered a few other curries, I forgot the names. All of them were really good! 

Overall - Great flavors. Huge portions!
