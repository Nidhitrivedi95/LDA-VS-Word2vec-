hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw This was a very enjoyable dining experience. Like others have pointed out, this restaurant serves incredible Indian cuisine. Being somewhat of a connoisseur of ethnic cuisines, I was pleasantly surprised by how close to the "authentic" Indian cuisine this place was--almost like you were in India itself!!! Many vegetarian options which were flavorful and yummy! Chicken Masala was out of this world as well. Naan was fresh and full of flavor as well. The owner was nice enough to point out that they don't use any unnatural oils and saturated fats in their cooking--indeed their food tasted healthier than most Indian places without the aftertaste of "not-so-fresh" ingredients and oils. Decor was very nice and elegant. I was very impressed considering the shopping center location. Service was average, nothing too incredible here, but the people were friendly. PRICES!!! are incredible. We ate two lunch specials with quite a few inclusive dishes and paid under $20!!!! I was very happy with my bill and tipped accordingly. They offer A+ lunch specials and dinner prices are also very competitive. I am pleasantly surprised that this restaurant already has so many great reviews as the couple of times I've been here, our party was the only one at the restaurant. Let's keep Mantra Masala in business, as it is the best Indian restaurant in Vegas!
