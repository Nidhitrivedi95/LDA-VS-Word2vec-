yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg I went for the lunch buffet, just to explore a new place and what an experience!! Appetizers like samosa and Bhaje were suberb. Main course consisting of Paneer, Veg curry, Dal Maharani and Saag. All them were good expect for Saag which laked seasoning. Last but not the least, dessert section was amazing, especially Ras Malai. 

All in all very good restaurant with nice food, ambiance, price and service. I looking forward to visit again soooon.
