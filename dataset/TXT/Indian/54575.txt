WCW9a5AfUlyx98Ul-hRMHg I live and work in the neighbourhood, and I'm so glad to have found a local spot that is affordable, fast, pleasant and delicious.  the vegetarian thali that I had today was delicious.  paneer texture so nice, and everything tasted so good.  I feel comfortable in this small, friendly place.
