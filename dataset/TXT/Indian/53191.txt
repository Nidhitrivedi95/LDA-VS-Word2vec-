VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Have been coming here for years (initially when they were on 5th Ave. and then their Hayden location). The food here is always delicious and top notch.  Their lunch platters are moderately priced. And, free delicious hot Indian tea! If you are craving Indian food, eat here and you won't be disappointed!
