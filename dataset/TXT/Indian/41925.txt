qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA I wanted to try this place out because my friend said it was cheap and pitchers were a good price. So I went to check it out for first time with my husband. I ordered a half pint of sapporo and pint of sangria. The waiter with glasses was nice but the female waitress came over our table and without a word took our menus away very fast and she even cut her eye at me! I have never felt so insulted at a restaurant before it was like she didn't care if we were there at all because by the looks of it it was a full house and they get a lot of young students on a tight budget. She was unfriendly, I dont expect overly friendliness but the eye cutting was not cool. 
I had sapporo  at another place that day so when I tasted the sapporo it was watered down. I didnt know that its even possible or legal. I know the taste of sapporo, but this tasted funny, bland and watered down. Sangria was not sangria, its a fruit punch full of orange juice and sprite.  I think sangria should be mostly wine and fruits, top it off with some sprite but this sangria tasted like fruit punch juice, not much wine.

It was busy and only two servers for such a Huge place...they were very unstaffed. Waiter was literally running from one end to another. If you're that busy you can afford more than 2 staffs on a busy night so paying customers and tipping customers can have the service they deserve.

to be honest I really liked the brie and avocado sandwich it was good and tasty. When it comes to food im very easy so it was decent for me. 

Overall brie sandwich was good, sapporo pint watered down and not good. I wouldnt recommend this place, I can get legit beers on tap for a lot cheaper at other places.  Im not going to throw my money away because the price on menu is low, when in fact im not getting what im paying for, and quality is low; water down beer is watered down and is illegal.
