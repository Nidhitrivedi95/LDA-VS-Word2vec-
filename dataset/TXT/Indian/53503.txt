VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg This is one of the nicer indian restaurants on the east side of Cleveland, where there is not a huge population of Indians and Pakistanis. 

Ambiance is well kept and maintained. It is welcoming and if you are lucky there is live music. Most of the vegetarian items on the menu are reasonably priced and taste good. I did not find anything extraordinary but nothing was yuk either. 

I will be going here regularly due to proximity to where I live and reasonably priced good food.
