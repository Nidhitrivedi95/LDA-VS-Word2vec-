GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Curry Corner is always good, and really cheap for what you get. The tikka masala fries are unique and fun, and everything we've had has been really tasty. The platters have enough food to take some home, and you get to sample multiple dishes.

Just FYI, though, you might want to bring your own water if you're ordering anything that is at all spicy, because the servers seem pretty busy and don't do refills or any other kind of interaction, besides taking your order (it will probably take them 10-15 minutes to get to you for that). We've had multiple experiences where our water glasses have been empty for the whole meal, even after we've asked for refills. Also, don't expect anyone to come check on you - if you need something, ask multiple people!

In short, great food for good prices, with poor service. In our book, it still gets four stars because of the value, but barely.
