RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Lahore TIkka House has an identity crisis, by Toronto standards. Is it a take out place with a large seating area, or a terrible sit-down restaurant? The result is confounded expectations and unnecessary disappointment. The tables are set upon arrival, and there are plenty of staff who take drink orders and bring food to your table. So why not decide to be a restaurant and have waiters and bus boys instead of an army of the latter?

Despite the identity crisis, if the food had been good, it would have made up for the ambiance. It was not. Oily only begins to describe every dish I tried: the vegetarian "sizzler" platter, dal, palak chicken, lamb kabob, and biriyani. The lamb kabob even had the distinction of being both dry and oily.

Overall, a number of problems added up to an unpleasant experience: tiny styrofoam cups of water, some dishes arriving on smoking, stinking platters, uniformity of flavours, slippery floors, all plastic cutlery, tables, and chairs.

I've been to a lot of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi restaurants in Toronto and the GTA, but I'm not as familiar with the offerings in the east end. Maybe this is one of the best choices in the East, but for the city overall, avoid this one like the plague.
