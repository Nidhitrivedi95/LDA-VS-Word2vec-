jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Really amazing staff, very sweet, friendly, and helpful. They unlike some places in town did not mind us walking in at 2:40pm 20mins before their buffet was closing to eat. Some places in town will straight out tell you that they don't let you sit after a certain time. 

Delicious food, amazing services, reasonably priced and on top of it all one of the best backdrops of Vegas. You can watch planes land and have the view of the mountains and the strip! What more could ya ask for. 


Oh yeah, I know! Hope they decide to sell fixed dinner on New Year's Eve so everyone who dines there can watch the fireworks from their dinner table!
