CMkayuNDHPcd1dxO32kJyA We went to this restaurant because we had a GroupOn....big mistake!  Food was very disappointing and tasteless.  Butter chicken sauce was flavorless and the pieces of chicken in it were hard.  The saag panner also had very little flavor.  Most of the dishes were cold and when we complained to the waitress she told us to 'dig' into the bottom of the dish and that we must have taken food from the top...hmmm go figure?

Overall I got the sense that the food was not fresh and had been sitting there all day.  There were no patrons in the restaurant and that should have been a sign to us that the place was sub-par.  

I can't see this restaurant staying in business for long....

In the city of Toronto there are far better choices for Indian restaurants...so save yourself the trouble and go eat somewhere else.
