QMB3hmb_Yv6Vk-HLiM2cdA Expect simple, healthy Indian vegetarian food and you won't end up disappointed. I tried the Thali which consists of Rice, Roti and your choice of three vegetable curries. Salad and a dessert (usually halwa) is provided. The site claims to provide home made food and it indeed is. The food is prepared by a Gujrati lady and there is no overdose of colors, masala and preservatives. Sometimes, simplicity just wins!  A Thali costs about $7.99 (pre taxes) and sounds reasonable - given that it comes with a dessert too. Perhaps, they could offer additional rice too in case someone asks for it. The folks there are friendly. The washrooms are clean and well maintained. An ideal place for takeaway food and occasional inroom dining (although the capacity is very small).
