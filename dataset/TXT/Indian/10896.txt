a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g Let me start of by saying I am not a foodie or difficult to impress. I love Indian and have eaten in this neighbourhood a few times. 

I ordered a takeout lunch for 2 ($50). Timing was great, transaction easy. I felt the prices were a little high but figured I wouldn't be disappointed. 

3 out of the 5 items we ordered were completely inedible. 

There was so much salt in the pakoras, potatoes dish, and the chickpea dish that we were not able to eat it at all. It actually hurt to touch your tongue. Also the pickled veg that came along with it was also so salty. 

I called the restaurant thinking they might have had a new cook and would want to know about the quality. The manager was not receptive to this info and told me that no one else complained about it today. 

He flat out refused to give any type of credit toward this 'not so cheap' lunch. He offered to give a discount on the next time I ate there; which I guarantee will be never. 

Completely disgusting experience.
