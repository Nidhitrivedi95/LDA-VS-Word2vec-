UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w It's called "chaat".  Apparently, this means "street food".  Sounds good to me.  The first time I ever heard this term was when I started to look into this restaurant.

I found out about this place from looking here at Yelp and seeing the high ratings.  When we walked in, I was asking myself where the restaurant was.  To find it, you go into the back of this little market and there are a few tables and chairs.

You order by grabbing a card, ticking off the food you want and giving it to the server.  By looking at the pictures on the wall, the meals don't seem that big.  Seeing them in person after they are served doesn't help either.  But, eating is believing--you get a LOT of delicious food for your money here.  May I recommend the Chole Bhature?  It's spiced chick peas in sauce with two BIG pieces of flat bread to eat it with.  This will fill you up fast for $5.25.

No meat here in the dishes.  There's cheese, but all the food here is otherwise veggie.  No matter--you'll enjoy it anyway.  This is another five star review for Little India.  Don't pass this place up.
