JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng One of the worst experiences i ever had in an Indian restaurant. We went as a group of 4 at around 1:45pm and had to leave in the middle of eating. I understand that we were late but the waiter was so rude and never even told us that there would be no more refills. Upon asking if he could refill the food, he sarcastically asked us how long we had been in US and have we ever been to an Indian restaurant at this time of the day. The way he asked and the tone were very displeasing and disrespectful. So, we had to leave in the middle. Would never go there again.
