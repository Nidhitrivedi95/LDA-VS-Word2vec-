zKSKmkBxfrltJau_4s1ZHA Biryani and Bites is part of Peacock Indian Restaurants. This location is difficult to view from the road because another business in the strip mall is blocking the view. The menu lacks descriptions so if you are not familiar with Indian Cuisine you will have a hard time navigating the menu.

 In a nutshell all the food we tried was tasty. This is not a fancy place and everything comes in disposable take-out ware and you dine on paper plates with plastic silverware. 

The server was pleasant. PRICES ARE LOW and PORTIONS ARE LARGE. The portions were twice as big as we expected and had half left to bring home.

We tried the Chile Chicken, Chicken Biryani and a Spinach Dosa. 

The Chile Chicken was made of moist chicken chunks in a fiery chile sauce that was tasty.

Chicken Biryani was mostly fluffy rice that was infused with spices and fresh mint and cilantro and what I think were tasty caramelized shallots. The chicken was moist and came with yogurt raita and another sauce that was tasty.

The Spinach Dosa is a thin large crepe filled and folded and stuffed with spinach and onions. Three side sauces were served with a Dosa. A vegetable-potato soup, a sauce that tasted like it was made with peanut butter and another sauce that was spicy tasted chile peppers that were slightly creamy. Not sure  but the spinach seemed like from frozen and wasn't the best. 

For the most part the food we tried was  VERY TASTY and a very good value.

This is a Three Star Special. Tasty food that's a good value.
