Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q Went here for a quick lunch with a friend, had the naanwhich and it was really tasty. The masala fries are very good as well. It wasn't too crowded but this  location will probably be its downfall, but the food is tasty and the service was good. They forgot one of our appetizers, But made it right by taking off the charge. One star for service, one star for atmosphere and three stars for taste.
