YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA WOW. This will be my new place. I ordered Palak Pannear, Chicken Korma and butter chicken. All excellent. Very rich creamy and the chicken was fresh and juicy. Also ordered rice and naan. I was told on the phone that it might take a little while for my delivery, but I really appreciated the warning.
