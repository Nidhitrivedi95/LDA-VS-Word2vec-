IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Excellent food. Excellent taste. All at a great price. But what I enjoy the most is how homey this place is. The staff is super friendly and attentive. They chat with the customers and replenish your naan when you need it. I would definitely come back here if I was ever in the area.
