UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg I am biased towards Situl:  going to Situl has been a longstanding tradition with my Charlotte friends that started when I was in college, and there are a lot of fond and important memories I associate with this restaurant.  That being said, this is my go-to Indian restaurant in Charlotte.  The service is not top-notch and the prices somewhat high -- but that's been most of my experience with Charlotte Indian restaurants.  We've waited over an hour for food before.  Additionally they don't go as hot as I'd like them to -- but then, I like spicy food that hits the threshold of pain.  The amount they spice the food will appeal to most of their customers.  

The food is fantastic, though.  Some of my favorite Indian (and Indo-Chinese) food.   Currently I am living in New York and Situl is one of those places I will have to visit each time I am in NC to visit.  Just writing this makes me want to order some Chicken Manchurian!
