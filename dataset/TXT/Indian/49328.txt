tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I usually go to that Indian place south of the 60 on Gilbert, but based on reviews of this place I took a friend here for dinner.  He checked out the buffet and said he wanted to try it, so (even though I know better) I did too.  I tried 4 different colored chicken dishes (the tandoori offering was all gone) and they were all dry from sitting on the table too long and tasted the same.  No complexity to the sauces.  The cauliflower was overcooked from sitting on the steam table.  One dish that was supposed to be lamb seemed not to be.  The Chicken Briyani was dry and a little crusted.  The complimentary naan seemed reheated or stale.  The best thing I tasted was the Lamb Vindaloo.  It was good!  When I went back for dessert there was a full tray of tandoori chicken so I tried that and it was dry.  The desserts were okay.  The restaurant itself is kind of...dingy.  
Yelpers, you let me down on this one.
