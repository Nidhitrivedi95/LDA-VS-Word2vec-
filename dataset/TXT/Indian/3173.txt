0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg The search has ended. Chaupaati, of all of the Indian resturants in Charlotte, is by far the best non-Americanized Indian food in Charlotte. The menu is extensive and if you like spicy you will not be disappointed. The service is also terrific. The staff are all more than helpful and won't look at you crazy if you mispronounce a name or two. Bishal, thank you for taking the time and recommending dishes that fit our pallet. Even though the location is a solid 20 minute drive from my home, the trip is well worth it. If you looking for authentic non traditional Indian food, I highly recommend checking this place out.
