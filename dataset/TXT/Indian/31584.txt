KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ My go-to place for 4am Pakistani/Indian cuisine. They're open very late and usually have a collection of cab drivers parked outside who are always fun to chat with. The atmosphere inside is very casual, with an "order at the counter" and "seat yourself" system and TVs that usually play Bollywood music videos with occasional news reports. 

Our dishes of choice: palak paneer, tika masala, butter chicken and chicken korma with plain rice and naan.
