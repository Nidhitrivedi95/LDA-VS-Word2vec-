xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Very good.  Growing up eating Indian, I'm judgmental.  This is solid, and don't just take my PA born Indian self for it, my father from Mumbai agrees.  

Good chicken tikka, the shrimp vindaloo could have been hotter.  The waiter warned us, vindaloo is hot...apparently he erred on the side of safety when it comes to heat.  

Nan was fantastic - had a couple types.  

Service was extremely friendly.  

Only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is atmosphere.  Everything was great, but I don't want to feel like I'm eating in  my aunt's "extra space room" during a family party.  Invest in some décor upgrades, little advertising, this place will do even better, than as good as their doing.  

Highly recommended for the food, but don't go for atmosphere.
