UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I love to eat, no surprises there. But what I really love is a cuisine-specific buffet. I'm fond of smorgasbord buffets too, but there's something about just Indian food or just Chinese food or just Mexican food, and endless amounts of it, that make my heart go pitter patter (in an excitement way and a high blood pressure and cholesterol way). So when in a panic of needing Indian food and needing it now, I met my girl Jaime W for some AYCE yums. 

When we arrived, we were given menus. "WTF FOR?!?" I thought. It turns out that in addition to their delicious lunch buffet, they have a hefty selection of drinks, alcoholic and non. Next time. 

I started off wrong by getting a small plate instead of the bigass one necessary for all Indian food pursuits. It didn't take me long to fill it up. I did not care for the green salad--too peppery--but hey, that's the beauty of the buffet. Chutneys all were so winning, especially combined with any of the other various items on the buffet. You can't go wrong with mango chutney and paneer tikka masala, amirite? 

The menu is SuperMenu, so clearly marked for anybody with dietary restrictions. My only dietary restriction is having only one stomach so I'm not concerned about vegetarian/vegan/gluten free but if that's your bag, here's your place. I also like how there are menu suggestions and they let you know that some things are desserts (except those little donuts. Those are marked wrong, they are for every course). 

Definitely will come back for the dinner menu and for the buffet again. Can't complain about a thing.
