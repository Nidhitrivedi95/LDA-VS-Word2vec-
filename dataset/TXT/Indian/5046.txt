2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw I have mixed reviews for this restaurant. I called Avani for reservation and the person who picked the phone wasn't polite neither interested in providing any customer service and I was told that they didnt have any reservations left and I can try to get on the spot place.
Once at the restaurant I was please with the customer service provided by the Hostess taking reservations from the guests. Surprisingly Avani gets crowded on the weekends and I will strongly recommend to reserve your spot. Additionally we were there to celebrated my Husbands Bday and after Dinner we asked the staff if they have mini cakes and mentioned about the Birthday to them, they provided us with a complimentary Slice of cake with a pretty Sparkler on it. Thank you team Avani for the complimentary Cake slice
