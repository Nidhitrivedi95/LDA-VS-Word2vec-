UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I came here with my family after my graduation ceremony. Considering we didn't have dinner reservations, we were seated in a timely manner and our order was taken promptly. However, after that we waited about an hour for any of our food come up. Once it did, all the dishes we ordered were satisfactory but I've definitely had better Indian food in the Bay Area. 

One random thing I noticed was that the waiters all were obsessed with making sure our water glasses were full. While I appreciate the attentiveness, it began to disrupt our conversation which was a little irritating.
