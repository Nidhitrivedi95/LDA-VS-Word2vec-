2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Went here for lunch with a friend who recommended this for good Indian food.

To be honest I drive past here all the time, and I never knew this place existed.  Its not that its small either... I think I assumed it was a spa for some reason??? Lol

Place is a good size, and very nicely decorated.

We ordered butter chicken and chicken tikka with butter naan, and garlic naan.  Both were very good and flavourful.  I really liked how each chicken piece was moist and was the chicken breast.  I hate when places don't cut off the fat or bad parts to their meat.  The garlic naan was also better than the butter naan.

The only downside I would say is price.  They don't have a lunch menu, and their dishes do not come with naan or rice, therefore you have to order it separately.
Our lunch came out to be about $50 for the two of us.
