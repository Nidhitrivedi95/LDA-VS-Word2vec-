8cDP0mjK0J6lk292IeKRGg I went there on a Thursday after work with a friend. I had been 1-2 x before, a couple of years back. There was plenty of simple seating and TV with CP24 in the background. 

But most people seemed to be there for takeout. I suggest ordering ahead of time as it took 15-18 mins  for us to get our small order of: reg boneless chicken roti ($9-10), 3 doubles ($1.50 ea.), 1 reg potato and channa roti ($6). Total =$22 (inc. taxes) 

The regular size rotis were quite large - we requested they be cut in half. Portion size is good. The boneless chicken was dry and only 2-3 pcs of meat in each half. The doubles were deelish and spicy (on request)! 

We each had half a roti and 1 double and felt full. So we had leftovers for lunch the next day. Note: we were both female so perhaps someone else could eat the entire roti. 

I had the potato & Chana roti next day and it was fine but nothing special. More roti then filling and was not spicy as I had requested. But for $6 + tax it was good value. 

I like that they have mini sized rotis...I'll get that next time and it's a few dollars cheaper.
