We can't remember the names of the food that we've ordered so far, but they're all delicious. Some of the dishes can be made spicy--from 1-10 how spicy would you like your food to be? I love spicy food, so I usually go for a 7 and above. The service is pleasant as the waiters are friendly. The price is reasonable for the portion and taste we get.
