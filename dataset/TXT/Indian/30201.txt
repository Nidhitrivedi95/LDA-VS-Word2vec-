K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g The food was even better than I remembered, and as I was leaving, I thought to myself that I need to eat here at least once a month or more.  The flavors here are just top notch, and the staff is super friendly.  One really good mark of an Indian restaurant, is that Indian people eat there.  While I saw a mix of people in the place for the buffet this afternoon, I saw a healthy number of Indians there as well which made me feel like I was eating authentic cuisine.  Put it this way, how many chinese people do you see eating at PF Changs or Panda express?  The reason is because the food is made for a western palate.  At Madras, the food is all Indian all the time, and that is what is going to keep me coming back!  A great tip is that at the end of your meal when you are walking out, they have a bowl called Mukhwas, or basically "mouth freshener."  The mix is cardamom, anise seed, and coconut candy, and one half spoon full in your hand that you put into your mouth really helps to sooth your stomach after the meal. So if you haven't gone yet, use this review as an absolute billboard to try their buffet, and come back for dinner.
