abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg I re-visited this small restaurant after a year and the quality of the food and service are still first class. Each dish has it own carefully crafted distinct flavours and all are worth trying. On this occasion we had the Brussel sprouts - who would have thought they could be so interesting and tasty, the chicken mango salad, like all the dishes small but worth it, the lamb beautifully grilled, the eggplant flatbread with its unique toppings, and a new desert not yet on the menu that was so inventive and delicious.
The South African sauvignon was better than expected and the house Burgundy fine.
The owner is still there, on the premises. 
Service very friendly and helpful.
