-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g This was our second, but certainly not our last, visit to Nandini's. We ordered lamb biryani and lamb korma. Both were perfectly spiced and seasoned. The lamb was fork tender. Don't forget to order the naan - garlic and regular. Large portions and loved the leftovers. Oh! Did we mention the mango lassi?
