GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA The food was great. The service was not. Not once did our order taker/server ask if we needed anything, and once I asked for a togo box.  I got a small container that I guess I was supped to put my rice, chicken, humus, and naan into. I had to ask for additional containers, as if. I feel as  though I cheated my for leaving a tip.... If u can, I suggest ordering to go !
