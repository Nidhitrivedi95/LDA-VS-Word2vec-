SA7NjDkzdaJxUjKvX9_gpA My colleagues and I went to this little gem of a place for lunch today, based on the other Yelp reviews.  This place is not fancy at first glance but the food?  Spectacular!  I HAD to add my voice to the praise being poured out here!  My colleagues and I all enjoyed large flavourful portions, with service provide with great fervour by the owner.   The bill?  Less then $9!!  I have no complaints and I will be back again....and again.  I will be suggesting to my colleagues this be our new "regular" spot.  What a find.
