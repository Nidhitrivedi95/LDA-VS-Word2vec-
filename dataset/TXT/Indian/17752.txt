E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw Best Indian food in Champaign by a mile. The staff is very friendly and offers excellent service. I've been going here for almost two years and they're very consistent when it comes to the quality of food. The garlic naan is as good as you can get anywhere in the US and most of the entrees I've had here have the right balance of spices. Try their dal makhani, and thank me later.
