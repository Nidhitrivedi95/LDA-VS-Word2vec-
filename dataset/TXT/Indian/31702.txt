KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Just left after a wonderful dinner.  The food was excellent and when we added some of the chili paste that was on the table it was amazing!

Part of what made it so special was that both of the staff that were working were incredibly attentive, kind and friendly.  The gentleman who served us made great recommendations and the lady who assisted matched h smile for smile. 

That's what going out for dinner is all about :-)
