d6XiEFppPRpj5AZk_VzWZA I've been craving a West Indies chicken roti for a while now, and today after reading some of the reviews of fellow Yelpers, I chose this "Hot & Spicy" location. 

Walking in I found myself the only white person in the place... But I often find myself the only white person in Brampton... so nothing changes much here. There are quite a few people sitting at the dine-in tables or standing around the counter waiting for their takeout order. 

The menu is an array of Indian/Caribbean fusion! Some items I cannot pronounce nor do I know what they are... Keep looking... Ah! Boneless Chicken Roti! 

I place my order and I have the option of spicy or no spicy! I obviously pick spicy as I have developed that part of my palette for many years now.

It was a short wait before they called out my takeout order number. I left with the take out package noticing I had some significant weight in my hand. 

Arriving at home, I opened the delicious and HUGE roti onto a plate and sat down to my movie. My first bites were just the nice chewy flat bread wrap, complete with cornmeal confetti! Just the way I like it! As I get to the filling I can feel the spice hit my lips and tongue... YUM! I get my first bite of potato, the next is a morsel of tender chicken breast. The innerds of my roti explode with a beautiful blend of spice hotness and flavors. 

Ok so if I didn't tell you before this is a HUGE roti. I have presently taken a break after eating only half of it to write this review... Debating if I shall leave the rest for later or just continue to feed my taste buds... hmmmmm

This is the first place I have tried Roti since being in Ontario, but I would have to say it would probably be hard to beat!
