S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Great place in a great location with plenty of parking and easy access.  We were greeted by friendly staff with great knowledge of the menu and components of each dish.  The aloo pratha is amazing along with the cracker-type bread, papadum.  The chicken tikka masala was amazing along with the lamb korma, which we ordered extra spicy.  We will come again or grab some take out as we love great Indian food!
