llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I am new to Indian Cusine having had it just once before in London. I was looking for something approaching good Indian food in the Phoenix area, and must say I've found the place. I first called to find out if the restuarant was open as a few other revies had mentioned it had closed. I was pleasantly surprised to hear it was open, as it isn't to far from work. I wanted to order ahead and take out for dinner. When I arrived, the food was done and I was on my way. The place was empty at the time (Wednesday at 5PM) so I was a little nervous, but the food was really good. I had the Chicken Curry and the garlic naan. I would recommend both!
