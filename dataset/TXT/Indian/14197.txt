C_chktl5jFeRqu1C0rmScA I have been to this restaurant a number of times but this is the first time I have decided to write a review about this place.

Good food - horrendous service!

Ordered the thali meals - which comes with egg plant curry, beans thoran (pan fried bean), moru curry (seasoned buttermilk - thanks wikipedia!), payasam(pudding) and a couple of more dishes. I order fish curry on the side and was given chicken curry instead. The lady asked me if I could manage with the chicken curry instead. I was like whaaat? I ordered something else and you get something else instead - no way! She then goes and gets the fish curry 15 minutes later when I am done with my meai. Thanks, but no thanks.

The food is very tasty and that makes me to drive 30 minutes to come to this place but they need to train their staff on service. I see new faces each time I visit this place. 

Need to improve or else this place will close down like the rest very soon.
