scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg I'll keep it simple, food here is really really good.  Like really good.  From the samosa (get the lamb, trust me!) to the delicious warm naan, everything my husband and I tried was delicious.  Even my glass of Riesling was refreshing and a generous pour.  Atmosphere-wise, a few too many families trying to convince their distracted toddlers to try tandoori chicken for the first time.  My advice, just don't.  Service was good, our waiter was super-friendly and quick.  

Portions were a little small for the price.  My $14 chicken korma was awesome but the silver bowl is came in was kinda small.  I'm sorry but I enjoy Indian food leftovers!  My husband had to tandoori mixed grill and it was super tasty.  A bit heavy on the peppers and onions - more meat & fish would have been appreciated.  If you can handle spice, go for the medium.  It's plenty.

Yes, we'll definitely be going back.  Want to check out the lunch buffet!
