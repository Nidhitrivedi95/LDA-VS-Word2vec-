lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw I'd give this place a solid 3/5. It's good for a quick bite and the atmosphere is super chill. The prices are also very reasonable - but keep in mind you got to be ordering your food up at the counter and grabbing your own water. The servers will deliver the food to you though but don't expect anything extravagant, they simply just place the food on your table and if you're lucky you'll get a smile. 

The food is very average I'd say. I got the fried eggplant dish with fries. The fried were way spicer than expected and I would say I have a dece handle of spice. The eggplant was a little overfried in my opinion which kind of took away the whole taste. My friends got the beef dish, the names are kind of complicated so I forgot a bunch, but those dishes were simply alright as well. 

The location is super prime though, super convenient and easy for a quick bite. The food is a little to the heavy side but that's to be expected when you go for Indian food.
