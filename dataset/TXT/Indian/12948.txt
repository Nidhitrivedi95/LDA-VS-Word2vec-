b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw I can't get enough of this food. It's the best Indian around hands down. So I had to change my rating. I could literally eat it daily! And the owner is really sweet. You also get a ton of food! Well worth the price. If you order carry out its done within 10 minutes of calling.
