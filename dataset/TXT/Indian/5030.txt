2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw One of my favorite places in Sauna. Love they have a mix of great Indian and some Hakka.  Their Gobi special is amazing. For a vegetarian this places is awesome,  lots of choices.  A little pricey, but as a vegetarian it's kinda worth it to have more choice on a menu.  Again,  that Gobi special.  So good.
