After a brief closing for renovation, and a change in management, the café formerly known as "Cakes N Flakes"  has now re-opened as "Curry n Cake".  There's still a refrigerated case; the samosas are gone, but cakes are still there (a few whole ones, and about 10 flavors by the slice: black forest, pineapple, pistachio, mango, etc).  

The clientele looked the same as before, Indians in their +/- 30s (I was the only anglo in the place).  The door still says panini and wraps, but the menu doesn't have those, sticking with Indian foods like dosa, uttapam, and curries.  Today (a Saturday), veg. and non-veg. lunch specials were posted on the counter; I had the veg. for $6.99, which came with bowls of lentils and eggplant, rice, thin bread (rota), and crispy fritters -- very yummy.  I got a piece of butterscotch cake to go (I'm eating it right now; also yummy).
