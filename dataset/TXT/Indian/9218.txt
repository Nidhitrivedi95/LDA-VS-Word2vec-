Second of all, on every table they had a Halloween prix fixe menu. But apparently it's only available on Oct 30th and 31st, but the date is not mentioned on the special menu. Why even have it on the table if it's not available...beats me!

Overall, the garlic balls we got we're flavorful and delicious, especially the chutney that came with it. The fish and chips was alright, but I wouldn't order it again. The saffron chicken was quite good with tender white meats but lacked saffron. The plain rice was pillowy and the plain naan had a great flakey exterior and soft interior.

I might come back, even though there were rough patches to the service/offers.
