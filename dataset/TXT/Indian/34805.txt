Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Very bad service. Food came cold already and then it took them forever to bring out the second round of breads... By then the rest of the good had gone completely cold and inedible. Finally they weren't bringing us the cheque and I had to walk to the cash register to request then to give us the cheque so that we can pay and get done. Despite all this, the curries tasred good but quality of paneer was bad and yellow dal was not pigeon peas but green mung. I might not go here again.
