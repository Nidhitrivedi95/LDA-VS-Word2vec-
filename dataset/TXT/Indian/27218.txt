iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ This is a small family restaurant in Thorncliffe Park. Has about 12-15 tables. We were a group of 6 and there were only about 3 tables that could accommodate a group of that size. Most of their business seems to be take out. 

For appetizers we got the chicken lollipop and manchurian, both were quite good. 

For the main course we got veg hakka chowmein (noodles) and veg manchurian fried rice. The entree dishes were garlic chicken, thai chicken, veg manchurian balls, veg sweet and sour balls, and chilli potato. The portions are huge and we ended up taking some of the food home.

The food is regular chinese hakka food - oily and spicy/hot. Not the best I've had in the GTA, there are better options in Mississauga and Scarborough, but for someone that lives downtown, it's a good option to have "in" the city.

Service leaves much to be desired. The server waiting on was impatient and almost rude. My friend had a couple of questions about the menu, and her body language suggested that she thought we were wasting her time. I understand that she probably had a busy day, but if you are mean to customers, then you probably shouldn't be in the service business to begin with.

All in all, an average experience. Flavours are meh, but if you're someone who values quantity over quality, this could be what you're looking for. 

We spent about $20-$25 per person, which included a drink each.
