They have authentic Punjabi cuisine. They are pricey but tasty. Their bread (naan) is really big and good! The service was slow but they were very busy, our waitress was nice. I did order hot tea and the mug had dirt on the rim which grossed me out a little. 

Overall I like this place, but have to admit it's a little pricy.
