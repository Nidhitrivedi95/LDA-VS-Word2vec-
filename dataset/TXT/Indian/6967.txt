4scx_rtI9RZfFHWUxqPuHw Delightful food, great service. My wife and I just enjoyed some excellent late-night take-out from Mirch Masala. We stopped in to order their "non-vegetarian dinner for two" to go. We were in a hurry because our date night was at an end and we had to pickup our kids at a certain time.

The staff at the bar were welcoming. We ordered our food - which they customized to our spice preference, medium in our case - and then shared a glass of wine at their bar while we waited. It was cozy, the music was appropriate and not too loud dirt didn't interfere with our ability to talk. We regretted not being able to stay longer to enjoy the atmosphere.

Our food was ready very quickly which we appreciated and packaged extremely well. There were lots of sauces included with our meal and they survived the ride home perfectly.  Even after thirty minutes in the car, the food was hot and smelled delicious. It tasted even better! Two saucy dishes (one chicken, one lamb), a huge serving of steamed rice, seasoned chicken and other ethnic treats awaited us. My wife and I were thrilled with the entire meal  - every dish was different and flavorful.

We were extremely pleased with Mirch Masala and are already looking forward to returning so we can enjoy their outdoor seating the next time we're hungry for good Indian food.
