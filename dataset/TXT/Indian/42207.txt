qjaMwPcTyq5_JLcZpmTqNw Went there after seeing some good yelp reviews. We tried fish pollichathu, beef fry, parota, appam, chicken ulli mulak and railway biriyani. The fish pollichathu is a must try and was the star of the evening. Railway biriyani was also nice. Its steamed inside a banana leaf so it had some special taste and brought back memories of how my grandmother use to pack meal in banana leaf when we used to travel in train. The chicken ulli mulak had a very pungent taste of raw ulli and was a disappointment. Beef was not that great. It tasted like reheated one. The appam shown in the catalog was nice palappams but the one we got was like tatu dosa's. Overall it was ok and will go back for the fish and biriyani.
