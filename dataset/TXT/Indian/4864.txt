2rYcqMuCHNhWzwutGxryjw This place is a hidden gem that everyone should try! I have tried dozens of Pakistani/Indian restaurants all over the GTA and this one tops my choice for quality and freshness. I have eaten here 5 times and keep going back on a regular basis and really happy to have this place as an option in Durham region. I use to be a frequent client of the other indian restaurant in Whitby but stopped as every time I ate there it would make me feel gross after. This place doesn't do any of that and only leaves you satisfied and wanting to go back for more. 
It's a small husband and wife shop who are very friendly. ...decent looking inside but looks more like a take out place as its not intimate especially the lighting.   Portions are good although I find you get more meat in the curries at the other place. I have had several  of their curries and pakoras and they were all yummy and fresh.
