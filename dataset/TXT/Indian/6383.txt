3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA I was so excited to order from here after all of the amazing reviews. I am in disbelief at how tasteless the food was!  We ordered the butter chicken and the dal. Both dishes lacked the flavor of Indian cuisine. Both were bland and we were so incredibly disappointed. The garlic nan was the best part of our meal.  Really too bad as we live close by and thought the prices were reasonable. Maybe they had an off night?  Will still never return. Bukhara grill or Chutneys are much better options
