YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw I've eaten at Persis three or four times. As a huge lover of Indian food, I get really upset when I feel it's been done incorrectly. (You may be thinking, "Who is he to judge?" I've had enough Indian food to know the good from the bad). Persis doesn't make me do cartwheels but also doesn't make me want to go dashing to the nearest trash receptacle either. I usually order the chana masala or the eggplant; both are pretty good. This is a solid Indian restaurant that I'll probably continue going to.

My only gripe is the speed of service. I can definitely say the concept of a "sense of urgency" is all but lost here. I've ordered take-out on several occasions and its taken upwards of 30-35 minutes each time, but even then sometimes it's not ready by the time I arrive. Is this enough to deter me from returning? No. I like Persis and will continue to patronize it, but geez, please light a fire under your chefs.
