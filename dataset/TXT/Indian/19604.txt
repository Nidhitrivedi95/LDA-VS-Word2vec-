FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg Met my fiance here for a late night Indian food fix on December 11, 2012.  This was an excellent place.  We had samosas, butter chicken and lamb korma.  The naan was steaming hot too!  Everything was great and the service was the best!  Very nice lady who answered the phone and me much needed directions.  They are so polite and friendly :)  We will be visiting again soon!
