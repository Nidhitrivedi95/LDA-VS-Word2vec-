gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We received pappadum plus delicious tamarind and mint sauces to begin our meal and after an exceptionally long wait we received our aloo tiki, deep fried mashed potatoes, which were overdone and virtually inedible.  

A few minutes later the remainder of our meal, chicken makahani, lamb saag, plain basmati rice and kabuli naan (stuffed with raisins and nuts) appeared.  The naan was flat as a pancake and the filling was very bland.  Both entrees were large and delicious though the lamb was on the tough side. We concluded the meal with a shared portion of carrot halwa which was a bit too sweet.  

Service, other then by the busboy, was abysmal from start to finish.  The sole waiter, I am guessing the owner, sat in a booth across the room from us playing with a cell phone and never once looked in our direction to determine if we or any of the other diners needed anything.  I had to call the busboy over to get our check and then it took the waiter an inordinate amount of time to process the payment.
