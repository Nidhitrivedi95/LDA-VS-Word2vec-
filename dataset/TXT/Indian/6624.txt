483pQIBo1rxjZqms1s6V2Q I love curry, but for a while I have rested on my laurels and simply revisited the same old places. A few weeks ago I decided that was going to change, and so we come to my review of The Everest. 

I have sat in at The Everest once and had a couple of takeaways, overall I have to say the food is of a good standard. I prefer the spicier side of life and so have tried a chilli garlic, madras and a biryani (less spicy, still tasty). The prices are fair, certainly on par with other establishments in the area. So the food is good and the prices are fair, that being said the restaurant itself is a little tired and dated. 

In fairness I would whole heartedly recommend The Everest for a takeaway but less so as a place to sit in. Overall though it is a good shout as a place to get a curry.
