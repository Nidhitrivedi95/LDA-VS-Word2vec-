Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Not sure about the buffet experience below, but..... This place is freaking awesome as far as quality of food..  

Chicken 65 is a great example of a delicious way to start your dinner..  Then add Chana masala to the mix and you have one great meal.....  If you lucky to get before it's gone,  the special Hyderabad Biryani -  Friday is goat,  Sunday is chicken,  then you are in for a special treat..  The spices and flavor is undeniably irresistible..  The vegetable Jalfrezi also tasty, but the must get with any meal is the samosa chaat, if you dare utter these words " can I have it Indian hot", those might be the last words you speak for the night because your mouth will be on fire!  Welcome to little Hyderabadi
