KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw This was a little different place then I thought. The menu is Pak-Indian cuisine. 

I had the Butter Chicken lunch special. With it came a Samosa & a small veggie salad. The Butter Chicken with Basmati rice was very tasty. The clucker quantity was a bit lacking (I had 4 pieces in my order). The rice was done just right. What stood out to me were two things
1. The Butter Chicken Samosa was outstandingly good. It was Crispy deliciousness & I wanted 3 more! 
2. The place was crowded with young school kids which made it very loud! Not the restaurants problem however. 

This was a solid lunch but is order a burger next time.
