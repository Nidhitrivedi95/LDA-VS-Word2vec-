Meat/Vegetable Samosas
Butter Chicken
Assorted Desserts
Naan 

This is considering as a fast food environment 
Samosas: They were very good, great for a quick snack and has a great taste  
Butter Chicken: Mediocre at best, tasted pretty much like chicken with a very plain tomato sauce put onto it. Some of the pieces were very hard meat while the others were chewy.... 
Assorted Desserts: Very good! Very sweet but goes well with tea or coffee
Naan: Not very good, Garlic naan tastes bitter contrasting with naan 

Its okay, I wouldn't have it again although the pricing is very good
