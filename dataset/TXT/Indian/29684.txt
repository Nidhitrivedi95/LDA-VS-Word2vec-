jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg We really wanted some indian food...so we went to Jewel of the Crown for take out.  It was Saturday night and there were about 20 people dining so we felt like at lease some people were eating there.

We ordered shish kabob...it ended up being dried up and spiced oddly...we could not stomach eating it.

The vegie korma was ok but had huge...not bite size vegies in it.  Like really large carrot pieces and like whole quarters of potato.

The Chicken tiki masala was pretty good the chicken was tender and the sauce was pretty nice.

The rice and nan were fine.  

I guess we were expecting something really great and it was so so...next time we will try a different place until we find an Indian place that is better:(
