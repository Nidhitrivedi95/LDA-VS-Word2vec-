OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA One of the older Hakka Chinese restaurants in the GTA, Lin Garden hasn't changed much, after all, why would it if its its serving kick a$$ hakka food, good portions, reasonably priced, and service is efficient! It has always preserved its reputation as one of the best hakka restarurants in the GTA, there are only a handful of these restaurants as many are starting to realize the fad! 

Our group of 5 ordered their notables:

Chili Chicken; perfect portion, not overly salty, great blend of flavors, just got to watch out for those green chilis lol!
Vegetarian Pakora; perfect size, a little bit on the oily side however still flavorful!
Chicken Hakka Chow Mein; portion was huge, noodles cooked al-dente! and lots of ingredients used to create this dish! 
Crispy Beef: Probably the best Crispy beef I've had, not overcooked! 
Manchurian Chicken: was alright, nothing to rave about, 

overall experice was a 3.5-4/5
