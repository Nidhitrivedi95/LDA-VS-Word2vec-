16-gsPZnaBJgFi9Le-i27w Amaya Bread Bar claims to serve "neo-Indian" cuisine but in my view that really means toned-down Indian food for the "Canadian palate."
The fare was decent but it really could have been more flavourful. It was really lacking that extra something that makes me want to go back to a restaurant again.
I also must say the prices are a little high for the amount of food served. 
I went there on a fairly busy night and five of us got crammed into a small 4 seater. I wasn't the best seating arrangement.
That being said, the management and staff are nice, even if our server was a tad clueless about some of the ingredients on the menu.

Not likely to return unless invited there for aspecial occasion.
