UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We went to the lunch buffet and the food was just all right in my opinion. Service wasn't  all that good we had to ask for our waters to be refilled because they never checked on us. Dinner may be better but i usually  prefer lunch.  So not my favorite indian food resturaunt but if i am back in vegas  again and want  indian id go back.
