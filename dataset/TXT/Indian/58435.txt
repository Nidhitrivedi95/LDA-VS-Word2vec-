Their naan are outstanding, pakora is excellent, the spices in all the dishes we have tried are perfectly blended and the portions are generous and ample for leftovers for work the next day. The staff are very friendly especially welcoming to children. The kids really like watching the chefs make the breads through the large glass window they have.
