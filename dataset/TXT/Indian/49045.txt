TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw The numerous health code violations and the scary plaza (see my review for Komol) kept me away from Namaste though I had been intrigued from afar. Intrigue finally got the better of me when I had an incredible craving for dahl. My man and I rolled in for take-out and were pleasantly surprised to see a NV Health Dept. "A" proudly posted on the space near the host stand (Sigh of relief... now, I only had to think about the crazy parking lot). 

The menu showcases Goa's fabulous cuisine, though there are plenty of standard Indo faves (samosas, tandoori chicken, etc.). The Dahl Tadka is the Indo version of a hearty lentil soup with lots of garlic, onions, spices and several other ingredients that make you go Mmmmmmmmmmm. The Shrimp Xacutti is the spicier, Indo version of Thai Red Curry... though, in my opinion, it's much yummier (I may be biased) than its Southeast Asian cousin, and the garlic naan was perfect -- not too much garlic, but just enough so you can get a hint of its flavor. All in all, the food was excellent, as was the staff, who were accommodating and friendly. 

Of course, the zen atmosphere in Namaste was shattered as soon as we stepped outside onto the pavement with our piping hot take-out. We heard a car hit another, which was followed by a series of dudes screaming at each other. I was sure that a huge fight would ensue and my man and I ran to our car, quickly passing the homeless dude who was fast approaching us for $$. SIGH.
