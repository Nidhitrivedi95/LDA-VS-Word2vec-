gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This restaurant is really wonderful. Went on a Friday evening, and was greeted by a friendly host right away. Appetizers and main course arrived quickly. The food was absolutely divine. The flavors were rich and full, spicy, but not too spicy. The kind of food that you want to keep eating even when you are full. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. My family will definitely be going to this restaurant again.
