fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Naan! Naan! Unlimited freshly made naan made me a fan of this place! I went to India's Taste on a Saturday night with my family for the first time, and left with a full belly and satisfied palette. It was a busy day for them, however the staff were still friendly and helpful (and also kept the naan coming~). They have a good range of choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians. I have little knowledge about Indian food, but I did enjoy everything I had, especially for the goat/lamb dishes. I will most likely return when I have a big craving for Indian food and naan.
