aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q Fantastic find for me today!

Happened across this little place, walked inside, and lunch life has been changed forever.

The place isnt much to look at but the food, oh man is it ever good!!!! Dont expected your averaging tasting mexcian burrito though, the ones they sell here have a flavourful kick of spices in your mouth.

The sizes of the burritos were huge! Jumbo means jumbo, and only for 8 bucks too!!! Because I'm a huge rotti fan, I could not help but to also get a butter chicken rotti (thinking I'll save it for dinner). The rotti I got was HUGE (fit a large take out box) and smelled so good I, of course, could not wait until dinner to go to town on this bad boy. Chicken was juicy and tender, and the potatos melted in ur mouth.

Needless to say I will b going back quite often for lunch from now on!
