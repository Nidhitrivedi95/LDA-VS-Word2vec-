PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Great little place for Indian food. Not fancy at all. 
If you walk in they have specials which change daily. I have gotten several items off their menu. Their biriyani which is a dish made of meat and rice cooked together for several hours is amazing. 
Food is a touch oily but is very well seasoned. Some of the items are quite spicy so if you can't handle the heat make sure you let them know. 

This is probably my favorite place for Indian cuisine in Arizona.
