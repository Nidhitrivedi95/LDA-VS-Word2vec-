TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This place is great! It's probably the best Indian lunch buffet we've tried since coming to Vegas. Everything was so flavorful! And they offers a lot of dishes that I'd never tried before - ones I've never seen offered at other buffets. 

It happened to be a Friday during Lent, so my hubby's stuck to the vegetarian dishes. I worried about this a little because his favorite Indian dishes usually involve chicken. But he couldn't have been more pleased! I think his favorite was the Saag Paneer and then Kheer for dessert, of course! My favorites were the Goat Curry and the Chicken Makhani. 

All of this was just under $30 including the tip. The service was fine and we had the place mostly to ourselves.
