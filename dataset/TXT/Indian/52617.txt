uxpCyMp4R10WRjqr9JsaPA I can't say that I am an expert on Indian foods, but I thought that aspects of this restaurant could have been better. The food was good but the service was poor. First of all, the waiters were sitting all of the people together by the windows on a rainy day. That would have been fine if the restaurant was full, but it wasn't. One group even had to asked to be sat somewhere else. We ordered our food and it was brought out in a timely manner. The food was tasteful, but nothing to call home about. The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice and the seats were roomy. When we got our check (there were two separate checks for four of us) they messed up who got what. It took three tries before they got it right. I would recommend trying it, as I would give it a second chance too.
