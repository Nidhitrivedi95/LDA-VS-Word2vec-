LgqGDQsUurUh6qUocPeSsQ We had a vegetarian thali and a chicken vindaloo for supper. The overall impression was that the meal was way too salty for our taste buds. There was a total of five 1-inch cubes of chicken and 2 pieces of potates in the vindaloo. The dal and the naan in the thali plate were fantastic, but the chaana and the aloo gobi were excessively salty. Thank goodness I had a sweet lassi to save me (my favorite part of the meal). Even my SO's mango lassi tasted like it was made from a mango syrup. For the price we paid, we've had better Indian meals elsewhere in the city.
