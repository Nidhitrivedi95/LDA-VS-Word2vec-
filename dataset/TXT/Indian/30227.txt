K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I love this place.  We go there on the weekends to enjoy their veggie buffet.  After five times, we realized that we hadn't had the same dish twice.  The dosas are fantastic  and appropriately spicy.  It's been a while since I've been to Udapi, but this place seems better from what I recall.  No alcohol or meat, so any review referring to Chicken Tikka means they haven't been there.
