3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA We went for dinner after reading reviews for this restaurant which was highly recommended by yelpers. Sadly, the experience was really just meh! The restaurant was full. But there was a vacant table available and we got it right away. The servers are very attentive but the food took forever to come. Even after the lateness the Paneer veggie twist we ordered was too watery and wasn't flavourful at all. The garlic naan was made fresh but tasted more like the frozen naan warmed up. Unfortunately the experience wasn't good enough for us to go there back. Ambience, service, location, veggie options - good but would rank it OK on taste and quality of the food. I would not recommend this restaurant.There are many other good Indian restaurants in the area.
