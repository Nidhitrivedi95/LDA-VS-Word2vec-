dJfiXs0BwwkGKl0sXC3dzw My new favorite Indian restaurant!! The portions here are not only large but they are delicious!! I had the chicken tika masala and gobi 65 and they both were amazing. Highly recommend this place to anybody looking for the best Indian food in Charlotte. We also met the owner and told him the food was delicious!! He was really friendly.
