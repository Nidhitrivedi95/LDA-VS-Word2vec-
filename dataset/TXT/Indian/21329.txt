GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA If I could i would leave zero stars. I've came here a few times in the past and the experience has been fair. The food is very good, the only problem is the service. The most recent experience 11/9/2017 me and my wife came in for dinner. We were sat down and the server just left and never came back.  About 15 minutes have passed not one employee asked us if we needed a drink or gave us a menu. This was going to be my first meal of the day, so you can imagine how irritated I must have been. A few times the server looked at us. Rather than asking if we needed anything he just went around empty tables to set napkins. Then a new group of people came in and they were  sat down and immediatley asked if they needed water and given a menu....after we have been sitting there for about 20 minutes with no service. They are very selective with how they treat their customers. The food here is amazing but the people of the facility are terrible. I've never experienced this in any resturaunt ever in my life. We got up and left hungry.
