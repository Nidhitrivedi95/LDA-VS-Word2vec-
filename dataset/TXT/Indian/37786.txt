ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I really enjoyed the service and their effort to help educate us on Indian food. I have to say that I've always been skeptical of this type of food and its hard to win me over. So I gave an extra star just in case I'm being unfair on the food. I liked the ambiance, the location, the service, and the food tasted good. My only real complaint is the price. It just seemed steep for what we got. $116 for two people is not a big deal but for what we got, I think that was the real challenge. But overall a good meal and service.
