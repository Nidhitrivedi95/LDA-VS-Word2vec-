nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA Really disappointing. The hapless kid waiting on us seemed like he was filling in for someone who had ducked out to the washroom -- he didn't seem to have any experience with or interest in waiting tables, and seemed either stoned or distracted. Our food took forever to come out, and when it did it was almost comically bad -- the vegetables had clearly come out of a bag of frozen mixed veggies, with some bland sauce half-heartedly sloshed over them after defrosting. The chicken dish we ordered was passable, but small and unremarkable for the price. Toronto is full of great Indian restaurants -- steer clear of this one.
