JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng We love this place! We have dined-in for dinner and have gotten takeout and was not disappointed either time. Our waiter did check on us a few times but wasn't very chatty, which we are fine with, but our orders came prompt and everything was delicious. I had the lamb curry and it was amazing. We even tried the Gulab Jamun and loved it. I had never tried anything like it but the consistency and flavor was so good. This place is one of our favorites.
