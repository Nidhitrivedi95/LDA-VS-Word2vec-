rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ We drove there from Oakland  just for food.   We have been told that this is the best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and yeah..we weren't disappointed. You can tell that this place must have authentic Indian food by people in the restaurant. All are Indian. When you go there, you need to order food at the counter. I love mango lassi there. It is not too sweet, just right. For appetizer, I go with Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower flitters with spicy sauce).
