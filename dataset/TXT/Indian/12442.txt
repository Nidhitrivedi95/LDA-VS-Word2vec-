aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Had a very strange experience here. The staff were very disorganized. I  ordered a Kathi tikka roll and a butter chucken burrito and said I would pick then up. The counter man said come back in 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we arrive and they start to put the food on. If he wanted us to wait he should have said for us to wait. I don't think the turn around on their rolls is typically 10 minutes so maybe they were waiting on something. 

Also the signs outside are somewhat misleading. Butter chicken burrito was advertised for 6.99 on the chalkboard outside but was 9.99. The Kathi rolls are advertised as 6.99 but this is for the small snack size. Not outright lying but a bit shady.
