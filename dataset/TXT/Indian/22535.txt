gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Seriously, how did I miss this place?? I've lived down the street since it opened 2 years ago, whhhaaaat!? Great food, great service and the location is what I've been looking for in a killer Indian food place. 

Let's start out with the samosas; perfectly flakey outside with the right amount of chewiness and the filling was seasoned to perfection! 

I tried Iddly for my first time and it definitely won't be my last! They were warm and fluffy and the moist texture allowed for extreme dipping in the sambar along the the side! 

Next, Chana Butura, my absolute favorite thing to eat when deciding on Indian Cuisine, it never lets me down and Ruchi definitely nailed it! Piping hot puffy bread and chickpea curry, I mean come on, does anything else sound better? 

Lastly, Paneer Shahi Korma - listen, I don't even like cottage cheese, but if this is what it tasted like all the time, you've got a friend in me! Served over rice and I had some puffy bread leftover for dipping, SOLD! To Ruchi for stuffing my empty belly with an amazing meal!! 

Until next time...
