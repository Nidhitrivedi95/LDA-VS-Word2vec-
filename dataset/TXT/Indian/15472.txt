CRgCV0KUx40uW_j_b0p-MQ This place is my go to for buffet lunch when I'm craving good indian food (and I'm ALWAYS craving indian food). While I do have some criticisms with the place (1. Sometimes servers take too long refilling water/naan 2. On slow days their food just sits there and doesn't seem so fresh) they've never been bad enough for me to stop coming back. I just make sure I time my visits right and its always guaranteed fresh made food... especially the naan which is probably why there's always a wait for them. Definitely my favorite indian buffet in Mississauga.
