F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Just across the street from my folks' place...

After trying Emerald Chinese Restaurant (and feeling somewhat violated) I demanded some type of redemption that there was somewhat decent Asian food in this part of Mississauga.

So mom says there's a Hakka place across the street that 'just' opened... 

Do yourself a favour and eat here! The food was sooo damn good! We ordered the Spring Chicken, Egg Fried Rice and, what goes without saying, Chili Chicken, since any self-respecting Hakka restaurant should be able to hold their own with that particular item. In essence, the Spring Chicken is much akin to the Chicken Pakora without the spice, but also has green onion in the pakora batter. Very nice. The Egg Fried Rice was very mellow and the rice was cooked perrrrfectly. Even more shocking was the amount of rice, which was packed to the top of the takeout container, as if I got two orders of rice. SCORE! And for the Chili Chicken? It was excellent. Not too spicy, but had a good amount of heat that can be handled by anyone, yet adjusted to be more hot and spicy with the included hot sauce.

Mom gives it a 10/5. I concur. Great Job Hakka Ren!
