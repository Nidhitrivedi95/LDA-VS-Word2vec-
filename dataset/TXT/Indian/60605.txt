zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Tried this place out because it's close to home and was disappointed.  The meat was dry and the service was slow.  The space can use some updating. The staff were friendly and I really wanted to like it because I like the cuisine, however I'm going to check out other places before going back.
