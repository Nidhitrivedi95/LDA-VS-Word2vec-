llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I was just here yesterday because Tandoori Times was closed. I was disappointed about it until they brought out the food. The presentation was lovely! The paneer tikka was sizzling and gorgeous. The paneer was a perfect level of spice and unlike Tandoori Times, not dry. The veggies in it were delicious and juicy and crunchy. My mother ordered the paneer masala, which came out looking just as good. Medium spice was perfect and the peas and bell peppers in it were abundant and delicious. The waitress had a vibrant personality, very helpful. The entire restaurant was empty, that was surprising for 6pm on a Monday. It is rather large, nice atmosphere, weird Indian videos on the tv. Oh and the Chai tea is superb.

I'm eating my leftovers right now as I write this. Still good! Highly recommend this place.
