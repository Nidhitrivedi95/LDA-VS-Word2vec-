SB0HnIkRA7IaTX9btxZW-Q I'm a huge fan of Indian food! But I have to say that I've eaten the worst shahi paneer and the worst chicken tikka masala possible at this restaurant. The shahi paneer wasn't creamy at all, it was like water and have absolutely no taste at all. 
For the chicken tikka masala, the pieces of chicken were good and tender but the sauce was liquid and tasted so artificial that it ruins the chicken. 
To finish on a good note, the naan was just perfect, fluffy and tasty and the waitress was really friendly and the service was impeccable, to bad that the food is a no go!
