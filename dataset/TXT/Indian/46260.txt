sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ love love love their Roti's! Yes, you can wait a while when you're wanting a roti during the lunch rush, but it is well worth the wait. It's a good idea to call in your order. 

I have tried several different roti's and I've had plates with rice, but I always find myself at the mercy of the curry chicken roti. 

Be careful not to order hot your first time you go there. If you typically love hot food, try out the medium because it's sooo hot. I looked at a guy like he was crazy once when he ordered hot, I can only assume it will actually tear you apart later...you know what I mean.
