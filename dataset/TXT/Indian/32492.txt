li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ Hurry for Curry, then wait. It took 25 minutes for me to get my order. Don't get it confused with the chain Curry in a Hurry, that would imply they are quick. Also don't get it confused with Naan and Curry in San Francisco, because then it would be cheaper, faster and better.
This is the second time I've eaten here. The first time I had the chicken curry (which took awhile too). Also, I was confused, because I thought Indian Curry is usually thick like a paste. This curry was extremely watery. Also, I was confused because they gave me a tiny little piece of undercooked bread, which I guess was supposed to be the naan.
The second time was when I had to wait (longer I mean). When I finally got my order, my extra order of naan wasn't ready. Although they certainly had enough naan for everyone else. I sat down, finished my food, and sure enough no extra naan. The naan I had was still undercooked, so I thought they would just under cook the extra too, since they don't bother to finish cooking it fully.
Furthermore, what's with the ordering through computers? Are they meant to save time? Or look cool? The line is always backed up with people navigating thru menus on these. Also, with the automated ordering machines, they should have extra man-power in the kitchen right? Nope.
Seriously, this is Indian food gone wrong. Next time you have a curry craving go for any of the great Indian restaurants in the valley, I've liked all the ones I've tried. Or if you're downtown, go next door to the Mexican restaurant, the pizza place, or (never thought I'd say this) Subway. If you have the time hop over to Breadfruit or Pastabar. Or just wait till people tire of this place and after it closes, eat at the new restaurant that takes its place.
