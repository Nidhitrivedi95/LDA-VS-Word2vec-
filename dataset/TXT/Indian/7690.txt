67-W33G-nihf5UtOj5Mivw A food court kind of restaurant. It has so many choices to offer. I had a daily special- chicken masala. With rice, salad, a kebab and a lentil soup. They are tasty and come with big portion with a good price. Very good price for the students around. 
They have mango lassi which is not a thick texture, considering the price it is good. 
The chicken dishes look all attractive to me. Next time I would like to try a butter chicken. 
The waiter was nice and friendly as well as the owner. 
Try the sauce they offer above the counter. They are full of spices.
