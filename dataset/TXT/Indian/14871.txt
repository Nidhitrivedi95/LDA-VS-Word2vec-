cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA We got Saag Paneer and Lobster Tail on Rice with coconut sauce. Food was surprisingly good, although the portions are very small. 

The waitress was attentive and very friendly. 

Despite all the positives mentioned above, I most likely will not return. It is over-priced for what you get,  even with Groupon it was not worth the value.
