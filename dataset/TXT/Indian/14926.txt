cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg Overall an amazing experience. Authentic North Indian cuisine and service goes above and beyond to accommodate you. The only sad thing I found out about this  place is we left a generous tip because the female server seemed very friendly and dedicated to us only to find out that the owner does not allow them to keep the tips as 'he pays them out of the tips'that is their base salary that is shared.
