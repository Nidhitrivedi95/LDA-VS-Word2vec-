NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw This is probably my favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto and yes it definitely beats Lahore Tikka House.

I was sad to hear the owners have changed, the previous owners were the sweetest souls! They recognized us right away and we'd always converse. Now, when I enter I just get seated with minimal conversation. 

It's a very small restaurant so don't bring a big group of people. It would be the perfect date spot! 

I always order the butter chicken here because it's so creamy and has the perfect balance of sweetness and spice. The garlic naan paired with the butter chicken is so delicious.
