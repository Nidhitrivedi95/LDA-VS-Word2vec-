c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A There are so many excellent Indian restaurants in this area that my husband and I routinely dine at, this one just didn't measure up.  It was our first time ordering from Makkah, so I'm willing to write off the awful food we received as the kitchen having a bad night.  We ordered the meat special for two as well as some palak paneer.  The food arrived via delivery still hot and the delivery person was very pleasant.  The food however, was surprisingly unpleasant.  The vegetable of the day dish was overly oily and heavily spiced with chilli without any real depth of flavour.  That really describes all of the food, overly spicy without any real depth.  We both love hot foods, so it wasn't that, it was the one "hot" note and nothing else.  The palak panner was black and greasy at best, with approximately 5 cubes of paneer.  The same was true of the chick curry (our selected meat of the day), the chicken was cooked well, but the curry was like water and there was barley any chicken to speak of.  Finally, the naan was very thick and unlike any naan I've ever had.  It was more like pizza crust actually.  As I said, this very well could have been an off night for the kitchen, which happens.  It's just hard to think about ordering from them again when there are so many other amazing Indian/Pakistani restaurants in this city.
