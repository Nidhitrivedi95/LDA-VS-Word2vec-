kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w This was a great meal but with rushed service.  We had dinner on a weekday. My mother ordered the murg vindaloo "Indian hot" and loved the level of spiciness.  I order the kadhai paneer medium. Now, my heart sinks when the waiter at an Indian restaurant asks how hot I want it.  (My standard answer is "however the chef thinks it should be", but waiters never accept that answer.)  Where I live a customer is never asked, but it seems to be a standard question in smaller cities.  My dish turned out to be perfectly seasoned.

My only issue was how quickly we were rushed out.  The waiter was asking us about dessert before my mother had finished her entrée.  We ordered dessert and it arrived--before my mother had finished her entrée.  The check came lickety-split.  I'm not sure what the hurry was as we were there at an early hour.
