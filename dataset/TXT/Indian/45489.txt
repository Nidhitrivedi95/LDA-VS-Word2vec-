ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Went on a Saturday evening around 7:30 with a party of 5 other girls, the place was extremely busy but as we had called ahead we did not have to wait for a table for very long.  This was my first time at an Indian restaurant in general and I have to say that o was very happy.  The food was amazing very flavorful and a good portion.  My sister and I shared an order of Dum aloo, which came with rice;  We also ordered 1 tandori naan and split it.  We ate till we we're full and still had some to take home with us.  The two of us ate and we're satisfied in total for about $18.00. 

I will mention that I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars simply because we had a rather long wait, it was nearly an hour before we got our food.  However, it was totally worth it and I will be back in the future.
