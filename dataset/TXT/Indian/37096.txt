o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Please read this review. whoa ! there is no option for No STARS. I would have given that to this place. bad bad experience eating there once. We are North-Indians we know our food. The food was soo bland and not very professionally cooked, it was like some aunty trying to cook restaurant food. Very very small portions. 

But here is the best part, when the bill arrived everything was marked at $1 extra $2 extra. I asked the server to please look at this bill everything is marked at a higher price, she came back and said no everything is alright . That is when I explained her everything like she was a Child, "see the price in the menu now see the price on the bill can you see the difference", then she took the bill back and reduced some amount and still it was incorrect. All this while the owner lady was watching but decided not to get into it or even come to us to ask what was happening and if she could help us. At this point i was like are you kidding me, opening a restaurant and inflating prices from what you wrote in the menu... I went up to the counter i said, please look at the bill again it is STILL INACCURATE. The owner lady said, "Relax, please don't stress". Now I was really calm, i thought "Why would I be stressed, its your business, and your customer is upset, you are fooling them. You better be stressed" i was just watching her get really confused and not able to manage anything at all... then she gave me rest of the amount back in loose change. She kept on saying there is something wrong with the package here the software that calculates and generates the bill. 

We had such a bad experience, we will never go back there again and told everyone we know about what happened, everyone who heard the story was furious.
Get your ACT together Ma'am.
