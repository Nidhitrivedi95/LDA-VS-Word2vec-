GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA As a foodie and lover of tasty spicy (cause spicy bland exists) food, Curry Corner has to rank as one of my favorite places to eat, simply for the quality of the food. Can't believe it took me so long to find this place! The Lamb Karahi with extra chili is by far my favorite dish.
