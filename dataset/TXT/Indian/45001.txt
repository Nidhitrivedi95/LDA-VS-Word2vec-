S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA BEST mango lassi I've ever had!!! Service was great! Food was satisfactory... I went for something new and adventurous as a main dish, but wished I'd gone with something more traditional and reliable. I will definitely be back to try another dish. The owners truly care about their customers and I look forward to returning!
