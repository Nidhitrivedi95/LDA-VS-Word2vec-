CzwowIhuiBfW9O0MqUJhKA This is my go to place when I'm craving for Indian Food. The food is good and affordable. 
We usually order the combo for 2 - butter chicken, chicken biryani, kebob, 4 naan and 2 drinks all for 23$.

The service is fast and servers are friendly. I hope they renovate their washroom.
