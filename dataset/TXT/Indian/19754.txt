FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw I love ordering takeout from Swagat! And of course it's always best when you order a load of food and share with great friends.

This was some of the best chicken tikka I've ever had. Perfectly spiced and rich. 

The samosas were delicate on the outside and a hearty mix of potatoes and peas on the inside. 

The aloo mutter and chana masala were also fabulous! And everything was still piping hot after the drive home.

And of course, the best way to finish off Indian is with an order of gulab jamun! 

Our total came to about $70, which served the seven of us dinner (we were stuffed!), and we even had some leftovers. Totally reasonable!
