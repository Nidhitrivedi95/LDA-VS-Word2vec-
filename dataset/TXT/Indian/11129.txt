aBdFmNEYq4_ft8eCr-TwRw I really like the food here... I believe I'm a regular. But they never seem to have many people. In fact, I'm here alone because I wanted dosa and I'm their only customer. Regardless, food is great, price is great. I always leave happy. Today there is only one worker and he does not seem too happy to be here but usually he's very nice. Food was ordered and arrived in less than 10 mins. Had their butter masala dosa this time and it was yummy! Wish I took a pic of it but here is what's left! Masala chai is good too. They didn't have chaat papdi today. I also want to state that I live 45 seconds walking distance from guru Lakshmi and still drove here to eat. Food is good!!!
