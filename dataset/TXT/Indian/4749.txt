Like it is being the trend with Indian Restaurants in Phoenix, the original owners appear to have sold this place after they built up a customer base. I went to the buffet last Saturday, it was no good. Everything was too salty, and the Biriyani was dry, the dessert had gone bad. Will not go back there again.
