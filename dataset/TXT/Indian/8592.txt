7U7uLS9YjjhBM1SoyNH30w Most dishes are Indian, but they serve food I would categorize as middle eastern as well - hummus and others.  I enjoy a good biryani, and they've got it here.  Several dishes are vegetarian, but meat dishes are prevalent.  The saffron rice is sooo good.  The food is all pretty good, so the buffet might be the best way to go.  The service is decent but sometimes pretty slow.
