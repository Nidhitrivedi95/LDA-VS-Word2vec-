ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I went to Copper during Queens Feast with two friends and we all agreed that the overall three course meal was not worth $30. My main dish was a "Ghost Rubbed Chili Chicken" and it lived up to its name because it was so small I almost didn't see it. The naan and sauce trio was my favorite part if I had a favorite. My friends ordered croquettes and they were semi-delicious. As the final course the menu offered a choice of chocolate cake (strange), or a traditional "trail mix" type cake. Our table ordered both but the chocolate cake was entirely too rich, and trumped the other courses in size. I'd rather fill up on the main course, not the dessert. 

Other items of note: Our waiter was extremely nice, the kind of nice that is creepy--he was very interested in how each of our days had gone. But he was knowledgeable about the food. During the middle of the "feast" we were greeted by the most apathetic bus boy I've ever met. He told us blatantly "I gotta get outa here man, I hate working here!" We LOLed, but wow, who says that? Especially to customers eating your food? Really weird. 

At least the building was nice.
