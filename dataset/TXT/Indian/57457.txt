YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw This place is amazing!! Their food is authentic and delicious. I had the butter chicken and I had to order another one to go so I could keep eating it the next day. The rice was delicious and so was the naan. My only complaint was that the waiter seemed a little annoyed with us because we could not pronounce the names of the dishes and we had a hard time understanding him but that was understandable. It was a wonderful place and I will certainly be back
