WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA One of the best roti available downtown. They offer some awesome combo rotis for the adventurous. The mutton, squash and spinach is my usual order. The roti is very large, one meal if you are starving or two if you're just hungry. Friendly service and a nice dining room full of neighborhood folks.
