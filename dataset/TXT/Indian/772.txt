-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg The Maharaja specialized in showcasing Indian history and offered the royal dining experience. The menu is divided in 4 different sessions; 4 different flavours of 4 different regions of India. Each session has its very own appetizers, main and desserts<U+200B>. 
You are greeted with, in my opinion, the most knowledgeable and courteous server. He gives you the restaurant speech and brings a complementary minty drink (sorry I don't know the name).   
We got the lentil and paneer dish, with naan. Their naan is hands down the best I've ever had. The portions are generous. 
Highly recommend!
