gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Food is Meh... to say the least. Pay and eat crappy Indian food, here is your place.

I went here for a to-go buffet, boy I was taken for a royal ride. I was told instead order separate ones (so not everything is mushed up together). From the menu,

1. Sambhar - 2.99 + 4 other items from the buffet
The bill came out close to 4 buffet price. I quickly told him, all I am looking for his separate boxes (no extra items).

Ended up giving me a watery sambhar and a watery avial (with foot long vegetables in it no pun intended) paid 15.50.

I understand, how some people in the name of buffet to-go take the restaurants for a royal ride. While I was trying to be honest with the restaurant, I was taken for a royal ride. 

My last time to this place where there is no transparency, dishonest to say the least.
