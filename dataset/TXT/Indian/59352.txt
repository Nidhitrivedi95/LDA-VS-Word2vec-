z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA A friend and I went for a lunch.  We were surprised to learn about the $2 offer on Tuesday so we decided to sit down. We have been here many times and usually enjoy the food.  Since my friend did not know much about Indian food, I decided to take a bowl for her.  The manager was rude and made disgusting comments about how the friend can come for herself and order food. She proceeded to tell her staff not to put give extra serving if I request (which shocked me as to why I would?).  We left feeling humiliated for no reason.  Never returning again.
