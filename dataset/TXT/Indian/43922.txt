RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I don't need to over explain myself to make my point. This place is phenomenal. Simply put. You can't afford to miss it if you live in Toronto. Now.... Word of caution - you'll have to shower from head to toes and throw all your clothes in the washing machine after eating here. Even your urine will smell of spice, don't say I didn't warn you.

A true gem of Toronto's culinary scene.
