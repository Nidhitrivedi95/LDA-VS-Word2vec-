NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ I've been to the Gurkha a few times. The food has always been great and flavoursome. 

It's quite a tight squeeze to sit in as the location makes it popular. 

I've always enjoyed it however more recently the waitresses faces could sink a ship and I think waiting 45 minutes between starter and main meal is unacceptable. This has only happened once yet it wasn't that busy, felt like we were being judged. 

I'll be back and the tips will reflect the service.
