JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg I'd definitely return here. 

I really like the location and the ambiance of this restaurant. The entrance is not directly at the streetfront, so it's easy to walk by this place without noticing it. The interior is is dimly lit, and the decor is lovely. They were playing some sort of cool fusion music as well, which added to the lovely evening. 

Indian restaurants in the fine dining category are few and far between. I feel like many restauranteurs attempt but often fail in the face of  mom and pop Indian restaurants, whose flavour combinations and traditional recipes deliver great food for minimal prices. I can count on one hand the Indian restaurants in the fine dining category: The Host, Kama, and Mt. Everest. Out of these three, Mt Everest was the only one I was pleased by, until now. 

The food served at Earth is rich and delicious. The flavours are authentic, and the freshness of the food is evident. The service at Earth Indian was excellent! So good in fact that my partner tipped way above the expected percent. The standard papad with chutney was served at the beginning. After this arrived our main course. We ordered the vegetable biryani, and the Paneer Makhani, upon the recommendation of the waiter. The naan and roti were yummry. There was lots of saffron in the biryani, which I appreciated. Definitely worth a visit :) Great for dates!
