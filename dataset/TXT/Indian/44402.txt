Young, smart passionate team paying close attention to everything from the alkaline ionized water served to the enormous 6ft dosas at this spot that pays devoted loving tribute to the uniqueness of South Indian cuisine. We went for lunch and couldn't resist ordering way too much and it was still super affordable - two dosas, 2 savoury potato donuts, possibly the best chicken I have ever had, and two mango lassis for $30 is excellent (and delicious) value. I love the decor, the silver glasses and plates, and the charming friendly waitress who worked the whole lunch rush by herself with a smile. Big fan, can't wait to go back.
