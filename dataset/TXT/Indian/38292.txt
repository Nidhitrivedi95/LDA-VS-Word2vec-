OlJODULZWPGLZP_ntZfSfQ Best Indian food I've EVER had.

This is straight takeaway. You order, you wait, you get your food, you leave. Or you could have it delivered. Whichever you prefer.

They give you a ton of food. One dish could feed a family! Inexpensive, flavorful, and well worth the walk to go get it. I tried three different dishes, two different types of rice, two types of nan bread, and the fried bananas. All of it was good, spicy, and chalk full of flavor. 

All of the Indian food I've had and rated now seem second best. I guess I'll have to go to Edinburgh again to get some.
