FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ Really great curry! Going here for lunch means fighting the rush and that can mean a wait but well worth it. The green curry & bamboo is delicious, I'd highly recommend it! The atmosphere is decent for being in a small strip mall but the service is what makes up for it as the staff is very nice!

The lunch menu is usually the way to go as it's cheaper than the regular menu. And the portions are usually smaller, unless you love jasmine rice, then order away carb freaks!!
