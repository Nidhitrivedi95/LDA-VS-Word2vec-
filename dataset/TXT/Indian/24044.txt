GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg I don't know if it's rude but I have to lick my fingers!!! We just lunched here & the Chicken Karahi is AMAZING! The meat that came with the nehari was melting. So tender. I love the service~ they really care about the customer & the quality of the good matches. Thank you! You keep us coming back.
