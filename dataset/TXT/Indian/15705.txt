CVNJ5kndABkFtDLr_mrBaA Very friendly service kept reminding me that everything was homemade style. 

The butter chicken ($7.99 + $1 scoop of Daal curry) was small and not cheap, why couldn't they have given significantly more rice? The food is pre-prepared hot table style and ready to go. The butter chicken tasted good and the Gulab Jamun ($1 / ball!) were also good as well though they were served on a lid (with a hole...) for some reason (!?).

No washrooms, really small seating area. I'd go again only for the much cheaper daily specials.
