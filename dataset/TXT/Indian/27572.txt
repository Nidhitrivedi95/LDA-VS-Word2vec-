That said, my family finds the milder flavors a bit more to their liking than BT (not me!:)), and it's almost guaranteed that the chef/owner will make a stop at your table to ask for your opinion of the food.  The staff is wonderful and the ambiance is great.  If you like Indian food like we do, try them both and select based upon where you are at dinner time and whether you want it spicy/authentic or Americanize/dsubdued.  Let's be clear - there is a place for both.  You won't lose either way.
