Uyw1pJ03kt-I1B_tkA3aFg I wish I could leave a review less than 1 star! I was so excited to try this place. It was a terrible experience. Even the chai tea was awful. We waited for over an hour and a half, and when we finally got the food the beef Nihari tasted like a dirty sock that had been soaking in water. We finally just left, and got Chinese food next door.
