-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Nandini is a very good restaurant, they offered a variety for vegetarian dishes and the servers were very nice. We carry-out often, but we dined in on a week day once. It was quiet, with only two other families there, but it was nice. Staff was very attentive and conversational and suggested dishes and different kinds of beer. The food was amazing as always, their spices are on point and everything was warm and cooked well. We come from Phoenix to this restaurant, foregoing a handful of other Indian restaurants because this one made a great impression on us. We are only able to indulge once a month because of the prices, but that's ok because we have never been disappointed with our orders when we do indulge.
