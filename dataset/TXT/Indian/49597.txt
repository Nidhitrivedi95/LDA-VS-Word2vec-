tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA We managed to drive from Florence once every two weeks to come and eat Indian food. The servers Are nice to my kids and they so the naan plain for us. The mango lassi is one of our favorite. Chicken tikka is never a miss. I love the raita sauce so it is not as a spicy. 
The desserts are great choices and we always make sure to have some of them.

We will be coming back also.
