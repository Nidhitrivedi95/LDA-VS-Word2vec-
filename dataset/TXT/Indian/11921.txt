auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ We visited this place last night for dinner.  There were 4 other parties dining there when we arrived.  The place was nicely decorated for a strip mall restaurant and the staff seemed friendly and welcoming.  Nehil was our waiter and the experience we had with him garnered Taj Palace this one star review.  Another couple came in after we did and Nehil spent 10 minutes chatting with the couple at the next booth, talking about himself.  When he did stop by to take our order I told him that I wanted the Vegetarian Appetizer Platter and he said "you don't want to order that, that's going to fill you up and you won't eat the entree."  I then ordered a potato filled bread and he said "you don't want to order that, take the garlic naan"  as if he wants to tell me what to eat.  I deferred to my Husband who wanted the half tandoori chicken and Nehil said to him "you don't want to order that, take the fish entree".  I asked to speak to a manager and he said none was available.  I then asked for a business card and the name of the owner and as we were leaving a group of men entered through the back door.  I spoke to one of them and told them about our experience and they just stood there dumbfounded.  We left and had a wonderful $75 dinner somewhere else.  Too bad Taj Palace - you lost our business forever.  The quote for this place is "Guest is as good as God".  I think not.
