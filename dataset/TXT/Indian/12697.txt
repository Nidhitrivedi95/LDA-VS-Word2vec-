B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Came here on a Friday night and was surprised that it wasn't busy. I've been to Dhaba a few times and would argue it is probably the best Indian food in Madison for non-buffet style. Samosa chaat is a great appetizer that can easily be shared. I always get chicken tikka masala and a paneer dish and love the flavor. Not too rich and just the right amount of spice according to your preference. Their garlic naan is to die for! Service is usually great, but this past time our server seemed to be a bit forgetful.
