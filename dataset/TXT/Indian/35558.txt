MWcN6qLWTfRJqLySxwJNqQ Unfortunately I never got a chance to eat this food.  My family and I attempted to try this location for the first time today.  When we went in the restaurant, they were completely empty.  It was a very casual restaurant, so we decided to order our food as take out.  Assuming there were no other orders they were working on, our food should have been ready fairly quickly.  We sat there waiting, and about 5 minutes later, two other couples came in to order.  I'm not sure what the problem was in the kitchen, but after 40 minutes, all of us (my family and the other 2 parties) were still sitting there waiting.  My husband went to the counter to express his displeasure with the long wait.  The guy at the counter ran into the kitchen to help, and he bagged up our order within a couple of minutes.  We took our food home, only to find 2 out of the 3 meals missing.  I was extremely disappointed to say the least.  My husband returned to the restaurant to show them what they had given us and ask for a refund.  Instead of apologizing, they tried to give us the missing food that had been sitting there for the last 15 minutes.  Everything was horribly cold at that point, so why would we want any of it?  Guess I won't be trying this place again.
