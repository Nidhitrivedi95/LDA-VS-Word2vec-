KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Stay clear of the buffet at a minimum. We ate there yesterday & spent most of the morning in the John. Don't know how long the food keeps sitting out on the buffet line. The chicken in the chicken masala did taste a little off and I just left it after the first bite. Haven't checked with my friends on how they are doing. I feel bad since I took them here.
