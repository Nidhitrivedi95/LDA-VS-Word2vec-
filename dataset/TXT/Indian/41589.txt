Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Fantastic. I was in town and wanted to try someplace new. Did we ever make a great choice. My son and I shared the Tom Yum Soup, Everest Special Beef, Chilli chicken, and  pineapple fried rice ... and the unique veggie spring rolls (think samosa spring rolls) .... everything was phenomenal and you could tell it was cooked to order. To add to the great experience the server was attentive and most personable. Just a great experience.... I wish I lived closer.
