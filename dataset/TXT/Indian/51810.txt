UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I am soo in love with this place!!! If I lived in the area, I know I'd come back all the time! Although their menu is quite large, they offer a useful & effective ordering system - Aside every menu item comes a list of options for how you would like your order prepared (i.e. with or without butter, onions, garlic), what you would like in it (cheese, veggies, chicken, lamb, fish), & the size/ cost (half or full order on some things), etc. with a really cute/ funny description of each dish. Some key symbols you will see throughout the menu are "V" for Vegetarian, "Vn" for Vegan, "G" for Gluten-free, "J" for Jain (w/out onions & garlic), & "N" for nut-related products, as well as "H" for choices that are considered healthy. Although this may not be of concern to some people, I found it to be very helpful & this made it much easier for me to order my food exactly how I wanted it. 
For my dinner, I tried the Vertical Vindaloo w/ Fresh Veggies & Veggie Tikka Masala Curries w/ Paratha. I enjoyed both dishes & was really glad I went with the Paratha instead of the usual Naan since I love Whole Wheat products & wanted to try something different. Also, I love that they carry brown basmati rice & even give you a side of regular white basmati rice when you order curry, as most places I've been to have not done this. But, keep in mind that half orders of curry are probably smaller than you might think, so it's probably best to place full orders since their dishes are so good anyway! In addition to the rice & noodle dishes, soups & salads, & curries, they also have some good-looking dosas & condiments like tomato, mango, or coconut chutney for only 1$ :) 
Our service was very nice & attentive too; We had multiple people check on us throughout our meal & each brought us everything we asked for w/out any problems. I had a really good experience here & can't wait to come back!
