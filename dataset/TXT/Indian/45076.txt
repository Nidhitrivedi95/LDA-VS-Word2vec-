S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA It so nice to write a 5 star review for a Indian restaurant.  People run don't  walk to experience this fantastic restaurant   When you walk in the aroma knocked me over the place is clean comfortable.  And best of all the food and the service were awesome. 
I had the Samosas the beef ones THE BEST IVE EVER HAD!!!
Gopi the manager/server was attentive friendly and over all made my visit like I was eating at his house.  I ordered the chicken Tika Masala 5 stars I ordered it Indian hot it was divine.  The basmati rice was flaky and delicious.  The only odd thing is they charge for the rice ?  Never seen that before. The buttered Naan was made to perfection. Over all I wish I lived here I would be going all the time. Hopefully they will have a family member open up this restaurant in Texas!!!! Great job New IndianGate your a hidden gem !!!
Sincerely Tony!!!
