La_yPXZpdIJINeDEP-THLA I've been here a few times during weekday lunches and have been impressed with the food so far. Each time I come here, I have the lunch special (thali), which comes with naan, rice, a main meat entree, a main vegetable entree, 2 appetizers, some fruit, and a salad. Very filling and very delicious.
