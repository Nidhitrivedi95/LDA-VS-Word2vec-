daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ I couldn't tell you anything about how authentic the Indian food here is as an American, but as an alternative to the standard American fare in the area, and as a vegetarian, I found the food here to be delicious. I was also delighted at the breadth of yogurt dishes and pastries. I'll have a lot of new things to try for the next few months. The servers were also very friendly and accommodating.
