UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I have been to Banjara many times and it never disappoints.  By far the best Indian I have ever had. I've tried many dishes there and all were excellent, with the exception of one dish (a couple of months ago) that I decided to order "hot" thinking I could handle it - it was way too hot and not enjoyable, but not restaurant's fault. 

Overall Banjara is exceptional value for money with authentic ingredients, a great atmosphere and very attentive staff.
