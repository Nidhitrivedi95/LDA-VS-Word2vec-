oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q Nice decor, attentive service and nice size portions at fair prices made this an easy 4 star choice for me. Try the soups here (even the small size will satisfy you) I really enjoyed the spicy chicken and shrimp, and my companion had the Thai Spicy soup. I will definitely be back here.
