My husband and I stuffed ourselves at Swagat and enjoyed every bite of our appetizer and entrees. We will definitely go back.

Swagat had a different style of service. I don't think the same person ever came to our table more than once. It was still prompt and professional service -- just no specific server.

When my husband ordered his entree, the server asked if he would like it spicy. So my husband made the mistake of thinking that he likes spicy foods, so sure, order spicy. He quickly learned that his concept of "spicy" -- which is probably the same idea of "spicy" shared by most Americans -- differs from the authentic Indian cuisine definition of "spicy." 

Just a fair warning: be nice to yourself and enjoy a "mild" entree at Swagat!
