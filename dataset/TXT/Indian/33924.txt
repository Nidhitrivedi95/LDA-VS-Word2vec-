m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew I've been there twice.  The potatoes and the meat dishes were good.  Fresh naan was a constant.

There were some things that were not good at all.  The Saag Paneer had burnt air-filled cheese cubes, and one time they had freezer-burn sherbet as ice cream.

It's not bad, but there are definitely better options out there.
