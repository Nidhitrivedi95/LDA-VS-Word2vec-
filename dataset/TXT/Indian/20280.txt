fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA India's Taste is located in a strange part of town surrounded by industrial stores that you'd never think to find it here. On the inside, the restaurant is fairly large and clean though the buffet area is somewhat small. The food was just okay. The buffet contained some of the normal things you'd see at other Indian buffets, like butter chicken, samosas, cauliflower, etc. In the back, you can see the cook making naan bread. I found it amusing that fried fish was listed under "non-veg snacks". My group also ordered the papri chaat, which some liked, but I thought it wasn't particularly good. It tasted too much like lime and a mix of every spice imaginable. Overall I'm not particularly impressed by India's Taste.
