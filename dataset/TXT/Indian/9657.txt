8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw I really wanted to like Sree's more than I did.  Ray and I stopped in a day or two prior to the G20 summit when downtown was virtually a ghost town (kinda like a weekend day in Pgh, but this was a Wednesday).  It's a small place in a V shaped building with two entrances.  Ray and I walk in for the first time and no one really is in the spot (again G20).  The tables are on both sides of the building facing the wall with paper towels and plastic silverware, hot sauce scattered around.  There is an extremely pleasant indian lady behind the heated trays who greets us warmly with a broad smile and a pleasant demeanor (this is one of the reasons I wanted to rate this place better).  The meals are very cheap at $5 for the chicken curry, rice and another vegetable (think some type of chick pea).  I also appreciate their selection of drinks which includes coconut water.  I kinda had an idea what I was gonna be in for when I looked at the sad bread.  I was expecting roti or naan, but this was cold semi stale pita.  We have a seat and being somewhat of a curry maven I look forward to a flavorful lunch, but sadly the meat is somewhat dry and the curry lacks any real flavor or spice.  The rice is fine and I've already commented on the pita.  The chick pea side had a little more flavor, but still nothing close to good.  The lady was so endearing that I almost gave the place three stars, however the food really was sub par.  I can only imagine they are specifically tailoring this food to the masses who want cheap food and are only dabbling in indian flavors with the tamed down flavor level.  I probably won't go back.
