UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg Stopping in for their lunch buffet ($8.75 with tax), I was a little wary by the emptiness of the place. Other than me, there was only one other couple there, and this was during the peak lunch "rush."

The buffet was laid out with 8 trays on the steam table, 4 vegetarian dishes and 4 chicken dishes, plus one tray of rice and one of "asian noodles". The salad bar had a selection of various spices, including riata. There was also a dessert bar with rice balls and sliced melon.

I placed a portion of rice on my plate as well as a spoon of the chicken curry and chicken chilli, plus something a palak paneer (spinach curry) and later went back for more rice, a piece of chicken tandoori, some chole (garbanzo bean curry) and chicken masala. All were pretty mild on the spice scale, but they had plenty of delicious flavor.

The waiter brough by a basket of fresh naan bread, which was super useful for soaking up the sauce from my plate. He also was great at refilling my water glass and bringing the check.

Would I return? Yes, I think so. It's located in the "back court", so drive around behind Michael's Arts & Crafts store and its at the end.
