MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ The high quality of ingredients has already been mentioned but deserves emphasis. Having ordered lamb dishes once a week for three decades in major cities, this is the only restaurant where I have never had to deal with tough gristly meat. Flavors and breads authentic and fresh. Unfortunately a limited menu, with no Sheek kebab and all the vegetarian dishes served full size (and full price) so not practical to order a variety of veggie dishes.
