DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Went to Sangam twice while visiting the area, and was very happy both times.  I sampled a number of dishes at their lunch buffet as well as the Mulligatawny soup and chicken Saag at dinner.

The food was well spiced (a bit milder at the lunch buffet, but I completely understand that), cooked perfectly, and not sweetened or "Americanized".  The only complaint whatsoever that I have about the food is that it was just a bit salty, but not a big issue.  It was also very fairly priced (especially the $9 buffet), and the service was friendly, professional, and prompt.

I highly recommend, including for those who also like good Indian and Asian foods, and I would certainly go back!
