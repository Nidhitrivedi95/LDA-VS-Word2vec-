RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Service is deplorable. This is high priced Indian food, in a really Nice area of Ballentine and one would expect decent service. Well you won't get decent service here.... I was never quite sure who my actual server was because our table got waited on by three different people, when somebody could be bothered to wait on us.  The staff seem to be more interested in speaking with each other and with customers. The food was decent but still high in price compared to other Indian restaurants in the area, however I don't mind paying a little bit more for fresh food rather than a buffet.  That said, our food was room temperature by the time we finally got and we could never catch servers I just send it back within five minutes after I arrived at our table.  Just a bad experience.
