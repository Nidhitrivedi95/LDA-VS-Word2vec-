iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w Holy shit this is good. 
No menu, super authentic, the owner will talk to you to know your preferences, and cook it fresh. 

Appetizer: 4/5. No idea what it is. Fried mixture of potato and onions with spice sprinkled all over. Good but a bit greasy.

Chicken masala: 4.5/5. Chicken breast, a bit sweet, creamy. 

Chicken kahari: 5/5. Thank god I found this dish. Chicken thigh, full of spice, ground ginger, aromatic. A miracle.

Garlic naan: 4.5.
