0nJgoF9hAi6f2K7XInr1hQ This may very well be the most overpriced restaurant I've been to. The portions are tiny--my chicken kebab appetizer featured two pieces on my kebab; the fish and prawn curry featured three pieces of fish and two prawns for twenty dollars. The food we did get was excellent, but we left hungry. Even the coconut rice pudding servings were scanty--and we're talking bout a cheap dish of milk and rice, here! My husband ordered a pop and was charged for the refill--three dollars each! The decor is nice, the service is good, but for the kind of profit they must be making, it damn well ought to be.
