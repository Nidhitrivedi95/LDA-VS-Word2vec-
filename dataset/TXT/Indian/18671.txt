eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg I Love Indian cuisine and this place was great!  Good buffet for lunch and friendly service.  

I'm a lover of butter chicken and I literally ate like Homer Simpson at a buffet lol ( shows you my age) this and the mango dessert I couldn't get enough of!

They never ran out of food and quickly filled the trays in a timely manner.  This place is worth the drive and you will leave happy.  I did!!!  The buffet is always good to get a sample of different items.  It's also great for vegetarians!
