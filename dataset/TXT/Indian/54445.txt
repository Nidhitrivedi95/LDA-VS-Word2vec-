W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg My family and I ate at Minerva on Sunday, June 21 2015 as part of a Father's Day outing in Madison.  The restaurant came as a recommendation from a co-worker and it didn't disappoint.  
We sampled three dishes, not including naan and rice:  Idli Vada, Chicken Madras, and Bhagara Baigan, none of which are typical Indian restaurant fare.  All choices were delicious but the Chicken Madras was outstanding.  I really appreciated the variety of dishes available, especially since I am not that familiar with Southern Indian cuisine.
Price-wise, I thought dinner was a good value: Around $41 for all the food listed above plus 2 mango lassis.  I am very much looking forward to going for the lunch buffet, especially after reading previous reviews.

Overall:  5 stars for the food and 3.5 for ambiance.  It's location in a strip mall doesn't help but I think they could spruce things up and be attentive of piles of things strewn around.  This didn't really bother me but my family commented on it.  This, in no way, should detract you from visiting for lunch and dinner.  The food, like I said, was outstanding and a great addition to a great food town.
