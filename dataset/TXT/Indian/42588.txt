r9RInq9B_cT1raDM4bNE6Q I've been to hundreds of Indian restaurants in the past 40 years through the world. This was by far the worst.

The bharta was ok but the dry curries smelled and tasted like a barn and as if they'd been sitting on the stovetop for 5 days. 

Neither my guests nor I could eat the food. It was very stale and I questioned its safety since it tasted so old and arrived lukewarm. I've had bacillus cereus from improperly handled Indian food and took charcoal to keep from potentially getting ill again. 

Please go to or order from Bindia if you want Indian. There's a reason this place is so inexpensive.
