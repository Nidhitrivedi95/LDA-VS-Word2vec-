nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA If you are judging Indian restaurants based on their butter chicken, i'm sorry to say you are doing it wrong.

I quite liked Maroli. There are so few choices in the city for Indian food that isn't North Indian in the city, especially downtown.  Maroili serves the sort of Southern Indian food you'd find in Kerela.  They have Chapatti's and Paratha, rather than the Tandoor oven Naan's you find all over the place.  You can also get Appam, which is a rare find in the city. (I like Sri Lankan style Appam much more.) The dishes can be pretty spicy, though you can order them mild if you like. Their Malabar Chicken is pretty good, as fried chicken goes, but my friends and I all enjoyed their mussels dish the best. The stewed Beef Syrian was soft and flavourful. 

The service was excellent. The staff are really friendly.

This place is definitely worth checking out if you want to try something different when it comes to Indian food.
