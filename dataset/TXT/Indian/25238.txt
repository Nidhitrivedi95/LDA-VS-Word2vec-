hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q Staff was very friendly. 5/5 
Ordered my food spicy.  They made a pretty big deal about how hot their food was, seemed average to me.  4/5 Chicken Makhani was solid,  I'm used to a bit more cream / butter in mine to cut the acidness of the tomato, Maybe they mixed it up? 
The basmati rice was super plain.  Again I'm accustomed to a bit of seasoning. 3/5.
Garlic Naan was good, no issues. 5/5
