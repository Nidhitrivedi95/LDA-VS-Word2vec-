QEN53zi2iJAAl3ceR7O68Q I am giving it a 5 star because this place has the best of what they call a bun kabob. It is awesome and the paratha wrap with chicken is awesome.  

The best part of this place?  The owner is a great lady who greets you with a big smile and treats you very well and treats you as if she is your auntie :)  

This place needs to improve on cleanliness.
