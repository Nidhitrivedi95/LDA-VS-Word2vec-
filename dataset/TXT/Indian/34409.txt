MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g Horrible service. We had 3 orders and did not receive one. Waited over an hour and still did not receive our third order after asking the employee several times about it and being told "they will check it out". The food did not taste that great either. We highly recommend Chennai Chettinaad Palace not too far just off of Bell and the I-17.
