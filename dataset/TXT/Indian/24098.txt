GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg The food was very authentic and fresh! I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and I was very pleased. They asked how spicy I would like it, and they made it perfect! My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Biriani , it was very spicy and full of flavor. More Chicken in the Biriani would have been nice next time. The servers are very friendly, I am looking forward to my next visit!
