J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Long time customer ..been a fan for at least 14 or so years. I always went to lunch early when I worked nearby because there were always line ups. Went back for the first time in years and took my 8 and 11 year old the quality of the food is the same they have expanded their space and the service is still quick. The kids and I make the trip down town a few times a year and this is their favorite restaurant. The best thing is the spicy food is spicy and wonderful. The kids are in love with the butter chicken.
