02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Seriously good Indian food. Ordering spice is actually spice. Good blend of spices. Chicken tikka delish! I've had dinner and the buffet - both were very good. Fresh naan brought to your table during buffet. Lots of choices all very tasty. Too bad I live in another state and it will be a very longtime before coming here again.
