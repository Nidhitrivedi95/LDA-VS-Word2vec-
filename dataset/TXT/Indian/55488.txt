x1GM1mzeDx4ARUGKV8n98Q I am so thankful my family and I stopped here on our recent trip to the Scottsdale area. If you see the sign from the main road through Cave Creek, pull over. From the front, it looks like another gift shop, but there sure holds a lot more inside. Wonderful WONDERFUL food! I had the Navajo taco, that is served on Indian fry bread, has deliciously seasoned, tender shredded beef in a savory sauce, pinto beans, shredded lettuce and cheese as well as tomatoes and onions. To die for. We also wanted to try the chili and it was spicy and great as well. My whole family was incredibly happy with what we all ordered. I will definitely make a point to stop here again the next time I am in the area!
