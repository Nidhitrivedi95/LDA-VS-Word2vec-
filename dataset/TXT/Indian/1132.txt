-qdbWrCU8Ktg80dk458BAw Easily one of the tastiest Indian foods I've had.  

What's good: the taste and freshness of the food. Super friendly and courteous staff.  The quantity and prices are not somethin to beat. The stuffed naan (Amritsari kulcha) was absolutely delicious as was the Chat Papri which came recommend by the staff. Very fresh. 

What's there to work on? The food was slightly over salted. Rice wasn't cooked properly. Gordon Ramsay would've been furious. Tiny outdated interior. About 20 years outta date. 

All in all, great discovery via the yelpers. Def go there again!
