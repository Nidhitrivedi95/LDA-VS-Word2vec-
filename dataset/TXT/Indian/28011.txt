IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA As a frequent visitor to the greater Phoenix/Scottsdale area, this is can't miss spot for me.  I have been eating here for about 10 years with no complaints.  I can't find something on the menu I haven't tried and loved.   I wish I liked closer to make this my go-to spot.  

This is a local family owned business, unlike most restaurants nowadays.  The couple works the kitchen and the dining room everyday they are open to bring traditional home cooked meals.  As I spend half my life in airports, it is a refreshing change.  I have spent many hours speaking to them as a solo diner and can't wait to see them next time I am in town.  

Make sure to leave plenty of room as the portions are large and you will want to devour all of it.  The "barg" is actually beef filet that is cut to small pieces, so it is super tender and flavorful.  So while the price might look high, its for top quality meat.  Leave room for Persian ice cream, as it is not like any flavor you have ever tried.  

I routinely bring customers here for dinner because of the inviting atmosphere, great food and excellent service.  I even have many of my customers returning without me and thanking me for introducing them to this restaurant and Persian food.  The only place I know to get better Persian food is in my mom's kitchen... but that is on the other side of the country.    

Stop by and say hello to the owners for me.  If you start a conversation with them, they will treat you like family!
