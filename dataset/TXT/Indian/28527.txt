J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I came here for the lunch buffet. I'd been told it was really great by a friend of a friend. There was a nice amount of variety, more then I'm used to at a buffet, and everything was solid. It also just wasn't great and the price was a bit high. There is so much great Indian food in Toronto, I can't imagine coming back here.
