J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Went for the lunch buffet earlier today, as I was craving Indian food. In terms of size, I've seen some bigger buffets out there, but there are a solid number of selections. Among the offerings were the standard chicken tandoori, plus butter chicken, chicken vindaloo, yellow daal, spinach, chicken and vegetable pakoras, chickpeas, and a number of salad dishes, plus multiple desserts (I enjoyed the gulab jamun and rice pudding) and quite a few chutneys. While many buffets tend to be bland, this one actually had some spicier dishes, which was nice to see. The servers were friendly, and dirty dishes were cleared promptly. They were also good about intercepting a woman who tried to go back up with a dirty plate. Is it the best Indian food I've ever had? No. But it was good, plentiful, and reasonably priced, all served by nice people in a comfortable environment. Perhaps on a food level I'd call it 3.5 stars, but the intangibles make it worthy of rounding up. I'd go back if I were in town again and craving an Indian buffet lunch.
