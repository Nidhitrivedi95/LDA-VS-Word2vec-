gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA I ordered the non-vege Thali which is overpriced, in my opinion at $14.99 for a combo. I got my food and the naan bread had about 2 tsp of oil on top of it, and my chicken tikka masala had only ONE piece of chicken in it! The chicken curry and tikka masala were bland! I was thoroughly disgusted by the whole experience. (Oh, and the guy at the counter mumbled and I could hardly understand him.)
