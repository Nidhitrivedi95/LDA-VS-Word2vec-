8grTRpmD9JYRPWayoLxg0w I am very picky about my indian food so I may be a harder critic than most.    Food is slightly better than okay.  Delivery was quick but the food was lukewarm when delivered, saag panner was a bright green which I have not seen before in a food dish.    Not bad for the price and they deliver which is a huge plus for Indian food.
