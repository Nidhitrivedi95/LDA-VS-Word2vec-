RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg I went to the restaurant with my family to celebrate an occasion but this place absolutely ruined our evening. The first thing we noticed upon entering the restaurant was that the guys working there were gossiping about the multicultural guests sitting in the restaurant. This is quite rude. The entire time we were there, the guy serving us showed a real bad attitude. He acted as if he was doing us a favor. In the end, the guy took plates in a terrible manner even without asking if we were done or if we needed boxes.

The food was OK nothing special and does not represent good Indian cooking. I could go back for the food, if they fire the existing staff with bad attitude or teach them some manners. If I were the owner, I would know who that waiter is.
