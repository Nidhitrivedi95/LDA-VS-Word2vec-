It was highly rated and maybe for non-Indians, this is great. I ordered the rajma, Chawal (rice), vegetarian Manchurian, and garlic naan. Let's start with the rajmah- this didn't have a typical rajma flavor- it's like they just mixed some Indian spices and were like- hey- here it is. Not sure who they were trying to fool. Then the manchurian- it was basically tomato sauce with manchurian and it was so salty I had to ask them to take it back and give me the daal tardka. The dal wasn't bad. The naan didn't even taste fresh- as if it had been sitting for quite some time and reheated but that too only on one side.
