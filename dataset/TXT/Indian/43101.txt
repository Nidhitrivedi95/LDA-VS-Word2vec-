RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Been here now three times. And I am impressed with the fusion food.
Location: Meh. Decor is ok, ambience just above average.  But close to house so go to place on days when wifey isn't cooking.
Staff: Friendly and welcoming. But food takes time to come on the table which can test your patience at times when you are really hungry and all that awesome smell is teasing your taste buds.
Food: We have tried Chicken/goat Dum biryani - it's ok  not that great so we tried 
Chicken/Goat thalipakkatu biryani: very nice, wonderful flavours, meat well cooked and good quantity
Chicken chettinad: nice gravy, good flavour. Try having with chappathi. 
Chicken Schezwan: nice flavour. Good quantity.

All in all, I like this place and is definitely a try if you are a fan of fusion food.
