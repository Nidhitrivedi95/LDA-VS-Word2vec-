zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw This place finds a mention in two travel guides and so my expectations were high. It did not fail me as far as food is concerned but service, interiors and ambience need an overhaul! Kebabs and tikkas are succulent and delicious. Vegetarian side dishes can be asked for in main course portions and they are really good. Baigan bhaji, dal, aloo gobhi in particular. Their snacks (pakora, samosa etc) lack flavour and are best avoided. I would have rated this place higher if their service was better. On more than 2 occasions the waiter brought the wrong order or ignored a special request.
