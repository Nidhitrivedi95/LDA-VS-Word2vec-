DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I tried almost every Indian restaurant in Vegas and finally stuck here. The food is amazing and very classy. I have been there a couple of times and the experience got better every time. I usually get chicken biryani and chicken 65 which I think are very delicious. The dishes here are not over spicy but they will definitely satisfy your palate with the right flavors. Finally, don't forget to ask for a special desert/drink because Chef Manish always has a trick up his sleeve.
