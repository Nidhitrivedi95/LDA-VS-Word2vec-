muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw I've had outstanding food here every time I've ordered... I've only done take-out but I'll be in soon to try Sunday Brunch and the buffet.  Seasonings are on point - fresh ingredients and bright flavors.  Portions are large so I usually get at least two meals out of one takeout order.  Love!
