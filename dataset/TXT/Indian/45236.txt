S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Super impressed with this find. Weekend buffet exceeded my expectations! Our "go to" spot has been cutting back on quality for some time now and I thought it was time to try some place new. So glad I did.
Star of the buffet was the paneer tikka masala. Many layers of spices, butter/ghee, and tomato goodness. The owner's son (I believe) frequently checked on us, refilling our drinks and asking how we liked it. I gushed over the tikka and he told me everything is homemade there, even the sauces they offer - Chutneys. 
You can tell! The paneer cheese had a satisfying chew and creaminess. How is this found on a buffet?? I was impressed. Not only with the buffet spread but the level of care, sincerity and obvious personal investment shown for the restaurant's success.
veg samosas also offered and were quite crispy and delicious, which is not what I'm accustomed to at "other" buffets. Fried food is usually soggy unless you get it within 30 minutes or so of coming out.
I appreciate that both vegetarian and meat options were available and oh, the naan they brought was pretty darn good. Also, chai tea at the buffet. You sweeten yourself. Loved!
This is our new place for great Indian food and service :)
