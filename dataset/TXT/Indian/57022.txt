xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Okay I have come around, the Fry Bread House rocks! maybe I just went on a bad night or something...anyways after a few hours of trekking in the Heard Museum, we became very hungry looking at all of food and more specifically, fried food exhibits. Knowing that this place is Tohono O'odham Nation family owned, it was a no-brainer to stop in here for our fry bread cravings. You can see the women in the back stretching out the dough getting it ready for its hot oil bath.

I recommend you take your time to order because there is so much to choose from. They also want you to shut your trap on your celly while ordering, so please put it away in the name of order accuracy. Why do you have to be so fattening fry bread?? Why??!? Tasty fillings and the  bread itself is slightly chewy without being too chewy, and has a fried, fresh, goodness about it. Try the red cream soda, it ties it all together.
