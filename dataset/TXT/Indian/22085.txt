GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I had the lamb vindaloo and it was very delicious and as indicated SPICY. The waitress was very nice and brought me yogurt to help put out the fire in my mouth!!! :)  He had Beef Masala, which was marvelous. The garlic naan was fantastic. The rice was decent.  We will be going back to try other dishes.
