diXqpz9WOr4WLQq6uvARkg Surprisingly great! I always worry when restaurants try to fusion up Indian food.. Usually it just turns out bland and weird. But Firangi has figured out a great balance. Most of these appetizers ate fusion.. But curries and mains look and taste super authentic. The ambience is probably the best part. Finally you can dress up go out to celebrate something with  Indian food that's not in a dingy unattractive restaurant. Service was good as well. A little off here and there with the water and plates but overall the evening went smooth. 

And omg. That rasmalai tiramisu looked like a piece of heaven. Too bad I'm on no sugar diet right now but I'm so going to go back for that!!
