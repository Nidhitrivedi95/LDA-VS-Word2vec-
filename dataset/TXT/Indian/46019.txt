slUmNbUGPVs_uRpIl4y3YA Before there were several restaurants at the same location but no one did better business than DHABA EXPRESS because of simple reason 'GOOD & FRESH FOOD' at a very REASONABLE PRICE -- i guess thats what we all want. Perfect place for catering and take-outs.
Try their - Butter Chicken, Fish Pakora and Tandoori chicken -- Just love it !!!
Kheer is also delicious to complement your food but only prepared certain days.

What we need is little more smile and one good fresh air fan to throw the curry smell out.
