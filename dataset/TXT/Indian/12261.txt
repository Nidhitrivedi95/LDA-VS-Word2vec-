auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I've been coming here since this place was called Taza, then Jai Ho, and now Taj Palace.  I'm not sure why the name changes but either way the food is always good.  I by no means am an Indian Food expert but my experiences here are always good.  The curries are as spicy as you want them.  The nan is delicious (I love the garlic nan), and the Tandoori chicken is always piping hot and tasty.  

If you're not familiar with Indian food or really hungry, be sure to hit up their lunch buffet.  There are a lot of choices at a very reasonable price.  The servers are also very helpful as I try to order something new on each visit.  Also, be sure to keep an eye out in local publications for coupons and specials!
