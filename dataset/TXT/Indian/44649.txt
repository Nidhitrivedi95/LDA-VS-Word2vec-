S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA My Indian friend recommended this place. Unfortunately, everything I ate there didn't taste good. I had one dish that had this orange sauce with so much cream in it that it made me nauseous. Also, their garlic nan bread was terrible. It was so thick, bready and dry with thick chunks of which tasted like uncooked garlic. I took one bite and tossed them all out. Why is it so hard to find good, flaky nan in the Vegas area??!! The worst thing was that it was ridiculously expensive for two things and nan it was $40. Outrageous! I did get a discount that dropped the priced to $30 something but still it definitely was not worth it.
