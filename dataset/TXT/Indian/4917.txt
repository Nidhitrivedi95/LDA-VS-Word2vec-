2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw My favourite spot for Indian food in the GTA, thus far!
I have tried a good amount of Indian restaurants and Avani certainly tops the list.

The place is always clean and inviting, and their servers are always welcoming and professional.

They do close between lunch and dinner, so make sure to call to make a reservation, always better since they fill up quickly.

They have a window to the bakery/over section, where you'll be sitting on your table, and can see the baker baking those naans fresh into the oven, pretty cool scene!

All their curries and thai dishes are tasty and good
Portions, my all time favourite is the calamari appetizer! I go there just for that sometimes!

Highly recommended
