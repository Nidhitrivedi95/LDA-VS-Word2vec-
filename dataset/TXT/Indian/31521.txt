KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Indian/Pakistani food at it's best.

I knew this place was good when the Taxi drivers were all there at 4 AM.  24-hour service is a big plus.

Since then it has become my go-to place for Pakistani/Indian food.  The combos are plentiful, the options are many and the service is always very friendly and helpful if you are not sure what the dishes are.

I've ordered a-la carte and prices tend to be high - so stay with the combos and order a different one for everybody in your crew and then share to get a taste of everything.

Amazing.  I go back monthly.
