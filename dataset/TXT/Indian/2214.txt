_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA I came here with a friend for dinner because he recommended it and I honestly recommend to everyone else. It was my first time ever experiencing Authentic Indian food and I've grown to love it so much after this one visit. High quality, great ambience, and delicious food. Definitely try out their Samosa you won't be disappointed. Oh, and their chicken xacuti and garlic naan bread! (I'm currently having cravings for these while I'm writing this review lol).
