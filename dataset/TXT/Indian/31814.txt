kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g I will start by saying that for the most part, the food here was uninteresting and bland.  I am by no means an expert on Indian cuisine, but I have spent time in India and eaten my fair share.  And I love Indian food!  This is not close to anything I experienced there.  It seems to be Americanized and I think they are trying to appeal to a broader audience that may not be as familiar with Indian food.

On the positive side, they do have a vegan menu.  But it is strange in that when you choose an entree, you choose a type of rice (white/brown), a sauce (4 to choose from:  masala, korma, spinach (palak), or curry), and what you want with the sauce (lentils, chickpeas, veggies, etc).  I have never seen an Indian menu laid out like this.

The chickpea ceviche was good, and the tamarind-date chutney that was drizzled over it was also good.  The bread that came with the entree was really a tortilla, I don't remember what it was supposed to be.  And as I said before, the entree itself was pretty bland and disappointing.  Won't be coming back, there's plenty of other good options for great Indian food around.
