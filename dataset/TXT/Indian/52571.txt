UXEqtEXs92COE3UiaSx4oA I was there last Sunday for lunch.  I have not been here for 3 years because I moved out of the area.  I had a huge craving for Indian food and the first place I thought of is "The Famous Indian Cuisine".  I can't believe it, same price as 3 years ago.  This is unheard of in today's market.  ($9.95 for lunch and $11.95 for dinner).  The food is excellent and server is very friendly.  Naan bread was freshly made, the buffet was fully stocked.  I ate so much that I could not eat dinner.  Lol.  I love teh Butter chicken, Tandoori Chicken, creamy Spinach, Tofu, Lamb, peas, etc.  All I can say, I love this place.  Great place and great prices.
