_n5gPknmF6_WBrFngFb21w Food was good enough--nothing spectacular... and that's where good stops!  Customer Service is horrendous!  No check back!  Food is not coursed, so they bring it out whenever it is ready.  No wine/beer available.  No seltzer water. They didn't even have coffee available!  Yikes this place almost made me feel like I was eating at home not eating out.  Except if I was eating at home, I would have at least been welcome.  Wait staff not very warm and friendly, you almost feel like your imposing on them!  Again probably won't be back, also just not really a dinner restaurant.
