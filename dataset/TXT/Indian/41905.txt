qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Red Room is a hip-and-happening place great for student group hangouts. This is where I'd come to enjoy a pub night out with super cheap food and drinks. The service was decent--came here for the first time with a group of 10 friends on St.Patty's day, was surprised there was space for us at around 11pm and we got seated pretty quickly. It was quite busy but our food was brought to us in good time. Unfortunately our server was unable to split the bill for us, and there was auto 15% gratuity which we were unaware of, but other than that I'd say Red Room is my new favourite pub.
