ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I consider myself to be a curry aficionado. I grew up in Vancouver, which with its large Indian community, has amazing curries. I lived in London for several years, which has some of the best curry houses out there. I know what good curry is, and Origin just doesn't have it.

Perhaps the fusion menu is somewhat better than the traditional menu, but I was in the mood for curry so I stuck with the traditional. We ordered 4 different dishes, 2 mains and 2 sides. We had a curried lamb shank, a prawn dish, mutter paneer and dal mahkani. 

Let me be clear, the curry was not necessarily bad, it just wasn't that good. Each of the dishes tasted exactly the same, and looked much the same. The food was bathed in some sort of bitter tasting dark-colored gravy. It would have been fine as a stand alone dish, but getting 4 plates of exactly the same flavor/texture just didn't do it for me. 

The other off putting thing about the place was the turn and burn type service. It was rushed even though we had reservations, and it wasn't that busy. The server didn't come back once except to bring the check. Also, the bus boy came to take our plates away 2 mins after being served, and before we had even started on the food! Oh, and it's overpriced too.

I have to say, I am disappointed. I had high hopes after reading my fellow yelpers' reviews. My search for good curry in Vegas continues...
