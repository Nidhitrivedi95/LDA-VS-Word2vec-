uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA we ordered food that took over two hours to be delivered.When it got here,it was cold.The samosa was very salty,the lamb biriani was absolutely disgusting,I only managed two bites before dumping it,the flavour was awful,the meat tasted old,and the rice was clumpy.it all tasted like stale,about to expire food.i also tried the Masala dosa,it was overly spiced,dry and the chutneys they provided tasted so bad.Our entire meal,including starters and soups,as well as entrées,ended up in the trash.
I have eaten south Asian food before and I am familiar with the cooking,this was absolutely the worst food I have had,disgusting,bland and smelly in a bad,not good way,food.i will never eat here and spend over $50 for food that ended up in the trash.we went to McDonald's for dinner.
