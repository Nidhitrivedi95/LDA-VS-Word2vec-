jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg My sexy Indian man (as I like to call him) and I decided to have thanksgiving dinner at this place since I didn't feel like cooking and you can never go wrong with Indian food. 
I ordered the house wine which was NASTY. I bet it comes in the plastic gallon from over at Walmart. 
The lamb and chicken kabobs had 2 tiny pieces of lamb. Samosas were dry and the lamb vindaloo had little lamb and a ton of potatoes. My son enjoyed his chicken tikka which was kind of flavorless, but surprisingly not dry. I give this place 2 starts only because I loved the decor.
