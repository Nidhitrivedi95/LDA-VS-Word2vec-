UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I'm sooooo disappointed in this place.  This used to be my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas, but not after my experience I had tonight.  First of all there were only 4 tables including ours..  I think the waiter came to our table once to take our order and twice for drink orders and that was it!!!  The appetizer took at least 45 minutes.  Never saw our waiter!!  Entrees came (not from waiter) out cold except for one entree..  Couldn't find our waiter to order naan bread.  I took my out of town guest there for his Birthday and was embarrassed.  I don't know what's going on, but this place is going downhill..  Even then seats in ALL the booths are ripped up, the tables need to be cleaned or replaced.  I ask for Chris the owner to talk to him with my concerns and he wasn't there.  I really hope he pays attention to these reviews and tries to correct the problems.  The service needs the most help.  Good luck.
