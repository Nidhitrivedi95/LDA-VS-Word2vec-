-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Weekends can be a little busy and require some waiting. Although, the turnover is real fast. The food is stupendous and reasonably priced. Adequate space but nothing fancy in terms of decor. The food speaks for itself. The waiters are polite and responsive to customer requests. The food is authentic South Indian and there is a big variety to choose from. Would recommend the South Indian cuisine here rather than North Indian.
