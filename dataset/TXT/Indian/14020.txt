Cosy is the first word that comes to mind, the place is tiny, but beautifully decorated with wall hangings and there is colour everywhere. It only has a few tables, but thankfully I've never had a problem getting a seat.

If you're looking for an Indian Restaurant that serves curries and all the trimmings, then this isn't for you; if you're looking for somewhere that serves everyday authentic Indian food, then get here pronto!
My particular favourite is the chicken roti roll, with copious amounts of chai, but everything I've ever tried has been lovely! While I've never had it, friends have raved about the mango cheesecake.

It's cheap, it's certainly cheerful (there's often Bollywood movies playing in the background) and the food is great. What's not to love?!
