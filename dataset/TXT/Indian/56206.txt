XNL6PRXaQxyDO2yeBdy11w Our friend Aron recommended this little place that is just a few blocks from our home, so we gave it a shot.
Walked in at 11:30 am on a Saturday.    It was empty except for one man in the restaurant who was busy on the phone.   We stood awkwardly for about two minutes in front of him until he finally said, "Yes?"
He didn't even bother to take the phone away from his ear.
We said we'd like to order Repas Royal for 2 (dal soup, tandoori chicken, poulet tikka, seekh kebab,  tandoori shrimp, lamb curry, vegetables, naan bread, rice  and Gulab Jamon for dessert) and an order of onion bhaji, all for takeout.
He said it would take at least 40 minutes.
We asked about delivery, he said it would cost $4.00 and would take longer to arrive at our home because he had to call the guy.    Ugh, ok.    We decided to order, go somewhere for a coffee and come back to pick it up.     He never put down the phone the entire time we were there.
  
Fast forward 45 minutes.....the restaurant is still completely empty.    No sign of the man on the phone.   We wait.
He finally shows up with the food in bags.    $46.00 for lunch which we take home.
The food.....VERY small portions.     Soup was just ok.   Everything tasted the exact same, which we found so strange.    
We never received the seekh kebab but we didn't want to go back so we just took it as a loss.
Vegetables were a mix of fresh and frozen cooked together.    
Shrimp was frozen, so was the meat - they defrost it in warm sauce once an order comes in.    
Onion bhaji was greasy and mostly batter.
The one high spot was the naan bread - it was very good.

We're huge fans of Indian food and being in NDG, we are spoiled for choice.
We won't choose this place again.    We'll stick with Maison India or Ganges on Sherbrooke.
