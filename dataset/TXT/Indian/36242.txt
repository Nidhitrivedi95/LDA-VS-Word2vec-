NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ Came here on Yelp's recommendation and we were not disappointed. We had the mix-started with a variety of pakora, lamb and salad. Everything spiced and balanced perfectly. For our entree's, we shared the Butter Chicken and Saag Paneer along with rice and naan. Everything was absolutely outstanding - among the best I've had!
