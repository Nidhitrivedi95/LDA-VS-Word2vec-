I have been here many times, for buffet and dinner. If you order Nothern Indian Food, its GREAT. Southern Indian Food is NOT that great, don't order any Biriyani...what I had was certainly not worthy of being called Biryani :). Dosa for lunch buffet was ok.

Very Spacious, good for conversations and privacy. Nice and tasteful Interiors. Looks new and very clean.

Apart from food, I like the songs bollywood songs playing in the background which I dont get to listen a lot these days.

The owner is a very hospitable person, hence this review :)

The bad:
If you go alone, it can be a little expensive, they just raised the prices by a dollar for everything :(. All the times I have been there, there isn't much crowd and so for people who enjoy, people watching, not the best option, but if you like quiet and private kind of evening, its great.

Would have liked more TVs. 

Overall, its worth a try and a great option
