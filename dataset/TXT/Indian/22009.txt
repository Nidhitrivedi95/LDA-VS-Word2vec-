GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Tandoori Times has a number of locations here in the valley and I've had the good fortune of eating at this one and the one located off of I-17 & Cactus.

I've eaten at this location at least 10 times as it's one of my wife's favorite restaurants.  We went on a Thursday night and walked in with a Groupon which they readily accepted.

One of the positives is that they have a full bar and a very nice wine list which my wife appreciates.  I like the full bar in case I want an old fashioned as I'm not much of a wine drinker.

I ordered the lamb vindaloo and the Princess ordered the chicken vindaloo.  The dinner portions are really family style with enough food for a couple of people so needless to say, we went home with leftovers.  It sure didn't hurt my feelings to have to scarf that down for lunch the next day.  The basmati rice is terrific, a little saffron and other spices and it's perfect with the vindaloo over the top of it.

The meal comes with naan and I love naan.  We buy it at Costco just to have around the house.  The naan here is a whole different level than what I pull out of that bag, let me tell you!  Soft, light, and perfectly toasted.  We upgraded to the chili naan which has green chilies sprinkled all over it.  It's awesome, definitely worth the next $1 or whatever it is.

Finished the meal with dessert, (surprise, surprise).  Went with the rice pudding which is of a much lighter consistency that what I would say most Americans are used to. It was very good, perfect way to end the meal and cleanse my palate, which is my argument for always having dessert .  It has the same flavor components as typical rice pudding, cinnamon, raisins, a little nutmeg, just not with the custard-like consistence.

They seem to be gradually upgrading the restaurant with new paint and decorations; it's a very comfortable restaurant with consistently good service.

I think you'll like it.
