9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw Absolutely my favorite place to eat! I like this location because there's more space, with the same great food. Everything I've tried I love, the flavors make me do a happy dance in my seat... seriously. The self serve beer and wine bar is a fun thing to mess with, I really liked the selections I tried. It's really a great place with great food, I can't wait to go back!
