Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw This place has one of best tasting food in phoenix area much better than many big Indian restaurants. I have a travel job so buy food from them every week 2-3 times (Travel from different city). Even the people in the restaurant are nice and welcoming. There paneer tikka masala and navratan korma a very good (I take to go food- No buffet food, so can't say about that) Good Job keep it up.
