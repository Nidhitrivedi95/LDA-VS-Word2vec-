VmHGm_FNSZBjnolJ9f7Svg Best steak tartare I've ever had; pretty lady recommended the Beef Italien; line was out to the door but they serve fast; beef Italien was a great take, the Parmesan cheese went well with the mix; the freshness and quality of the beef used was evident, like a fresh wild blue fin tuna , potato chips were freshly fried which was refreshing ; this small restaurant is a great concept; a lot of business people ordered the Japanese salmon
