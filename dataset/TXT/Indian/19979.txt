FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I used to dislike Indian food so the first handful of times I came here for the buffet, I hated it. Now Mirch Masala has changed the game and gotten me into Indian food. I'd chose Mirch Masala over the Maharani any time, but this is my backup.

Their food is really solid. There's been a few hiccups with my delivery that has ticked me off, but not enough to not order from them.

The butter chicken, samosas, garlic naan, and Chef's Special naan are my go to. I also get keema naan, but I'm not really a fan of it from here. My boyfriend still loves it so maybe it's just me.

I'd definitely say give it a go if you're looking for a solid Indian restaurant. If you want the best, go to Mirch Masala.
