li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ If you are looking for a fresh change of pace then Hurry 4 Curry is the place for you. I didn't know much about Indian food. Probably still don't know much more today....but I can say that I have eaten here several times and never have been disappointed. New Slick modern place, friendly staff, quick service all help make the place worthy of the visit. The food is outstanding. One of the things I like best is that the menu is changing all the time. There are new manager specials every time I visit. Now when I order I just go for the special....it hits the spot every time. I hope everyone gets a chance to discover this place. Downtown needs new creative places like this and this place makes Downtown PHX just a bit more interesting and lively. 
I cant wait for my next meal!
