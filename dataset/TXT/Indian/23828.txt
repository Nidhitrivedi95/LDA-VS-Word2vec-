gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This place may have tasty Indian food but somehow I felt bloated all day after eating here. Maybe because of baking soda in the bread. I remember hostel messes in India doing that to keep people from eating too much??? I agree with some of the reviewers here that the Owner/waiter needs to have an attitude makeover. He scowls if people ask for another round of nans.Thankfully his cellphone did not go off while we were there...And rice pudding as a desert! I can't remember when a Indian resturant got away with pulling that stunt off. India has so many wonderful deserts and surely rice pudding is somewhere down at the bottom of that list....If you have to eat Indian in LV, maybe this would be my recommendation just because others are worse (Mint-ok, Origin-terrible)
