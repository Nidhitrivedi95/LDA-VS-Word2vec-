Cozy restaurant with flavorful Indian and Nepali food. Perfect mix between fine and casual dining -- the food is good but definitely does not taste home cooked.. It is more fine dining oriented. We ordered the butter chicken, normal naan, garlic naan , khadhahi paneer,chai, gulab jamun and ghajar ka halva (carrot halva). The butter chicken was flavorful and you could taste the cardamom !! Everything was very good. The Gulab jamun was exceptionally good and one of the best I have had. There was ice cream on the gulab jamun which I was not a fan of.. But it was so good without the ice cream!! 

Recommend this for a great dining experience in regards to food!Service was good but a bit slow and nothing too memorable.
