TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Come here for good, authentic Indian curry! I've only ever gotten their curries and tandoori chicken and they are simply one of the best in town. Even though there are a few on the west side of town, I always willingly and happily drive from summerlin all the way across town to eat at Cafe India. 

Their curries are flavorful, well-balanced and have morsels of tender meat - everything I look for in a curry. There have been a few times they didn't quite get the spice level right but they are more than willing to bring you additional hot peppers or even take it back to the kitchen. The tandoori chicken is simply heavenly, very juicy and soft. Just beware that if you do have it during their fabulous lunch buffet hours that it might be a tad drier than if you order it as an dinner entree.

And have I mentioned how great their lunch buffet is? $10 (I believe) and you get mango custard, lamb vindaloo (sometimes) and that spinach one that I really like.... and chicken marsala, tandoori chicken, naan, rice etc. Basically there's going to be more than what you can eat!

Their only downfall is their inconsistent service. Now it's not bad, but sometimes they can come off as brisk or they get very busy and it takes a while to be noticed. However, whenever that happens, their manager always noticed and would make amends, which makes it alright in my eyes. Besides, it's an indian restaurant and I'm sitting back, relaxing and not expecting things to be done as quickly as an American restaurant. When in Rome, do as Romans do!
