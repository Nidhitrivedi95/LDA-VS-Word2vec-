j3YSK-IgpNabCIzWEl7CaA So we finally went here for a late Saturday lunch. The Indian that I am, I get over excited when I see an Indian restaurant serve Bombay food, some change from the tacky South Indian - North Indian cuisine.

I ordered a Masala Dosa, my boyfriend ordered the Thali (Lunch / Dinner deal) with two non-vegetarian entrees (he's getting acquainted with Indian food for my sake :) ) and we ordered a wada paav between us because that's how I judge the quality and credibility of anything that claims to be "Bombay special." Yes, they passed the wada paav test. It was some delicious wada paav. So delicious that we ordered some more to go. The masala dosa was okay. The potato bhaaji inside wasn't anything to write home about, and the dosa was not crispy although it was huge. The coconut chutney was really good though. My boyfriend's thali had palak (spinach) chicken and achari chicken. He loved the achari chicken and I thought the palak chicken was just as good.

The good thing about this place is that they have a little grocery department. Nothing to compare to Patel Brothers, but it has all the basic stuff you'd need so we got to do our Indian groceries while they made our order of wada paav. This place is known for their sweets and savory snacks (most Indian grocery stores carry their items for sale) but with all that food we were too full to even look at the sweets cases.
