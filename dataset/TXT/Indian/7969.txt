72KojSHoxp8DissRtcXn-g Fantastic! We went on a Saturday night... extremely busy. We had reservations at 8pm and were seating around 8:30pm. We didn't mind the wait cuz we were able to sit at the bar and enjoy our drinks. 

Once seated were we greeted promptly and were informed of the daily specials. The restaurant was so busy but, our waitress was wonderful and didn't make us feel rushed at all 

We order the nachos... OMG! The lamb kabob.. the mac n cheese.. chicken lollipops and chicken tikka masala. Everything was beyond fantastic! 

Very excited to visit this restaurant again!
