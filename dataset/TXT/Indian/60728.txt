zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Was our first time trying afghani food so we tried all the recommended and traditional dishes.  The service was great, didn't know quite what to expect.  We less flavorful than Pakistani or Indian cuisine, and did not like their traditional dumplings.  Felt the rice with raisins and carrots was a bit strange.  Perhaps afghani food is not our thing if this is a representative of great afghani food based on the reviews.  Won't be back.
