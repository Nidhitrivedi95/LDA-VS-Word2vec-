The menu has the usual dishes plus a few specials, and all the meals are reasonably priced.
I think the place only holds about 25 people but its not cramped.
The staff are always polite and friendly and even took the time to take my son through some of the more exotic dishes on the menu.
I've always come out feeling full and satisfied and not with a big hole in my wallet
