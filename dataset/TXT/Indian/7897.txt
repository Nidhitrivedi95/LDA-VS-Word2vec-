6P4ZzCdd_YQqncnQv1jplQ We now call it the Haweli Clense!

The atmosphere was desolate, the food smelled a little fishie (even though we didn't have fish).  Staff was nice though:)

We ordered vegetable korma and it did not even resemble a Korma.  It seemed to have frozen vegetables in it.  The beef kabob was unrecognizable.  The chicken dish whatever it was (I have tried to block it out of my mind and insides;/)  was disgusting.  The nan was so tough it would pull out my Granny's teeth!

We all ate a few bites and left.  But the amount we all ate was enough to keep us home bound the next day.

Skip this place unless you have time to sit home:)
