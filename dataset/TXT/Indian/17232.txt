DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I ordered pickup and ask the receptionist on phone what is good in meat dishes she said roghan josh so I ordered that , and dum biryani and butter naan. I told her spice level 8 which means hot but food was not at all spicy. Good was well cooked but portion size was small so biryani compare to other Indian Resturant's portion was small . And food was not at all spicy. They prepared food fast . But I my self a good cook so this food was not for me. Good for ppl who like non spicy Indian food.
