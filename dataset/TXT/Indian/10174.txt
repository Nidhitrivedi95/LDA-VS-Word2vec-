9MpWhQOYziJ38EB7MctxcA I must admit, of all the ethnic cuisines I've tried, Indian is probably the one I'm most ignorant with. The service was extremely pleasant and the food was delicious.  We had the vegetable smosas for appetizer which were great and very flavorful.  I was in the mood for a Beryani dish.  The person I was with tried a vegetarian cheese dish with a tomato/curry sauce (forgive me as I cannot remember the name).  She said it was fantastic as well.  I gave five stars because I am unfamiliar with Indian cuisine and eating here gave me more of a reason to expand my palate with it.
