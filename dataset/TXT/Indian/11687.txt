AnvJqvwBOUlrYgrcubr0nw The Spice Lounge Kitchen is in a restaurant desert. Slap bang in the middle of a residential area, you'd think that it's got no chance and would be constantly empty; it's not the first place to think of when you fancy some grub. However, despite its odd location I've visited twice and both times it was packed.  

The food is not the Indian that everyone knows and loves. Gone are the kormas, tikka masalas and vindaloos, replaced instead with popular traditional Indian dishes cooked from scratch by the chefs. 

A big favourite is the butter chicken, and I've also really enjoyed a lentil daal. The food is light and full of flavour. Portion sizes are not enormous, but they are perfect to fill a hungry tummy. Garlic naan breads are freshly baked and taste wonderful, and rice is fluffy and nomtastic. 

Service is also good. Maybe a bit too good actually, as waiters frequently pop over to ask if your meal is okay. One waiter made the comment that chefs will prepare any meal that you ask for if the menu isn't to your taste and you just can't go without a balti. 

It looks like SLK is happy to bend over backwards for its customers, and this, coupled with a really decent curry, is probably why it's so busy!
