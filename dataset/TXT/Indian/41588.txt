Q1jycPoMbhAWezkZs1e2Zg Wandered in here on a whim after a failed attempt to get dinner at another place near it and boy, was I floored! The decor is absolutely stunning and the atmosphere is decidedly upscale and classy. We were greeted by a lovely woman (who later identified herself as the wife of the owner) who was incredibly warm and attentive to our table all evening. 

The menu features a good mix of Thai and Indian dishes. All of them sounded so good that it was difficult to make a decision. In the end, we decided on the Mintleaf Special for a starter, the Gaeng Keow Warn and the Panang. All of them were extraordinary. By far, some of the best Asian food I've found in Edinburgh. Make sure to try the coconut rice. As someone who is not a huge fan of rice, this stuff might be my new favourite thing. It's so sticky and creamy. 

For anyone looking for a beautiful space to have a meal or event at, I would highly recommend Mintleaf. I'll definitely be back!
