cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw Awesome Pakistani/ Indian food- it was very tasty and filling. I love how the kabobs and chicken cutlets were sizzling when they came to our table. 

The service was very good and attentive. 

I would give it five stars, but the locations is not in a good area of Mississauga, and the restaurant, although decent, could be a little cleaner and have more personality.
