Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Have been a visiting this restaurant once every few weeks or so for several years. Over the last 6 months, I started seeing that some staff changed, more importantly, attitude and arrogance has snuck in. 

Last night's experience made sure that I will never visit this place again and would never recommend Tamba to any visitors to Las Vegas. Main issues that they have:

1) Extremely arrogant staff that leads to Horrible service and also wrong dishes being served.
2) Very poor quality of food. One out of 3 dishes we ordered had double salt in it!! When questioned about these, their answer is: Sometimes these things happen.

Long story short, AVOID this place if you want to be treated well for the price you pay!! Not a wallet friendly place....Nickel and dime you for everything....
