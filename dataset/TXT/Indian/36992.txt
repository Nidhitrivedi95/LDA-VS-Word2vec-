o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Finally!!  We are wintering 'Snow Birds' coming from WA State and have sorely missed good Indian food in our West Valley location. We had Chicken Tikka Masala; Channa Masala; Lamb Chops; Saffron Briyani and Garlic Naan. Oh yum---every dish perfect--we ordered a lot to try and took much home to enjoy later. I am now totally satisfied with our restaurant selections nearby.
