0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Kohinoor is one of the few places that I have seen that actually serve dinner buffets.  They have a large variety of options, which is great.  The naan is fresh and toasty right out of the oven, and the food is well seasoned across the board.

The owner was really nice to me and gave me some extra sweets to go as a trial for my first time.  Unlike most buffets that have 1-2 common desserts, they have quite a variety of choices if you are into Indian Sweets.

The people working are extremely nice and have a great sense of humor as well.
