2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Big fan of this place. Its a stone's throw from my place and the dishes are absolutely delicious. I've gotten a few of the chicken dishes and have liked all of them - not sure if you can really go wrong with any particular one. The portions are quite generous for the price and I often split it into half and eat it over two separate meals with rice. Good value!
