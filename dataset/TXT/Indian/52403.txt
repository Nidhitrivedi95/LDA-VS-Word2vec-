uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA Service is horrible.  It's a take out place but a lot of items have to be made fresh... I don't mind if it's at a timely manner but 30 mins wait for naan bread is ridiculous.  Ordered fried noodles another time and the same thing!  Other than the curry their fried noodles aren't tasty at all.
