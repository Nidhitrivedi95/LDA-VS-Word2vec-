RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Probably 'the cleanest' Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Their presentation is immaculate, and their decor is friendly and inviting.  The pakora offerings here are some of the best for hundreds of miles-- it's a yellowish breading, that's light, not that dark brown usual fried offering.  Many of their dishes are great, and they have a good chutney.  They've been in business more than 20 years and the people who own it are so nice!  So glad they recovered from a kitchen fire a few years back.  It just keeps getting better and better.
