8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Since I was coming down from Chicago for a friend's birthday dinner here; I read the reviews and anticipated a long wait. What I didn't anticipate was that the Thali plate option was only for lunch, so I was bummed I couldn't sample more for a dinner portion. I had samosas to kill the wait time and they were definitely delicious. Literally the only reason for the one star. I ordered chicken aloo for my entree and my chicken pieces were pretty big; but also not cooked through. I ate the potatoes from my dish because I was with a large party and already the last person to get my meal. Our meals came out staggered throughout about 6 drop offs along with constant clarification of what was still missing and about an hour wait time from order to table. Lastly, while packing up to leave we saw a cockroach climbing through the napkins in the napkin holder on the table next to us. I paid for my meal and tipped for service but will not be returning to this establishment ever again.
