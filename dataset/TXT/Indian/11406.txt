afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w Sri Lanka formerly known as Ceylon lies off the Southern Coast of India. Unsurprisingly it has a number of different influences ranging from Indian to the various traders who have passed through. The food is similar in some ways to Indian food, as it tends to use cardmom, cumin, turmeric. However there are differences in the actual ingredients such as the fishes they use.

The funniest thing about the Country that I have always found, is that the first introduction to Sri Lanka that Indians have is through the story of Ramayan. In which a demon king from the country comes and steals the main protagonists wife, and they go to war. Beyond that the country has a pretty rich history, but I'm not going to go into the politics of it here.

I myself haven't seen a lot of this type of cuisine, usually the food tends to be pervasively South Indian rather than from Sri. Lanka. I like the food here well enough, the hoppers are pretty decent, though we got an odd fish smell from some of the rice. The food is usually spiced pretty well. 

The hoppers were the best I have had anywhere though. I don't know if they were cooked right because I don't have a lot of experience with them, but they tasted pretty good. 

The service I have found has been generally decent.

The restaurant itself is a kind of smallish place which generally seems to be clean.
