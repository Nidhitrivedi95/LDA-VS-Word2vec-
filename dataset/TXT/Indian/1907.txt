-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ Excellent! Very authentic and amazing in flavor. Butter chicken is outstanding. Very good non bread. It is not a fancy restaurant where you can have a romantic dinner, but if you are looking for a good ethnic food and do not mind to drive to Brampton, this is a place to go. It will totally redefine your experience and attitude to Indian cuisines. There is no  restaurant in downtown Toronto, North York, Richmond Hill or Scarborough that has such a good food and fair value. Highly recommend!
