fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Had another visit yesterday. Was I satisfied? 
I have a very sensitive stomach and don't do very good with onions( I wish I can kill all the onions in the world)
Sure, my stomach was a little upset yesterday but that doesn't stop me from coming here because 
Great service
Cost - $3x for 2 people dinner buffet
Taste - it's a taste of India all right
Vegetarian option

Hopefully I can train my stomach to eat like Yelp Elite Alice W. xox
