Service was excellent! their prices are reasonable and it's a place that has a menu full of interesting bites. 

For food we had:
**Tuna tartar puri 3.5/5, lack of tuna.
**Pakora frites 4.5/5 not oily, well presentable, perfect for sharing.
**Cassava bravas 4.5/5 
**Grilled cauliflower 4/5 simple but yet packed with buttery flavors.
**Khao shay 5/5 
**Chicken and beef tacos 5/5 was delicious but would have preferred if they incorporated a hint of Indian twist...perhaps butter chicken or tandoori flavoring....this was a deal breaker as this dish had a lot of potential....tacos seems more Mexican and lacked Rickshaw's emphasis.
