2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg Love this place enough to give it 5 Stars despite a slight on again off again language barrier  w/ the gentleman who has always greeted us kindly and seated us at the same table, each of the 6 or 7 times we've been here (a barrier which mostly comes into play when I say HOT and he insists MILD).  

Only done the buffet once, but it was affordable and I was pretty surprised at the variety they offered and how well marked it was, especially when it came to vegetarian vs non-vegetarian dishes.  

Not sure what everyone is complaining about, re: the service (that goes for my boyfriend, as well).  If you've been to anything other than buffet hour dining, you know the service at Indian restaurants is somewhat relaxed, and this place is no different.  The aforementioned gentleman takes your order and then leaves you to your party.  He's never failed to keep our waters full, and despite making themselves more scarce than traditionally bothersome American servers, he and/or the demure lady (who brings our steamy, delicious food in a timely manner) always have a watchful eye on the dining room.  

Only very slightly pricey, one could judge the portions of some things small, I guess, but not the main dishes.  There is always more than half left over, despite that we're two bearded bear-types w/ voracious appetites.  Mango lassi is pretty good.  Food is great.  

Wheelchair friendly w/ accessible parking on the east side of the building. 

Please keep this place in business.
