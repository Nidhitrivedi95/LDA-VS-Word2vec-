ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw If there is a single phrase to describe this place it's "a bit too" : dimly lit, much vinegar in the chicken tikka "caesar" salad dressing, expensive. 

The service is gracious, my curry lamb stir fry entree was excellent, and it was served with rice - the poppy seeds are a nice touch. The actual chicken in the salad was delicious and tender, but the "caesar" part is taken too literally, and definitely more than a "take"- note: nobody actually wants to pay good money for a standard caesar salad.   Although, I would have liked some naan bread to go with it but I did not think it too fitting to pay for an additional item for a meal that already totaled more than $30 when my purpose is to dine, catch up on the news in the paper, and go.  On that note, it's probably a decent place for a date what with the mood lighting, attentive service, and attractive setting.
