zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q If you have been reading reviews about how spicy their food is, prepare to be underwhelmed. But, it could just be because I am used to eating a lot of hot spices. 
Beyond that, their service is great! In my opinion Their Chicken tikka masala is about good and flavorful but nothing to write home about. Their biryani is okay. It seemed to lack consistency in flavor between the chicken and the rice. The owner asked me how spicy I wanted it. I told them as hot as they can make it. She asked if I was sure and I said aboseffilutely! I was extremely disappointed when I didn't even break a sweat :(

Their Nihari however is a completely different story. How different you say..? Well, it is downright top notch! Spicy, tons of flavor and all around consistency in thickness. If you are in the Phoenix area and grew up in the subcontinent eating nihair then let me tell you that the next place to get it would be your grandma's dusty old kitchen back home. I have not had it this good even in Houston, Dallas or the desi infused parts of California.
I triple highly recommend it!

For dessert I saw that they had gulab jamun on the menu. People who know me and my bloating love handles know how I cannot ever pass these things up. I asked the waitress if she recommended it and she said no. Being the stubborn bastard I am I ordered it any way. Boy was she ever right. Their Firni is much better and I'd go for that in a heartbeat if I were you.
