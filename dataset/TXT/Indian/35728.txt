n2uhwMwM9mGz-8eMSEeqTg If you live in Georgetown and get serious butter chicken cravings like I do, just go here. One could definitely argue that it's a little pricy compared to its Brampton competitors, but their naans are super good, their butter chicken is up to standard, and the staff is friendly. One complaint is that the wait time can drag sometimes and several times they have done a poor job bringing everything out at the same. I once recieved my butter chicken a good 10 minutes before receiving anything to eat with it (rice, naan). Also their samosas are sometimes still cold in the center. That aside I do love eating here. Great portion sizes too.
