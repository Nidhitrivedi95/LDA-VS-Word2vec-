yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw We started eating here last year & we were very impressed with the service & the food.  Since then, I feel like the service is somewhat lack luster, refusing to allow coupons to be used on the take out orders and insisting they have a credit card number when you phone something in.  We used to be able to order special requests, but not now.

The flavors of the food are good, but the portion size in relation to the price is small.  The chicken is usually over done & not the best cuts of meat, but because the sauces are so vibrant, it's easy to hide from some.

Rice & Naan are separate, which is disappointing.

The atmosphere is nice & not tacky like many other indian restaurants.
