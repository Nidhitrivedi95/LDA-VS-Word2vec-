2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Best samosas I've tried in Scarborough and with 5 for a damn loonie you can't go wrong. Anytime I want something quick and filling to eat late, I just make a quick stop here cuz they're open till 11pm and get my samosa fix. I don't know about everybody else but when I buy mines they are always hot and fresh. Get their spring rolls too, it's also 5 for a loonie! I always get $3 samosas and $1 spring rolls. Comes up to $4.20. And get their tamarind sauce on the side too, think it's like 55¢. Only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is the lineup is always so damn long and the workers move like snails, they're so damn slow yo.
