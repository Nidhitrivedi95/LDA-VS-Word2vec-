e8_Xt-ldpDgWHn92s3rBaQ This was a disaster. I love indian food & tried many indian restaurants in different states, but this was my worst experience. I ordered a chicken masala & it was tasteless! I also ordered raita & it was horrible. If u still wanna go try ur luck with Biryani but Im definitely not going here again!!
