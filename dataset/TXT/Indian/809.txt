This is a very clean, spacious and modern Indian market.  They are well-stocked with all of the usual things (spices, pulses, frozen foods, pickles, biscuits, etc).  Their produce section is inviting and well laid out with those little water sprayers above that keep the vegetables fresh.  

There's also a deli counter with hot snacks and sweets, attended by very sweet ladies who also prepare all the foods.  The veg pakoras were really nice, also the besan ka ladoo (a subtle sweet flavored by cashew, so yummy!).  

Finally, it was satisfying to see the modern cash register with its big screen where you can keep tabs on all of the prices as they ring up.  It irks me in other small markets where you just kind of have to trust the cashier to not make mistakes.  A big thank you to my fellow Yelpers for helping me find this great place!
