OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Provided I could give more than 5 stars for this restaurant I would do that, the food was soooo tasty, we were lucky to talk to the chef Nityananda and he was too courteous to understand our taste and make us customized food outside the menu.

We had rasam, rice and gobi sabji which was delicious and mouth watering. I remembered the home food which we will in India ...
