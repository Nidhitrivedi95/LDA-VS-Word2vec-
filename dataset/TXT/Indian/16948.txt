DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Tried a neighborhood restaurant for their lunch specials.  They have vegetarian options and chicken and lamb as well.  For an appetizer we tried Gobi Munchurian, a deep fried cauliflower in sauce and then chicken Tikka Masala and Korma.  Lunch included rice and naan.  I was very happy with the portions and they ask what spice level too.
