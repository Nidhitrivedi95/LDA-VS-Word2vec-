Guys, I got a take out container (stuffed with 3 different variations of vegetarian curries. I also ordered 10 amazingly delicious samosas and 2 roti. Grand total? $6.50 after tax. I can eat for 3 days for that!

The food is delicious. The wait can be long but I truthfully don't understand how the hell they can stay in business for that price. If the quality of the food was poor then I'd certainly understand. But it's delicious and I mean really delicious. 

Kudos to these guys for making awesome food, for stupidly cheap prices and making an amazing living off of it. I will be back and back and back again.
