jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q 5 flying stars for this restaurant. Iam so happy I dined here today. Food was awesome. Each dish had different aromatic flavors. Service was good too. My glass was never got to half empty.     

I had veg samosa, chicken karahi,chic tikka marsala,, garlic naan.. And taj large Indian beer.so good.

And they have great view of the airport..landings and taking off.. Totally worth of every penny. I will bring my family next time.
