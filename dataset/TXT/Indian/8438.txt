7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ My husband loves Indian food. It is a cuisine he got accustomed to during his business trips to Dubai. we were very excited when we found this restaurant in the Balantyne area.
The menu looked very promising , It has a wide variety of items. we ordered, the assorted vegetable platter for appetizer and for entrée , the choice was the Shrimp Tandoori and the shrimp Biryani. Surprisingly, we got the Shrimp Tandoori ( entrée ) before the appetizer. In a way that was good because it was the only plate we enjoyed. The rest was a disaster, The appetizer was mainly a combination Jalapeno peppers and onions dipped in dough and fried.  It lacked any taste  so we barely touched any of it. 
The Shrimp Biryani is described on the menu as ( unique Shrimp Beryani cooked in dum style garden fresh vegetables with basmati rice) . Yet, when we got it , It was mainly rice topped with onions. I don't know what happened to the vegetables mentioned on the menu. On top of that, it was so spicy, we couldn't eat it. We made sure to tell the waiter when we placed the order that we like everything mild and not spicy. That is for the food. As far as the service, the waiter did is best but he seemed overwhelmed.
After all, it was a bad experience and a waste of money. We definitely will  not go back.
