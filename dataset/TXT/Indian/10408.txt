9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g I love food. I travel for food. I am here from USA.  This place looks upscale. I ordered chicken and veg for entire family. We were super hungry so eating anything can taste good. However, my senses were pretty open to taste of this so called yummy food. Just disappointed chicken taste. It has some heavy flavor to it. Gravy was not good at all. Sourrrrrr. 
 
Now for veg. I had ordered malai Kofta. Well, they had put in cheese balls and once again sour grevy. Not the same malai kofta you would be used to.

Papadam was not in stock and couple other items were out of stock. Wow. Really.....  

No white rice is served with your order like normal restaurant. I get it that it's unique restaurant. However being Indian you would expect that to part of your true indian meal. 

I would give 4 star to their biryani as it was pretty tasty. 

Decore is nice and some musician singing Indian gazals and bollywood songs made the night little better.
