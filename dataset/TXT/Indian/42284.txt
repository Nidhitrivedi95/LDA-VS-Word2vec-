QMB3hmb_Yv6Vk-HLiM2cdA Really amazing and simple food. I ordered the thali with Kari pakora, daal and chana. I liked Kari the most but other two options were not bad. It came with a little bit of salad and rice and then 2 home made kind of rotis. It also included a little bit of suji halwa as sweet. Perfectly tasting food. Haven't had anything like that from a take out place for a very long time.

Kari pakora is must try I would suggest.
