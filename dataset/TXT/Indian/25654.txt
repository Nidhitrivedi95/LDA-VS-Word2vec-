hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw We grabbed lunch with a friend who lives in the area. 

We all grabbed a Lunch #2: Chicken Tikka, Dwane Handi, seasoned rice, naan and tomato soup. It was good, but not the best. Chiken tikka was juicy, but the tikka sauce seemed less complex than others. Dwane Handi is good, tomato soup was pretty standard, naan was okay. The portions aren't that big, but it did the trick. I just was more sad about the tiny dollop of rice. I mean isn't that the point of the rice and naan is to sop up the sauces and flavors of the dishes? By the end I was just taking spoonfuls of the dishes since I was out of rice and naan which to me is a travesty. This Asian has to have rice!!! 

$7.95 isn't bad for a lunch, but with a lot of Indian places offering a buffet for $9-11 it isn't necessarily value when compared, but good value for being the only Indian in the SW and few places with lunch specials there.

Service wasn't really personable. We didn't get any drink refills and when ordering drinks he took mine and the BFs drink order and turned around without asking our friend if they want a drink. No drink for you! 

It's okay if you want Indian nearby, but I think a drive out is worth it.
