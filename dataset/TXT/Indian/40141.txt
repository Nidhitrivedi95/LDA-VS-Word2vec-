PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg During a recent trip to the Edinburgh Fringe I developed a bit of an obsession with the Mosque Kitchen. Canteen style, simple menu with choice of veg curries or chicken or lamb as well as sheesh and biryani.

£5 for rice and 3 veg curries or chicken plus a veg. You can make your own combination.
Most importantly, the food itself is excellent. Perfect basmati rice with some aromatics. I recommend the aubergine and pepper curry, meltingly soft and delicious as well as the channa and dahl. The standard chicken curry is also excellent with super tender chicken. Add ons include samosas and naan bread and probably some other options.

Food is served at the counter, you pay, take your plate and find a seat with the other diners.

We had lunch there every day and wish I had a branch near me. I've been trying to make my own versions of their curries, inspired as I was. Not bad but can't come close.

A perfect no-nonsense, no pretence, no fuss, great food and great value eatery.
