pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Taj Mahal can instantly turn anyone from average Joe into thinking they are a Bollywood star being catered to. As such, I was ready to jump into a synchronized song and dance rendition with the overuse of pastels when I left- except that my stomach was so full I would have the grace of, say, Kristy Ally.

Simply put, this is a busy indian buffet the majority of the time. Lunch is cheaper than dinner and is quite a bargain. Basmati is always perfectly cooked, and samosas are hot and delectable. To say the spread is filling and wonderful is an understatement. Seriously, my eyes looked like someone who just got done buying tons of cat food at Wal Mart and just stepped into an Old Country Buffet, when I view this selection.

From Tikka Masala, to Korma, Goat and Chicken Curries, you will attempt to construct the leaning tower of Pisa on your plate, and wish there was some way you could get to all the different selections in one sitting.
