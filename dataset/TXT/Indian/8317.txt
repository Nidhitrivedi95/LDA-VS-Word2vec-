7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ Best meal I've had in Charlotte. Stopped in for dinner and had a terrific experience.

Nice atmosphere, great menu, terrific service at very reasonable price.

We had onion pakoda appetizer, chicken tikka and navrathan korma entrees.
Food prepared perfectly and was simply delicious.

Service attentive but not over bearing.

Prices very reasonable. Good beer and wine selection

All in all, a great experience and will certainly be back again!
