We work at the bank down the street, not only is the store owner so damn nice, he goes over and above when helping us. We pre-order our meals and he always has it ready for us on time. You walk in and its so clean, you can tell its all fresh and we prepares what he can on the spot. You taste the difference. The veggie samosas are on point too! Lastly the price is the best, we do the curry poutine for $5 and a side of samosas which are $2 for 2. Sometimes we change it up for the curry bowls or the butter chicken bowls for $8 lunch special that's awesome too! Oh and if you like spice make sure to ask him as he will make sure its perfect you! Couldn't recommend this spot more. YAY!
