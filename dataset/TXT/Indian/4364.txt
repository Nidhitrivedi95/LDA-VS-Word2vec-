1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw We missed the buffet time but the dinner was still great. We had Chicken Tikka, Butter Chicken, Paneer Makhani, and Dosa, with Naan of course. You can choose your spice level as well. Yes, we were hungry and ate all of it! All was very tasty! Definitely will have to go back and try the buffet. Adding this place to my top favorite Indian restaurants in town!
