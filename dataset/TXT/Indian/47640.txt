TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We went there on a weekday night by 10 PM. As the place closes by 10.30 PM, they refused to let us dine in but said that we can order take away. We ordered 2 plain naans, 2 garlic naans and chicken tikka masala. We waited for 30 mins but we were not given any update on our order. Only when we started to pester them about our order they hurried into the kitchen to get it ready. The taste of the food was good. The parking lot was a bit cramped. IT would have been full if we had come by 9 PM. 

Service was the main negative of this place. They were not hospitable to us. Too business oriented and in your face attitude.
