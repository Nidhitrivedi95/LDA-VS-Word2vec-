yi1LdN8dBh3TLN1hTTOrGw Ordered delivery for three. We were horrified at the poor quality of the food.
Here are some of the low lights:
- Entrees clearly had frozen bagged vegetables in them that were freezer burned. Peas were shriveled and rock hard. Carrots and chopped string beans in the curry were raw and flavorless. We had to pick the veggies out in order to attempt to eat the rest of our entrees.
- Naan bread was so undercooked that it was still raw dough. Two orders, totally inedible.
- 4 small chunks of chewy lamb swimming in about 4 cups of watery sauce for $16. Poor value to say the least.
- Very bland curry flavors in all the dishes, weak spices, not fresh ingredients.
- My friends wife was sick during the night.
A complete waste of $70, this place gives Indian food a bad name and we will NEVER order from them again. Do your self a favor and go some where else these people clearly don't care about serving you quality food.
