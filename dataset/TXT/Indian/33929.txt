m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew I'd rate this place 3.5 stars. 

Huge selection of food - vegetarian, meat and dessert section, and a salad bar. However the taste was average, nothing blew me away. 

I took two pieces of papadum from the meat section and they were stale. The papadum from the rice/vege side was fresh and crispy. 

Also the naan was good, can't complain. I'm a naan lover but they only give 4 pieces of naan :/ 

So yeah, overall the experience was average. I've had better buffet with lesser selection but everything was yummy.
