DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg The food is so good.  The menu is HUGE so I always get the sample platter thing because I can never decide on one thing.  Or, I go there at lunch time to get the buffet.  The buffet is always different every time I go.

And, its vegetarian/vegan, so its always an option for the veg-heads.

I love this place despite the violations that it received last year.  I heard about it from a friend who lived in India for awhile and she said "eh, it makes it more authentic."  And seriously, what restaurant in Phoenix doesn't have roaches?  As long as I don't see them while I'm dining I don't care.  And, it's still open, so I assume that they have rectified the situation.
