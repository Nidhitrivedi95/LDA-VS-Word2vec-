The management has changed and so is the food. For the price they charge, it is not worth

Picked up a Szechuan Fried Rice, Vegetarian Manchurian, a Hakka Noodle and a Mixed Vegetable with Tofu to go. The order took 40 minutes as it was extremely busy. I was notified of the same. But the person who took the order was not customer friendly. 

The Fried way too red, perhaps with colour added, the Manchurian Balls were too soft, the vegetables were OK and the noodles too greasy. 

Not coming back

Picked up a medium Manchurian Soup, veggie fried rice, veggie chow mien, veggie Manchurian and paneer chilli. A box full of plain rice also came included (the quantity was a lot). 

The soup was good and spicy and was still hot till we had at home. The fried rice was nice and so were the rest of dishes. The chilli paneer was a bit spicy for the kids. 

The only downside was that there was a piece of transparent plastic bag that came in one of the dishes - most likely in the rice or veggie Manchurian.
