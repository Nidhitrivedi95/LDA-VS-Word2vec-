IxImEiJocfQHMl_xphWYag I really want to like this place. The staff are awwwwesome, very attentive and helpful. The garlic naan has real shaved garlic baked on it, which was very nice. The meat is plentiful (but maybe that's because you're paying around $11-$13 for a bowl of curry about the size of your palm, the lamb wasn't quite as tender as another reviewer said which was basically my sole purpose for ordering it). But I'm just not quite sold. $5 for a tall but very skinny glass of mango lassi that tastes like the yogurt's gone off and about $3 for a bowl of raita that's smaller than the curry and also tastes like the yogurt's off. I'm nervous cause I feel like I'm about to feel sick at any moment but maybe I'm too new to Indian cuisine to realize that's normal? It's got a very nice mood for dinner with candles, the window opens wide so a couple diners can look out over the pavement. Apparently the lease is up and the building owner has given the new lease to the current cook who is reinventing the restaurant with a new name, new menu etc. Supposed to premiere in about a week. I'll stop by when it's up and running. Maybe tonight was a fluke and they were just finishing up their current stock of food..
