eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg This was the Indian restaurant I would often frequent when I lived in Phoenix. The three stars I give this place reflects my mixed feelings about it. I tend to gravitate to Indian restaurants that offer excellent lunch buffets, as it gives you the opportunity to sample multiple dishes. The buffet offered at Flavors of India is just okay, but often a little on the bland side. I do enjoy their samosas, vegetable pakoras, and tandoori chicken, but most of the entrees offered at the buffet are underwhelming. The story changes, however, when you order items from the menu and ask for them on the spicy side. Their mutter paneer and aloo gobi are excellent and nicely spiced. My personal favorite here is the baigan bharta, which is spicy fire-roasted eggplant with onions and peas. The taste of it is just out of this world. This is a great place for take-out, where you can order items to your specifications.
