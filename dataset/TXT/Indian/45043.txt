S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA If you are Indian don't go ... period!!!! Worst food in entire America!!!!

Paneer tikka felt like tomato gravy. Palak paneer was just horrible. We had buffet and would not recommend to any one. I just don't know how they have so many positive reviews.

Forgot to mention, the deserts were so bad that frozen deserts will be 1000 times better!!!!
