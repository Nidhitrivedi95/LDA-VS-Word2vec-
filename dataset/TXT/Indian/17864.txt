e8_Xt-ldpDgWHn92s3rBaQ Very low class and unhygienic food... I am Indian and have had Indian food all over the US... This by far is the worst.

Ordered several dishes and each one was bad!! 

When I asked the owner about what I had ordered and what they have instead, he was very defensive... Not a simple sorry or anything like that....

Again, just bad food!
