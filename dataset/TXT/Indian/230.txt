-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Glad it was a Groupon. The great reviews I read must be from people who don't know good Indian food. Perhaps the owners assume their customers will be the same. I do know good Indian food--and this isn't it. First, to have a Palak Paneer main dish (dinner) for $12--and the rice costs extra? You get a side dish serving with nothing else? NOT good. The dish itself was simply vapid spinach mush with three, count 'em, three cubes of paneer. The garlic naan (extra, of course) was very thin-crust pizza with a whiff of garlic and a parsley sprinkle.  NOT naan, but the thinness of pappadum. Service and ambience fine, but as for the food? Not going back. Only one other couple in the place.   So disappointing.  Friend was equally disheartened with her shrimp curry.
