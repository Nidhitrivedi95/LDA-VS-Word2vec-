yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ good ambiance for campus town. extremely attentive service. price is reasonable for what you get.

But i didn't leave this place feeling like I NEED to come back here again. The food was good, but it wasn't mind blowing. Maybe Indian/middle eastern food isn't exactly my food of choice. I'll probably come back here again and try something new (I got a chicken dish which was pretty good, but next time I'm going to try their curry dishes and their rolls). Anyway, this is a good addition to campus town. I liked it more than Bombay even though I believe they're owned by the same guy.
