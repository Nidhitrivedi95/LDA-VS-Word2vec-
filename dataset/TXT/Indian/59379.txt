z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA I went here on a busy weekday for lunch and was appalled by the service. I was second in line and it took me more than 25 minutes to order some food. It was disappointing that the staff made no effort to keep the line moving even with more than 10 people waiting. I just went for what's available and had a rice bowl with paneer and yogurt and it was mediocre at best. 

I'd probably never go back.
