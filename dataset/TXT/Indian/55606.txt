x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ This place totally reminds me of the Indo-Chinese food in Bombay. 

The chilli paneer, Chinese bhel, chicken 65 (as per my non-veggie friends), crispy baby corn are great starters! I loved the hakka noodles and burnt garlic fried rice. The main course although tasty was spicier than what I'd expected for 3/5 level. 
Great place, will definitely go again!
