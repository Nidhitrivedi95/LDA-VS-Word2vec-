UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg We have tried this place twice in a two years gap. First time didn't like it at all so after two years we decided to give it another try. The food is acceptable and you can make a combo dish to try different options. We have tried Palak paneer (not creamy and strong taste of fried onion), butter chicken  meets your basic expectation, chicken tandoori is tasty but a bit moist. Lamb madras was the best dish that we tried. Great combination of taste and texture. 
Do not expect any sort of service in here (although the calling button system is good). There is no food presentation. Everything in our combo was mixed together. Our waitress poured the food on my friend and she did not care at all! With the price you pay, you can't expect much. I am not getting into the bugs and strong smell of the burnt oil inside. Try to get a table outside. Make sure to ask for your gulab jamun to be heated, otherwise you will be given a cold, stale piece. I might visit this place once more in two years again.
