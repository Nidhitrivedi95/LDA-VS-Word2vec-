OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w I would give this place a 6.5/10.  
The food was actually good, however, the service could use some improvement.  We wanted to order take out for the office, and right off the bat we knew service was definitely compromised, but we had already made plans for the entire office. 
We called in 8 times however nobody picked up our calls, we had to drive to place our order and go back for pickup as it took some time to prepare.  Upon arrival nobody greeted us, and we struggled to find the desk/help.  Mind you, one of the guys was serving the table beside us, saw us looking for help yet said nothing.  We helped ourselves by looking around and finally placed our order, I asked why nobody answers the calls, the guy pointed to the guests and said "we're busy", I guess they don't care for customers unless they are dining in.  Anyways, we noticed only 2 waiters in a place full of people, clearly they need more help and customer service skills, not once did they smile or say thank you/please.  We picked up our food, the guy didn't even give us the change, I guess he assumed he deserved the tip, though not much.  Luckily the food was good, otherwise I'd never recommend it.  If you don't care for good service, I would def recommend this place, otherwise save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere.
