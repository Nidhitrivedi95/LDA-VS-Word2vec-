cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w What a great evening of wonderful food and service.   The eggplant fries and cauliflower apps were delish!  So were our mains of butter chicken, biryani, lamb, okra and shrimp.  While all portions were ample for the 4 of us, the tables are way too small for all the food and tables way too close together.  Other than those minor problems we will be back for sure!
