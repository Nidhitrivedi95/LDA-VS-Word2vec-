Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ Nice place, good vibe. Bathrooms are not the cleanest. 
Food is good but pricey. Service was fine. 
Had the fried onions as appetizers which were on point! Hyderabadi lamb shank was well done as well. Naan on the expensive side. Rice doesn't come with the dish and has to be ordered separately. Would visit again. Nice ambience.
