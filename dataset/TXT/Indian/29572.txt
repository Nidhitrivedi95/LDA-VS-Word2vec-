jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg Must visit Indian restaurant!!!!! This is my second time here and by far the best service we have ever received in an Indian restaurant in Madison. The food was much better this time as well. 

We tried the masala fish for appetizer which was delightful. We had masala dosa and an egg dosa as well.  The dosas were crispy and fresh. Sambhar and the coconut chutney that came with it were very good as well. 

This will be my new go to place for Indian food!!!!
