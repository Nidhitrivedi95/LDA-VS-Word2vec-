3quopZyL8WuqVFfsCi0z2A I love this place!! Best Indian Restaurant in Scarborough!! 
Their Naans are shaped like giant tennis racquets! 
Small but lovely atmosphere & good wine list. Great place for a small gathering or a date! I also do takeout a lot. They have some incredible lunch specials...they are huge and delicious.
