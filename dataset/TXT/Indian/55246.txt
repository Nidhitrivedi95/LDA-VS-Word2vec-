WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA I know some people will strongly consider harpooning me knowing that all these years I've been chiming on about the best roti in town and espousing the perfection that is Gandhi's without ever having tried Bacchus Roti, but alas.

I have now tried Bacchus. And while I was only able to plow through about about a quarter of my gargantuan roti, I loved it. I ordered a combination of squash and potato and it was piping hot, juicy and incredibly dense. I wasn't familiar with the spicy rating at Bacchus so I was conservative with my choice. 

My favourite part about Bacchus was how beautiful the decor was (not knowing about the renovations I was expecting a total dive in the heart of Parkdale). Very classy, sophisticated and clean - not at all like some of its neighbours. Also, the person who served us (perhaps the owner himself) was very friendly and personable. He seemed like a genuinely "good person" - you know how you just get that vibe from some people? He was one of them.

SIDENOTE: It's important to note the discrete divisions in the roti family - there's the typical West Indies roti (like Bacchus, Island Foods, Triple X, etc.) and there's the South Asian roti (like Gandhi) which is essentially curry in a wrap/roti. You can be a fan of one, neither or both but it's hard to claim a 'best roti' if you're including both types, ya know? So I still vote Gandhi for best South Asian style roti - for that there's no contest. But it'd be tough to choose between Bacchus and Vena's for best West Indies style roti!
