ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ Amazing Indian food with a pretty decent setup. 
We loved it here. 
Yelp, thats how we found it. Street parking, there is ample at night. 
We reached at 8 and were seated immediately. Tables are not huge but are neat. Staff is courteous and attentive. They serve complementary roasted papad with chutney. 
We ordered paneer masala - yummy, dal makhani - awesomely awesome with lachcha parantha- I have had better lachcha parantha in past this one was okayish n onion naan- this was good. 
Food was served without much wait, which was pleasing as we were hungary after the day's activities. 
They serve jeera rice with the entree, which was also good. Overall Food tasted great. 

We give them 5 stars based on 1 visit during a tourist visit to Pittsburgh; it proved a nice one.
