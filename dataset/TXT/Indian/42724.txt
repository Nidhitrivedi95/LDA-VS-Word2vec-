The appetizer (chaat) had cold potatoes, served with various generic cold chutneys which had a bottled aftertaste. The butter chicken was swimming in a thick sauce which was obviously old (cream was curdling and tasted rancid), the chili chicken was not spicy and drenched in oil (I'd suggest the chef goes over to Cafe Nirvana a couple of miles down the road to see what chili chicken should taste like), the dessert was a sooji halwa (cream of wheat with butter, sugar and raisins) often considered a poor man's dessert in Indian circles and never served in restaurants, and a sad looking chocolate souffle of some sort which had not set. 

Disappointing, to say the least. If you want better Indian food, try Cafe Nirvana down the road, or Woodlands, or Fu Lin (for Indian hakka Chinese). If you want less expensive Indian food, try any other Indian restaurant in Charlotte except Copper, which is owned by the same person.
