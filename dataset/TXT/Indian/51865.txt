UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Waited for 10 minutes despite reservation.  No problem, but at least they could have offered us something to drink.  The host and others were very nice and cordial.  We ordered and waited 40 minutes for our food.  It was myself, my wife and our little boy.  The food was awesome.  They were a little skimpy with the Basmati rice and brought some more when we asked.  The beer selection is impressive.  We will go back.
