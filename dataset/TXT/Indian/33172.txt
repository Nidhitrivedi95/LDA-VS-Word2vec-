llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Nice! An excellent Indian food restaurant in my hood.

The food is delish, the staff is super friendly and the decor is appropriate.

We enjoyed the garlic naan, a peas & cottage cheese dish and a cauliflower & potato dish. All were super tasty. Lots of vegetarian options.

I'm really glad we popped in to try this place out. We'll be back.
