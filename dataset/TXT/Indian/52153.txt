UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA met up with a friend for lunch. its been a while since ive been here but the buffet is still really good. 

$11 or $12, i dont remember.

they had mint chutney! very good stuff. not spicy though. 
they had an interesting basmati rice with cashews, dried cranberries, and other stuff. it was pretty good. never had anything like that before.
all of their curries were excellent. i really liked the mutton on bone the most. 
the tandoori chicken was a little dry, but it usually is. lunch had just started so everything was fresh.

last time i ate here i dunno if i ate too much but i had really bad food coma. this time i had 3 plates but feel good.

maybe its the waiters thick indian accent that makes the food taste better at mint, but this place is definitely one of the better places to get inidian food in town.
