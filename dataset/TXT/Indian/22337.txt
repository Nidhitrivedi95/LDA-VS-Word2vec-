Microwaved curry & roti, with the centre still cold!

This was a huge disappointment given the high Yelp reviews. The decor was nice, but we should have realized the food was not fresh when we heard the microwave beeping when the owner/cook was preparing another customer's order. We still gave the restaurant a chance and placed our order. The patties were soggy, not crisp (*beep*beep*) The chicken roti was cold in the inside (*beep*beep*)

We left the restaurant without finishing the food. Best decision we made that day. 

Would give this place 0 stars, if I could. Won't be going back. In fact, it pains us to still see it open whenever we pass by the area.
