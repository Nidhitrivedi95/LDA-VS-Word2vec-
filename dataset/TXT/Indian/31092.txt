KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA I've always loved Chung Moi. This is real Indian Chinese food of the best kind. (ok, ok, Karachi Chinese). Theresa, the tough, practical, and friendly restauranteuse has opted not to serve pork (I oink sadly about this omission) undoubtedly in deference to the Muslims among her clientele. Strangely though, booze is available. With many Bombay Muslims as my friends I sort of understand that. If I had the guts to question her about it all, I would ask. But I don't. I do have the guts to order anything on the menu. Hakka chow mein is brill - lightly soy-sauced stir fried noodles with your choice of shrimp, chicken, egg or all of the above. Dry chilli beef, chicken manchurian, shrimp schezwan, any of the special fried rice dishes, the soups - all outstanding. Be warned this is not Chinese food like you'd get at a Cantonese restaurant or Canadian Chinese restaurant (kill me please, before I review that). It's Indian chinese - garlicky, peppery, fiery with chilli heat. Chung Moi is practical and unfussy - cafeteria style tableware, the cliched Chinese rubbish on the walls,, plastic tablecloths and chopsticks, but who cares. It goes beautifully with a Heineken. Or three. It is greasy food, they do use MSG. And when you eat it, you suddenly understand the brilliance of the "Don't ask, Don't tell" policy. This is not a date restaurant. You'll find more romance at the gas station two doors east. But for foodies, looking for an Indian Chinese fix, Chung Moi is your friendly Scarberian pusher.
