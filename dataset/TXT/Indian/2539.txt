02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I would not give any stars, not many options... Tasted verymuch like the frozen packets heated & served.

The buffet time is till 4 pm however the biryani is not refilled at 1.00 PM

The tondoor wasn't cooked all thru. Desers were all frozen & served very cold with pieces of ice in the kheer.

The only good thing was the fish, which aswell wasn't re-filled at 1:00 PM.
