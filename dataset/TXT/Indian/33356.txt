lO-IY5X36bLI8vnQR4O18A I  like the food here but customer service is horrible and they rip you off. For example I ordered chicken kutthu paratha , veg biryani, and chicken 65 all this to go. When I get there I was told they were out of chicken 65 OK that's fine . The girl adjusts my bill by taking chicken 65 off the ticket but keeps the tax on for that dish. Then got home open my food the curry with the kuthu paratha is half literally half a cup with 1 piece of chicken. They charge you $3 extra with chicken.I tried to call them 5 times to complain but the phone is going straight to VM. I'm very very disappointed.
