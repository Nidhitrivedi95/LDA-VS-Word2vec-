nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ The food is something you'd expect at a much fancier place. I was blown away by the presentation. The watermelon mint soup came in a bowl made of ice with mint leaves frozen inside.

It looks like a fast food place, but the quality of the food is that of a much better restaurant. You do pay for it, but a bit less than an higher end restaurant, probably because of the utter lack fanciness.

There weren't many people when I was there (Saturday afternoon), I hope it picks up.

The chef was really nice too :)
