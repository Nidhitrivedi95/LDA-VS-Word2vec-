pFmuMpPANaAFQ1PGVv1FeQ My fiancée and I schlepped out to Monroeville because an Indian friend of ours said that the food here was, and I quote, "better than Indian food back in India." With that kind of recommendation, who could resist?

Well, turns out that at least for my palate (read: not-Indian), the food was okay. Tasty, but nothing special. We got the fried catfish and the chicken tikka masala. The first was on a recommendation from the chef and the second was one that I tend to like at other places (pretty Americanized Indian dish). We also got some naan (one garlic and one cheese stuffed). We wanted Samosas, but they were out. Which was surprising given that we were the only people in the restaurant the entire time. Though, I must admit, the mango lassis were delicious.

Anyway, the decor was, well, pretty drab. Think folding tables and chairs from Costco (not kidding). The staff (the one waiter and the chef) were very friendly, but were never really around for say, a refill on a water.

Overall, maybe the food really is fantastic, but my palate for Indian food just isn't sophisticated enough. If yours isn't either, stay in Pittsburgh and head over to Taste of India. Much closer, and just as good. On the other hand, if you're Indian and can tell the difference, give this place a chance and post about it!
