W4PkdKcGXYM3Njo_Y9pPHg The man we've seen running this place has always been really nice the few times me and my friend went in! Plus points for hospitality :)

Their shawarma isn't amazing or anything, but at $5 each (when we went in), it was a great deal! The biriyani was pretty good as well, although we ordered the one with boneless chicken and accidentally got a couple bones in there... 

All in all this place is seemingly the only decent Indian food we have in the area, so I don't mind popping in now and again when the South Asian cravings hit!
