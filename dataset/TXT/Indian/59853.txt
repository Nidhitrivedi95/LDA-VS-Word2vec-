ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Our entire family enjoyed a delicious lunch today. The food selection was broad and the flavors were right on point. The restaurant was spotless and had two flat screens to display Bollywood movies. The garlic naan was sublime. Our boys raved about the desserts. Very reasonable at $10.99 per person for the lunch buffet. Everyone's favorite was the chicken korma, but it was all very flavorful. We will be back.
