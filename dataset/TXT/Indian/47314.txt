TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ Disclaimer: Nine years in Toronto and I've never eaten Chinese food in Chinatown. I've also never tried Hakka style Chinese food before. 
That being said, this is the best Chinese food I've had in this country. The Hot and Sour Soup is the best I've EVER had. Manchurian Egg Fried Rice was delicious. First time trying Crispy Beef and it was also delicious. They made a mistake with my American Vegetable Chop Suey and gave me chicken and shrimp instead of veggie, but it was still really good, I just picked out the shrimps. The General Tao chicken was a bit gristly and should have been spicier, but had good flavor. 
The young man who took my order and served my takeout bags was beyond sweet, and the restaurant itself was very clean and smelled good. 
As someone else said, don't be put off by the crazy neighborhood (someone was outside in the street screaming about "get off my street!"), the food more than made up for it. I'm moving more central, but will definitely make the trip out now and then to try other items.
