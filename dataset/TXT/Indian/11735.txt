aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q Indies is a cute little Indian take out place in the Colonial Arcade food court.  

Truth be told, I've had better Indian, but Indies is good for a quick lunch.  There is a good selection of both vegetarian and chicken dishes, including some specials that are not your average tandoori chicken.  The Alu Gobi (caulifllower) and the Mattar Paneer (peas 'n' cheese) are my favorites.  The Briyani special is really good- spiced chicken and rice with a huge side of cool raita.  The raita is fresh and homemade, BTW.  The mango lassis are perfect for nursing a hangover!!!

The real stand out here is breakfast.  Alu Paratha is described as "Indian style pancake stuffed with potatoes".  It's more like a very thin naan stuffed with spicy minced potatoes and served with a much needed cooling raita.  It takes about ten minutes from order to receipt, because the chef makes each one fresh.  Boy is it worth it.    Be warned-- hot means India hot!  Ask for mild or moderate unless you are, in fact, fireproof.
