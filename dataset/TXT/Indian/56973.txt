xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I've traveled the west coast and parts of the east coast finding and trying fry bread and I've gotta tell you, this is the best of the best!

Most fry bread at other places is of an entirely different consistency, but at the Fry Bread House, their bread is PERFECT!
It goes well by itself, with a soup, or even topped with something to make for a delicious dessert!

The few times I've been there, I've also ordered the hominy soup which is very delicious to eat along with the fry bread.

I highly recommend those two together.

As for the dessert (the offer a variety of toppings for the fry bread, I've had the honey and sugar and the chocolate) Both are good, but the honey and sugar is a bit messy, so be prepared for that. The chocolate is also a bit messy. The different toppings add a bit more sweetness to the fry bread, but honestly, I find it best when served warm without any toppings at all.

Definitely worth a try!
