U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg I have passed this restaurant many times but didn't pay much attention as many restaurants on the Lakeshore leave a lot to be desired.  But then I read that Maurya's is operated by Mother India and decided to give it a try because I've been enjoying Mother India's rotis for many years.

I ordered the Chicken Jalfrizi roti and was pleasantly surprised it was just as delicious as Mother India in Parkdale... And the service was incredibly fast and friendly.

I encourage everyone to give this place a try if you like East Indian food.
