3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g We had been there to the lunch buffet on a friday couple of weeks ago and the food was awful. The restaurant itself is very boring with no music or ambience and uninviting. I was hoping that we get some good food there. The papadum tasted horrible probably because of the oil. The Gulab Jamoons were torn apart in the buffet tray and not even a single intact piece was there. The tandoori chicken tray was empty. They did not care to refill the empty food trays. The owner was bit rude when we complained to him of the quality. The buffet itself is about 11.95 + TAX on the week end including friday. I don't mind paying 13 dollars for the food, but not for the food they offer. Chutneys on baseline is a lot better bargain in comparison to this restaurant though the pricing is similar for the buffet.  The only +ve experience was the bottled water they offered at no extra cost and the chicken biriyani. Anyways we decided not to return to this place.
