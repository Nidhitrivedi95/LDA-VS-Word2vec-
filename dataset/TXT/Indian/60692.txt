zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q This was really good food at a very descent price. Infact it was a lot of food for a price I was totally willing to pay. I had the lamb biryani and it was very well spiced and had the right meat to rice ratio.The service was incredibly fast and very friendly. I would come back here again ad try their other menu options.
