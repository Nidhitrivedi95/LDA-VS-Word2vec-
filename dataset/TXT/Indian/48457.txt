tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g Whenever I get a craving for Indian food, I come here. This place is amazing! The food is very authentic and the atmosphere is great. A good friend of mine is Indian (who was born and raised in India) and he says this food tastes as if it's home cooked. We've been to a few other Indian restaurants, but none of them beats Cuisine of India.
