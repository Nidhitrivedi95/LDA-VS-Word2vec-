3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Out for past 11 days and was tired of eating burgers and pizza, we wanted to have Indian food. While browsing yelp, we stumbled upon this place. Dinner was great, service was also good. Next day we tried their lunch buffet, and it was even better than last night's dinner. Lots of option, great taste and overall great service. I would recommend this place to my Friends visiting Vegas.
