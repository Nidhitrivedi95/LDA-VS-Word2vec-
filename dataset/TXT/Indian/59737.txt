ZDx7kt4aOPTlmYTqXDrTGA Staff is taught how to lie instinctively at both the Ajax and Scarborough Locations. Absolutely dishonest and ready to misguide you on almost any question asked!
I asked for hot samosas one evening, they said they are not making any for the rest of the day and the cold ones on the counter are all they have. Hardly 30 seconds later another staff comes and empties a load of hot fresh Samosas. The lying staff member smiles shamelessly on eye-contact post fact!
Next I asked for hot rolls; they re-fried cold ones from a few hours ago and handed me darker ones. Upon questioning the staff, they said rolls come out dark when fried and become lighter as they cool down, which is BS! 
Quality of food served is seldom good and this has happened to me repeatedly at both locations.
It's a disaster of a food service depending on how lucky your day could get! I'm not eating from here again!
