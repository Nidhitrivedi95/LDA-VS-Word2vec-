sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ You often hear that some of the best places to get food, are those non-descript "hole-in-the-wall's".  Well this has never been more true than with Gandhi Cuisine.  They make their own roti shells in-house.  Ingredients, spices, etc, are always fresh, and you get a LOT of food for what you pay for (You can easily split a roti into two meals, unless you're a serious eater!).

Only flaw with this great place, and why I deducted a star, is that there is no consistency when it comes to spicy heat.  I used to always order "Medium", which is normally just fine... however sometimes the medium will be WAY too hot.  I'm talking nose running, eye watering HOT.  In which case I usually add yogurt to the roti to cool things down.
I've resorted to always ordering the mild and adding my own heat.  Not really an issue as they're still delicious!  For lovers of heat...or those who like a challenge, go right on ahead and order the HOT.  Which roti you decide on is entirely up to you...there are no wrong choices here!
