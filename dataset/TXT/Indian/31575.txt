KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Went in because friends told me to try it if working near it. Ask for the chilli chix paid for it . look at the menu said it's comes with salad& pop ask the lady she gave me the salad but she wanted money for the drink. I showed her the menu that comes with drink she looked over to the other person said something in there language. I left with no drink with a disappointment. The portions was little. Will not go there again.
