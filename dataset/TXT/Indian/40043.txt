pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Ok the ala-carte menu is awful. After reading reviews thought to try their buffet....super disappointing. The food was cold with lots of artificial coloring. The shrimp curry was watery and lacked any kind of flavor, felt like i was eating shrimp in water. Dont waste your money!!
