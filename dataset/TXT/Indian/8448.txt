7NurnM6G9b_2jTEKpIkQpg I was on my way to get some cupcakes at So into Cupcakes and then I saw the Sign... yes a sign saying "Spicefully Yours".

Cheesy slogans and store names seems to be the headline for this afternoon..

I should have come by Canbe Foods a year ago... (yay! Yelp Friend I hear you!) but you know being a procrastinator I am guilty... but it is never too late.

Chicken Biryani ($6) is like a full lunchbox with content just expose everywhere when I started eating that. Can I complain that it was too much? Are they purposely trying to make me fat? I ate half and saved the rest for lunch the next day.

Be careful of all the spices they use... It is not hot spicy.. just spicy with a lot of different kind of spices used in the preparation. And you might end up burping everywhere.

Maybe I will try their Roti Paratha which they claim is "Best In Town" next time!
