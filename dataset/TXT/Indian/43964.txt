RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Love this place. On vacation with family, goggled it up, bit of a trip to get there, but worth it. Take trolley on Gerrard, west. True no beer and Styrofoam plates and plastic utensils but the food makes up for it. Every thing seasoned well and good portions, be prepared to share. Never been to Pakistan but the staff and the dining area with indoor outdoor picnic tables, makes it seem your there.  I forgot a bag when we left the place, but our waiter ran 1/2 a block to return.
