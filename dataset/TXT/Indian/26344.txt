We started with some delicious naan and a variety of dips. The mint and mango? chutney were a highlight of the meal.

I had the Papdi / Mango / Watermelon Kachumber Salad which was refreshing but I wasn't sure that the onion seed dressing really suited the salad. I then had as my main dish the Allepy Masala Prawns  which were too heavily salted for my taste...but admittedly I am sensitive in this area. The prawns were served with probably the best part of my entire meal - the gigande beans pappu -Wow the sauce was deeeelicious. My dining partner had the croquette's and root veggie Wadas which were ok but not restaurant week worthy in my opinion. Finally we finished off our meal with Mocha Kulfi which is like a very sweet thick ice cream and a key lime pie. The key lime was excellent and I am not usually a fan. 

When it comes to Indian I have a soft spot for masala so I would like to come back and try something more traditionally Indian. 

Our service was absolutely great and the ambiance is fantastic. The outside area is really nice.Copper would make for an excellent first date.
