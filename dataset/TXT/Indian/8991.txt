The server was friendly and very prompt in greeting me and helping me with the menu. I ended up ordering the Saag Lamb, which was delicious! It did not take long to be prepared, and during my wait, the server made sure to ask if I wanted any water and what cutlery/plates I needed with my take-out.

The only thing that's keeping me from coming back is the price. It's a bit too expensive to eat here often with my college budget. It's conveniently located near campus, though.
