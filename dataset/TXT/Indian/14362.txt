c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg One of my favourite place to grab Indian food. I fell in love with this place years ago because their butter chicken is incredibly buttery and their lamb briyani is delicious but what I do not like is their prices. I find them a lot more expensive than other places (~$13.99 for a small bowl of butter chicken). Their naan bread gets pretty pricey as well (an additional $0.50 for butter naan). 

Although the people who work there are nice, I find them usually short staffed even during busy hours. They have a loyalty program to collect point using your phone number which then can be redeemable for credit at the restaurant which is nice.
