QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg I went there with my book club last week. The food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the sesame naan which I had never had before that night. Everyone loved their food and the portions were very generous. The service was super friendly and very attentive. We really appreciated the byob with no corkage fee. Overall a fun budget- friendly night!
