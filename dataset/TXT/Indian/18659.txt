eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg We went in for lunch today.  Parking lot was full and several people inside -- always a good sign that the food is good.

Was planning on doing the lunch buffet but found out they don't have Chicken Tikka Masala on buffet.   Sad panda.

So, we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala with some Garlic and Plain naan.  Service was very good.  The plain naan was excellent, while the garlic was a little too garlic for our taste. 

The chicken tikka masala was decent, however it was more of a soupy texture instead of a paste that I'm used to.
