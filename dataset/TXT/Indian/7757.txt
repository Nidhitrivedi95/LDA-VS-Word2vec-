6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A I have been here twice for weekend lunch buffet with friends. Unanimously this is the best Indian buffet in Cleveland at the moment. Their food are fresh and the trays are refilled in regular intervals. They are pretty consistent in terms of food quality. They serve dosa on your table if you ask for it. Apart from numerous veg options, they have quite a few chicken dishes, fish fry, chicken biriyani and goat curry. I find the chicken biriyani kind of hot and spicy as per my tolerance level,  but it has very well adjusted with my friends' taste buds. The goat curry is really good. I always make it a point to pair the goat curry with the puris. 
The chicken tandoori was really tasty last time. 
They had Mysore paak too on the buffet for desserts. That is the best I had in years. Mysore paak had all ran out when we had gone back for second serving. I don't think Mysore paak is a very regular desserts option in their buffet. 
Overall the food is good. Worth giving it a shot when you are really hungry on a weekend lunch!!

Tip: try to be there early so that you don't repent on missing out your second serving of Mysore paak like me!
