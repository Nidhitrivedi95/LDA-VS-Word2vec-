DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ My colleague and I arrived here at 12:15 during our lunch break and there were maybe 10 people in line in front of us. They did not take our order for over 25 minutes and we did not get our food for another 25 after that. There were 4 women behind the counter and I have never seen less efficient people. Especially in a place where the food is already prepared and all they need to do is scoop and pack. They were extremely slow, easily distracted, and stopped to consult one another before doing the next thing. They repeatedly referred to the monitor with all the orders, which is not a bad thing, but it's also not very encouraging when they're putting together the daily special (butter chicken with rice and naan). After waiting what felt like an eternity, I asked about our food. They quickly (surprise!) made mine and then we waited another 15 minutes for my colleague's order although he had ordered immediately after me. I just don't understand how you can be that level of inefficient!
Also, the butter chicken is so watery, it's not great.
