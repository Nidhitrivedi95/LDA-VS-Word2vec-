axGUBM5mgmFZQn85bMTVPA Food was decent, although I did experience dry bones in some dishes...it seemed there was no quality control of putting in chicken wings into dishes.

Restaurant way too small for it's own good.

Service, IMHO was pedestrian at best. The buffet was poorly manned and managed, with lots of empty bins as the height of the buffet schedule arrived at about 12:15 pm.

Table service was absent. Ask for a cola or iced tea, you get a tall liquor glass with 50% ice and no one bothers to ask if you want a refill; but they are eager enough to hover and take away your plate...

Not sure I would ever recommend anyone to go there, unless of course he/she is dying for some Indian cuisine.
