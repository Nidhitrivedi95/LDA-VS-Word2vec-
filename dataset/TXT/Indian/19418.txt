FCe3qJGTbKJTMAljvziuoA Ok, I think this place is legendary.  People don't come here to buy a couple of samosas, they come here to buy a couple of boxes of samosas.  Used to work by here and the place is just insane, my coworkers would go in and buy tons of samosas as if they weren't coming back to work the next day and have close access to the store.  The samosas here are light, fluffy, have nicely spiced potatoes, green pea, cumin etc.  pakoras are good as well, but their specialty are samosas.  To my surprise, this place is even known to my old work crew back in Toronto.
