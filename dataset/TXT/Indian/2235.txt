_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Had a fabulous evening at The Host.  Food was excellent.  Warm plates, delicious naan, sauces were tasty and rich.

What really stood out was the warm friendly welcome and service.  Shita (hope I got that correct) was friendly accommodating and fun! Made the evening extra special.  Thank you!
