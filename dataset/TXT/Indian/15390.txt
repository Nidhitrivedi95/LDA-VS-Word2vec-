ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ I was very happy with my experience here.

I had been there some time ago before I was writing on Yelp.  I had only been there for their weekday lunch all-you-can-eat buffet.  The price was $11.99 and I thought it was just fantastic.  Large selection of foods on the buffet, and it was fresh.

My recent experience with their sitdown menu service was a good experience, although it was a slightly slow one.  In their defence though, it was January 2nd, and I don't think they were really expecting to have alot of customers for their dinner service.
That aside though, the service was decent enough, and the staff was very friendly.
I really enjoyed the food.  The samosa appetizer was absolutely phenomenol, and my entree was Calcutta Chili-Chicken, which is kind of like an Indian version of a Chinese Sweet/Sour dish.  Not overly sweet, but definitely on the sweet side.  Not as hot as I would have liked it, but I think adding heat to your food at this restaurant isn't a problem at all.
My entree was $13.95 which I thought was a little on the pricier side, considering the size of the portion, but the quality of the food was awesome.

The location of the restaurant is great, with it directly across from Wellesley subway station, and there is a car-park right beside the restaurant.

I would definitely go back to this place again.  Good for large groups too as the dining area is large and open.
