NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ Ordered goat Briyani and chicken 65. The quantity was good. Briyani rice is either low grade basmati or normal rice(not sure). Taste is very similar to local Briyani shops in India, and found some lumps of white rice too:(.
Chicken 65 was on par , but tasted a little bitterness(not sure if its because of oil used), other than that 65 was good.

UPDATE 10/26/14 - The food has improved a lot.. Chicken DUM briyani is little greasy but its good...Currently i visit here once a week....
