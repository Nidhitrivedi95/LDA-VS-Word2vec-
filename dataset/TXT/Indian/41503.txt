Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w We wanted to try a new Indian restaurant and found this place near West Towne Mall via Yelp :) Service was exceptional! I've been in the restaurant business for over 10 years and they went above and beyond what I expected for a small family owned business.  

We came in around 6pm on a Monday night and upon seating our party of 3, the server set our napkins for us and made us feel welcomed. (The restaurant wasn't too busy that evening so my rating may be skewed because of that)  I didn't give them a full 5 stars because they were ALWAYS there at the table or near by. I would suggest to them to be able to "read" the table better and adjust their services accordingly. But I definitely give them credit for being courteous and anticipating our needs, like asking if we'd like more rice. 

Food was delicious, spices were just right without being too spicy. The chutney's served in the beginning of our meal were tasty as well. We ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh, Lamb Masala, and Chicken Vindaloo. The meats were very tender and the curries were tasting light. We also ordered chapati and the plain naan which were amazing! This was the best naan I've ever had, texture was light and airy, so soft it melted in your mouth! We had Mango Lassi's to drink and complimented the spicy notes in our food. The Lassi was not too sweet and perfectly tangy. Pleasantly, at the end of our meal they brought out clean hot towels for us to refresh our hands with.

We had leftovers and to my surprise the next day, the server had put a scoop of rice in the container for us to enjoy with our leftover curry! 

We will definitely be back!
