g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ As an Indian living in Atlanta, where we have some great Indian dining options, we were taken aback with the excellent food and service at Bukhara. Would definitely recommend this restaurant. We had a lamb sheek kabab, chilli chicken, goat dum biryani and some naans. All dishes were excellent.
