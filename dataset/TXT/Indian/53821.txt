VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ I can't believe I have not left a review yet as I have been eating here for years! Let me just start by saying that I love Indian food. I have eaten at several Indian restaurants in the valley and this one is by far my favorite. Their sauces are so flavorful and the meat dishes come with tons of meat. My personal favorite is the chicken vindaloo. They also have delicious chai that you can get either hot or iced, which I really appreciate being that I order my food so hot(spicy) that sometimes it's hard to drink hot tea. 5 stars, every time.
