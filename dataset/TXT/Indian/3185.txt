0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I ordered carry-out from here one evening.  I called it in and it was ready quick.  The food was still hot, even when I got home.  It was different than what I was used to, it had veggies in the tikka masala.  I had never experienced that before, but it wasn't bad,  The ingredients all seemed fresh.  I was happy with the naan.  It was extremely flavorful.

The place has decent prices for Indian food.  The customer service was very good.  I would try again sometime when I am around the area.
