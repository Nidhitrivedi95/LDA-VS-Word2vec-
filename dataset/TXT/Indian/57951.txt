yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I have had the best Indian food so far in tempe. I love the saag and makki ki roti. But when i went the second and third time on a Monday, this week and last week, there is a receptionist who did not let us in. First time she said that there was a 45-1 hour waiting when I could see empty tables and second time today she did nit let us in at 8:15 when the official closing time is 8:30. It is such a regret that a nice restaurant has a very rude receptionist. I guess her name is Deepal, as her co workers were calling her by same name.
