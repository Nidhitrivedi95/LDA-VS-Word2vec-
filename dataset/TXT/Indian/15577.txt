cuxC5smoo7m8Z-nAGDWMaQ Fantastic and best in Mississauga based on price and quality of their dishes. Me and wife have tried almost everything on their menu. It's rare to find a Indian place where everything is so yummy.  Favourites - cashew masala, paneer kalameeri, chicken lababdar, tikka masala, vada pav, etc
