UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w I ordered their chaat, pani-puri, mutter-paneer and roti. The pani-puri was expensive as the dish had only 5 puris!! The chaat was okay because it was a bit bland. The mutter-paneer had exactly two pieces of paneer and too many peas and the curry was too watery and bland, very simply it was Yuck!! 
Rude staff, bad food and expensive dishes are the highlight of this place. Never going to this place ever again.
