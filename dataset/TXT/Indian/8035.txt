7BIbvCkI7AXQMVC1-DHpCA I've been here a few times and its decent food. There is nothing special about this place that makes me want to specifically go back. Although, if someone is holding a party or special occasion here I doubt I would avoid this place.

I've never been here just for lunch or dinner, so that may effect my review. Although, I've eaten this food on multiple occasions for events at the restaurant. Its good Indian food, and you can never say no to good Indian food. It just wasn't spectacular. I would give most Indian food places 5-stars if the quality of the meat they used was better and if the quality of everything they use is just better. The salads weren't green, the meat in the korma and tikka was very small. It just felt like they were cheaping out on us.

Desserts weren't really special either. If you give me gulab jamun or some jelebi, I am a sucker for that stuff. Theirs was decent, but there wasn't much of it available. However, there really isn't much better stuff in AZ in this vicinity. I'd say India Gate is a little better, maybe try that place out first.
