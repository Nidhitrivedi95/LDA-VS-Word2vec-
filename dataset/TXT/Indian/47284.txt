TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ We chose this place based on the existing reviews and we were not disappointed!!!

Anyone who goes there MUST order the Crispy Beef. Honest to god it is AMAZING. So flavourful, tender and perfectly sauced. Not the least bit chewy or rubbery. We never order beef with any Asian dishes but Lotus Garden is the exception. 

Singapore noodles were as expected and yummy. Still not quite sure about the Manchurian Chicken Chow Mein it wasn't our favourite but we were glad to try it. 

We live around the corner and ordered delivery. It took just under an hour, which we were prepared for so that was fine. Cash only for delivery. 

It's so nice to have found a (Indian) Chinese food place that uses fresh ingredients and is not overly greasy. We will be back!!!
