ro-4-3USXvGKnp07BrxSKg Tried this place few times (dinner and lunch buffet). With so many Indian restaurants sprouting up in this area, i am surprised that they feel no need to provide quality food and service. This one is the worst. Their dum biryani is the most sub-standard biryani. Other items i have tried here are no better

Another restaurant to cross out.
