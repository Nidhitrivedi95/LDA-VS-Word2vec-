gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA This food stinks and the service is worse than that. I don't even know where to start. All the food was cold and what really ticked me off is they don't serve water when you order. Not a fucking cup of water ?!?! Are you serious? This is Las Vegas first of all and second of all after spending 60+ dollars at your restaurant you can't give me a fucking cup of water? Smh I don't even want to continue writing or it'll be bad.

I'm back here for dinner with my family. Decided to give another try. And bunch of sh** still don't offer water. Bought 50$ worth of food asked for water and they say "here is a cup there's a water fountain by the bathroom" freaking a-holes. I won't be giving my business to people like this ever again. "Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me."  Villa pizza right next door gave me 5 cups of nice iced water with no hesitation. On top of that you can tell the food is old and its served cold. The sauces taste like the frozen ready to eat sauces you can get at any Indian market. Learn how to run your business. Sorry not sorry.
