PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q Maybe I went on an off night, or maybe I shouldn't have gotten the buffet, but it really wasn't that great. The Naan was rock hard, most of the food items weren't fresh; and well, it was just Meh. I'll try it again and order off their vast menu which hopefully will result in a better quality of food.
