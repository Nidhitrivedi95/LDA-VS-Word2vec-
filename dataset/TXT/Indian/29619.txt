JVxsZRI5XX9611xg5qzTrg Affordable prices and great taste for Briyani! They have daily specials so there are many varieties to choose from. This place is more for take out since its a small restaurant. Service and staff are friendly with explaining and recommending what is good on the menu. I would recommend this place for those wanting good Briyani for under $5!
