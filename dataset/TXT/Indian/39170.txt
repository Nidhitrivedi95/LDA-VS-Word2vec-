oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw Gotta say, I was so very disappointed with the food and service at The Mad Greek last night.  Starting with the drink delivery - which was slow, slow, slow, and the appetizers that arrived cool (and that included the Saginaki that, by definition should be hot given that it's flamed).  Only three of the four diners received water and silverware.

On to dinner - again - all the dishes arrived and were tepid at best - the tzaziki sauce was thin and unimpressive.  The wait staff never checked back to see if we liked the food, to refill drinks or water.  To top it if - despite saying I was picking up the check, the delivered the check to the only man at the table - OMG how 50's is that.

All in all - this restaurant could pay closer attention to the food coming out hot, and do some training for the wait staff.  I used to go to this restaurant in its first incarnation on Coventry - and I gotta say the years and the move have not improved The Mad Greek.
