P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA This place is FANTASTIC... I've been coming here now for 5+ years and I've never been disappointed here. EVER.

The owner/manager is an incredibly nice man who you can tell cares a lot about his restaurant & patrons.

YES, the food is amazing... I actually think of this place at least once a week... I have an unhealthy obsession with the sweet & spicy Indian Pickles that are served at the lunch buffet...

After trying basically every good Indian & Pakistani restaurant in T.O., There's only 2 places I'll go to - India Palace & Lahore Tikka House.

India Palace WILL NOT disappoint!!!!
