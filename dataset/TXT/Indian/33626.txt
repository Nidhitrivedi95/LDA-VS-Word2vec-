lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw It was date nite with our friends and decided on Kobe ... To start with the initial 3 star rating did not set expectations high.

However, the service was amazing from Megan (spelling?) who knew the restaurant menu from heart and made some recommendations, ALL of which were superb.  The Manager was handling his customers knowing that 50% of your reputation is customer experience, which proved that attention to detail, always smiling and actually listening to customers will only make his business grow.

The food, was really really good as the portions were generous, the sauces depending on your choice were tasty and flavourful, and the multitude of toppings were perfectly portioned.  

We started with the lollipop chicken. While I have had this appetizer at other restaurants, the chicken was fully cooked, crispy and the Szechuan spicy sauce for dipping really made it enjoyable to eat. The two sizzlers, one with chicken and one with beef with two different choices of sauces were portioned well enough for four (4) adults. The flavour was really good and the accompaniments were plentiful, especially the mushrooms with the beef and the vegetables with the chicken.  

To wash this food down, I had the blue Margarita  which was sooo good. My friend had the Pina Colada which was very refreshing. 

Finally the dessert, brownie sizzler sitting on top
of pineapple rings accompanied with two scoops of ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce at the table was a nice finish to our date nite dinner.

Highly recommend for the service, hospitality and delicious food.
