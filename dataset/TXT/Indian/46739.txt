t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I love this place.. Come here about every other week. The food is absolutely amazing. We normally get the same thing, but we have tried most of the menu.. The service is wonderful, staff is super friendly. 
Chicken tikka, bullet naan (yummmm), vegetable briyani..
I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves Indian food!!!
