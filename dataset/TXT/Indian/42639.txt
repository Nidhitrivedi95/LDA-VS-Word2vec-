Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ The food here was really, really good. The best Indian style food I've had in Montréal so far.

I ordered my vegetarian go-to: shahi paneer, palao rice, and samosa. I was not disappointed. Particularly good was the channa samosa; I hadn't had it served "wet" before. Very, very good. The palao was tasty too.

The service was also good and (who I assume is) the proprietor was friendly and helpful. They also have a gigantic goldfish that I'm kind of a fan of after sitting next to him/her at dinner. :)
