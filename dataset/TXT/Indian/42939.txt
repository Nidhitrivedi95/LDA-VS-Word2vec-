RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I love this restaurant.  My husband and I eat lunch here a few times a month.  We are on a limited budget and its a real treat for us to go out to lunch and really never going anywhere but Blue Taj.  Why risk it?  
A staff member we particularly love, Bim filled us in on how the food is so wonderfully flavored, all the spices are hand tempered.  Yeah what dedication and devotion they have to their high quality of food.   The flavors of their dishes are incredible and everyone we've recommended Blue Taj to looovvvve it.
