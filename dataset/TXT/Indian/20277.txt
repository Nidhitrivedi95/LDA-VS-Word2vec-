fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Great value for your money! Don't let the exterior fool you. It may look grungy on the outside but the inside is nice and clean. We came for lunch on a Sunday and we were seated immediately. 

The service was great! The waiters were kind and attentive, bringing out  fresh naan, clearing plates, and filling our cups with water often. 

The food was pretty good. My personal favourites are the butter chicken and the tandoori chicken. My sister noted that they didn't have the cauliflower and eggplant curry she liked today but that didn't matter much. The rest of the food was a hit or miss based on personal preference but I just stuffed myself on the chicken. 

Only downsides are the selections arent huge but you really get what you pay for. The buffet area was just a tiny bit cramped when more people started rolling in after 1 but overall it's a really good restaurant. I recommend you give this place a try!
