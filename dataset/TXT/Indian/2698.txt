07ZateHZK5iqMxNs3g3r6Q This restaurant has horrible food....nothing close to authentic Indian/Pakistani food.  The buffet costs 11.99 and not worth the price.  Dishes are bland and ingredients seem to be of a poor quality.  Being a native Asian, I have to say...huge disappointment!  Fresh naan is the best thing on the menu.
