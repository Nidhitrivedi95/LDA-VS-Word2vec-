B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog A gem in the streets of Old Montreal!  The owner Faruk is the best!   Service is unmatched and highly personal.  A beautiful location and ambience to match!  All the senses are turned on from the second you walk in.  Aromatic herbs and spices tantalize your sense of smell; Background music takes your subconscious to India; Eyes investigate and take in the beautiful and authentic artwork; Taste buds beg for more....from the homemade mango chutney (to die for) to the pakoras to the aloo ghobi and tandoori chicken....each dish outdoes one another!    Philadelphia (and south Jersey!) will definitely be back!
