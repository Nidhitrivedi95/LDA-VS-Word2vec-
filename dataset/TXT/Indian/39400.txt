OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I love Hakka food (Chili Chicken is easily in my top 5).  Lin Garden is probably the closest Hakka restaurant to me.  It's a decent place, not Frederick good, but decent. 

Pros:
Good portions for price
10% off on take out if paying by cash

Cons:
Nothing spectacular
Decor could really use an update

I try to be fair when rating Hakka places because I love Frederick and it sets the bar really high.  Lin Garden has been around for ages and is one of the older Hakka establishments in Toronto.  They have a loyal following as they are the only Hakka restaurant in the area.  Every time I go, the place is busy with people eating in and taking out.

So Chili Chicken is probably the dish mostly everyone judges at a Hakka restaurant. I get this every time I go out for Hakka. Lin Garden's version is pretty good.  You get a very good portion for the price you pay. It's nowhere near the spiciness I want it though. For the most part, Lin Garden's dishes are good.  They'er nothing spectacular, but they won't really be horrible either. 

Presentation is not a strong point here.  I think this place presents itself like a no frills place to just come, eat, and leave.  I think though, if you are a sit down place that you bring family to, presentation goes a long way.  Some of the decor looks like it hasn't been updated in years.  

All in all though, Lin Garden is a solid Hakka restaurant.  When I crave Hakka and don;t want to drive all the way to Markham, Lin Garden is usually where I end up going.  Remember to pay by cash when ordering take out and you will get a 10% discount.
