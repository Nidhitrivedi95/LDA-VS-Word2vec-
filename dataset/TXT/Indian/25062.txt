H4YK4AK3TimOFmv9GtqPGQ I ordered delivery from them and the food came without any cutlery and plates. In spite of me explicitly asking for it which I have never had to do before. I called back and was told they will TRY to send it in. 45 mins later no sign of it and when I am calling back they don't even pick up now. The whole idea of delivery was that I did not want to have to go out and now I am doing just that to go buy disposable plates and spoons. I understand that people make mistakes but leaving someone lurching with full knowledge of your mistake is just not the right thing to do.
