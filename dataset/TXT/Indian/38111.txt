ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw One of the best indian meals I've ever had, hands down. This place is as tasty as they come, and they make it spicy!

Added props for the beer selection (not amazing, but lightyears beyond other indian restaurants). They have a few belgians, some craft brews, and of course Indian beers.

I can't wait to go back to this place next time I'm stuck in vegas thanks to a tradeshow.
