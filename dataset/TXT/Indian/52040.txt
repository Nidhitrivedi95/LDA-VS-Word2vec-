We had the chicken tikka masala which was amazing, the salad with tandoori chicken, na'an bread and the chicken tandoori. Every single dish was absolutely amazing, the whole family agreed on 5 stars. There were multiple people coming around to refill drinks and get you anything else you may need, the owner came by multiple times to make sure everything was great, just as he promised it would be. This is a must try for people just visting from out of town or the locals, just east of the strip (Las Vegas Blvd).
