ffWkln-XUcOyh_K9SK5oBQ Annapurna is a pleasant vegetarian south Asian restaurant on Bathurst just south of DuPont. It's bright spacious and cheery inside, with pleasant smells of warm spices. Surprisingly it never seems busy because the food is tasty and reasonably priced. I always have an iced chai with soy milk. The specials never disappoint. Staff is pleasant and helpful. It's not fancy and there's no attempt at cliched Indian decor but the food is tasty and healthy.
