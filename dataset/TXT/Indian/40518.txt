PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ When you have a craving for Indian food, Bombay Mahal will deliver. We got there 30 minutes before the kitchen closes and the restaurant was full packed! As soon as you walk in the restaurant, you will be hit with all the aromas this wonderful cuisine has to offer. We ordered wayyy too much food for two people! We were very hungry after our Ali Wong show lol!

Dal soup
Chana samosa
Fish pakora
Lamb vindaloo 
Shrimp curry
Chicken tikka
Some eggplant dish
Rice pulao
Lamb thali
Naan 

Everything was DELICIOUS! Salty, oily and so spicy we were sweating like if it rained on us. We had so much food that we had another dinner with the leftover :)  All that food for 100$ taxes and tips included. Dirt cheap!!! It's also a BYOB. Service is very friendly and fast. It is out of my way (about 35 minutes) but so worth it!
