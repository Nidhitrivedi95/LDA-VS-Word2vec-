c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg After craving for some South India food and being disappointed by many restaurants I came upon this place.

During the first visit I had the Veg. thali and Mr. H had the Uttappam. We also tried the Mutton Sukka and they were all delicious. The Mutton Sukka actually would make me come back... again and again.

During the second visit Mr. H and I both tried their biriyani's (Chicken and Mutton) and Oh My God! It was the best thing ever! The rice was so soft and moist, the mutton would melt in your mouth and the spicy flavour was just right. 

Once again however, my food was better than Mr. H's, he did like his Chicken Biriyani a lot but the Mutton was awesome. Their service is pretty good and fast.

Next time I try the fish biriyani. :)
