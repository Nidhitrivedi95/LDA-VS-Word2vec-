QL7FeE8Izak6xi0GG-SnJg My bf and I went here on a whim, based on a few Yelp reviews.

When we first walked in, the restaurant was completely deserted. Which usually scares the crap out of me. The lone employee explained that their A/C had broken down for a few days and had literally JUST been repaired as we walked in. Phew.

We ordered from the basic looking menu, again, not quite sure what to expect. We apparently over ordered as we were unsure of portion sizes, so overcompensated by buying too much naan. But, since when is that a bad thing?

 Food came out amazingly fresh and made to order. We ordered the lamb korma, karhai chicken and channa masala, plus both regular and garlic naan. Oh man! The lamb korma was amazing! Hitting a nice balance between creamy and sour, with fork tender meat. I found the channa masala a little heavy for my liking, but was still very delicious.

That night, I texted everyone in my family to visit Bhaijaanz for delicious Indian food. You should go too!
