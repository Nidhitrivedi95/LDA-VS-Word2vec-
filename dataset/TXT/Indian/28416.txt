J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ After my first time here last week, I still can't stop thinking about how amazing the butter chicken is. It's just the right amount of sweet.

I visited on an empty stomach, so naturally I wanted to load up on healthy stuff first. Which of course, this place satisfied the criteria. The house salad and dressing was delish (light balsamic-style with flavours of onion) and the oranges were nicely sliced into thin  discs. And the pineapple was good too!

Then I moved onto the veggie dishes -- curried peas, green beans, etc. Sorry, I can't remember much of this...blame it on the butter chicken. It was the headliner. 

And for $11.99? C'mon, what more can you ask for. They've been getting accolades for years now!

I will be back. With guests. With an emptier stomach.
