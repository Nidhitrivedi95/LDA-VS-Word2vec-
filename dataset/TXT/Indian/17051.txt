DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Can't say enough good things about this place.  The Murgh Makhani is my absolute favorite dish there....mmmm.  Every dish I've had here has never dissapointed...I love that this place popped up out of nowhere and I will continue to explore the menu finding my favorites. I've been here 6 or 7 times.  I would have given the 5 stars EXCEPT the Kulfi trio was really lame.  Come on guys, really !?  "tiny tiny plastic to go salsa thingys"  It was like those tiny jello shot holders.  I would hope the naan consistecy gets better...its been hit or miss.  Overall great, great food and the staff really seem to care.  The customer service is excellent!
