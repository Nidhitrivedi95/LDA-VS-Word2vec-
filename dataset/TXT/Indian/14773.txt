cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw This is my absolute favourite restaurant in Mississauga.  I go so often my clothes smell of tandoor. I rave about this place to all my friends and family.  I've had pretty much everything on the menu several times and I'm never disappointed.  The best Bihari kabob, reshma kabob, garlic naan, and chicken tikka you can find.  Takes awhile since everything is made fresh and to order.  I can wait hours for this food and I do.  I highly recommend it
