Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I've been trying to support this place since it opened in my neighborhood. They had some real service problems at the beginning which seems do improve, but the food was pretty good so I tried to give a chance to grow.

Things were better for a while but on a recent visit, a Sunday evening, the service was just horrible. The server really didn't know how to manage the few tables that were filled, took her at least 20 minutes to bring drinks! After an hour of waiting for food and at least four other parties coming in, waiting and giving up, we also gave up.
Lot's of people came in and out during our wait to pick up carry out orders; maybe that's what they should stick with because their dining room service is awful.
