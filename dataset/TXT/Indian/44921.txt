We tried the lunch buffet here & it had lots of option for Vegetarian & non vegetarian. Food was reasonably priced & tasted good. On another day we tried their Ala crate menu as well & it was also good & well priced. Servers here are extremely friendly & help you out to pick right dishes. Big thumbs up.
