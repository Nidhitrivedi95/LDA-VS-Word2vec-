hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Soooo my husband and I just relocated here to Vegas from Atlanta and we love it here. Just so happens that I had a taste for some indian food. So I found this on yelp. This is literally 5 minutes from my house. The food was delicious. I got the tandoori chicken, vegetable samosas, naan bread, then I desired something a little sweet so for dessert I had the galub jamun (which were great, just simply two small round balls drenched in rose syrup). This place has a very nice small intimate setting and everyone is nice. Can't wait to go back!!!
I will try the chicken tikka masala!!!!!!
