pns5NH--mhuCC1vK-xbYsA Located within a shopping mall, Biryani is easy to find and parking is plenty. It's entrance could use a facelift, but as you enter the restaurant you'll notice that decor is not its priority nor is it their focus.

I had visited this location once before, several months ago, but I can't remember how I liked the food. The manager that day was very accommodating to my vegetarian requests and I remember that mainly, enough of a reason to visit this restaurant again. 

As soon as I walked in, I was seated and my order was promptly taken. There's playful Punjabi music playing in the background, making the wait for my veg. thali (with ghobi substituted for chana) more relaxing.

I've written all of this while waiting for my food, so the rest of this review's tone will be entirely targeted at the quality of the food and its taste. My credentials are that I was born in India and eat Indian food regularly.

...15minutes later, my thali arrives with a basket of naan, everything just as I ordered. Considering the taste of the food is fresh, I consider 15 mins totally worth it. I came at a non-busy hour however, lucky for me.

I set the spice level of the food to 7, and it was perfect for me. If my girlfriend came with me, I would definitely go for an 8 and order some raita. The food was wonderful. It had that home-cooked element to it, and although it used oils, it wasn't soaked in it. I'd recommend the aloo ghobi and the khadai paneer any day. The palak paneer was also made well, but I am not a huge fan of the creaminess, just a matter of preference. My personal notes: next time skip the palak and ask for the ghobi to be cooked with light oil.

Food was so good, I ordered some vegetable biryani to go,  which arrived rather quickly. I wouldn't say this is the fanciest spot ever, but they have great service and provide great tasting Indian food, and I look forward to coming back.
