PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ A buffet is a great place to get a taste (an introduction) to a new cuisine, and that's what it is...The food was a bit on the salty side and the carbs fill you up quite fast. The variety was limited and after a round or two the selections seems repetitive. I enjoyed their briyani and meatier dishes. I find their pricing steep and services aren't always that responsive. Overall, it's a nice change of pace but not place I'd choice on an everyday basis.
