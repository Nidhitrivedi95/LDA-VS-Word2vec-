-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q So so good. Went with 3 people total and ordered 3 different dishes and a bowl of rice. Got the chicken masala, vegetable mango and one other dish. We also got garlic naan. The food was plenty for the 3 of us and we even had extra to go. Really you can't go wrong, the waiter we had was awesome and gave great descriptions of everything. I would highly recommend Mirch Masala.
