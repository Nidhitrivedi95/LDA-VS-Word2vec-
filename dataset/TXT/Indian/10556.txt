A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA When I have a craving for Indian, I make a point of heading out to Udupi Palace to get my fill. I believe this is Toronto's only vegetarian Indian restaurant (please correct me if i'm wrong, i'm always looking for more!) and their menu selections offer a great deal for vegans too.

The menu is quite large, so it's often the case where i'll order a lot more than i'll be capable of eating. My usual mistake is trying to get a good variety of appetisers, but many are just too dense or oily in large quantities to have in addition to a main.

The dosas at Udupi Palace are basically what drives me to visit - so many varieties to choose from! And you can get a nice bit of heat with the Mysore dosa. For spectacle alone I generally lean toward a paper dosa. If you can bring yourself to order outside the dosa section, they have a small selection of curries and their breads are amazing. I'm not much of a fan of the Uthapam, I find if I want something heavier i'd rather a curry/bread combo.

The food can be quite rich, but it's definitely great to occasionally calm the Indian food cravings. Surroundings are very basic, but the servers are friendly and helpful and the location smack bang in Little India is easy enough to get to.
