qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA meh. the drinks are cheap enough-- not CHEAP but not overpriced. service is basically non-existent. the food? ugh. i ate here and stupidly ordered Pad Thai. It was pad thai noodles with tomato sauce. seriously. ugh. 

also they only accept cash? for such a large bar i really don't understand how they can get away with that. 

basically its a nice central place for U of T students to gather. i'm sure i'll be back a few times, but i won't be eating there again.
