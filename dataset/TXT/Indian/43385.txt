rLmUtrlEZO4BkyaAH_jQCQ I am a newcomer in Edinburgh and I live near by. I tried Guru for the first time today (take away) and I am definitely a fan and will be coming back often. The lamb passanda that I had was superb! I tried the garlic naan and it is huge as others also say. However, I think it could have been tastier. Next time I will try the Guru naan. I also tried the tandoori chicken from the starters and it was also very good. 

Rating: Food quality which is what really matters is a 5 out of 5. Price-wise though it is a bit expensive for take away; I would give it a 4 out of 5. The staff was also very friendly; 5 out of 5 easily. Overall the first impression is a restaurant well worth 5 stars! (I am rounding up a little bit; it is worth it as it is so close to my flat.)

I will update this review periodically with further recommendations.
