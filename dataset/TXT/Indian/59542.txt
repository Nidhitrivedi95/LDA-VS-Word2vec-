ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ Normally having to drive 15 miles for Indian food I really wanted to like this place. Food is tasty enough but on the not spicy side. Which was a plus as I had to ask multiple times to get a drink. They brought us some disgusting Indian pancake things. The naan and rice are plain and disappointingly boring compared to anywhere else I've ever ate.  But the butter chicken and 555 chicken were tasty enough. I got some biryani chicken after seeing raved reviews and was disappointed how unspicy it was.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone but a beginner who feared the spicy. Holy non spicy tandoori this place is also overpriced on weekends.  Went from a two star to a one.
