XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Don't tell "momma" India but I've had better roti.

It may be because I'm biased that I love my west indian roti better. It may be that the medium heat, which even our server claimed would be pretty hot, did nothing for my spicy tastebuds. It may even be that after I was done eating, I was craving roti.

Meh, it's all of the above.

I did really sense the flavour. The chicken roti was more temperature hot than spicy. It felt like it needed a kick of something. I didn't mind the thinness but it just felt like something was missing. I didn't finish it all and it's not just because I was full. It left me wanting. I think for good roti, I'll stay on the Bloor subway line route.

I almost feel like there's a story behind the metal cups. They intrigue me.

I did love the server though and his account of being robbed. It wasn't really funny but him telling it with a smile on his face made it funny.

5 stars for Yelpers as usual. I love sitting back & listening to the various stories and jokes. This night did not disappoint in that department. Honourable mentions to everyone on my end of the table.
