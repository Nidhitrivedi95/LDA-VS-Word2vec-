uqPHO-o4stxGXLdxP3WNig This is one of the pathetic restaurant in the town. 

Worst Service:-I ordered chicken biryani for take away and they took my order over the phone. I went to pick up after 30 minutes of placing the order and yet I had to wait for another 40-45 minutes. My advice to Dakshin Staff, If you did not had the Biryani you shouldn't take order from customer. They accepted my order and after reaching only they said we have Dakshin Special Biryani at the same price $12.99. Dakshin will never say no to your order and offer you something weird just to make money.

Terrible Taste:-About the Biryani I can only say it was one the worst Biryani's I ever had. For the name of Dakshin Special Biryani, they mixed chicken curry and rice along with pickle spices. We were not able to eat even half box. 

Overcharge :- They said $12.99 per box, but they charged me $14.99 and that's what appearing in my credit card statement. No tip was given by me as it was take away order. So basically they are cheating customer as well. 

This is not my first and last experience with terrible food quality of Dakshin. I went there for couple of times and experienced same bad quality food. Avoid this place.
