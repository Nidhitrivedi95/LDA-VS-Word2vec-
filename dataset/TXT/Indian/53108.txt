vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg I walked into Waterfalls late on a rainy Sunday evening when almost nothing else was open in Kensington Market, so they got points for being available right off the bat, and I was looking for Indian food so that made me even happier. Given it was empty the service was attentive and good, though it was of course not possible to judge that dimension under regular conditions.

I had two glasses of the M.S. Organic beer, which was smooth and light as promised, and which I enjoyed immensely! I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, which was good but not amazing, naan, which was hot and excellent, white basmati rice, again hot and just right, and some mango chutney, which was brought in a nice amount. I finished the meal, which I savored and enjoyed every bite of by the way, with a pot of very good, hot chai tea, and a great desert recommended by the waiter, Rasmalai (a cottage cheese-like, sweet white desert with some chopped pistachios), which was cool and creamy and wonderful!

All in all a wonderful place which I would send others too, without suggesting it was the ONLY place to go if it were too busy for example.
