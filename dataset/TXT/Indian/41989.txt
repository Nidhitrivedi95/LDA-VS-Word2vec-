qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA If you're looking for cheap, decent food and somewhere to get drunk - good place. If you're looking for friendly staff, quick and reliable service, and an atmosphere for a quiet night out - bad place. I'm torn because the food was pretty good so clearly the kitchen staff is alright, but the front staff is hard to find, hard to communicate with, and at times downright rude. Food was good enough that I'll give them a second chance, but I won't be expecting any smiles or greeting as I walk in this time.
