86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ I was fortunate enough to be invited to their grand opening several months ago, and then when Imran N planned a UYE here back in October I got to re-sample a large portion of their menu to be 100% on my thoughts. Overall pretty good, with a few mishaps but overall worth the visit if you've never had Indian Fusion cuisine before.

It's a smaller location, but well laid out, near the Shepperd and Yonge area in North York. This location is the relaunch of this international brand after two previously mismanaged locations in Thornhill and Mississauga failed. The true visionary (Alfie) behind bringing Nawab back to Toronto is a generous and kind business man who knows exactly what it takes to make this business work. 

Here is a run down of what we got to eat and my thoughts on each as we tried them:

- Nawab Garlic Balls - pretty good, very nice flavour

- Mumbai Lollipop - very similar to a chicken wing with Indian flavour

- Green Poutine - Not very good, this dish is Indian trying too hard to be North American cusiine, the general concensus with our group was that this dish was lost on us, not a real fit

- Pulled Lamb Slider - it was mostly bread and is less a slider and more a pulled lamb naan sandwich. Good taste overall.

- Seekh Kabob Beef - this dish was a major fail, it needs to be reworked. Extremely dry and over cooked

- Channa Masala - this was a good dish, I enjoyed the flavour on this

- Saffron Chicken - This was their signature dish that they pride themselves on, it's similar to butter chicken but with a healthier take. I enjoy this, would definitely come back for this

- Gulub Jamun - a very sweet dessert but most folks in our group loved this, I could eat one but more than that and I'd be in a sugar come ha ha

I'll likely return when in the area and perhaps with a larger portion I'll be able to properly rate/improve their review rating. 

Eatcrest Out!
