epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg I'm addicted to the Roti here! I get takeout whenever I'm in the area, I can't resist. I usually go dairy free, so the chicken curry and Ali gobi rotis are my choice. I take it home for my boyfriend and I to share and we get 2 meals each out of it (for $20!) great deal and delicious. 

My one complaint is that twice in a row I've ordered the mango chutney and it tasted very strange. Almost "chemically" is the only way I know how to describe it. Very disappointing as I love chutney! But I survived because the rotis are good on their own.
