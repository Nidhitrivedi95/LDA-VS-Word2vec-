idrN6XWKErG6nKDsEMNbOQ Dirty place but the goat curry was good and the naan was delicious!!! They need to really stock up on everything and the food needs a better heating system. I would come here again but right when they open to get the freshest, unpicked through food. The people that come here are obviously all Indian and very bottom of the barrel. I felt comfortable eating only in the "fine dining" section because the small section where they put everyone for buffet was a complete and utter disaster to say the least. Tables were all left unclean and it's obvious the waitress doesn't like to clean at all, or for that matter, offer beverages. I would have given a 1 star if i wasn't jonsing for the goat curry, spinach sauce, and naan constantly....
