S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Tonight I went with my family to Gandhi for Indian food that was excellent  experience because what we order was so tasty and outstanding. Paneer tikka, tandoori chicken, dal makhni was so tasty and paneer tikka masala was mouth watering. Gandhi naan are always best one In whole vegas. Gandhi food  is excellent food and it remind me of India food .Gandhi staff was good in service and the owner was very friendly. Crystal and Paul was very friendly and helpful for everything. My daughter loved paneer tikka because it's made as per her choice taste. I would love to   recommend my friends  to visit Gandhi Cuisine food when they come to Vegas . I LOVE GANDHI CUISINE FOOD.
