PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q I went here with my best friend for the lunch buffet. The food was really well seasoned and delicious! The naan was like perfectly cooked, and they had a large selection of vegetarian dishes (great for me since I am one). I think it's a really good deal, definitely stop by if you are in Oakland.
