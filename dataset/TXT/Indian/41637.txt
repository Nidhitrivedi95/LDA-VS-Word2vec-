Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Seemed to have pivoted from Indian food to Hakka - which is an Indian twist on Chinese food. Nice atmosphere and good portions. The mango salad rocked but I found the entrees a little too glutinous.

One request - please tune out the banal Bollywood music and bring in some soothing Indian Classical or even new age stuff like Krishna Das.
