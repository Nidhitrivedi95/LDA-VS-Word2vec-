I am not a big fan of their curries... they are alright, but the BBQ/tandoori dishes are very good for the price. The taste may not be what you are used to from other Pakistani joints, and that could be due to the Bangladeshi influence. Very similar though. 

I've never had anything delivered, so I can't comment on that. Pick up is probably thr best option.
