UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Ordered delivery this evening and I was very unimpressed. Firstly, the driver called us complaining that Bathurst st was closed at queen and could we tell him how to get there? Then he told us that he would just drive to Queen and we could walk 2 blocks to come and pick it up. Uh... No. My boyfriend told him that Bathurst was open south of Queen and that he could find his way here on the side streets. 

When the food arrived it looked ok. We ordered the Saag Paneer, Butter Chicken, Lamb Madras and Bhartha. To be honest, none of it tasted that great. All if the respective meat dishes were moist, but the sauces all had a consistency that was a little unpleasant. The bharta tasted smoky, but almost artificial and one if the dishes had whole back cardamom pods on it. Unlike their green counterparts, they can a little nasty when they break open in your mouth.

It was nice that they included papadam with the order. Overall, though, I wouldn't visit Banjara again after this experience. I really liked their food the last time I went. Maybe because it was really spicy, but I remember it being much better than this. Almost hard to believe this food came from the same restaurant.
