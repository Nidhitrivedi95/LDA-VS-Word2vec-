0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Ambience: Interiors are neat & clean. Exterior is like old restaurant. What it means, if you are trying to impress someone not recommended.  

Service: Good service, hot naan served as soon as it was ordered. Wait time less than 5min. Recommendation, soiled plates to be removed immediately. 

Price: Average 14$ per person. Similar to veg buffet prices in most of in town restaurants. (Ordered buffet for four, special order of garlic naan, 3 coke & Indian tea).

Food:
Naan: Was Good, can be better by adding little more garlic and making it crispy or well done. 
We ordered veg buffet, it included 6 curries, snack, plain rice. 

Taste: Simple and tasty food. Not very greasy or spicy. It's more like how you find in Indian home. 

Overall: 
Will I visit this restaurant again? yes only with family. 

Will I order for party? Probably not because it tastes like simple, tasty home made food and nothing special which i can bring to party. 

Will I visit this place with guests? Not sure, as there are other good restaurants in town which are close to shopping places.
