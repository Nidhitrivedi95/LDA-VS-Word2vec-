UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA The worst restaurant and service I have encountered . The service is so bad , made us wait for 1 hour . After the wait , they served us cold food and the appetizers were old old and the chicken they served is literally like rubber . The beer served was not good . On the whole we wasted so much time in Vegas on this restaurant . I am extremely disappointed . Will never recommend this place . If Yelp had a zero star I would prefer that .waste of time and money .
