As such it doesn't offer the nearly standard lunch buffet and features higher prices than you might come to expect.

What it does offer is very good food and a very nice atmosphere if you are into that sort of thing.

My Chicken Tikka Masala was "above average", as were the samosas and our side order of butter paneer. Wife wasn't as impressed with her vegetarian dumplings. 

3 1/2 stars tipping just toward 4.
