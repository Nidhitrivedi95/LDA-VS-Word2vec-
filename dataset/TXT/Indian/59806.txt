ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg A bit of a drive for us but so worth it! Goat curry, lamb rogan josh, chicken tikka masala, naan, basmati rice, and the combo appetizer plate.  Beat we've had in town.   Service was impeccable.  So much on the menu we still want to try. Hubby will be spending a lot of lunches there for the buffet I am afraid.
