Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ Chicken masala takeout is what I ordered. My very first time here and first time eating Indian food. It was really good. Definitely come here again and will try other options. 
P.s. I wish that photo of the dead fly, on the side of the plate would get taken down. It is very unappealing and really, it could've noted on their comment instead of taking a disgusting picture and posting it on here.
