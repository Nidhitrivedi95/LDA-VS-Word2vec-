QT4Ub4DlaDX52vdnKutD0A The food is genuinely priced but terrible and bland.
The paneer tikka masala was so sour that it was inedible. The veg biriyani was terrible that we had to leave it there after a spoon. The only thing that was better were naan and the fruit custard. The service was  so bad. The guy almost threw the fork n spoon to the table. I will never go back to this place. Nor I will never recommend it to anyone. Stay away from this place.

I really wish I could give 0 stars. :(
