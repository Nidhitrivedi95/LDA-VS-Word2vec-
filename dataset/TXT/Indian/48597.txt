tQH_DyUIWYOHMD7CYg6-jQ Despite the name Hakka Wok, I much prefer the Thai dishes such as Green Curry Chicken, Basil Beef, Pad Thai and Tom Yum soup.  The owners used to operate a Thai restaurant, hence the number of Thai dishes offering.

The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. You get a 10% discount if you pay cash for takeout for order over $20.

Try the lunch specials, too as they offer Thai, Hakka and Chinese dishes for less than $7 with a drink.

Service is friendly and very prompt!
