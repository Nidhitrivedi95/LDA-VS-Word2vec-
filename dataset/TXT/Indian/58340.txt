YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ I am so glad this place renovated, it looks out of place in Parc Ex.

It used to be so cold in the winter here, I would have to put on my jacket while eating.

They specialize in south Indian Cuisine, so typically much spicier. 
That was the only downside, it was not spicy enough.

I had the butter chicken thali, I know it's not supposed to be spicy, but it should not be sweet either.
The rice was a bit under-cooked and the potato dish was a bit too sour.
My friend had the lamb curry thali and he said the same thing.

The dosa was really good though, I get it every time I come here, The sambar really warmed me up on a cold day and the potato filling was a delight. 

Chand Palace was better last time, thali wise.

If I go back, i'll explore the menu a bit more and get other stuff, I rarely get thali since it seems to be cooked for people that don't like spicy foods.

The service was quick and efficient and the restaurant was full on dec 23, when the whole city seemed dead.

The decor is quite nice and the prices are pretty good (they did not really jack up the prices for the renovations)
