HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Just alright Indian food located in the basement of an office building on the east side (for real).  Must be the scarcity of Indian food in Cleveland that made this place packed on a Friday evening at around 8:30, because the food was nothing special.  I had my usual, the malai kofta, and my wife had her usual, mattar paneer, but found that both were a little too tomato-y for our liking.  The samosas were fantastic and the duo of sauces they bring out (the seemingly traditional tamarind chutney and then the mint-cilantro-onion green sauce) were exceptional, especially the mint-cilantro-onion sauce.  It was chunkier than most other Indian places I've been and had just the right mix of spice and coolness that I spread it on my garlic naan.

  Outside of the samosas and sauce, nothing really to write home about.  The service, while pleasant, was painfully slow and we sat for between 15-20 minutes before the waitress came over to our table.  We'll continue to look elsewhere in our new hometown for the go-to Indian place.
