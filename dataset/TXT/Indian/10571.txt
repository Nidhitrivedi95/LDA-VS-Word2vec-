A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA I'm a carnivore and I LOVE this veggy place. Plenty of amazing tasting selections to satisfy even the meatiest of meat eaters. My only feedback would be to refresh the tables and seating as it makes the place appear plain and tired. Even still, it will not deter me from coming back for more!
