Or maybe because I live in Boston where we are really lacking good, authentic Indian food.  But we absolutely loved the food here, which can be very surprising for a buffet.  So many choices and everything was delicious.  I have been craving it ever since and been so disappointed not to be able to find anything similar locally.  Next time we're in Montreal we will definitely go back!
