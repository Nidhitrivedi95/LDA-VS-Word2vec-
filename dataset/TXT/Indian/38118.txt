ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw When I walked into this restaurant I was struck by the ambiance.  The dim romantic lighting, the heavy silk drapery and exotic decor were enticing.  When I opened the menu and saw the rather high prices I thought that the food must be superb.  

Well, in reality the food was just okay.  Nothing spectacular. In fact, the Chicken Curry was dry.   Even though our party of seven ordered seven dishes that were listed as "family style", there was just enough food.  Maybe not even.  I think people were embarrassed to take too much our of the small dishes- as we had to share amongst seven people.  I think that became apparent when everyone was anxious to order extra orders of Naan (break).  

My advice to the owners?  Lower the prices a bit and increase the size of the portions.
