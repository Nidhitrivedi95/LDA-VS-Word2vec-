DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Me and my buddies found this gem coincidentally. The staff here is friendly and helpful, they would explain dishes that you have no clue about. The food here is fantastic and delicious. Indian food is known to be spicy but they always ask you how spicy you want it to match your tastebuds. Highly recommend this place if you're looking to try some Indian cuisine or if you already enjoy it!
