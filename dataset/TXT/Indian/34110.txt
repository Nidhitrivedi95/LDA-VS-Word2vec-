m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Definitely the best Indian restaurant I've been to in CU--though Sitara is pretty close in downtown Urbana. 

Went today for lunch, party of 3. The service as attentive immediately we felt warmly welcomes. It's pretty quiet in the restaurant which I attribute to 1) it's newness and  2) the holiday vacation. The interior is pretty but feels more Spanish than Indian restaurant--but I'm here to talk FOOD. 

Appetizer: Samosa Chaat. Always a personal favorite of mine when it comes to Indian apps. This place doesn't disappoint. The flavors are full and satisfying. In top of that, the onions taste absolutely of onion heaven in all the sauce. Onion lovers, rejoice and scoop up all the bits of leftover onion when the samosa is gone. Non-onion lovers, be nice and let us eat them with gusto.

Drinks: Mango lassi. I love mango lassi, but frequently I find them too sweet with not enough yogurt flavor. Here, the mango lassi is a wonderful in between of sweetness and tart. The presentation is beautiful in a tall and wide glass and you can see the swirls of yogurt still from the fresh glass! 

Entrees: chicken tikka masala, lamb biriyani, fish curry. Great prices. Great portions. Great flavors. What can I say?

Naan: garlic naan. Of course. It comes out to you in a basket and you are just hit with the most wonderous sight of garlicky, carby goodness. They don't skimp on that naan. Praise. Praise be. 

I love coming home to CU and new amazing restaurants. I hope this one will be here to stay!
