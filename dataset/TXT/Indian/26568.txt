And the dish i ordered -- the scallop dish (i forget the name) had so many vegetables in it that it was ridiculous (asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, beans, carrots, tomatoes, onions, green/red peppers...), but amazingly in spite of that it was delicious and well prepared.  The flavors were so appetizing, but not overwhelming. Looking at the prices initially i was apprehensive, but surprisingly, it was actually worth the cost.
