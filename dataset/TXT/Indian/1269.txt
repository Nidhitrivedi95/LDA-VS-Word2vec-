-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg A popular Indian place in Pittsburgh with a combination of hit/miss food and mediocre service.
We visited on a Saturday night and the place was packed. Few of our items took forever to show up.They mixed up some of our items with others and there was some confusion with the final bill.

The only items worth mentioning were pongal(rice cooked with lentils, laden with ghee,peppercons and cashews) and mirchi bajji( chillies stuffed with spices and batter fried). The vegetable cutlet is definitely stale and tasted really bad. Overall,the food and service were sub-par.
