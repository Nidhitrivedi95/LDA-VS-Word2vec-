2k38N8o_4mAVQwZrmBMPzw Mumtaz Mahal is the kind of takeaway joint that tries to please everyone, offering a combination of curries and Indian specialities such as pakora or the super-sweet gulab jamun, as well as standard fast-food offerings such as pizza and burgers.  I guess their hope is that offering such a wide range wiil entice in anyone heading home to Leith after a night out in town, whatever they're after.

All I've tried here is their veggie samosas, and to be honest, I asked for chilli sauce on them, with the result that all I could taste was chilli sauce, leaving me unable to comment in much detail about the subtlety of flavour in the actual samosas!  But there are times when having something simple, hot and spicy can be very satisfying, and, if you're in that kind of mood, Mumtaz Mahal will provide you with what you want cheaply and quickly.
