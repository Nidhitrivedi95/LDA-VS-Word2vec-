zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw I had heard amazing things about this kebab house, but not being a kebab lover myself  I didn't know how to judge it. I was surprised at how tasty the meat was - I didn't think the huge chunk of meat on the spit looked appetizing until it was sliding down my throat.

I must admit I've only been once and it was following a rather liquid lunch, but I'll be back and explore the menu further....but so far so very, very good!
