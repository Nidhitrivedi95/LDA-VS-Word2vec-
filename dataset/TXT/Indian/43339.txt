RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Lamb dish for $24, two vegetable samosas for $7, veggie biryani $19 on lunch menu This I have say was quite pricey. The restaurant was inside Rio Hotel & Casino and I could understand why, the ambiance was elegant. We were there during prime lunch time and there was just one table of customers leaving. They had buffet for $14. I saw the waiter went to the buffet to get the lamb dish I ordered from the menu, he went back to the kitchen and came out after 6mins or so. When I got the bill, 20% was added for gratuity and it was just my father and I, and he should have let us know. I am well-travelled and well-dined and well aware of the tipping etiquette.  however I didn't question the waiter because the food in my opinion were good. I am not sure if I will came back due to the two reasons I mentioned.
