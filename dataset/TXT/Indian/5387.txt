2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw I love this place so, so much. Awesome Indian food for super low prices. $1 for 5 veggie samosas? Sweet Jesus. You could come here with a ten dollar bill and invite all your friends to share with you. (Unless you wanted to eat them all yourself. I would.)

You would think there would be some kind of catch. Is it so cheap because it's mediocre? No friggin' way. You're getting amazing tasting stuff for an equally amazing price. You cannot beat this restaurant.
