KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Super awesome food. The chicken biryani is to die for. I cannot remember the number of times we have taken our food to go from here.

The kathi rolls are awesome too! I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to taste good flavorful Indian food.

So sad that we have now moved from the area and won't be able to take out as often :-(
