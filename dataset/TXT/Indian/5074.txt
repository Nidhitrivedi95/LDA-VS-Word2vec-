2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw Just happened to drop in here tonight with my husband.  Impressed right from the beginning.. We were greeted warmly at the door and shown to our seat by the owner's wife. Very nice atmosphere and extremely hospitable service.  They were setting up for a one man live singing show and the singer was excellent.  We had the lamb chop appetizers which was delicious.  Our mains were prawns made with garlic and butter and I have never tasted more delicious prawns.  They were cooked to perfection and the sauce was delicious.  So flavourful. The other main was the chicken tikka.and that also was very good.  The garlic naan was one of the best I have ever had.  We were impressed with everything.  They paid attention to all the little details and we noticed.  The massala tea was good and was served in teacups that had been heated so the tea stayed hot until the last drink.  Even their plain rice was delicious.. I forgot the name ( it had geera/cumin and I think fried onions and saffron  in it.  Totally impressed.  They have live music from Wed to Sunday and it makes for a nice date night or perfect place to celebrate a birthday with friends and family.  Check it out.
