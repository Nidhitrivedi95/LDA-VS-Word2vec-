b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Really good buffet we had on a Sunday afternoon.  We went instead of watching the Browns game one Sunday because my wife's brother was in town and he doesn't really do football.  Well, the Browns won, so I guess we should have gone back every week to keep that tradition up.

Food was really good and fresh - which is most important with buffets.
