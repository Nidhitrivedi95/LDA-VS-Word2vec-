PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g We went there for Valentine's Day and it SUCKED!

When we walked in for our 9 o'clock reservation we had to wait 15 minutes as apparently "Everyone came in late because of the weather", yes, light drizzle is indeed the kind of weather that makes people come in late. We and 5 more couples were standing in the small doorway waiting until we'll be seated.

Once we were seated we had to wait another 10 minutes for a server to come to our table and ask us for drinks and water. So, in total 25 minutes of waiting, with additional 5 mins until we actually got water. At that point I was boiling with rage and wanted to leave but my bf insisted on staying. 

Then the waiter came by for our food orders, while taking our food order he got distracted and started talking to the people seated at the table beside us. It looked like he was flirting with the guy at the other table. Now, my boyfriend was pissed off too 'cause he was starving. Wouldn't you be after 30 minutes of waiting just to get your water?

While we were eating our food, twice they brought food which we didn't order. Once it was double order of drinks, second time it was the dessert.

So, the overall impression? Highly disappointing. $70/person + drinks + taxes is not worth it!

Would I ever go to this place agagin or recommend it to friends? Nope.
