ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg My boyfriend and I were craving Indian food and read great reviews about Copper. After checking out their menu (which was current!), we made the jump. We drove for an hour to dine here tonight, and we more than just pleasantly surprised. We were floored!

Upon arriving, we were attracted the to quaint outside appearance. The vintage home the restaurant is built inside of is cute and homey but the décor is colorful and modern. We were instantly greeted by the host who had our reservation ready and made welcoming chitchat to us about it being our first time. He also spent the time to tell us a little about Copper's concept, which helped us make our slection.

We shared the Gunpowder Prawns appetizer: the tart granny smith apple paired perfectly with the prawns in a surprising and unique way. My boyfriend stuck with his standby, Tikki Masala, which was complex and rich and a wonderful portion. I dined on Apricot Chicken Tikki, which was invitingly spicy and served with a robust selection of vegetables. We also shared an order of Garlic naan. 

Everything was heavenly. We will definitely be back as soon as a craving for curry hits. Can't be beat!
