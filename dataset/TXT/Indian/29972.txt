JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I went there the other day with my boyfriend. They seem to be under new management and he was extremely nice to us and they had new people. The portions are large and delicious. I highly recommend this Indian buffet during their lunch hours for all you Indian food lovers. The restaurant is very clean and lovely as well. This is now our favorite buffet in the area. The food is the perfect amount of spicy. I always get the chicken tikka masala with white rice and naan.
