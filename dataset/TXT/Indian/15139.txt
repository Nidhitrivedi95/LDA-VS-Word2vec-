CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Was there with a friend for a pre-theater dinner on a Wednesday night. Food was average to even below average, we ordered deven dishes and none of them was anything to rave about. If not for the attentive service, I would have given the place 2 stars...Waiters were working hard to make our dinner enjoyable but the place was only at third of the capacity, so they obviously were not busy. Will not return.
