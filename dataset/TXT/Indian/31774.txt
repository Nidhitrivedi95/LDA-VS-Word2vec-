kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA Kalpna is not a big restaurant but has managed through the years to establish a big name. It is one of the best Indian and veg restaurants in the city. Expect nice food, excellent service and a bit pricey meals but it is all worth the experience. The place is warm and with a homelike air. I strongly recommend it.
