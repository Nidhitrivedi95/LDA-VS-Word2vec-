Wish I could give zero stars. Saw the reviews and was impressed. We went around 7:30 on a Sunday evening and opted for the buffet. The food was lukewarm but tasted ok (nothing incredibly special). I looked to the right and saw a small cockroach crawling on the wall. Called the waiter over and he picked it up with a napkin. Seemed annoyed with the cockroach but not alarmed. No huge apology. Just a quick sorry and walked away. My boyfriend asked for the check and when the waiter brought it to the table I said, "are you seriously going to charge us for dinner when there's a cockroach on your wall?" He muttered no and we left.
