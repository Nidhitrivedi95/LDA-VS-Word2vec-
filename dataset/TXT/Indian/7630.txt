5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ Went there after reading the reviews saying the food is good. My friends and I were thoroughly disappointed. It's terrible food. It's nothing like Indian food should be and the worst part is it's not even fresh. It was so bland and when we asked them to add a little salt they asked us to add it ourselves!! Stay away from this place if you want decent Indian food
