BOFvGNX-64B9Qzck1A-FOg Hindsight is always 20/20, but it doesn't make it less true that Indian Flavour should never have moved out of its heavily trafficked Atrium location to it's dingy current second floor digs a mere block away. 

Visiting on a late afternoon (about the same time I always used to frequent when I was at Ryerson), I found the large dining room almost completely empty. The once incredibly pleasant servers were now sitting around a table, discussing something that was more important than greeting me. 

Once we established that I was going to forgo the lunch buffet ($9.99) and just have a combo of two curries ($6.99) to go, I was walked over to the buffet spread and dished out my meal. Although there were a fair number of both meat and veg options to choose from, the curries mostly looked inspired. The saag that I chose was rather bland and had only one lonely cube of paneer in it. The butter sauce (sans chicken) was a much better balance of spicy and sweet. 

While the server was visibly displeased and inconvenienced by their running out of pre-made naan at the buffet table, it must have been my my lucky day since the freshly prepared naan was definitely worth the wait. Now if business could just go back to booming, perhaps Indian Flavour could manage to churn out consistently quality food again.
