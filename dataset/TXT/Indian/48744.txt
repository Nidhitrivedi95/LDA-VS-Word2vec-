TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA Came here for Sunday dinner. Overall, not bad. The best Indian I've had in Oakland so far. They had some nice variety in the menu, but we stuck with their dinner special which had more typical offerings. We tried the malai kofta and paneer tikka masala. They were both good. The service was nice, if a little bit slow. The mango lassi was delicious. We'd come back when in the area and try the  dosa or some of the creative ideas (Indian shrimp? Interesting, and worth a try) but our go to Indian will still be Udipi Cafe.
