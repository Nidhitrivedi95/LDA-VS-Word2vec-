8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Came in for lunch and had the chicken vindaloo. The curry was good, had good flavor and the right amount of spiciness. I have tried all but 1 other of the Indian restaurants in the CU area and this is at the top of the list so far.

1 star deducted for 2 reasons:

1. Service was subpar. The glass of water I got was lukewarm. Had maybe 1 sip of water left in the glass and the server looked at my table, walked by a few times without refilling, went back behind the bar and was on his phone. About the 4th time he finally came back and finally refilled the water....with more lukewarm water.

2. The vindaloo had broccoli in it. I've had vindaloo plenty of times and have had different places add a variety of veggies, but never crunchy broccoli. It was kind of random and kind of seemed like it was a random vegetable added to the dish to stay true to the menu that said "a curry with assorted veggies". Honestly it took away from the dish. 

I would most probably come back here and try another dish and hope that service is a little better.
