U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw My first time going to Bay Leaf, and my first time writing a Yelp review - I shared the Bay Leaf Cafe 'Mixed Grill' with a friend, and it was just fantastic.  I can't help but wonder why business was so slow during prime dinner hours of a Friday night.  Friendly staff and pleasant environment, and so many more dishes I'm itching to try.  I'll definitely be going back.
