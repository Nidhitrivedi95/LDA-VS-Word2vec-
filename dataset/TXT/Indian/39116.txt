OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w I was really intrigued to try this place after noticing it's trendy exterior for the first time. Went here with friends and was greeted by a friendly server. We ordered goat curry, lamb Dum Pukht biryani, butter chicken and butter and garlic naan. Biryani was full of spices and flavour. Goat curry was too salty but nothing some naan couldnt fix. Butter chicken was delicous. Loved how the table came with papadums and sauces. Service was good but we didn't need to be asked how we were 6 or 7 times too many. Super friendly staff though :P
