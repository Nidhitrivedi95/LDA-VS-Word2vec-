TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I have been going here for years I have not found better Indian food in the city.  It's always been consistently good and I have to recommend Lamb korma.  They make it with cashews raisins and lots of cream and just a hint of spice which is exactly how I like it.  The garlic naan and plain naan are both amazing, please do try the vegetable samosas as they are far superior to the meat ones. The atmosphere is really nice too and they did go through a major renovation some years back which was well worth it.  It's not in the best neighborhood but believe me when I say make it over there as you won't be disappointed.
