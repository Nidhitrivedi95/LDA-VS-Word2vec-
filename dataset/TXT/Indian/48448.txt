tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g Tucked in a strip mall, I was pleasantly surprised at the warm, welcoming atmosphere as I walked in.  Vibrant colors and elegant but minimal decorations make the restaurant feel very homey yet modern.

I came for the Sunday champagne buffet, and while it didn't offer hundreds of selections, there was plenty to satisfy our group of 6 comprised of both vegetarians and non-veg folks. 

Every item I tried was delicious and fresh, and several dishes had me coming back for second and third helpings.  The samosas are crispy and light, the butter chicken smooth and flavorful, chicken biryani tasted fresh and bright, and the carrot halwa had me going back multiple times because it is just that delicious and sweet.  They also offered gobi manchurian, and although at the time I had no idea what it was, I returned for multiple helpings and just couldn't get enough.

The buffet also offered orange and apple juice, an offering of desserts, champagne (there did not seem to be a limit) and hot chai, which was a lovely complement to the meal.

The staff was very welcoming and gracious, especially to a relatively large group that came in with bags of holiday gifts to exchange (this was in February) and where very kind about us taking up a large table and several hours. 

I will definitely go back, and often, and will be recommending Cuisine of India to all my friends.
