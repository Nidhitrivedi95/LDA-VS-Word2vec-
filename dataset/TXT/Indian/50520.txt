UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Ahhhhh.... With an engulfing whiff of the scrumptious and intoxicating aromas as I first stepped foot inside Banjara, I had an inkling that it was going to be as good as I had heard. 

   Word of mouth took me to this wonderful establishment at the corner of Bloor and Crawford (just west of Christie Pits park and a step from my door) and it lived up to it's reputation. You can take my word-of-mouth to heart; delicious and well priced dishes, including both meat and veggie delights! 

   Recently, a South Indian Cuisine restaurant opened right next door called Madras Masala, inevitably by the owners of Banjara and I can not wait to try it next! Look for the Madras review coming soon!
