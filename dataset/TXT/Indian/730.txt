-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg The restaurant is targeting to offer the experience of fine dinning, and it's almost there as well. The service is good. Trained servers with effort to give good services. The interior decor is trying to reflect a fine dinning ambiance, which could be more suitable if it had a larger space and selected (refined!!) paintings. 

Food quality vs. price vs. quantity will get a 3.5 star out of 5. But considering only quality, it's definitely good.... aromatic and spicy. We had Shrimp curry (Hyderabadi Tawa Jhinga Masala), mixed daal (Dal Panchmel), Pudina Paratha and  butter naan (Naan-i-Makhani)... all of them were good.
