I ordered butter chicken and other veggie dishes, my chicken was raw not by just looking it could I tell when u bite it, it was raw. The owner would not believe me and wanted to come to place to get it out of the garbage to believe  it. I have never in my life had a restaurant owner behave the way he has.
