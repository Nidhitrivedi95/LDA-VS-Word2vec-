scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg The BEST INDIAN FOOD AND SERVICE in Madison. My husband and I LOVE coming here. I get the chicken curry with a little spice and it's constantly amazing. Im a wimp when it comes to spiciness and they adjust the heat all the time. The service is top notch! This place is. Family favorite!
