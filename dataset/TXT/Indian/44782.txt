S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Came for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed! Very good food at a great price and the staff was very friendly. The owner came and talked to us and asked how we liked everything. They're the first Indian restaurant in Las Vegas and they get people from all over the world that come based on word of mouth. Would highly recommend it to anyone!
