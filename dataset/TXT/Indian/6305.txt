3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I kinda get what another reviewer meant when she said the buffet is quite large, yet lacked variety. Everything was pretty great though; I love that they aren't as afraid of adding a little bit of heat to their buffet dishes (most places avoid heat in buffet items, for obvious reasons). 

I also thought the garlic naan was wonderful, hot and fresh from the kitchen. They brought it out pretty late into our meal, which brings me to the service. Not bad, but a little slow. Understandable, as they haven't been open long, and not a huge deal. Just looks like they might still be working out a couple of kinks perhaps?

I would definitely return, for the buffet, and possibly for dinner if the mood strikes.
