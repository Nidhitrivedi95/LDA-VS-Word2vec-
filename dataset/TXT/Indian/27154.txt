Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag My neighbor told me about this fabulous restaurant, and I tried it the next day.  Excellent food!  The service the first time I went was slow because the waiter was alone, but the service and his manners were so impeccable, I did not care!  He recommended the cauliflower and I have to have it every time now! I have been back twice in less than a month, taking someone new each time to introduce them to this great place.  The cocktails are amazing!  The waiter tells me they have two other restaurants, but because downtown is easy to get to and a fun place to be, and this is across from Container Park, this is the only Indian Restaurant I need to know about!
