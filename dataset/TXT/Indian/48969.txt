TTFW5vD2i3ylvWaLpv4l6g Went to Agra for dinner recently and it was a fairly positive experience.  The vegetable pakora was well cooked and crispy although the chutney (I'm guessing it was mango) was kind of non-descript and they gave far too little of it.  I also wasn't impressed with the wilted salad it came with.

For mains, we had half a tandoori chicken, jumbo prawn masala, and vegetable jalfrezi with rice.  The vegetable jalfrezi was just ok and disappointingly bland.  But the prawn masala was nice and the tandoori chicken had a smokiness to it that was very pleasant.  And the basmati rice was beautifully cooked.  

Being that we were dining in the financial district, the prices aren't exactly cheap but service was polite and efficient and the food was fine based on what I had.  I'd come back here if in the neighbourhood but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again.
