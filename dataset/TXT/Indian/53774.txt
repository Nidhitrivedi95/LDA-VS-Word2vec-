VNOz_tOw_Hz3FAJeEHb_yg I came to Pyaar in a roundabout way. You see, I asked the hotel desk clerk if he had a menu for the Thai restaurant around the corner, Archi's.  He said he did but they had changed the name to something else. He fussed around in a drawer (not in his drawers, that would be weird), said "Here it is" and handed me a menu for Pyaar.

I knew right away that Indian cuisine is not Thai cuisine.  I'm funny that way.  While I have enjoyed being curried away at both, the food is distinctly different.  Anyone that is even a slight foodie is not going to confuse Thai food with Indian food.

So I decided to check them both out. And I decided on Indian instead of Thai.

I was the only one in the restaurant. I tried ordering several things and struck out with an assortment of "We're out of that" and "He only makes that during the day" (Hint-don't put it on the dinner menu).

I opted to order several small things. I started with a veggie samosa, followed with some gobi paratha and to go...rasmalai.

I really liked the samosa.  The gobi paratha was pretty good, with a nice robust and grainy bread.

The rasmalai for dessert was...interesting.  Very sweet.

Overall, pretty solid Indian, nice people and reasonable prices.

And Sanford and Son on the tube when I left.

Too old school for me.
