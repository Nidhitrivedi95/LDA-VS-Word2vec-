CHrH99pDvs_jPA22o1xBAA We went here for dinner while visiting Edinburgh. We were greeted when we walked in and it was pretty busy. We were able to get a table and found the service the entire time to be excellent. The food was great and we both enjoyed the meal. I would say the naan was large and we ordered 2 we would have been fine with 1. However both were excellent. I would defiantly return to enjoy other dishes.
