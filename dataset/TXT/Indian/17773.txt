E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw Really disappointed today as I ordered a Bombay mixed biryani for takeout during lunch hours. As I am paying for it I notice I am being charged dinner price and I remark isn't it a lunch special right now. I've ordered takeout before during lunch hours and was always charge lunch price. The person/owner then remarks it is a dinner biryani which has me really confused since I've ordered it for dinner as well and there is no difference from what I've experienced. As I get home i open the box to see that it's actually only half full. So if I am paying for a dinner portion why is it even less than a usual lunch portion. Very disappointed by this experience.
