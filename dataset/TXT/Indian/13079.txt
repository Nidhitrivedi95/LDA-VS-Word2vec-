b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q I too am very shocked by negative reviews regarding flavor, authenticity, wait, and selection.

It's a little dingy, my water glass was noticeably dirty, and I was told I couldn't order or eat food at the bar...

The food itself was amazing! So much flavor. I got the Kahari chicken and it was sooo tender. The garlic naan was super thin and crispy with tons of garlic and flavor as well. 

They were on top of filling my waters as soon as I finished em. Lots of space, they set a nice ambiance, and the service was great. The food was out within 10 minutes or so of ordering and I've got a whole second meal to be eaten tomorrow. 

It was a bit pricey, but I notice that trend with Indian food generally.

I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Glendale!
