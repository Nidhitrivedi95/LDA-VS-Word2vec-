xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Just had my first taste of one of Leela's Rotis and I have to say that it was the best chicken roti I have ever had, and my family is Jamaican so I've had my share. Wow. I should mention I'm a very finnicky eater (sorry Mom), and one of the best things about this roti is how there was absolutely nothing about it to put me off, the chicken was perfectly groomed, no gristle, nothing, just clean deliciousness in beautiful curry sauce wrapped in a roti that really hung together, and not too dry either. Love it. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
