Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg *Weekend lunch buffet review*

Our plan was to find some grub at Aria but we either found stuff that was too expensive or not very appealing. By this time we were STARVING so I whip out my trusty iPhone and used my Yelp app to find this place just across the street. It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace all the way in the back.

The first thing we did after we entered was pay the $15 for the weekend lunch buffet. I thought that was a bit strange but if the hotel buffet places can do it why not. 

They had a lot of variety, at least 14 different items, and thought everything was just ok. One thing I thought was really good was their upma, it's like an Indian version of the Moroccan cous cous. It was my first time having the dish and it was simple yet very tasty. The chicken tandoori had good flavor but was a little dry. The chicken tikka masala sauce was good but there wasn't a lot of chicken, I had to dig around for some. What I noticed is that this place supplied small containers for the different dishes. I've never seen that before and thought it's a good idea for those who don't like mixing their food. 

They were pretty good with refilling our water cups and clearing our dirty plates. Bad thing with this buffet was drinks weren't included so a separate bill was handed to us. Another downside was the food wasn't labeled properly, so I was just grabbing things blindly. 

Overall it was just an OK experience. At least Tamba introduced me to a new dish, now all I have to do is find it here in LA!
