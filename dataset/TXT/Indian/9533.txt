8PCFk6ZKDm73Ag42C8XtGw As a starved Indian college student, this is my little slice of home with the best Chaat in town yet.  Chaat - An Indian savory snack that is too die for. 
We ordered what I almost thought was an entire menu for two people.  
Biryani - super yumm definitely try it 
Papdi Chaat - Amazingggg 
Samosa Chaat - could've been better 
Methi paratha- really nice 
Biryani wins hands down
