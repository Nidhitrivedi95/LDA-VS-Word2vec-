UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Everytime i drive out to Vegas I HAVE to stop here.  Bar none. the BEST Indian food I've ever had and well... I'm a vegetarian. I eat a LOT of Indian food.  The greatest thing is they have all regions of Indian food so, you don't have to pick just one, you can have them ALL. Plus, the wait staff is super nice and willing to chat with you about the food.

it's a little bit pricey, but even for the frugalest person it's worth EVERY STINKIN PENNY.
