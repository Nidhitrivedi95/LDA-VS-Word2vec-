J1KKxEsRWiTqp9-nMCV8Vg Food is excellent. We ordered chicken biryani and hari mirch salan with kheer. All food was tasty but they need improvement for takeout packing because of the heat the base of the container got burnt. The food cameout from the base of the containers and fell into plastic bag. Mirch salan also leaked from the container. Price is reasonable, but they should use better quality rice it was not even basmati. First time had biryani with non basmati rice. It is only takeout place but clean.
