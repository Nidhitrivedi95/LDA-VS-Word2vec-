oMKDfSKXbumNXMD45ZQKag I come to Greenville every year to visit grandparents. This is the first time I tried this restaurant since it first opened in 2017.

Chaat papdi, chai, naan, paneer Ki sabji was delicious. 
The prices are incredible. Cool hall.
Restaurant is clean.

I definitely recommend it!
