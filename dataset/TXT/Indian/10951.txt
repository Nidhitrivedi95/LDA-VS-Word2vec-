a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g 5 stars for being the best butter chicken I have had on Gerrard! Much, much better than lahore tikka house for LESS MONEY. 

The butter chicken has a good level of heat, your nose will run but it doesn't overpower all the other flavours. I think they make it to order, to some degree, because it isn't on their hot plates & usually takes about 10 minutes. The chicken has always been tender and juicy. The naan is great! They give you nice big pieces. 

The large ($20), with 4 orders of naan ($1.50/each) filled 4 people for about $30. Awesome.

The samoas's (chicken $1.50, vegetarian $0.80) are also delicious.
