yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Will be going back again - food & service wonderful. The restaurant was full with a 45 minute wait for walk in's but I had made a reservation (or thought I had) through opentable. When we arrived the Hostess could not find our reservation but was so gracious - we were seated immediately. Only upoon further review of the confirmation email I found that I had made a mistake & reserved a table for Sunday, not Saturday. I told the Hostess & apologized & she completely understood. Great service!
