3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ Food was very delicious! I can't handle too much hot spice or dishes that have too much flavor/spices, so I ordered the mango curry, which is on the sweeter side. I had it with Raita and basmati rice---mmmm! It was so good! Everything was made fresh, especially the garlic naan.
