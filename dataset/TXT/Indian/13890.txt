Bu1SgnZblQhE345j3GlzUg I have been on a quest for exceptional Indian food since moving to North York. My search is over! We ordered samosas, butter chicken, lamb saag, rice, and garlic naan - standard items I order to compare to other places. Tasting it reminded me of the first time I had Indian food. My eyes watered - not from spice but from happiness! The food was so flavourful, fresh, and satisfying to all my taste buds. It took some time to arrive, but they just opened recently and when we called, customer service was exemplary. We felt they really cared. The delivery person also impressed me. It is rare that when I order food for delivery, the person buzzes up to my condo and greets me by name, introduces themselves and says what restaurant they are from and, joyous joy, that they have my food. It was so professional and reassuring, too! Well done, Great Maratha. From the staff to the food, top marks! We will be ordering again soon and look forward to trying some new dishes from your impressive menu!
