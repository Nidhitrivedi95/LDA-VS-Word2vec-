7bKDFnTkYzlYEfU7hJ9UtA This is what you should expect, Ok food most of the time, yes their Biriyani is good but it is a hit or miss.

I had unbelievably good Chicken Biriyani, and then so bad Biriyani that I just chucked it, same goes for their Beef and lamb Biriyani. 

Shami kabobs, chicken or beef are really good, but sometimes they are stale, they go bad in your fridge in a day or the same day. I did mentioned this to the owners wife, she said "it is not possible" yes it is and it has happen numerous times. 

Keema-Naan-pretty good
Bihari-kabob-Ok but very spicy and not much flavor
Shish-Kabob-chicken and beef are just Ok but very spicy
Butter chicken ( frozen ) horrible, 
Daal-very good
Kharai chicken-super spicy and it was Ok
Naan-decent but they burn it most of the time 
Samosas-Ok
Keema-pretty good but very spicy 

Now Customer service:
This has to be the first place that owner is worse than the staff.
The staff actually are okay, most of the time polite, but the owner is so conceited, 
you could be standing there for 5 minutes, and he would playing on his his laptop at the cash and would not even acknowledge you, and when he does, he just gives a blank stare, implying yes what do want ? if you ask him any questions about daily specials, he says go talk to the kitchen. I am sorry but he has no clue how run a business.

I stopped going there just because of the owner himself..and trust me he does not care.

So you may ask why this place is so busy, and how come they have been in the business for like 12 years, the answer is simple, HUGE PORTIONS AND SUPER CHEAP!
