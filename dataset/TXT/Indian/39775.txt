P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg We visited them today to grab a quick dinner. The food was very mediocre. I had chili fish and wife had American chop suey.
The gravy in the dishes was very much watered down and flavorless. Even the sauce kept on the table was diluted. The quantity was decent for the price, though. The service was okay.
It's hardly been an hour since we returned; both I and my wife got diarrhea.
Never going back there again.
