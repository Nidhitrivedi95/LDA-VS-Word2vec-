ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA We tried goat biryani, baingan bhartha, masala dosa, mango lassi, and two kinds of naan: garlic and plain.

The plain naan was OK, the garlic a bit on the uncooked side.

The bhartha and biryani were both rather greasy. The bhartha was also mushy in an un-bhartha sort of way while the meat in the biryani was somewhat tough, when we were expecting something that falls apart easily. 

The lassi was good, had some ground pistachios in it. The masala dosa was definitely sub-par. 

One of the rare places we've been to where most food was left uneaten AND we did not take any home. I think that says it all. Service is OK, if you plan to go there.
