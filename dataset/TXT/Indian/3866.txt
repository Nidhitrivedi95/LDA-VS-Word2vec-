0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Lots of choices for good Indo-Pakistani cuisine in the Valley, but this spot stands out as the best in Tempe for a number of reasons - the goat is off the chain good; the daal almost makes me want to become a vegan; and the naan is by FAR! the best naan you will encounter in the Valley. Add in great guest services & a litany of desserts & snacks - this Indian restaurant will make you a true believer!
