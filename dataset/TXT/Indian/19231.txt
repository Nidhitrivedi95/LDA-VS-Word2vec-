f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Here's how's i felt in brief - 

* The Best - ( Food )I have tried the kebabs, Garlic Naan, Shahi Paneer, Chicken Tikka, Veg Biryani and Chicken legs. Man i kid you now, some frkn awesome food. From fragrance in Biryani to texture in Tandoori stuff to overwhelming ( in a nice way ) Garlic flavor on the Naans... Dude Man it's what i want to call, " The Good Stuff". Priced reasonable. Looking forward to eat my fav Nihari. Guys this is a real place to eat some meat.

* The Good - (Owner). Takes pride in his first initiative. You can tell how passionate he is with the way he explains on how he worked on getting the crew together and how each dish is prepared. How his focus is to make money but priority is super flavorful and delicious food, which he delivers, trust me on that. 

* The "OK" - (Ambiance) - 3 stars, all for very clean and nice enviorment. Flags and Arabic/Urdu written are intimidating, on your face, loud. Even though i can tell it's with a very noble and harmless intentions.

So far i have nothing to complaint. I promise to keep updating this post if i experience something different, specially something wrong. :}
