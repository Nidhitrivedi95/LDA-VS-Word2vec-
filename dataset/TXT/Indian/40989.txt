PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA I love Indian food. It is a recent obsession and I know the good stuff when I see it. The food at this food court location is very good. The naan is fresh and tasty. All of the entrees are made fresh to order, so let the cooks know how spicy you enjoy  your entrees. 

Service: the staff is use to tourists and questions. They were very friendly and knowledgeable about the products sold. 

Wait time: everything is cooked fresh. If you are in a rush, go to Quiznos subs. The food is worth the 10 minute wait while they cook it. 

Price: pretty pricey for a food court. It was $40 for two waters, to entrees, an app of samosas and bread. This is the same price we pay at a sit-down restaurant. The drinks are not included in the combo price. 

Location: it appears they share a kitchen with a burger joint... Strange for an Indian joint... 

Try this place if you are at the Rivera casino. :)
