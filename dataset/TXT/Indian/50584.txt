UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I came here with some friends and my bf for rainy day food or "pakors" as he told me it was called and I was very impressed! I reply loved all the spices and seasonings on every good item. I will say beware if you are not good at handling spicy good however I love it so I was in heaven! The outter layout of this restaurant does not do it justice. The inside layout and decor is lovely! And we were seated by the window which I thought was a very nice experience. I will say they need a better system when it is busy, but all in all I was not disappointed in one bit. The good hit the spot, did not break the bank, and pricing for beers both local and imported (which I find pairs amazingly with spicy goods) were a steal! I Will definitely be back to try more menue items!
