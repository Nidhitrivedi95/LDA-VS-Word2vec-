ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I'm glad that there are some new, tasty Indian spots here in the Southwest side of town!  (This spot and also check out Curry Leaf!)

Came here on a Monday evening and the place was empty which worried me, but I trust Yelp reviews so I stayed lol.  The server was obviously new because she didn't know much about the menu but I appreciated she was willing to help and probably ran back to the kitchen 3-4 times to ask questions for me (I can be a pain lol). She got some training out of the way though! Lol

We ordered the meal for two option that included 4-5 entree tastings, rice, naan, yogurt sauce and some desert. I haven't seen this at an Indian place before and I would suggest this option to try the menu!  The butter chicken and the ginger chicken were very good! 

They offer a buffet daily which I am planning on coming back to check out :)
