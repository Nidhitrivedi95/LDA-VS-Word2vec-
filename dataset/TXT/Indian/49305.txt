tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA the food is so good my 10 and 11 year old children actually crave and request their Weekend Buffet on a weekly basis the service is always friendly and the mango lassi Is Awesome on top of the fact that they don't charge you for it like every other Indian restaurant those I really do suggest a buffet as you get to try a little bit of everything in your not locked in the one dish
