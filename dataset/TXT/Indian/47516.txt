TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Food is not really fresh. The taste is just average. Confused why so many good reviews in yelp. 
Took buffet lunch and paper dosa and chai. Paper dosa was thick and no taste at all in chutney or sambhar. 
The staff isn't polite. Asked me if I want any drink without showing menu. Did not bother to ask if I need anything else during entire lunch or for that matter even show up their face so I could tell them. Muttered something unclearly "server something" when I asked for the chai ordered and left. It was like they are just serving for the sake of it. 
My husband got sick right after eating buffet. I am not from Vegas and will advise others against it who wish to go here based on reviews .
