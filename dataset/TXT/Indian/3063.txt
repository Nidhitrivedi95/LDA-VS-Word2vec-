0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw How this place gets any positive reviews is beyond me.  I ordered satay, curry and kung pao.  All 3 were nearly identical - greasy sauce (which pretty much all tasted the same), vegetables and gristle.  Honestly, probably the worst food I have ever ordered (and I order a lot).  Unless you think mall food court food is haute cuisine, don't bother.
