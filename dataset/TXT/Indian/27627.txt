Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Good resturant, had nice and limited options . food was tasty .  Phaldaari chat and panner kabab was tasty. Naan's were tasty too. They had too much gravy for panner methi but cook aplozised for it. Which was some thing i have not seen in any other resutrant.

Will go again for sure.
