iJfS02AOptwkaWD-vOVRew We discovered this place about six months ago via Restaurant.com after trying virtually every other Indian restaurant in Gilbert, Chandler and Mesa and not finding one that stands up to the great Indian food we had when we lived in the Bay Area.

This is by far the best here and comes closest to the amazing Indian food we enjoyed in California.  The Chicken Tikka and Chicken Tikka Masala are outstanding, as is the Naan bread.  The Chana Masala is quite good, too.

We only order off the menu (haven't tried the buffet) and I've now been back dozens of times, and have taken friends and family. They all agree this is the best they've had here in the Phoenix area.

Service is decent as well (nice family that runs it).  Oh, and if you're worried that Indian food is too spicy for you, just ask them to make it "super mild"...they are able to get it right and make it so I can eat it (and I don't like spicy food at all).
