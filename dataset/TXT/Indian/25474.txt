hq10TdILrwtTcAESKY251Q Visiting from the US, I was looking for a somewhat decent Indian dining experience for dinner in the Mississauga/Brampton area without walking to a hole in the wall place where you're served on a paper plate and given plastic utensils...and there are tons of those in the area.  It's difficult to scour for a nice place because there's tons of Indians in the area and Yelp reviews seem to dictate there's no satisfying them as they always have a gripe with a restaurant for one reason or another and there seems to be no sure bet go-to place for reliable food.  I dined at Nirvana last night and it fits the bill for a nice place where you can have dinner with friends or family.  None of the food overly impressed me, but there was nothing bad with it..I guess average is how everything can be described from the mango lassi to the naan to the main courses (ordered chicken and paneer dishes) to the dessert.  Why 4 stars instead of 3?  The decor is welcoming and seeing one of the chefs working at the tandoor oven behind a glass is a nice touch I haven't ever seen at another Indian dining establishment.  Lastly, the female servers who work there are adorably cute and always running around with smiles on their faces.  If I'm ever back in the area, I'll definitely be back here for a decent meal and friendly service.
