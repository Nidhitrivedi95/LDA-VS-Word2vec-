izNAs4Ya2NWKppUgKnQ04w Food quality on a steady decline. Service was good the first two weeks that they were open and mediocre or bad ever since. 

The naan on the buffet are soggy and tired. Sometimes buffet items are labeled and sometimes they are not. Unlabeled food could have created a catastrophe when I ran into peanut chutney and assumed it was tomato or onion chutney. 

By shear luck an employee informed me it was peanut. Since I have a peanut allergy that oversight could have wrecked the rest of my day. 

Take out for dinner was good which is what got them three stars instead of two.
