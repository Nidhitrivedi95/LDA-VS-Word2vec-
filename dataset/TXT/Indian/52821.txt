v21dSJb78W3NM41cC8MMuA My wife and I have travelled all over India - about 14 times! We have had the best of the best of Indian food. Tonight we found this on Yelp - thought we'd try it. Wow. What a surprise! We had the Paneer Tikka Sounfiana and the real test of a great Indian restaurant - Palak Paneer. 

The Palak was as good as the best I've had in North India, fresh and just the right spice. However, the Paneer Tikka Sounfiana was stunning! Huge chunks of homemade paneer cheese coated in the most unique seasoning and charred to perfection. This is a dish you can't get anywhere else. 

Their prices are a dollar or two more than the other, also very fine Indian restaurants in the area but very fair for what you get. It was a pleasure talking with the owner who was very pleasant. We'll be back again and again. 

Add this one to your list!
