7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA I've had take out from here quite a few times and tried a few different things and i've had mixed feelings each time.

The chicken biryani is ok. Its not the best - its lacking something just cant put my finger on it.

Chicken Tikka Masala - not a personal favourite but my family things its really great. I don't think it has the tradiitonal tikka masala spices.

Green Chicken - this was really great! The meat had great simple flavours and was so tender - cooked perfectly.

Daal Makhaani - by far, my favourite dish here!

i will keep trying other dishes as the location is close to work - i'm not a big fan yet, its a taste in progress!
