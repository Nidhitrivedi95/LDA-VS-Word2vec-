zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw Right, so after my last review of Kebab Mahal, I decided that I was hungry. So I went back to Kebab Mahal, of course!

This time I went for the lamb-curry something I hadn't tried before and, being Indonesian and curry-prone myself, I think I died of bliss.

I shuffled in, holding my stomach, bent over and clearly in the final stages of hunger-pains. After having placed my order and being greeted by almost all of the friendly clientele and staff the curry arrived. A light opened up above me, trumpets sounded, a harp was gently plucked. And I may or may not have taken a nose-dive into the curry.

Look, I'm sensitive to heat and so this burnt my throat and mouth to a point of angst-ridden pain but it was soooo good that despite the pain, I couldn't stop eating. (My fault for trusting them when they said there were very few chillies in there, "almost none").

What am I saying? I'm saying get your bee-hinds over here and have ye some curry! Doesn't get better, really doesn't, and they're so incredibly friendly. As a matter of fact, why .. I do believe it's almost lunch-time .... muahhahaha
