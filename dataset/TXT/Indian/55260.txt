WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA I was all stoked for this place after the 4.5 star average review - a rarity. Stopped by for some dinner. The place was more than half and less than  two thirds full around 8-830 pm on a spring Thursday.

Got the jerk chicken special roti (with squash and spinach). The chicken was surprisingly dry and not spicy. The veggies were bland. Nothing was hot - warm at best.

The whole dish was a dry, lukewarm, melange. I had to get a pineapple chutney sauce to give the thing a bit of juice.

At this price point, I was pretty disappointed. I may try it again - but am in no hurry to.
