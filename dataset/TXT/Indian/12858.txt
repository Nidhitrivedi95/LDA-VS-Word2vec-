B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog Iffy recently, but often very good Indian food.

This is not Indian food you would find in D.C., L.A. or Toronto, all of which are infinitely better in price/value and quality, but this is a solid Montreal Indian restaurant. Authentic spices, middle of the road portion size, wonderful naan! One item I would like to see on the menu is a lassi drink. And, a dosa in downtown Montreal would be very welcome. They make it spicy for you, and that's what I like when I have Indian food. The soup is also very good!

All this being said, I am downgrading this restaurant for 2105, as it appears as if they are phoning it in recently and the portion-to-value-to-quality has gone down in the past 12-14 months. What it has going is that it is convenient and the space of the restaurant appears more upscale than it's competition offering the same cuisine. If you are not a connoisseur of Indian food this is a fine option. If you are, you have been warned, i.e., do not get your hopes up. If you are looking for value, best to leave it alone altogether.
