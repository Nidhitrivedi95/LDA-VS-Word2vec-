XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw ok, the inside of the restaurant is not fancy or modern, which might turn some off. but our meals were DELICIOUS. we were there in the heat of the summer, and the A/C was off, but fans cooled us down. we did not wait an inordinate length of time to be served, and did I mention the food was DELICIOUS? 
for those who did not like the inside of the restaurant - maybe try take-out?
