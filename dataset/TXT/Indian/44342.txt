rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I took my gf here for dinner, she is vegan, and they had a few different vegan options. We shared vegetable pakora, which was very yummy, and veggie curry on rice, which was not mind blowing, but it was p good. We also had two drinks, a rosewater gin and tonic, and a caeser for myself. The rosewater gin and tonic was strong, and flavourful. The caeser was like an indian twist on a traditional caeser, with spicy chilis and stuff. It was aight. The only thibg i didn't like wer da prices, hekka $$$ but not too too bad overAll a good place for a fancy indian meal. Our server kept using a kindda weird like silly voice tho, and i was like, nty stop. But she was knowledgable.
