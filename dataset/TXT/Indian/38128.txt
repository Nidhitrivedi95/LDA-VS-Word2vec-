ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw We found the restaurant using the Yelp iPhone app.  My girlfriend and we always I make it a point to try out a local Indian restaurant when we're away from home.  We've been to Tamba in the past for buffet and it was ok.  We were greeted warmly when we arrived by a well dressed host for a Friday night dinner.  We were expecting another hole-in-the-wall join but to our surprise, the ambiance was fantastic.  Dimly lit, very elegant.  Apparently the restaurant is modeled after their restaurants in London.  I played it safe with a Chicken Tikka Masala dish.  They got this right, and MORE.  I literally licked my plate clean because the sauce was so delicious.   It was that good.  The bartender, the waitress, the host, AND even the chef took a moment to stop by at our table throughout the evening to check in on us.  I was really impressed by the service.  It  is so uncommon to see, especially at an Indian restaurant.  The customers at the time of our visit were a diverse group of people, with an Indian family at the large round table in the corner.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place to those who are visiting Las Vegas and love Indian food.  Origin India is clearly in the running for best Indian cuisine in Las Vegas.  You will be delighted by their service and will enjoy the food.  If you're reading this on your iPhone, just go.  Get directions from your currently location now!
