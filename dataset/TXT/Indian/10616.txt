A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Good decent staff...

Faluda : is not faluda is just milk and ice cream

Bhel: soggy didn't seem fresh

Rava masala dosa: no crowd still took 15 mins, but worth the wait.

Ok ambience, generator /AC noise, utensils bieng banged in the background, old songs playing in the distant background in the kitchen...

Pricing is cheap...
