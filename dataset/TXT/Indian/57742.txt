yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Wasn't really a big fan of Indian food, but once every ten years or so, I can sample this type of food. Even if you order it level one, there is a chance of sweating. The spices don't burn, but they do linger for a bit. I can't pronounce what I ordered, but it involved chicken breast chunks in a heavy sauce with onions and peppers. The dish was good and so was the basmati rice which was included in the price of the entree. Otherwise, it is essential that you of course order the garlic Naan and that lived up to the hype with a light tough of garlic on soft bread. The mango lassi didn't taste too mangoey, but was a nice creamy cool down when things got hot. Check-in on Yelp for a free rice pudding which has some hidden raisins and nuts buried inside. The place is on the outskirts of a shady neighborhood, but as far as Indian food goes, it was a good new experience.
