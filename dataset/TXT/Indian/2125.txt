_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg New India Bazaar is primarily a dry-goods grocery store for all things Indian.  Or at least all things Indian that a honky like me needs.

If you're looking for bulk rice, cardamom seeds, black mustard seeds, paneer or anything else from the multitude of Indian ingredients that are overprices for being "exotic" in normal groceries, this is a great place.

There is a freezer case with Indian tv-dinner-style food, and frozen parathi and naan.  There was also a food counter of some kind, but when I went on a Sunday night it was closed - it didn't look like it was full-service.  I hear it is a chaat-style eatery.  Hours weren't clearly marked and no one was outwardly helpful, but if you went during lunch hours, you could probably get a snack.

No produce.  They do have the requisite Bollywood video section, though.

Gluten-free folks take note: you can get a ton of chickpea flour here for super cheap.
