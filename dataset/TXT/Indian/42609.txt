Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ By far my favorite Indian restaurant in Montréal so far. Great ambiance and delicious Punjabi food. I am regular to this place and their Chef never disappointed me. Try their lamb dishes with Naan. Try mango lassi to cool down after some hot and spicy food ;) Try their Baryani if you happen to be a rice person.
