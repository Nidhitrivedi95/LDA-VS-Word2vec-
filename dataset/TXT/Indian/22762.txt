grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg I probably go here every week. Sometimes just for snacks and appetizers, other times for take out meals. Cheap and super tasty. Quick snack: fish bun $1, fish patties 3/$1, roti $0.50/1.00. Meals: seafood or chicken with 3 choices of veggie sides about $6-7. This meal is good enough for two!!!
