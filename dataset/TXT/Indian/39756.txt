P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg Absolutely love this place. Bf and I come here so often they know us and our order- Chili chicken dry and fish w mixed veggies! Very friendly, super fast, very affordable. We always leave super full and our bill comes to less than 20 bucks for both of us! Visit this place when you're in the area you won't be sorry!
