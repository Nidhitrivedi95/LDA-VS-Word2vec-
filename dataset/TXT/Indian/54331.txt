Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A Went to Jaipur Junction for dinner tonight and as usual was not disappointed. For the most part, I consider this a takeout restaurant as the service can sometimes be slow, but tonight we ate in and dinner moved very quickly. (There is a buffet option during special hours, but I've never eaten at that.) For dinner tonight, as I have a gluten allergy, I didn't partake in the samosa appetizer, but my family loved them. They were freshly fried, warm, and crispy. I sometimes get the tasty tomato ginger soup as a starter, but decided to skip tonight. Our main dishes consisted of the alu gobi, chicken saag, novratan korma, and chicken tikka masala. Sides of saffron rice and naan come with every main dish (plain naan comes with your dinner, but if you want the special flavored naan, you have to order them). Apart from the naan which I couldn't eat, everything tasted amazing. I choose the medium spice level, but you can customize your dish from mild to spicy (and extra spicy if you ask). Really you can't go wrong with whatever dish you choose. If you need to cool down, try a mango lassi. If you want a dessert that not overly sweet, give the carrot halwah a try, really, it's excellent. If you don't feel like eating in, don't worry, they have carry-out. Either way, this Indian food deserves a try.
