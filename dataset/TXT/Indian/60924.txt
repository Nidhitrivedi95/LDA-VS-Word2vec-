zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I was skeptical from reading all the reviews but went there last night for a dinner using Groupon.  The food is fantastic.  I'm not sure if they've lowered the price but didn't see any main course that price at $16 as the reviews below said.  We got the Samosa appetizer 2 pcs. for $3.99 which I think it's reasonable price.  The main dishes we got is $12.95 and $13.95 which is comparable to another Indian place down at the other end of Craig Street.  The food is fresh and cooked with lots of spices (which mean they use lots of spices/ not mean too spicy hot).  I could taste the intense spice in all dishes, which I think that's what should be expecting for in Indian food.  Even the filling of Samosa have a taste of spices, whereas other places would only be mild tasting potato with no flavor.  The portion may seem a bit small but with one appetizer, two entrees that come with rice and one garlic naan, filled me and my husband up without the need to take anything home.  Will definitely go back.
