epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg amazing place, great for take-out (the actual dining area is VERY hot) had the lamb jalfrezi and my friends had the butter chicken, huge delicious portions they are well-priced. I ordered mine medium spicy (7 out of 10) and didn't fit it very spicy at all so I would suggest ordering up a spice level from what you are used to at other indian restaurants.
