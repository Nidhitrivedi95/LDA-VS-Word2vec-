Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg This place is legit!! Hidden in a strip mall and filled with Indian clientele!

Went in for buffet night and was so happy! got to try everything from goat curry (delicious and tender) to chicken Marsala! Well worth it!  The buffet was big with many choices for everyone!  

Bar service needs a little help but hey, i should have just ordered beer and not a vodka tonic!

Will be back!!
