Went with a friend, and we share a delicious meal of veg platter with 2 chutneys, Chicken biryani which comes covered in a baked naan covered bowl, Baingan (eggplant), and butter naan. 

I wish there was room left for dessert and chai, perhaps next time 

Ordered takeout: Butter chicken with naan the chicken tasted amazing also!!
