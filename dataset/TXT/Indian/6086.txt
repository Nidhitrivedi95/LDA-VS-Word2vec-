3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Went to dinner with my husband and was blown away by both the service and the food! The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. There were two managers on and both of them checked on us which is always nice. The food was phenomenal! Our server recommended the Vindaloo and told us the Tikka Masala was their most popular do we tried both, and while both were good the Vindaloo was out of this world! We will be going back soon and I highly recommend it.
