DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ The lunch buffet is awesome! I am generally a carnivore but the buffet at Sangam allowed me to try some vegetarian dishes that I would not have ordered a la carte; I was really impressed and got to broaden my food horizons.  Flavors are bold but not overwhelming and the atmosphere is quiet and clean.  Service is low key but quick and efficient.

Sangam is a great place to try a variety of excellent food that happens to be Indian.  It's now part of my regular lunch rotation.
