For $10, you get a soup and salad, a plate of food, and a dessert.

The options vary day-to-day, sort of like a canteen. You basically get what they felt like making that day, so things may be different everytime.

It's quite a lot of food for what you're paying for, since you get the full 3-courses.
I don't know about the taste since I don't visit too many indian places, but I found it pretty tasty although there's no meat. Has various sauces and spices in everything.

This probably isn't really a restaurant but part of the temple operations for the people that spend their days there, so don't be surprised with how it works. I don't expect it to operate like a commercial restaurant.
