DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ DELICIOUS! So glad I found them because I've been craving Indian food since we moved from Asheville, and I had my go-to there (mela). 

Everything was great. Flavorful and plenty of options. There was lots of little desserts to choose from too! 

Such a perfect spot to take someone who loves Indian food.
