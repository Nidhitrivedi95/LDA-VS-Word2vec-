I thoroughly enjoyed everything that we tried and it all lived up to what I know about Indian cuisine. Spicy and good.

The only thing I disliked about this place is that the service was a bit slow. they only had one waitress working the whole place in the middle of lunch rush, which I thought was a bit ridiculous considering that there were 14 tables with people at them...seemed like a bit much for one girl even though this place is a bit small and you had to wait quite a while for your refills. 

Besides that the waitress was very friendly and informative, I would not go out of my way to go eat here again but definitely enjoyed the food and atmosphere.

More like 3 & half stars.
