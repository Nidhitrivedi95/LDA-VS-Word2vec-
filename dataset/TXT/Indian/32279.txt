lfSMMmOB0pr32BPiJwpShA Our first experience was very disappointing.  We were missing a number of items from a combo dinner (salad, 2 kabobs, chutney, etc.), the samosas were cold and our chicken biryani had two pieces of chicken, one of which was literally a bone with no meat on it.  We called back and the manager (owner?) offered to repeat the meal for free next time.  We ordered again and were told by the same manager we'd have to pay for the extras we bought that were not included in the combo meal (naan and samosas) and delivery.  Even though he told us he'd repeat the order, it was only $3 for the food plus delivery.  The meal was much better this time, but we were still missing chutney and the samosas (which were one of the things we actually paid for).  

I would have given a lower rating, but the manager tried to make things right and the food is quite tasty.  It's just too bad that they can't seem to get their act together when sending meals out.
