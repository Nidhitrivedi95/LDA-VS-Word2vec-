j3YSK-IgpNabCIzWEl7CaA Absolutely one of my favorite places to eat. I am definitely a regular there and go a few times per week. My favorite items are their vegetarian dinners. They are always fragrant, fresh, and nicely spiced. Their vegetable dishes rotate daily, but some of my favorites include the bindi masala, potato eggplant, achari aloo, chole, paneer mutter, undihu, tuvar behgan, behgan bartha, and methi mutter. I never hesitate to try something new.
If you are looking for a fast, fresh, and flavorful meal, I would highly recommend this place.
