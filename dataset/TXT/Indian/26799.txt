iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA So good! This is our new favorite spot and that is saying a lot since we have to drive all the way from Gilbert. The restaurant is small but clean and comfortable. And it smells so good in there! 

We have tried the chicken tiki, lamb vindaloo, samosas and garlic naan. Everything was perfect. The lamb was a little spicy but the tiki masala was great. The portions are generous and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be trying the curry next!  

And try the mango lassi, sooo yummy!
