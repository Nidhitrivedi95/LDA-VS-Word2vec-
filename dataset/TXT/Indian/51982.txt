UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Like another reviewer mentioned service here is always awkward and uncomfortable. While I was still placing my order the waiter said you should order the full size of curry because the small size is very little. First off I was not finished ordering and I just felt like he was trying to up sell me. Also I have been here before so I know the portions and have been served by this same waiter. 

On this visit, I ordered the mango lassi; garlic naan; chicken tikka masala; andhra curry. Mango lassi is still my favorite in town. I still don't understand why the garlic naan is not cut so when it comes out piping hot I have to wait a bit to actually tear it apart. The chicken in the tikka masala was dry even though it is buried in a cream sauce. The Indian spices in the andhra curry are overpowering to where you cannot taste the coconut milk or the fresh veggies. 

The lack of attention to detail paired with the uncomfortable environment gives MINT two stars.
