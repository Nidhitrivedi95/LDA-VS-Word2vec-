I went with a couple of friends while in sin city.
Garlic naan - fluffy and garlicy - yum.
Samosas - solid not amazing. Mint & tamarind chutneys were really good.
Chicken tikka masala - outstanding
Chicken Kardai - really good
Lamb vindaloo- great flavor - lamb a bit tough.
Saag - great flavor.
Rice - nice.
Owner couldn't have been nicer. His son even drove us to the closest hotel to catch a cab because it would have been more than 30 minutes for one to come.
Get off the strip and get some real Indian grub here.
