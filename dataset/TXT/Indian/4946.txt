2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Went to Avani, based on reviews. Nice surroundings, the food was some of the best Indian I have tasted so far in Canada - tasty and well-seasoned, well presented and customer service was also good,...they could tone down a little bit when asking if everything is OK/if we had finished our meal...a little excessive.  I say 'A-OK' because unfortunately, plates were not clean, had to ask for replacements, also glasses had residue of food particles, not once but twice.....made me question the state of the kitchen!!  I will visit again though.
