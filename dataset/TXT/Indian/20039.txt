FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Do I really have to give them a whole star?  My husband says yes, and that at least the food wasn't moldy.   Lacking was this restaurant's calling card for a one time visit.  The food was solidly mediocre.  The decor was pedestrian.  But the service, oh the service, earned a tails-up penny.  Awful, just awful.  Our Server failed to address an empty soda glass, did not offer additional Naan, and reopened the blinds after we shut them to block the bright sun.  We did not find chewed gum or stones in our food, so at least we can't complain that they were actively trying to kill us.  All that being said, the mold would have added more character.
