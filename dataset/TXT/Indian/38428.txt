OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Bottomless Curry Bowls?....Challange accepted!

My first impression walking into this place is it's a wannabe hipster Indian Restaurant. And I guess with a name like Urban Turban, it definitely fits the bill. There's a hip bar area up front, and these retro metallic cafe chairs, modern lighting, open kitchen, and a rickshaw up front....ridiculous! 

What I've come to realize about LV dining is that authenticity is not the name of the game...but taste certainly is. And Urban Turban has some really delicious food! The curries are well balanced, creamy and with just the right amount of kick. The garlic naan is soft and chewy. The Samosa's were gorgeous (looking) and tasted just as good as they looked. And this Lamb Sheekh Kebab was sooo flavorful. So even if it's not "real Indian food", it's still really good food. AND if you order the bottomless curry, they will send you home with extra bowls of curry :D The fat child in me rejoices!!!  

Also, I kinda hate on the idea of a bar in an Indian restaurant, but the bar here is pretty darn awesome. Tasty drinks :)
