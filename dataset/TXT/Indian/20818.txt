I like their Vada Pav, Chaat and Panner pizza they are I guess the best in the valley. Pastries looked really tempting, we did not try it but, will do so next time as we had a heavy meal. Their lunch options are limited with one veg and one non-veg curry. But I think that works out for a fast food Indian joint if they want to stay away from the other buffet places. We will go there again for Pastries this week.
