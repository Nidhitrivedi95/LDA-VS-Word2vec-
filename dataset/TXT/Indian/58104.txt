yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The Dhaba is our go to restaurant for Indian food in the Phoenix area. I have an affinity for lamb vindaloo and the Dhaba never disappoints. The lamb is always fork tender (other Indian restaurants have a tendency to serve tough or chewy lamb) and the fiery vindaloo never fails to satisfy my craving for spicy food. We've also tried their chicken curry, korma, tikka masala, aloo palak, palak paneer, naan (garlic and plain), and various deserts. The meats are always cooked perfectly and the flavors of the sauces (spicy or not) are fantastic. Their wine list is decent, and pairing suggestions are offered. The selection of Indian beers is good, and an Indian beer is a fantastic way to subdue the fire on your palate from spicy Indian food. We never leave the Dhaba disappointed. The service is friendly. If you have questions about flavors or spice, just ask and they will take the time to help you through the menu. We have recommended the Dhaba to many people and will continue to do so.
