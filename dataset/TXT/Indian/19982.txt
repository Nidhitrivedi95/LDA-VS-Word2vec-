FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Been back.  They had some kind of lamb dish on the buffet.  I love lamb so I fished the meat out and just ate that, the onion chutney (it's a nice moderate spice level), naan, and rice.  I think I put away about 2 lbs of lamb.  So for 9 dollars - that's not a bad deal.  

Only problem - you can't predict when they'll have the lamb and when they won't.
