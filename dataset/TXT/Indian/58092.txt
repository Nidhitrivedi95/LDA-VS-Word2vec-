yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The customer service was amazing. We arrived for lunch just before closing and they let us in anyways. Due to a inadvertent miscommunication, our order was spicier than expected for me. By the time I realized it, the kitchen had left. The staff went out of their way to find something to accommodate us (which was very tasty). The whole thing was handled in a very professional and kind way. I left happy and full. My husband enjoyed the shrimp tikki masala and the palak  panner very much. Great garlic naan! We were so pleased !
