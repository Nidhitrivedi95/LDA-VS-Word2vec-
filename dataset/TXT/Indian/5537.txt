3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw I like the ambiance of the restaurant, they have live music during dinner time. I have been to this place twice first time a la cart and second time buffet and here are my findings:

A la cart:
1) the best option if you're going to dine at this venu; food is fresh and hot.
2) the best items are lamb biryani and butter chicken.

Buffet:
Skip it all together because curries were liquidly displayed and there was always shortage of naans!
