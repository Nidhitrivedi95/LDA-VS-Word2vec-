iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Love the look of the building, very hip and modern, pulled in on a spur of the moment and I thought I would try it out. Menu was nice I got a chicken burrito combo I wasn't sure what to expect cause Indian burritos aren't something I eat all the time but I loved it, great flavor easy spice. Good choice! Also it only took 2 min 40seconds for them to take my order and serve the food. Awesome job guys I'll be back probably again this week!
