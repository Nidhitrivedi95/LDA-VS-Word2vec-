fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Great for a quick lunch with the buffet. $12.99 on Friday - Sunday lunch. Good selection of curries and they bring you fresh naan to your table. Also had the mango lassi which was tasty. Desert selection was decent, assuming you left some room. Overall, would likely go back, probably for the cheaper lunch buffet during the week :)
