U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw Very impressed with the Bay Leaf Cafe. There are very few Indian restaurants in Phoenix,  so I am very glad to have found this restaurant. The food is amazing, the chicken is tender and soft,  and sautéed in delicious sauces. The staff is also very friendly and eager to help. Overall a great restaurant!
