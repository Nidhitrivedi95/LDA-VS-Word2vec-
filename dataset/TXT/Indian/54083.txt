vrAZ6qenlYwHfgzSSlmkiQ Baingan bharta (or as they called it here - Bengan Bhartha)  - a super-melted eggplant/onion dish.  So delicious.

I've been eating in Little India since 1982.  This was my first trip to the Regency and I am sad I'd never been here before.   Really good buffet.  The mutton and matar paneer were excellent.   All of the veggie dishes were good.  The tandoor chicken was about the best I've had in the neighbourhood - flavourful and not oily at all.  I'm still trying to identify the very good fish kari that was served.   Fresh naan brought to the table regularly.   Staff kept an eye on the tables and the buffet.  Nice condiment/salady section.  

the baingan bharta .... the best ... in the neighbourhood and maybe anywhere I've had it.

We'll be going back.  Terrific place.
