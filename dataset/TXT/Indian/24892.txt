h2qoDqeVdTDnJRGQGqsi4g Tried this place for the first time today and it was excellent.

I placed an order for pickup through Just Eat, and the service and food were both fantastic.

The prices are a little higher than some other Indian food spots, but the quality of the food is definitely there.

They have incredible Saag Paneer, Samosas and Garlic Naan.

I definitely recommend this place - it won't let you down!
