TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw One of the worst Indian food places in Vegas. In case you want to eat and taste only chili paste, come and order spicy food here - especially stuff from theta door like kebabs. I typically never leave reviews, but this is one of the places where they asked how the food was, and despite telling them it was terrible, they did not bother to take any action. Anyhow. Hope this helps someone. My last time here for sure.
