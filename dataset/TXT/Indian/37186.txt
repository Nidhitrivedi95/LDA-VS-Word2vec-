o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I've been in Arizona for almost 4 years, eaten a lot of Indian food, and would rank this as my number one spot. It's not "authentic" Indian food, but it is imaginative, flavorful, and modern. 

Apps- The traditional samosa is solid, but I would recommend the samosa chaat. The yogurt cools off the spices of the samosa, but the outside retains its crispiness. The bhel puri and paneer pakora are also a good way to start off your meal. Like many new age restaurants, they have their own version of "Indian fries" which were ok- if you are in love with fries try them out, otherwise go with the traditional Indian apps. 

Main courses- The wifey and I usually do 1 chicken and 1 paneer dish. Take your pick  of the butter masala, tikka masala, or saag- they are all good, but the butter chicken is our favorite. I also highly recommend the channa masala (pro tip get the bhatura aka indian fry bread to go with the channa masala). I do wish they had more vegetable options- no okra, cauliflower, or eggplant dishes...but I guess that's what you get with a "modern" Indian restaurant.

Haven't tried the dessert or drinks so can't comment on those, but we always get the raita (flavored yogurt) to eat with our curries. If you are like my sister and can't eat spicy food but don't want to hold the crew back, put a dollop of the raita on your spicy curry and you'll be good to go. 

If I could give 4.5 stars I would. This place is not as good as Indian food I've had in Houston, NYC, or Toronto, but it satisfies my curry craving and beats out the surrounding South Asian spots. Also, 10% student discount! The people are always nice, and my water cup is always full. Definitely check this place out.
