J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Little India has been a staple to my Dinner dates. This place is romantic and cozy that I love bringing dates here. The decor is amazing and its like stepping into a whole new world when you first enter the kitchen.

Of course, it is busy and there is a mixture of different ethnic groups here that you will never have that uncomfortable feeling when it is only one culture group that eats at a restaurant and they all stare at you when you walk in.

I ordered my usual Mutton Rolls to share with my date, Beef Biriyani and a Chai Tea. There is a David's Tea in the area, but it does not compare to the Chai Tea here. For dessert, sometimes we try the desserts but its not something I like too much of. 

Overall wonderful experience and staff!

Though side note, take out delivery is very slow. It took 1 hr and a half for food to arrive. The website warns 1 hour, but it definitely took longer. I would not recommend this take out place.
