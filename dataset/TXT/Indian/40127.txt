PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw Namaste Kathmandu serves excellent Nepalese and Indian food.  The combination of these two similar cuisines makes for a more interesting experience and you can compare where the two types of food differ.  I've not eaten much Nepalese food so I went for the Bhute Ko Kukhura which was chicken marinated in a whole range of spices.  My mate went for the fish Tikka which looked delicious and creamy.  Our meals seemed to take no time to arrive and tasted great when they did.  My chicken was pretty spicy, but it also had an amazing range of flavours and the chicken was as tender as I've tasted.
Our meals, along with some boiled rice, cost less than a tenner which was a brilliant deal considering the quality and portion sizes of the food.  We'll hopefully be here again.
