eVI5yxMGfcYht-J70FP4rA I truly loved the lamb vindaloo. It was one of the best I've eaten in my life! The roti was big but nothing to write home about. Wife had the chicken korma, found it a little sweet for her taste but agreed it was very flavourful. She really dug the sweet Lassi.
Definitely going to eat my way through the menu but I'm afraid nothing is going to stand up to the lamb vindaloo! I'm giving this place 5 stars for blowing my taste buds away.
I'll update my review after a few more visits!
