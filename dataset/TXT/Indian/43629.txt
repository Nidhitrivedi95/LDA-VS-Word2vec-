rr7uKYmcUTLeU4By1syBlw We recently moved to this part of town and are venturing to try to find our new local spots for lazy night take out. I love Indian and would argue it is something that never tastes the same at home, but my experience at Jashans made me think differently. We called on a Friday night, and granted, probably the busiest night for take-out, but there phone manor was very rushed and not very organised, as my boyfriend was passed to two different people, and then someone tried to dial out while we were on the line. They said delivery would take an hour, so we opted to collect it, as I was to hungry to wait.

We order garlic naan, butter chicken, potatoes/okra and onion bhaji. It did come well presented and neatly packed, but needless to say, the food was so disappointing. It didn't taste bad, but it certainly did not taste like Indian food. Mine was suppose to be medium, but was super oily and had no spice or real flavour to speak of. It was like tomato paste and oil had been partly mixed in, but nothing else, and the okra had no flavour. I don't eat meat, but I tried the sauce for the butter chicken and it tasted just like honey, and no spice there either. My boyfriend said the chicken tasted overcooked and he was no impressed with my dish either. 

The naan was very dry and lacked any hit of garlic, which was super disappointing. The onion bhaji tasted nice, but could have been crispier. It did some with some nice sauces, but not sure what they were, some sort of mild chili sauce maybe?

Overall, it wasn't a good experience and for over £20, it definitely wasn't worth it. As nothing made an impression on us, we aren't keen to go back and give it a second chance. I read the reviews beforehand and since they are seem fairly positive I was surprised it was so far from the taste I was expecting. I would not recommend this place to anyone, and will continue my search for good take out near by.
