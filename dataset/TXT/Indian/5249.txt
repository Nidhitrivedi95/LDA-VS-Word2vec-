2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA I was recommended by a friend to try out this place. The first time I went, I had ordered the Chicken Tiki Masala Roti. I felt sick after as the flavors were really strong and the meals was really heavy. It did not enjoy it was all you can taste was the thick sauce. I decided to give this place a second shot and ordered the Butter Chicken Roti. Unfortunately, I was disappointed a second time. It is definitely not my cup of tea. My only suggestion to people that want to try it is to order 30 min in advance as it can take a while for them to prepare it! Hope you enjoy it more than I did.
