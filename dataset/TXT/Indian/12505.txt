aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ A friend was going on about Kathi Rolls so when I saw Kathi Rolls Express, I thought this is my opportunity to figure out what these things are.  I made an order for a veg (paneer) Kathi roll and it took a few minutes to cook up. I checked out the place, it's small and cozy and I like the Bollywood décor with the NYC mural. The place has a good look. When I got my order (which I feel was a bit pricy) and tried it out... I have to say that these rolls are AWESOME!!!! Way better than anything other roll or wrap you may try in the city... it's not a contest. I'll definitely be introducing this place to other people. Good job!!!!
