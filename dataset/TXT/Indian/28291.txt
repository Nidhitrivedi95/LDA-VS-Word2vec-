J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Delivery time was a touch long. 1 hr and 10 mins, even tho they said 45. Seems to be the standard operating policy set by the Indian food guild of metropolitan centers worldwide. The meat combo for two is $60 with tips, delivery, hst. Not the bestest deal. Naan is phenomenal and massive. Like a blankie. You could make a fort! That you can eat. The vegetable curry was out of this world. The butter chicken was mislabeled- it should be aylmer brand ketchup nicely emulsified on over cooked white chicken. It was absolutely not butter chicken, it was tomatoes and vinegar and just why bother?!?!?! Horrible. The mixed prawns,  lamb and chicken Tandoori was fine. Peas paloa  (sping?) Was fine. Overall the place was fine. Fine. K. It's fine.
