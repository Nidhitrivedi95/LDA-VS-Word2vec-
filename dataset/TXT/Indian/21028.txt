GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA One day after work  I decided to visit the Curry Corner with my friend, and I was a little skeptical to try the food because I have tried a lot of average Indian food, and I didn't want to have that experience again, but I noticed the food was Pakistani style.

Since I had chicken twice that day already, I wanted to order a beef dish. The guy at the counter told me that they were out of beef.  Then I decided to order the most popular dish the "Chicken Tikka Masala."    

It was a different kind of Indian/Pakistani dish that I am used to. Usually these kind of dishes are heavy, but this dish was very light, but flavorful at the same time.  The Naan bread was different as well. It was a lot lighter and fluffier then the usual Naan bread; the rice was pretty good too.

We ended up paying about $10 bucks a person. I would like to pay a little toward the $7-$8 range for this kind of place because they don't serve you, but $10 is ok. 

Overall I would recommend this place if you are looking for a change of pace when it comes to Indian/Pakistani food, and want something lighter, but flavorful at the same time.
