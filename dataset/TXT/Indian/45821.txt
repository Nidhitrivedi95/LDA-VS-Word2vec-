SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ Meh. It was ok. I do not know what else to say about the food or even the decor. Meh kinda is the feeling I had after eating here today. I went with a fellow Yelp friend who works down town. It was the lunch buffet so I did not know what I was in store for, but for the price of $8.99 I thought, why not. The place is really big inside. There is enough seating in there for large groups of people and even an area that looks like it could be sectioned off for a party that would be separate from the rest of the restaurant. 

The service was ok. Nothing out of the ordinary happened. They sat us, they were friendly, but they weren't really checking often to see if we needed anything. I could have just went up to get another drink but decided against it and just had one. They did clear the tables rather quickly but checking to see if we needed anything else wasn't something that happened. So meh...

The food was also meh. Nothing out of this world spectacular but nothing that was terrible. The chicken was good and so was the veggie options. I will say that the tikka masala chicken was a little dry, which is hard to do, I think, for something that is marinated in a heavy sauce. But the sauce was also a bit watered down. So meh...

I won't say that I will come here again, but then again I do not head downtown very often. It was not terrible but it wasn't stellar. So meh. Try it out, and maybe dinner is better than the buffet!
