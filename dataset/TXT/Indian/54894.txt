WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA The decor and service is amazing in this place! Dishes I would recommend trying your first time there would be the butter chicken, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken. The food is always fresh and delicious! It is a little over priced but hey you get what you pay for right. A great first date place too because of its lovely ambiance!
