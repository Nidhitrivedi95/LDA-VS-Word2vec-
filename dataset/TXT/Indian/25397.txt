Went on a Tuesday night at 6:30 and we were the only ones there. Fine by me. One young man there, sitting at a table watching a Bollywood movie on the TV. No welcome, nothing. We sat down at a booth and he finally walked over. "Would you like menus?" "Um, yes please". He tried to direct us to the buffet, but we wanted to go ala carte. Back to his movie. When he brought our food, he set it on the table and walked away. "Um, may we have some plates and utensils please". "Oh, sure". The whole evening was like that. Just disinterested and aloof. Weird.

Food was really good, though. Wonderful Kabli Chana (chick peas and potatoes in butter, masala, coriander & other spices. Dal (lentils in garam masala) was a little spicier than we asked for, but smoky, rich & delicious. Onion-stuffed naan and Saada rice were really good, too.

So, maybe we go back, but if we do, we take-out.
