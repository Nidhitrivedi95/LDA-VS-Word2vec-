W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg I was here last February and had the most bizarre dining experience at this place. My partner and I ordered gobi manchurian, masala dosa, avial, and chai to have before the meal. The gobi manchurian arrived and was great, however our chai did not arrive before that. The masala dosa arrived flat, flavorless, and anything but crispy. They completely forgot about the avial, and the chai came with our check. The result is that my partner never got their entree and mine was a completely miserable dosa. Definitely would not recommend this place. For dosa Maharani downtown has been the best thus far. Although Minerva has good gobi manchurian, the offering at Swagat is much better. This place pales in comparison to Udupi and Mysore Woodland in Chicago.
