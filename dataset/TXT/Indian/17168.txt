DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I'm so glad to have stumbled on this gem in SW Vegas.  SW Vegas has pretty much been devoid of much Indian food.  Everything me and my buddy ate was amazing.  I'm primarily a vegetarian, but I will occasionally eat a little meat and had to try some of his chicken dishes.  I'll start with the appetizers:

Chili Panner: Think of chunks of smooth cheese, almost cheese-curd like, in a sauce similar to Kung Pao, but obviously more complex.  DELICIOUS!  This will become a regular item for me

Chicken 65:  Chunks of fried chicken in a thick tikka masala-like sauce.  Need I say more? 

Naan:  Solid good ol' garlic naan

Entrees...

He had the Chicken Tikka Masala which is of course a fairly common dish for us Caucasians, but it was above average.  Huge chunks of white meat chicken in an aromatic fragrant sauce.  

I had the Dal Makhani which is sort of like an Indian Chili with lentils and red beans.  MIND BLOWN!  This was soooooo amazing.  I ate almost the whole portion which can be dangerous if you eat a large amount of Lentils lol, but I couldn't stop.  

I badly wanted to try the Choco Naan, but there just wasn't any room, so next time.
