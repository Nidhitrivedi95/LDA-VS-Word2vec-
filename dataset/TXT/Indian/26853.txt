iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I have to tell you from the moment I walked in the smell was just amazing and I could not wait to taste the food. 

Bathrooms were family style and very clean.

Our waitress was very nice! She got the water no ice rught the first try and the water was filtered and cold, perfect for a hot day.  

We ordered the Hyderabad and Tikka Masada and they were the perfect temperature, spice and we're very tasty.

Overall one of the best dinner adventures we have had. Stop what your doing and makes reservations if you want to impress your someone with a great meal for a great price.
