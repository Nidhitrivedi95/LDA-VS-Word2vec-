a8o8OMGhWg4JwbuMMnVOHQ The grilled portobello chicken breast has an outstanding creamy sauce, so did the bow tie ala rosa... amazing!!
The burgers in general are great too!! That's what my partner always have.
And their staff is so friendly, they even paid attention to the kids and were talking to them and asking them if they liked the food.. which they did.
