PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Disappointed in this place, as I've had much better Indian AYCE food elsewhere.  The flavours were just lacking on almost all the dishes I tried (except for the butter chicken that tasted amazing).  

The dishes I was most disappointed in were the fish pakoras (they had the pakora flavour but b/c it was just a piece of fish, the texture and overall flavour were off) and the chicken biryani (the rice was soft, the spices were very tame and the chicken felt like it was repurposed from another dish).  

I won't be back for sure and will stick some of the AYCE places in Toronto.
