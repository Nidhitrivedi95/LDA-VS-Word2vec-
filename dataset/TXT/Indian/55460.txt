x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA This place gets my vote for best Tandoori Chicken in the Valley; if you like  a flavorful 'dry rub' on the outside juicy on the inside, this is the place.  Most local tandoor seems too soupy for me (I once encountered a local version that honestly tasted like they just dumped Campbell's Tomato soup on it and that's it - no joke)  

On a side note, they also serve a sort of jalapeno chicken dish - I'm not savvy enough know whether this is authentic (it's kind of on its way to chinese-american) - but, my point is that I think it works - I like to see this kind of cuisine morphing (don't be shy to amp up the heat on this one Pasand - it's best this way - and if anyone complains that it's too spicy - then they shouldn't be scooping anything with 'jalapeno' onto their plate to begin with - right!?!
