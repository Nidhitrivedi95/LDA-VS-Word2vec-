DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew We have only been here a couple of times and it's nice to finally have a good indian restaurant on the southwest  side. Food is pretty good and you can taste the fresh ingredients they use. Unfortunately, because they just opened they have some kinks to work out regarding service (wait time) but I'm sure it'll fix itself eventually.
