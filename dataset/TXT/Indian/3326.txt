The pizza tastes good when eaten hot, as the base is thinner than usual pizza and gets soggy if reheated later. On other occasion, I had their day's special curry combo with naan and rice which is a good value for money.
We called 2 mins after their closing time and they were kind enough to still accept the order for take out.
