tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I have a couple basic guidelines, when it comes to restaurants. First, any place which actively advertises is probably not very good. If it doesn't sell itself by word of mouth, there's probably a reason. Second, Indian restaurants which offer a dinner buffet aren't very good. I see it as an act of desperation to save a failing business. Still, I figured I'd give India Oven and their dinner buffet a try.

Most things on the buffet were below average. Nothing stood out as particularly good, and a few things were pretty terrible. The worst offender was the rice. It was so hard and crunchy it was inedible. This problem was compounded by the fact that we waited forever for our naan. Naan is thin bread cooked in one of the hottest ovens used for cooking food; it takes less than a minute to cook. Once we got it, though, it was pretty decent. The tandoori chicken was ok, but it had a sour taste to it, like it had been sprayed with lime juice and left to soak it in. The chicken didn't taste super-fresh, either, so it might have been cooked and rewarmed.

As for the service, it mainly consisted of about 10 people milling around the small dining room, refilling water, asking how the meal was, and being confused about what went where. 

I'm still looking for a great Indian place in the valley, but I've had much better food at Royal Taj in Tempe and Star of India in Ahwatukee.
