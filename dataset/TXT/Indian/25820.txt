After an incarnation as a Mexican restaurant, I am happy to see it back to being an Indian/Pakistani restaurant. While much of the former elegant decor that was Karma is now gone, it remains an attractive space, just far more casual than it was.

That being said, the food is delicious. It is clear that fresh and quality ingredients and being used and prepared by a skilled chef. The classic Indian dishes do not disappoint, right down to the naan bread. 

The staff are all super friendly and provide helpful guidance in navigating the extensive menu. When we complimented the food, they were genuinely pleased that we had enjoyed our experience and remarked that the chef took great pride in making delicious food. This attitude, lacking in so many restaurants, makes me want to support them and I hope you will as well.
