AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw My favourite local take out! 

I order mostly Indian dishes: chicken or beef korma, karahi, vindaloo, saag..veggie dishes: chana nasal, navaratan makhini,  pakoras. Naan is great.
But most of all, their service is so pleasant, whether it's take out or dine in.
Reasonable prices, can't go wrong!
