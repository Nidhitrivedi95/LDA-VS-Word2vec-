llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Best Indian buffet in town! Lots of vegetarian options. The pistachio ice cream is amazing! The owner and staff are the sweetest and always remember a returning face. Very kind to children. The coconut chutney is the best I have ever had. A true gem to madison. Never had a bad dish.
