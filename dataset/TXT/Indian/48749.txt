We stopped in here on a Saturday because we were in town for another event  - since it's the Holiday Season, the pay lot up the street even had free parking.  Bonus!  Unfortunately, they didn't open until 5 PM, so we had to wait a couple minutes beforehand, but it was well worth it.  We were actually the first ones in the door.  I'm not going to talk about the ambiance/setting - others have pretty well covered this.  The kitchen was a little slow with our food, but the tableside service was still good.  I can't complain that much about the kitchen - as soon as we sat down, 5 other tables filled up right behind us.  While others got their appetizers and meals before us, we didn't mind because their food seemed a little less complicated to make, and I can understand the restaurant's approach of trying to make as many patrons happy as fast as they can.  But we did wait at least 30 minutes for our orders to come out (hence, the one star deduction).  Again - well worth the wait.  I had the Curry Goat; super flavorful; my only complaint is the amount of bones that came with it.  My dining partners had the Chicken Makhani (with tomato & cream sauce; it was delicious), and the Chicken Saag with spinach.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  The waiter came over and even asked if the spiciness was OK,...as if he could read our minds, especially since one of us experiences chronic indigestion.  She was fine throughout the meal and even after.  They were out of Naan bread, so they provided us a couple orders of other dipping bread, perfect to sop up all the leftover sauce.  They didn't push drinks on us; the water was fine and was refilled several times over.

The big question:  would we go back?  Absolutely.  Even through we live about an hour away, we agreed we would drive that far just to come to this restaurant and try out more items.
