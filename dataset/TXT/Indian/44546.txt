rxR93KtNb5vxGA17wiHd2w I was very dubious about trying Khushis again.  I used to be a dedicated follower and must have gone at least every couple of months without fail for years.  Until the old restaurant opened on Victoria Street that is and the quality of the food as well as service just went straight down the hill!  The last time I went I had a disastrous meal involving raw prawns and a chicken bone which although the head chef himself came out to see what was going on as he could see that we were not happy, instead of helping turn out experience round for the better he just decided to conceal the evidence and walk away without so much as an apology!!!  

Needless to say I never went back.  However, I don't hold too much of a grudge and am willing to give out second chances so when the new restaurant opened on Antigua Street I pondered over whether to try it or not.

I have to say though, I'm definitely glad I did!!!  

Although I was nervous when walking through the door the friendly and attentive staff put me at ease quickly.  This setting is lovely.  Although the other one was really swanky Antigua Street restaurant has still managed to keep that element alive but with a more cosy atmosphere rather than the cold and open feel the old place had.  The ceiling is full of glass lanterns which fill the place with colour and sparkle.  

That's not the only colourful thing about the place though.  The new and improved menu is amazing - they have far more fish courses than I remember and the Baltic curries come in a clay pot with an Indian bread lid which look delightful.  The quality is back up to scratch and the prices not half bad either for curries ranging from £6+!!!  

But lets not forget about the deal breaker here - it is BRING YOUR OWN BOTTLE and one of the only B.Y.O.B.s in Edinburgh that doesn't charge corkage!!!  Your purse will thank you so go for it...
