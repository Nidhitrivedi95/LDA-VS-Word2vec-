B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Amazing service. My bf drinks a lot of water and our glasses were never empty. Lol. As much as people might mind that, my bf drank 6 glasses of water so it is nice to have a place that finally brought enough water for him. We got the dinner for two deal which was a ton of food and a great deal for $40. Had a salad, appetizer, 2 curries, 1 chicken plate, Naan, and rice, then finally the dessert. 

Super stuffed and satisfied. :)
