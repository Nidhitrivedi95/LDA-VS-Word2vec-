tqJcWIO5uvv1MzwGd7gkUQ this place had a very home-like feel to it.

it's not a fancy restaurant where you get served food its a fast food joint, but they take really good care of you.

I got the chicken & rice and it was one of the best i have had in the city my girl who is a vegetarian came with us and they customized a dish for her - that's service!

I echo the review below mine, the owner was super friend - which i think is a testament to excellent customer service!
