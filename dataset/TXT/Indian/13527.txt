biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg First let me clear up one thing, some people have written that this restaurant serves BOTH Indian and Middle Eastern (kabab) food.  It does not.  It was a kabab place until 6 months ago when the ownership changed, its now SOLELY Indian food.  I guess they're too cheap or too lazy to change the name or sign... which i actually find really endearing.  

This is easily the best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm from the Bay Area where we have a very substantial Indian population.  Even my boyfriend, whose prior idea of exotic food was Filibertos (no I'm not kidding) LOVED the food here.  I had chana masala (chickpeas) which was insane, spicy and savory and completely flawless, and my boyfriend had the biriyani.  I'm not a fan of biriyani in general but this one was pretty good. Just a warning, you'll be picking full cardamom pods and whole cloves out of your mouth -- but whatever works to get the flavor so nice!  You can order your meal " thali" which means with 5 small side dishes for just a couple of bucks more, so we got to taste the dal (lentils), a soup, the aloo gobi (cauliflower), an incredible eggplant dish, naan and a tiny dessert.  I dont remember what the dessert was called but it was some kind of cardamom syrup soaked fried flour ball -- was delicious. I've been disgusted by that dessert at other restaurants but LOVED it at kabab palace. FYI, we didn't mention anything at all about level of spicyness and our meal definitely came spicy enough to make our noses run...charming, right?  so if you can't handle heat i'd suggest mentioning that you'd like it mild.

 When all was said and done, our bill came to $25 bucks, and we had at LEAST half of what we ordered to bring home.  Next time we'll order only one "Thali" meal to split and still eat well.  All in all, the best indian meal i've ever had, and enough to convert my 'merican-cheese loving boyfriend.
