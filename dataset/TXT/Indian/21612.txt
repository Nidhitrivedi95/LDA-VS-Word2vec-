One can taste that everything on the menu is made from sctrach vs using canned junk. My 3 year old loves their paneer dosa, idli, all types of rice & chikoo milk shake.

The owners are friendly and always have a smile on thier face and greet the customers & make them enjoy their meal. Bottom line is this is the best restaurant in the valley that serves fresh tasty authentic food .
