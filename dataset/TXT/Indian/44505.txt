rwuMWGqt7L5l5lDsOYv1dw amazing restaurant .... One of the best indian places I have been to in US.
Authentic north indian food... All credit goes to the chef "prince". 
He knows what exactly north indian food tastes like .. Although I am not from here, I luv this place and whenever I go to champaign, everyday I have food from here. Prince comes up with these new dishes everytime and I eat whatever he suggests.. 
A must go place in Champaign..
