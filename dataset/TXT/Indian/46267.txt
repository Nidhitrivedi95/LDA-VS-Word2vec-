sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ These are the BEST Rotis in the city. This tiny spot on queen street it makes great indian food. I love the butter chicken which is massive and cheap one order is more than good for two people. The fresh samosas are great and they have plenty of veggie options. There isn't much seating so try and call ahead you wont be disappointed.
