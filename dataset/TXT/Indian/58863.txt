YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA The place is nice and cozy, quiet too! For dinner the price for an adult was $15.99 before tax! There were at least 4 chicken options on the menu, plain rice, chicken briyani and naan. There were also 4 vegetarian options such as channa masala, paneer and okra. The staff were very attentive and polite, our water was filled every time we got up to go to the buffet, and the dirty dishes were picked up immediately. The only issue I had was I thought the food was missing flavour, the tandoori chicken was exceptional, however I felt as if the chicken masala, butter chicken and channa masala all tasted the same. This is why the restaurant isn't getting 5 stars... I really missed the flavour that I would get at an a la carte restaurant.
