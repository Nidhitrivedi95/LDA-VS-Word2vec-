U3Ah385YhvlraXsKcEeZ4g This place is terrible. Just terrible. Wandered in with my brother for dinner. First thing we noticed was that the restaurant was empty, which is never a good sign. We sat down and ordered a pitcher and quickly noticed it would have been cheaper to simply drink by the pint. In any event...

We ordered the baba ganouche  to start - bland bland bland. The cucumber was good at least. 

I had the bulgogi and my bro had the curry. The bulgogi must have been pressed salt formed to look like real food. It was almost unbearable. The curry was bland and we were only able to find three pieces of meat in it. It was really quite terrible.  

We complained and the server told us that the quality was not great. I told her they better get their act in gear. We left and grabbed some fast food on the way home. 

If I could give a 0 I would.  Do not eat here!
