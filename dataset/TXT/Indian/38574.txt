OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Came in on Wednesday night & it was kind of slow. I think that will definitely change when more people try the food. I'm fairly new to Indian cuisine and I loved what I tried. First there was complimentary appetizer which was light & crispy, served with some great dipping sauces. Then I tried the manchow soup which was tasty & the right amount of spice. I think it could cure the common cold as well. Then I had the Parda Chicken Biryhani that was beautifully presented in a hot pot covered with a pastry crust on top. Yum!!! I was with some family & friends so I had the opportunity to taste some other appetizers & main dishes as well. Butter chicken pizza?!?  OMG. It was good! And at the end of the meal we tried the ice cream as well as some paan shots that are a must! The ambiance of the restaurant was nice, but I admit the chairs have a lot to be desired - not too comfortable for a long period of time. Oh, and kudos to the wait staff who were very attentive.
