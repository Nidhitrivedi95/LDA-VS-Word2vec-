OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w Nice interior compared to many other local Indian food restaurants in the area - lots of parking. 

We made reservations; upon calling we were told we could have a table for 2 at 7pm. The guy didn't want our name, which we found odd and asked him if he wanted it for the reservation - he said no. 

Of course we arrive and the place is quite full and everyone is puzzled that we have a reservation but there is no record of this. Whatev, we just want a seat as the aroma of foods was definitely making us super hungry. Luckily, there was an empty table and we were able to be seated. 

There is a large menu with lots of delicious sounding dishes. We opted for chaat papri and cheese naans to start and the dum phukt chicken biryani and chicken tikka masala for mains. 

The meal comes with a complimentary starter of papadums and a cilantro and tangy sauce. The papadums were a tad on the stale side. The cilantro sauce was our fav. 

Cheese naan - oh SO good. We both remarked we would return if only even for this. Delicious and served hot- yum!

Chaat papri - we are big fans of this dish in general so always make a point of trying it out at any new place we go. This one we found too tangy and lacked much of the trademark chickpeas and potato and had far too much of the yoghurt. 

Chicken biryani - delicious. Just the right amount of spice (I'm brown and LOVE my spicy food!), but not too overbearing. A generous portion which comes cooked in a pot covered with a naan. The naan is inedible as we are cautioned it's not cooked through but it makes for a really neat presentation. The sever cuts it open at the table. Tender pieces of chicken breast dot the dish. 

Chicken tikka masala - flavour central. Fresh peppers are cooked to a mild crispness which makes the dish even tastier. Generous sized portion. 

Meal comes with a small dish of raita which was nice. 

Service was good. 

We will definitely be back to try out more of the vast menu.
