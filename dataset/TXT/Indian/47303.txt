TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ Outrageously good. I was having a lazy night and got the veggie pakora and the hakka shrimp noodles for takeout. 
Not going to lie. I ate 4 pakora on the way home... so tasty. Literally so good. The hakka noodles were very good too. The pakora stole the show because they were crunchy and tasty with a little spice. 
Very large portions and a very cute clean space. 
All the positive reviews are true and I would definitely suggest visiting. I will likely be back for this crispy beef that everyone is raving over... beef is rarely my first choice at Chinese but they did so well on all the other dishes that I'm actually excited to try it.
