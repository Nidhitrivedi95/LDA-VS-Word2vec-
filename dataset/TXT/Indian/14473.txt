C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Tucked just outside of Little Italy, this place is small and cute with a good size patio. Inside had a great old rustic feel that was very intimate but not intrusive to other patrons. 

Brunch runs from 10:30am-3pm, which is perfect for a late riser like me. I chose to eat the eggs napoleon which is poached eggs with smoke salmon, spinach, mushrooms on a croissant topped with a cream dill sauce. I gotta say that the dill sauce turned me off a little but the croissant was excellent and I loved everything else, except the sauce. 

My partner had one of the scrolls and I'm not sure if it was the wrong choice or what but this scroll tasted like poo. There was too much chick peas and the filling was just a jumbled mess or vegetables. The side salad that came with it was quite tasty and I would order that salad on its own.

Service was great but our waitress seemed a little spacey but it was family style and when our waitress wasn't around, other servers picked up the slack. 

One thing was that there was a bunch of bees buzzing around our food and around us. I'm not one to be scared of bees but they were being quite intrusive that at one point I had to get up and leave the table because they would not leave me alone. 

I'm 50-50 on whether or not I would go back but I do need to try their dinner menu and I think I may be pleasantly surprised as the food did smell delicious.
