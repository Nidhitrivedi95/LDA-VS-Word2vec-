2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw the food was great!! loved the chicken kebab platter. in main course, we tried the methi chicken - excellent and the dal makhani - again, delicious! oh, and they had roomali roti, which I was super excited about! not all restaurants serve it.

service was very good. we had a friendly, attentive server.

the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I found it to be a tad too expensive. i am up for paying for great food, however, this just seemed a tad pricier than I would be prepared to pay. main dishes ranged from $12-17. the roomali roti was $4!!! I had to think twice about ordering it.

in conclusion, definitely recommended and would visit again. however, would love it if the prices were lower.
