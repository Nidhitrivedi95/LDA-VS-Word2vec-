1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g This place is really nondescript, with a huge clunky door that opens up to a staircase going up to what is essentially an apartment-like space. It certainly was not crowded, and I wonder if it ever fills up. The menu is simple and easy to peruse, and we focused primarily on the Nepali stuff since that's what is supposedly unique here--not sure where else in Pittsburgh this can be found. The momo is a staple, which is a nice fusion of dumpling and curry flavor. More importantly for the Asian palate, the dumpling skin was great texture--not too soft but not too hard either. The thali (lamb, specifically) was tasty and had great variety. While the portion of actual meat was a tad small, the rest of the platter made up for it, with lots of herbs and spices in the sauce for flavor. Definitely reminded me of the Jackson Heights community in Queens, NY.
