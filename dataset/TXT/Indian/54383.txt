Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A We got lamb biryani and palak paneer. We exchanged gifts and it was so lovely. We had a voucher and my phone was dying. The server helped charged my dying phone and that was so nice of them~ They were very good and so was the food, this place does not disappoint! I then remember from the decor on the wall I was here last year to and I remember, their mango juice is very good.
