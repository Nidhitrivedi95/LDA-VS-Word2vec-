zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I work in Oakland and order Yuva very frequently! It's definitely my top choice of Indian food in the entire Pittsburgh region. I moved from LA recently where I had hands down the best food selections available. I haven't found much in comparison here in the burgh, except for Yuva. Great service, quick, very affordable and the portions are plentiful. I definitely recommend going here.
