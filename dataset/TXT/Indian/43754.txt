RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Pretty darn good, not the best but close.  Across from Children's hopsital so you have to handle the meter parking but usually spots open.  Staff is very nice and sincere, when you walk in you are not sure what to expect but it is a quaint, clean, comfortable interior with a bit of dress up.
