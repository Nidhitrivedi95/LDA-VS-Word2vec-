ZPhQyUO9MY5xNEcTqZOrTQ I came here on a weekday night and it was completely empty. I'm not familiar with Indian sweets so I spent some time looking at the display. Their sweets weren't labeled so it was hard for people like me who are new to Indian sweets. While I was choosing my sweets, the cashier looked annoyed with me and had an attitude. When we left, my bf asked, "Was it just me or was she really rude?" 

The sweets weren't too good either. I got 2lbs of sweets and ended up throwing away more than half. This was my second time at an Indian sweet shop. The first time I got Indian sweets, I devoured the box in a day. I will be returning to the other place and not this one.
