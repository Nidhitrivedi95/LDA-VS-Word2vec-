jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ What a treasure of a restaurant!  I had never eaten at an Indian restaurant, and was looking forward to trying some new foods.  The "picture book" menu was great, allowing me to look at all their selections, and ask Bali (the owner) questions about everything.  Bali is very friendly and happy to acquaint people with the dishes.  She runs a great little place with high-quality food, and I look forward to returning.
