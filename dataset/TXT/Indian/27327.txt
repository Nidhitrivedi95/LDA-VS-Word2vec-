ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w Was hungry on my way to a meeting and pulled into this plaza. Being a fan of Hakka, I chose this restaurant over the others and boy am I glad I did. 

A disclaimer. I'm a big fan of Hakka style food and as a result, I've been to a lot of Hakka restaurants. 

I arrived at 5pm. The place was empty. I figured it must be the timing as everyone was making their way home. 

The place is relatively new and has a very modern clean vibe which is nice. Seating for about 40. 

All of the tables were nicely set and everything was spotless. I've never been to a restaurant that is this clean (including the bathrooms). 

After some deliberation, and trying to eat healthier, I opted for the spicy Thai fish with steamed rice. 

Took about 12 min to arrive which was fair. 

The fish was extremely tender and flavourful. The sauce is spicy but not overbearing (I can handle heat but don't like food too spicy as it kills all the other delicious flavours). 

Generous portion of fish served in a delicious spicy sauce finished with coriander. 

The steamed rice was cooked perfectly. 

My only bone to pick is that there were a lot of lemon grass blades in the fish sauce - so almost every time you bite, you're chewing on the lemongrass. While flavourful, it's not very pleasant to chew on especially when you're tying to enjoy the actual meal. I'd recommend that the cook remove the blades of lemon grass prior to serving. 

The pieces ranges from .30-1cm. Some of them were obvious to the eye, whereas most of them surprises you when it's too late. 

All in all, this is an excellent restaurant with delicious food and great service. I would definitely recommend.
