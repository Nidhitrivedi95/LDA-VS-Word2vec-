RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Went for the weekend lunch buffet.  Very underwhelmed.  Where was the tikka masala?  Some dishes on the buffet were empty and not refilled for the duration of our time there.  Many vegetarian dishes but at 13 bucks a plate, show me some meat dishes.  Only two creamy rice dishes for dessert. They were both tasteless and quite icky.  The young man who seated us was terribly pleasant and made sure our plates were cleared in a timely manner.  Nice, minimalist decor. Up the quality and value and favors and it could be a hit.
