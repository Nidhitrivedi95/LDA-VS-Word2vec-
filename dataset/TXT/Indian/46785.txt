t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I thought I was in for a dining masterpiece after seeing the solid 5 stars on Yelp.  Unfortunately, my experience was a bit different than everyone else.

The service was pretty bad for us.  We got our orders taken right away, and the food was pretty fast, but then we didn't see anyone again for quite some time.  Our mouths were burning from our food and we had no water.  And when I went looking for someone to fill our water, I couldn't even find anyone.  That's ridiculous!

The food itself was OK, but not amazing.  Definitely overpriced.  If I hadn't have gotten a restaurant.com GC, I would have felt super ripped off.  As it is, I felt only a little ripped off.  I guess I'm spoiled, as I remember getting like 5 dishes for $35 at the Indian restaurant that closed on Decatur and Charleston.  Here, I barely got 2 dishes and an order of naan.

It is the closest Indian place to me that I know of, so I may be back.  But I won't be running back.
