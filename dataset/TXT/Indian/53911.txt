VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ Not the biggest fan of this place but occasionally get this when visiting my parents in Gilbert. I normally don't write bad reviews (because unless the experience is terrible, nobody feels the need to waste time and write a bad review) but I am especially peeved from my recent experience. Let me start by saying that the times I've been before weren't the most outstanding experiences either but they've never been terrible enough for me to exert myself to write a bad review. 

This time we ordered the Shahi paneer with naan to go and the curry came back literally watery. The paneer looked and tasted like it was a day or two old and over all there was no taste to the curry. I kid you not, it tasted like water. The naan was decent, nothing exceptional, but the size of the pieces are very small and thin. Let's just say me giving a two to this place is being generous. 

Bottomline, there are better options for Indian food in the Phoenix area. You're better off just driving a few extra miles for some decent tasting authentic Indian food.
