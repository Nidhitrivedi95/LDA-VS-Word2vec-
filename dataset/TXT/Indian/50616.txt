UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Best Indian food I've had in a long while, thanks Banjara! Good value, and definitely good taste.  I'd make this my regular place if it were closer to home.  I'll be back.

I like that we got variety out of their combo offerings.  We finished our meals (just barely) and were able to choose the mains that we wanted.

Service - Nice.  Even though the place was empty, we had to flag their attention a bit as they had just opened.  But, their niceness and promptness made up for everything.

Beef Korma - Sweet & rich, moreso than others I've had in the city.  Delicious!
Lamb Rogan Josh - Nice deep flavour.

Rice & veggies & desserts - All very consistently good.
