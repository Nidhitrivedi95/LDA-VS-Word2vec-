VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Ate lunch there after about a two mile walk from the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch.  Very good food.  Reasonable prices and a lunch menu with various specials for each day of the week.  Complementary chai.

Waitress was very pleasant and helpful. The restaurant was quite clean as were the bathrooms.  Would recommend.

Lunch menu choices were limited to six entrees.
