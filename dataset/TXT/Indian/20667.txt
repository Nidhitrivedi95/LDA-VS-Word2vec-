g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ Excellent food! Have now been here twice, and both times the food has been great. Take out takes a little time, but the food is worth it. The portion sizes are very generous, with the appetizers being big enough for a full meal. Last time the veggie thali was enough food for 3 meals. Overall would definitely recommend checking this place out.  The staff are friendly, the food is great, and the prices are very reasonable.
