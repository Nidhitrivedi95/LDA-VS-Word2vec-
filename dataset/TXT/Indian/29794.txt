jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Really loved the atmosphere of Lazeez! The service was great. The waitress was extremely helpful. It is a great place to get a quick bite. The portion size is larger. I was surprised when they brought the food out in to go boxes, but it made it so much easier to take home! Food was still delicious the next day. I've had such a hard time finding a place with good Chicken Tikka and I will definitely be back!
