yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ Two words: food poisoning. ACUTE food poisoning. Knew I should have trusted my instincts when I saw them prepping food on the same cutting board they had just cut raw meat on. Food was pre-cooked and reheated and still tasted overly salty and the wait was ridiculous (said 10m, waited over 20). This is the second time I've given this place a chance and the second disappointment. Won't be a third.
