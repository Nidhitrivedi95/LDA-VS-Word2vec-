xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw We are from the Boston area, here to visit our son. We have had our share of Indian cuisine at home. We did a little searching and decided to drive to Cleveland Tiffin for lunch. 

Don't let the sparse decor fool you. They make everything fresh to order and it was delicious! There are plenty of dishes for meat eaters and also vegetarians. We ordered vegetable samosas, chicken curry, chicken vindaloo, paratha, and malai kofta. 

The owners were extremely friendly and checked on us often. Overall, a very pleasant experience.
