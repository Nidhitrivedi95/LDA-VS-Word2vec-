1q-0v6rg3X-K6qMj81wt-Q DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!

I've lived in Bloordale for a few years and have never been in enough of a hurry to try this place. However, there are very few takeout options in the neighbourhood so I figured why not! The first time I ate there it wasn't great but it the spot so I ate my meal. I didn't think much beyond acknowledging it was a mediocre place and to actively avoid eating there. 

A few months later I was craving Indian food so I went in and got one of the daily specials, I figured that it would have to be good seeing as it's what was the special of the day. I ate my meal and a few hours later was vomiting violently. This turned into a 4 day bout with food poisoning. I have an iron stomach so it was definitely out of the ordinary for me. 

I'm pretty sure the food is never fresh and every time I walk past the place I shudder to think that people are patrons of such a poor quality establishment.


Please do yourself a favour, when walking past it just keep walking. 

 I'm all about supporting businesses in my neighbourhood but when it comes to places that could potentially make other people sick too I will always err on the side of warning people to avoid certain places.
