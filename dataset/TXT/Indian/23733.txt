gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Thursday lunch, spouse and I arrived at about 12:25 and were seated quickly by a friendly male.  The booth had white linen table cloth and white cloth napkins with better than the usual flatware and water goblet.  Unfortunately, lunch is ONLY the buffet for $10.99 [it is not clear if this is ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT].  A menu is only for dinner.
The buffet had a "sneeze" shield with sticky notes with handwritten names for whatever was under the shield.  The labels were for the Indian name of the dish; not very helpful if you're not an Indian speaker.
The "wet" items were soupy and the "dry" items were dry to an extreme.  The two best items, IMHO, were the chicken curry and the white rice, while the others were forgettable.  The condiments I normally associate with curry [like coconut, peanuts, grated onion, etc. were absent; although the chutney was present, but unremarkable as chutney].
I would hazard a guess that those giving five stars are native speakers and are familiar with the food in the buffet.  Since I'm neither, this made things awkward.
