fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA India's Taste is a small AYCE buffet restaurant on Denison that is really hard to spot if you're just driving by. It may look old and "ghetto/sketchy" from the outside but inside is a nicely decorated venue. 

The buffet itself is really delicious! The only problem here, is that there isn't too much variety. You can make your own chaat which I highly recommend, (google it or ask a server if you're not familiar!) 

They have the basics like panner, butter chicken, fish pakoras, veg and non-veg thali and daal, but don't have a lot of the specialty dishes that you'd find at higher end buffets (aka ones in Brampton). However, for the price ($15 for lunch) it is definitely worth it. You'll be full and will leave satisfied.

Service can be a little lack lustre at times. We would often be waiting 5-10 minutes for a waiter to bring us more naan. There were 6 of us so you could imagine how quickly a basket of 6 naan would finish up haha. Overall service was not bad though and I give them a solid 3.5.
