3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw I came here as part of Dishcrawl and didn't get to sample their entire menu, but what I sampled was quite good.

The Aloo Papri Chaat was like a threesome (of sweet, sour and spicy) happening in your mouth.  The dish was served cold, which threw me off by surprise, but didn't impeded on the yum factor!

Their butter chicken is one of the lightest I have tasted and doesn't leave you feeling like you are 3 months preggers.  The chicken itself was quite tender, and the dish overall is very mild.

The only thing that I thought was bad was their burnt, and bland naan.  It was just plain old naan but reminded me of the non-existence of flavour that one would find in a communion wafer at a Catholic Church.  

I can't wait to come back and try their other dishes!
