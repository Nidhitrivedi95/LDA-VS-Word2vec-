nAnpTnodDchSl9H0f6R2pw I have had food from Bhoj twice now. The first time the food was great, it all came out quickly and the flavones were fantastic. This was about a week after they had opened. 

My second time with Bhoj, I was so terribly disappointed. I ordered UberEATS (and yes I know delivery is never going to be as good as when you receive the food fresh) and each of the dishes were lacking, we had saag paneer, daal, butter chicken, as well as basmati rice, garlic naan, and the vegetarian sampler platter. This is essentially what we had ordered the first time, only this time there was a layer of grease on top of each dish (about 3 centimeters). I was definitely repulsed, but still thought that the flavors could be there, honestly who doesn't love some grease now and then, I won't be deterred by that. However this time there was basically no flavor. About 2 pieces of paneer in the saag paneer, the daal was overly salted and yet lacked flavor. 

I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately after such a poor experience I can't say I do.
