0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ As good as Hakka gets. I know it's a bold statement but I am yet to be proven wrong. A little bit about me. I have lived in Calcutta, India (home of one of the largest Hakka communities) and I still go back for visits, so I really understand Hakka.

Details:

Ambience: Small joint in a strip mall, not much to write home about. Not sketchy. 

Crowd: Brown people (lol). 

Variety: Many cheap cheap cheap courses to choose from. Not that it matters to me because I always go for my staple Manchurian Chicken and Hakka Noodles. And a mountain of white rice that is included with every dish, I believe. Btw, I don't eat spicy food so I order my food mild.

Verdict? The owner is a gem of a guy. The servers are ever-smiling. I just love the vibe in this little restaurant. And the food is great.
