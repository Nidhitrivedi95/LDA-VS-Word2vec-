FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Stopped in for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed. Buffet selection was great and food quality was excellent- paneer masala and naan were very fresh. Dessert was excellent as well. Restaurant is very spacious and clean and wait staff is incredibly friendly. Best Indian Food in Madison!!!
