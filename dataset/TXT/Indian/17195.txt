DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Finally got to check this place out after driving past it for weeks! The food is delicious. Butter chicken is wonderful and hits the spot but the service is terrible! Hostess is rude and service is slow! Basically mission impossible to try to ask for something or get their attention. Would not recommend honestly!
