Gj3EI0cqh1ZpC86sDHtf7w The gates of India is a nice place to go for your Indian meal. The layout of the restaurant is lovely considering the small area they actually have. It's long and narrow but they have managed to get some lovely booths in down one side which really makes the restaurant feel authentic. There is also plenty of parking bays on the road outside and you'll be almost guaranteed to find a couple of spaces. THe food is great, and okay priced. As always, the drinks are too expensive. But this is universal these days. The staff are friendly and i can honestly say you will not be disappointed with the overall experience.
