V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg I hate the guys who are working there, before I never miss to have something to eat on Amaya in Eton centre, I like there , and I like there service, but I don't like Amaya on Yorkdale mall, the guys are rude, they don't talk polite and they show costumers attitude, I don't wish to go there anymore, and I advice to my friends don't try Amaya on Yorkdale
