PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Good food, but can't say it was great. I had high expectations upon reading the reviews here. We did a take out order of Onion pakoras, Navratan Korma, Paneer Butter Masala, Naans and Lassi. The pakora was just ok, gravies were slightly runny and not up to the mark, naans were well done, lassi was very refreshing. We also reordered the naans on another occasion and it was very good. Service was quick and our order was ready for pickup before time. Price point is on the higher side and ambience is of a fast food joint than a restaurant. Overall, slightly disappointing (except for the very good naans!) and loads of scope for improvement on the gravies.
