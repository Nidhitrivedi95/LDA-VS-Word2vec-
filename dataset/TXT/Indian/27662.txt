Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Absolutely the best indian food in Charlotte! Great service and an absolutely authentic Taj chef makes this north indian cuisine his own. I highly recommend the Tandoor paneer, Methi chicken, Chicken tikka masala. All are available in 4 different levels of spice. A must visit for anyone craving authentic indian food. A la carte style big enough to share with the while family. Ask the owner about the plates and he will go into  detail on his training from India. Will definitely be returning...often.
