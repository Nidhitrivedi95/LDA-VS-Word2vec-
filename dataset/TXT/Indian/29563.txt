jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg Good food! Diverse menu. We ordered Gobi Manchurian and it was really good and spicy. I had the hakka noodles which were good but could have brought side of soy sauce or other Chinese sauces to make less dry. Husband ordered Mysore Dosa and that was very good and even little Sarina had some. Family friendly!
Service was friendly, and kept refilling water. I do wish they were a little less quick to pick up plates which made it feel a bit rushed.
