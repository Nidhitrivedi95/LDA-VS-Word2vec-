aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q Boasting astoundingly affordable and piping hot fresh foodstuffs of various savory texture and consistency, Indies is a perfect fast-grab Indian lunch spot, conveniently located in the heart of Cleveland's esteemed 5th Street Arcade. Indeed, of all six or so lunch spots crammed into the small, dingy, rather viciously humid food court at the arcade's center, Indies was the only with a substantial line--and with good reason. The portions are huge and served rapid fire, though there was some slowdown when the credit reader malfunctioned. The owner (?) was affable, if slightly cold, telling one guest in no uncertain terms that there was no way he'd be able to select for the guest, or surprise the guest, and it was up to the guest alone to choose every one of his three-for-$6.75 options from the admittedly slightly difficult to read and confusing menu above (such menu, it should be noted was kindly broken up into vegetarian/vegan and meat options). This no-nonsense attitude is rather humorous to John Q Onlooker, and also probably should be sort of expected, as one imagines the owner (?) feels the stress of the quotidian nonstop lunch rush given just how tasty and satisfying his menu offerings are. Others have described the food as lacking on the spices, but your reviewer's medley of #2, #5, and #13 was an expert blend of spicy, savory, and sweet. The naan was slightly doughy, however, and probably won't be on the list next visit. Regardless, for those in a hurry, Indies is, on the whole, prime time tasty and well worth the minimal price tag.
