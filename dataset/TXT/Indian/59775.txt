ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I've been here a couple of times now, once for dinner and once during the lunch buffet. Dinner entrees can be ordered at different spicy levels and if you love heat this is the place. Everything was delicious, but the vegetarian dishes were particularly good. The meat dishes were all excellent and have to admit the goat dish was tender and flavorful.
