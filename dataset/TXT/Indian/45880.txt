SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg We went into this place yesterday, We had a gift Card for $25, to make a long story short, they marked up all the prices to make up for that $25 as I found out when I got home, VERY expensive for Indian, and it took about 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered (there was only two other tables full as so they were not busy) The food was good, not the best I have ever had, and def. not worth the prices, I should have listened to the other reviews, it would have saved a lot of money,  I would call this the Burger King of Indian. not as bad as Mantra Masala (STAY AWAY FROM THAT PLACE!)
