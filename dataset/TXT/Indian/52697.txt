Uyw1pJ03kt-I1B_tkA3aFg Food is very good, if a bit expensive. Not many Indian options in Matthews so I was excited for something so close. Says they do dine in, but they're definitely not setup for it.  I received my food, then our appetizer came 5 minutes later, followed shortly by my wife's haleem and probably 10 minutes later my son's biriyani came out.  

No glasses, water is bottled and $1.20, which costs more than their canned soda offering. A pitcher of tap water would be fine, but wasn't offered. Something to keep in mind if you order something spicy... Mango lassy came in small styrofoam cup. 

Would probably order again for takeout, but the meals seemed lacking. Order a kebab and that's all you get, $10 for a couple chunks of meat. $14 haleem, same deal. No bread, no rice, no veg, everything is ordered separately. Kinda hard to make a meal without spending $20/pp ordering multiple things and $50-60 is a lot to spend on takeout.
