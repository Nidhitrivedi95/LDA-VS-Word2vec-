yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Dhaba is considered an authentic Punjabi cuisine.  I have been to many North Indian cuisine restaurants, and I have an idea of what most of the dishes are.  Unfortunately with the Dhaba, you would have some of the similar lingo, but the name would be so long with other adjectives or Punjabi words that confused the heck out of me.  We finally figured out what we wanted, and ordered from our cute waitress.  We got the chana masala, palak paneer, and mutter paneer. For breads we got garlic naan and something else with a sweet taste.

The food was average at best, and the portion sizes were extremely small.  I had a Groupon for $30 for $60, and I can see the Groupon covering up the lack of quantity.  

The ambiance is this place is pretty well light and glowing for a nice date who wants to try ethnic cuisines.  It is a decent place, but I would not come here if you really hungry.
