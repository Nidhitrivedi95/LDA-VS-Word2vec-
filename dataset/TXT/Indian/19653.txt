Fl-ToG3j9jVBY43NOmCOkA I was sooooo looking forward to a great review considering that I visited Zaidi's Grill because of Yelp's reviews.  The people couldn't be nicer so I wish that I had better news.  I wanted beef samosas but they didn't make them anymore.  The chicken patty is also no longer made.  They had pakora's but I don't want vegetables battered and fried. (I'll eat my calories at Hagen Daaz thank you.)  My eating partner had the chicken boti which comes a la carte but they added about a half a cup of rice as a bonus.  Very nice.  We had the roti which was puffy but nothing to write home about.  I had a beef dish (can't remember name)  that consisted of a piece of beef with a sauce that seemed to have file(fee-lay) powder in it --the stuff they use in New orleans to thicken Gumbo.  First, I had to scoop out about 8 tablespoons of oil from the top of the dish onto another dish.  I spent some time doing this so much so that the owner realized what I was doing.  He politely assured me that it was only vegetable oil (as opposed to butter, I guess). I told him that I really didn't want the calories of the oil (also concerned about stomach's reaction to so much fat, but I didn't say this to him).  So all in all, my eating partner had an average meal and I ending up packing the meal and frankly I don't know what I am going to do with it.  By the way, they served a very tasty hot sauce which is house made.  As I said before, the owner/server could not have been nicer.  I was so disappointed considering I adore this type cuisine.  Wish I could have had a better experience.  By the way, there was no one in the dining room on a Friday night.  Not a good sign.
