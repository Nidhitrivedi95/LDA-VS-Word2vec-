tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg if there was a scale to rate , ill give this place -10. for starters their servers are rude and arrogant. we had to talk to 2 servers and each told us a different story.  My little cousin took chicken tikka from buffet while we wanted to order from ala carte, one of the servers told us we cant or the child has to sit on a separate table in order to get served from the buffet. Ridiculous!! coming to the food, the buffet was cold and looked stale. Food quality is a serious issue here. taste was average so i'd give it a 6. I have been t this place twice and i have to say each time i was extremely disappointed.
