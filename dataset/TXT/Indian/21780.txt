gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw I tried the Normal Gyro. I wasnt up for a Super Gyro since i was attending a Photo Walk. Nice menu for all varying tastes. My Gyro and fries came out in a decent time frame. Love the seasoning on the fries. And my Gyro was delicious with good sauce and fresh vegetables. The only gripe is they have Canned Soda and on the menu it lists sizes like they had a Soda Fountain. I wish they would hook it up or bring one in. Id love to have unlimited refills instead of paying a Dollar per can cause im a thirsty individual. But thats not enough to stop me from never making this my Gyro Stop.
