TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Best new place I've tried in a while,  my girl bought a Groupon here and we tried it,  they have an amazing lunch buffet for 11.95  but we couldn't use Groupon for that,  so I got the house special chicken mahtihka  I think I spelled that right  omg so good,  the rice and the garlic nan  I was in heaven.  Manny our writers was so sweet,  the cutest little buffet Indian guy I've ever seen :) can't wait to come and bring my kids here for the buffet!!!
