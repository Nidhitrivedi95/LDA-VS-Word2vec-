UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I had a buy one get one entree coupon to this restaurant, so I decided to stop by because I really like Indian food. It was buffet time there, and most restaurants don't honor the bogo entree coupons for buffet, so I was thinking it might not go as planned, but the waiter said I could use it! Great deal. The other bonus about this place besides how good the food tastes, is that it offers gluten free food actually labeled "gluten free." I have celiac disease so that meant a lot to me. Thanks Mint Indian Bistro. I like you guys.
