GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g This is top-notch, delicious food.  My friend from Mumbai told me that it is as "authentic as you can get here in the US" and I believe her.  Here's the thing:  heretofore I couldn't eat Indian food, whereas my wife would have had it fed to her intraveneously if possible.  Now, when we go to Woodlands, I eat everything and LOVE IT!!!!  Paneer is phenomenal.  Chenna Battura (sp?) brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it.  I have ordered, devoured, and thoroughly enjoyed about 3/4 of the menu.  

To further expound:  I could give a crap about ambiance, as long as I am not in a dangerous or filthy place.  Woodlands is immaculately clean and in an upscale Chandler location.  Really could not care less about the lack of interior decor or the fact that they use styrofoam cups and plates (which, from what I understand, is a significant "upgrade" from what you can expect in a South India marketplace).  Not here for a luxurious dining experience.  Just to eat.  And eat I do, in a clean, friendly, well-served location that offers delicious, authentic Indian food.  PS:  if you ever travel outside the US you'll find that about 98% of the world doesn't eat in restaurants like our spoiled fat butts--they eat in a market or order from street vendors.  Compared to this, Woodlands is off the chart in terms of luxury and taste.  And, again, compared to all other Indian food (which I could not eat before), this is the best.  Prices cannot be beat.  GO THERE AND CHECK IT OUT!!!!
