b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Nice Indian restaurant in Lakewood.  I had the rava masala dosa.  It's about 12$ but the dosa is huge!  You could definitely get two meals out of it.  In fact I'm looking forward to eating the other half for breakfast tomorrow. 
I only tried the idli and dosa.  I think this place is known for its South Indian cuisine.  Theres ample metered street parking that's free on weekends.  If you're here stop by Lakewood Park, less than a mile away to see great views of downtown cle across the Lake.
