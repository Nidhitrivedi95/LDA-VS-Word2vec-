ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg My wife and I were celebrating out 16th wedding anniversary yesterday and wanted to try something different, so we decided to try out an Indian Restaurant in Summerlin. It was my first time eating at an Indian Restaurant and the experience was great from the start! Upon entering, we were greeted by a couple of the staff members and immediately ushered to a booth. One of the waiters brought out a thin bread and chutney and a tamarind sauce, kind of like chips and salsa. Drinks and entrees were ordered by way of a recommendation by our waiter. I had the Chicken Tikki Masala and my wife had the Spicy Coconut Curry, which was excellent with the Basmati rice. I'm not an expert in Indian cuisine, but I did enjoy the flavors of both dishes. The portions were more than adequate, so we took home some leftovers. 

Aside from the food, the restaurant was clean and the entire staff was friendly and very accommodating. The prices were reasonable and we definitely will be visiting this fine establishment again to try out their lunch buffet.
