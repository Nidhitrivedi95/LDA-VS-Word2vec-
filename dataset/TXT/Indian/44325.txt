rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ We tried the Stuffed Paneer, Bread platter and the Dal Makhni. The dal makhni was oily. The stuffed paneer was tasteless. Indian food is supposed to be flavorful but the different dishes were anything but flavorful. It is overpriced for the kind of food we got. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you want to shell out money for no rhyme or reason.
