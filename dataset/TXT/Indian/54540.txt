The service here is great and so is the ambience. Unfortunately everything else you can get better from the frozen foods isle at Loblaws.

The lunch wasn't terrible...but the delivered dinner was really hard to swallow. I don't normally enjoy writing mean reviews but carrot aachar and white rice mixed together should NOT be called vegetable biryani!
