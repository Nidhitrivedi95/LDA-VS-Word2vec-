J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I came here for dinner with a few friends. The food was great and service was ok. Price is also reasonable. We had the korma, paneer, eggplant and egg roti. I would recommend the paneer and korma. We had ordered this hot sizzling meat dish but it never came. For that I am only giving them a 4. The waiter was not really totally all there.
