DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew **Edit** This WAS a great contemporary Indian restaurant. Seems to have fallen off the last few times I went and after tonight's ordeal I doubt they even have a tandoori oven. Shame, it WAS a great eatery...below is my original 5 star review.

Mumbai is famous for its seafood so the fish curry here has to be amazing, and it is. Try a Mumbai Mule to wash it down too.

In South Asian cuisine the simple things are the determining factors to successful restaurants and you can tell by the amount of south asians that frequent the place that the food is second to none. 

Samosas are amazing, naan is good, lunch specials are great. I love the decor and atmosphere. I've been for casual dining and held business dinners here and no one has left disappointed.

What makes it contemporary, I suppose, is the small plates. I have one Pakistani friend that doesn't like tapas because he isn't full unless he has a curry, so we were able to keep everyone happy here. 

Love the place.
