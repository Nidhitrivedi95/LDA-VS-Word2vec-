svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w This review is for two things: the samosas and the service.

1. Samosas - as I live in the area, I would often stop by for samosas. Were they the best samosas ever? No. But they were 10 for $3 and big crispy things with a decent filling. A few months ago, they decided to change their recipe. Why, I do not know, as they were pretty decent before. Now they're awful. The shell is almost bread-y and sort of... damp. It might as well be a samosa pizza pocket. Horrified, I asked the woman that works at the counter if this change was going to last forever. Which brings me to my next point...

2. Service - when asked about the old samosa recipe ever making a return, the woman just gave a curt 'no'. I mentioned how much my boyfriend and I loved the old samosas and she just stared at me as if waiting for me to order. This may not seem like a huge service issue, but every time I'm there, I feel a certain coldness from the staff. They've also papered the restaurant with all sorts of "rules" (regarding where you can eat your food, bikes leaning against the building, what doors to enter, etc), that are visible from the outside. This may seem like an innocuous detail, but there are so many of these rules now, it drives me crazy. The restaurant didn't use to be like this, so I'm not sure what has happened in the past few months.

Honestly, I walk by this place twice a day and it makes me long for the glory days of Dosa Mahal.
