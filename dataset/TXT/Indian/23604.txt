gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A A very generous 2 star. And that's for clean restrooms and overall cleanliness. 

We went in for the lunch buffet. I will remember just 2 tastes coming out from here - Sweet and bland. 

The buffet has the standard fare of veg and non veg curries along with sweet rice (rice + honey!!!?!) and basmati rice. Naan served on the table.  Of the curries I sampled, heres what they tasted like - 

Mixed veg korma - sweet and creamy 
Chicken curry - sweet
Chicken Tikka - sweet
Dal makhni - bland. And no trace of salt. 
Chilli chicken - sweet. Yes, this traditionally spicy indo Chinese dish is sweet here... Akin to mandarin chicken at panda express. 
Pakora - manageable but somewhat soft and soggy
Tandoori chicken - cold. But perhaps better than the remaining dishes. 


If you are expecting a spicy Indian fare.. Look elsewhere.
