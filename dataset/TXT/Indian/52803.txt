V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w I guess today it's their first new ownership crew, they seem a little confused and unorganized. I had the spicy chicken and tiki masala.  Great food, right amount of spice and not overwhelming. 
However the naan was pretty flat and not hot enough. It's been a while since I had Indian food ,but their yogurt sauce was too watery for me. I think it's supposed to be thicker like tzatziki sauce.
