GJZV3ltRSxV4O3fnkRKRQA I always passed by this place when I go grocery shopping. I decided to try it today and was disappointed.

The food quality is so-so, quantity small, and prices way up there. This is mainly a takeout joint, but the prices are equivalent or above a sit-in restaurant.

I tried the chicken samosas - small, but good. The Chicken Tikka was moist, and "ok". The lamb biryani had only a couple of pieces of meat and the rice was soggy, on the verge of being in a puddle of water.

Probably won't go again.
