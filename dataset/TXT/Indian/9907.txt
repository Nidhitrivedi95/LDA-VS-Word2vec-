9cGvOaA1BYw-ByOXjNbu9A I ate here while in town for work and was glad to find Priya. I had a Delicious and well-seasoned dinner. They also had a delicious-looking and well-stocked chaat bar and a broader selection of South Indian cuisine than I can usually get. I ultimately decided against dosa and went with the guthi vankaya and mix grill and they were both excellent.  The food was made for us, so the service is a little slower than I am accustomed to--just keep it in mind and call in your order if your time frame is limited. Once you get the food, it's worth the wait.
