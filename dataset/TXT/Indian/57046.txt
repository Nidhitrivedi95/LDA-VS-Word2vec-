xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw This was my first trip to the new location, it's been awhile since going to FBH and I wasn't aware they had moved.  The spacious new digs are a big improvement over the moderately squeezed 7th avenue spot, especially the parking.  Although I went in for a take-out order, I could appreciate the huge dining room where you wouldn't have to sit right on top of somebody.  If you go there for anything else than the food you might find it a little 'sterile', but of course the food is everything.  

I was greeted by a cashier, she was exceptionally nice and made me feel welcome.  Opting for my favorite, I ordered the bean (whole bean) and cheese fry bread.  My order was ready in about 10 minutes and I headed for home (7 miles) where I found the meal was still hot.  

FBH knows how to cook beans; they are the best in the city and prepared to perfection.  They don't skimp, the cheese is the real deal and the fry bread is divinity - as advertised.  Add-in their supplied homemade hot sauce and you've got a delicious 'homemade' meal.  The only thing I could compare it to was a favorite meal my mother used to make many years ago - cornbread and beans.  This Indian-style version of that meal certainly tastes homemade to me.  

Let's hope the expanded version of FBH brings them much success.  For the uniqueness and quality of their food at bargain prices - they've earned it.  FBH is scheduled to move once again to the southeast corner of 7th Avenue and Hazelwood, about 5 blocks south of Camelback.
