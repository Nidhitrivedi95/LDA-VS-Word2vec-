eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg First off I enjoy this place because they do a Buffett during the day for $10 plus tax. I have only had the diner service and it is 15-20$ per person. We shared 2 entres and had naan. Everything was great good flavors here and pretty much in par with other restaurants. Maybe they could include the cost of rice instead of charging extra? Maybe some people don't eat rice with there meal but most of us do. Anyway next time I'm back will be for the Buffett :) good price...
