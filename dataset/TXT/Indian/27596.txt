Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg I heard incredible reviews of Tamarind before I went, so I had pretty high expectations. I'm pleased to report that my expectations were totally met! We got the garlic naan, rojan josh, and chicken tikka masala served with basmati rice. All of it was good, but the tikka masala was by FAR our favorite.Creamy and full of amazing flavor! My 2, 4, and 6 year old loved it, although it was a wee bit spicy for my 2 year old. 

The industrial decor is on point and the service is good. Tamarind is definitely going on our list of favorite restaurants! Thanks for a completely delicious dining experience!
