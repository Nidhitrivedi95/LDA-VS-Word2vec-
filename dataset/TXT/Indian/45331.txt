s6IPjR2nSJqhXcGJ49Ckiw This may have been the worst dining experience we have ever had. To be fair, I think they had opened very recently and they seemed totally unprepared for customers. The restaurant was very warm, the service was very slow and the food was almost inedible. We ordered the pakoras to start and when they finally arrived, they were nothing like pakoras. When we asked the waitress about it, she simply said that this was their take on pakoras. That fine but they weren't pakoras and they weren't at all what was pictured in the menu. Things just got worse from there and when our main courses arrived my husband found his to be inedible due to the spicing. Now he likes very spicy food so this was odd but I tasted it and it seemed as though someone  slipped during the cooking process.
My advice, skip this place at all costs. We left feeling frustrated, hot and hungry.
