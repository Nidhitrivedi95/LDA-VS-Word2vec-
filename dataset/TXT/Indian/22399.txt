gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA I came to las vegas for a quick business trip over the weekend and was looking for some great indian food but i did not have enough time to go to a nice sit down place. THEN I FOUND THIS PLACE in the fashion show mall none the less, best location for any tourist to come. Not only was the food served to me fast but it was so fresh and it tasted amazing. 

I ended up getting the non veg combo platter ( which included chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, rice , naan and some lentils)  since i wanted to try a little bit of everything and i also got a samosa chaat with an ice cold mango lassi. I must say for all this food it was reasonably priced , especially for the location on the strip. 

i will definitely be coming back to india masala on my next trip.
