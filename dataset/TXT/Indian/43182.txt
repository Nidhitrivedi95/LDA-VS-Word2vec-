RJMblVTTzmEefL8Cge_TrQ This place is horrible.  Came here for lunch (Summerlicious 2015) with 2 friends.  Service was mediocre but the worst part was the food.

The theme was Mexican...  Appetizers, such as 'Corn Chips with Corn Salsa' and 'Chilled Avocado Soup' were good, but when our mains came (we all ordered the same thing - 'Carne Asada/beef tacos with a side of corn on the cob'), we were DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED.  The corn tortillas were so soggy to the point that we couldn't properly lift the tacos to eat them.  The meat was also quite bland.  My friend had to use a fork to eat the meat, and discard the tortillas.  I don't normally speak up when it comes to bad food (I usually just bear with it and make a mental note not to come back), but in this case, I had to say something when the manager passed by.  She said other customers had noticed the same thing, but her defense was that since the tortillas are made out of corn, they tend to fall apart (WHA? At home, I put my corn tortillas over the gas burner or grill to crisp them up a bit, so have never had this problem..  They couldn't do this here?).  She offered to have the kitchen re-plate them using flour tortillas instead.  We declined because we were pressed for time and had to go back to work (it took long enough for the mains to come out, even though the restaurant wasn't very busy).

Desserts were pitiful.  We requested our desserts to go (because service was so slow)...  Good thing we opened them up as soon as they came, because my friend discovered that they gave her an incorrect order...  My churros order comprised of 4 mini ones that looked like dog poop.  I had a bite of one of them...  Didn't taste fresh, was quite soggy with oil.  My other friend ordered some pineapple fritters, which were also soggy.

Needless to say, I will not be back to T Bar...  The food/service irked me so much that I felt compelled to write a review!
