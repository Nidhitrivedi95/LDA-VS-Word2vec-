Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A The food is great and the prices are good. I've driven 35 minutes several times to dine there. Do not go there for atmosphere. Also, unfortunately the person who seats you is also the person who takes your order and brings you your food. He doesn't bother to check in with you once your food arrives and acts annoyed when you try to flag him down for more food or a check. We were actually intimidated to ask for more napkins and order more naan. I'm willing to put up with that from time to time for the food but would go there more often if the service was better and at least a LITTLE friendly.
