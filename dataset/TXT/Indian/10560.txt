A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA For vegan and strict vegetarians, this place is a good option.

I would recommend going for dosas, and maybe the thali plate if going on your own. it's a nice fill.

If you have a group of you going and you're mixed vegetarians and not, this isn't the best option. I've found more veggie dishes at other indian food restaurants, even those that also carry meat. Overall the food is bread, crepe heavy upatham and dosa's, not many veggie dishes other than 2 curry dishes.

The food was very tasty, we all enjoyed it, the price for 5 was under $75, very reasonable and we were very full, but it would have been nicer to have a broader array of options. That said - if you're going with dosas in mind or for lunch, this place is great.

Nice staff, nice attention to food quality.
