jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Buffet at Pure Indian Cuisine was very reasonable and good!  We all enjoyed the $10.99/per person buffet.  The buffet consisted of salad items, meat curries like goat curry, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, vegetable curries like daal and chickpea.  Naan was provided freshly-made to our table.  Quite tasty and quick to eat.

Loated in the industrial area on Sunset Road, right across from the Las Vegas airport.  You can watch the planes take off and land right on the airway strip.
