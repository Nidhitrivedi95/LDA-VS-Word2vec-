i3rdifli2uVDfAn5-E4jmg Hesitated to review because I really don't want people to know about this place... I will never have to search for a staple indian place again. The food is as authentic as it gets in Montreal, portions are generous and the prices are more than fair.

If you don't care about decor and enjoy laughing at Bollywood pop videos while eating magnificent food, this place is for you. BYOB.
