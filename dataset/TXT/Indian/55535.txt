X1OnZ6sy5c5TmZCDwCR1Gg The Website says Tiffin for a tenner 5-7pm. I rang to book and was told it's only till 6.30pm.
Booked a table, but as soon as I said my name, they hung up.
We arrived and there was no record of our booking, but they managed to squeeze us into the empty restaurant.
We were given the A'la carte menu, and had to ask for the Tiffin menu.
we asked for the Tiffin for a Tenner deal and were told it was only on at lunchtimes.
I explained that it said 5-7 on their website and that I had rung up also. The waiter went away and spoke to his colleague and after much arm waving and shouting we were reluctantly given the Tiffin for a Tenner menu.
We ordered the food, it was very nice, but the whole evening was soured by the fact they seem to want to just extract as much money as possible from their customers.
The desserts were lovely but overpriced and the young lady who served us a special blend of tea was charming.
The toilets were filthy, the tiles were coming off the wall at the sink and there were no hand towels.
Despite the fact we enjoyed the food, it's unlikely we'd go back as the way we were treated upon arrival left us with a sour taste.
It seems there sole purpose is to rip customers off. Very disappointing and I expect Tony Singh won't be very amused when I let him know.
