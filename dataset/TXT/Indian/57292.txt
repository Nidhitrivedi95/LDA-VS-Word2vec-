Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ This is my indian restaurant of choice and my location of choice between Monroeville and Oakland.  The food is yummy!  I am a curry destroying machine!  I'm usually there for the buffets and the food is always fresh and hot.  Getting a refill on a drink other tha water can sometimes be annoying, but all things considered, I'm happy to spend my money here.
