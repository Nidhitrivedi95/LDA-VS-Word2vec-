3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA First time coming here for the lunch and it enjoyed it better than other indian buffets that I have been to.

There is a large selection of food that takes up the back wall. You have a choice between regular or garlic nan, I prefer the garlic one. 

Most tandoori chicken at other places are usually dry, but this one was nice and tender!

Definitely worth trying out (:
