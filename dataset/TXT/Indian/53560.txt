vFnzV9uy9nEXFQgkSuv_AQ What happened to this place? I admit that I haven't been here in a while. Used to be bustling with people. Came Saturday night at 6 pm and we were here with just one other couple. The place was designed English pub style with a log bar along the right side of the room with beer and ale  signs all around the dining space. Decor is still there but the server said they stopped serving beer and wine 1 month ago. Food was OK in flavor but minimal portions of chicken and lamb in the dishes. As we departed at 715 we left the place empty with staff sitting at the bar watching TV. At one time this was one of the better Indian places in the Valley-not anymore, unfortunately!
