ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ I've probably had take out here 20 times over the years.   The food quality is great and is consistent.  Pickup time is usually 20 mins and that too is consistent.  Rarely if ever have I had to wait.

We love the Coriander Green Lamb Special, and their other curries.  Onion bajji (sp?) dish is also excellent.  

I haven't ever eaten in their dining room, but the ambiance seems good.  I have never seen it packed, but usually there are 5-6 tables seated when I go in.

The staff seem friendly, and always greet me with a smile.
