TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Right down the street from the 'financial district' of Vegas you will find the hidden gem in one the ghetto hoods of LV. Inside this palace it is very clean and the $12 buffet is tasty. I loved it when I ate meat and appreciate it 10x's more now that I don't. The veggie dishes with naan bread is all I need for lunch. Keep that naan bread coming because its the best i've had. It always fresh and hardly ever doughy. Try the veggie fritters too. Dam, my mouth is starting to water just thinking about it.
