GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw Came here on a Friday night and it wasn't terribly busy (except for a birthday bash that was going on). It's located in the basement area, smell, but well-kept. 

Our waitress was fairly attentive and very sweet. The food didn't take too long and we were given complimentary papdum as an appetizer. Fairly decent, nothing to complain about when it comes to free food(ish). My date got the Lamb Vindaloo and I got the Fish Masala. The fish masala had enough sauce that it balanced out the fairly bland flavour of tilapia, but the lamb vindaloo was better. Though to be honest, I did find that the sauces were a little bit bland compared to what I've had before and maybe could've used a bit more salt. Portions are kind of small and I've paid less for way more (and better tasting). Naan was a-okay though! 

Would I come back? Eh, maybe... though probs not. If I do, I'd probably would order more well-known Indian staples next time and see.
