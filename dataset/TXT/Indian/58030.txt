yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I have been to Dhaba a couple of times and I have never been impressed by their food. I am very particular about Indian food because I am Indian. I was forced to visit Dhaba again because everyone in the group wanted to. They have really improved the quality of the food. I definitely recommend their paneer tikka masala and Chilli naan. The naan is not too spicy and perfect for the curries.
