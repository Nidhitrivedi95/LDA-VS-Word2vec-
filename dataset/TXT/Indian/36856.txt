nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ I was conflicted about doing this review. If this place gets too many good reviews, I would have to make reservations to go. Right now it seems mostly Ryerson students who have discovered it. If you are near the Eaton Centre or City Hall check it out. The food is delicious, and the cost is minimal. Good thing since I did not know it didn't take credit cards.
