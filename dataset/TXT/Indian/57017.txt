xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw When your friend who makes fry bread, vouches for this place and says it's the real deal, you go down there and check this place out.  And that's exactly what I did.  It is mosy definitely good, greasy, junk food.  In oh so glorious fry bread.  Some of their items are a little pricey, the honey and sugar fry bread, for one, but it sounds and tastes so good, you suck it up and order it anyway.  The flavors are overflowing, both figuratively and literally as the tacos mostly fall apart the second you try to pick it up.  They do provide a fork and knife to help with this, but don't do that, use your fry bread and scoop everything right up even if it makes your taco fall apart again.  My only little gripe is that although I taste the meat, the texture of it reminds me of refried beans.  Still good, nonetheless, and I'll definitely be back.
