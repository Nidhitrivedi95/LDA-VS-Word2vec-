Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w My favorite place to satisfy my craving for some authentic Tibetan and Nepalese food. Always loved their food-momos, chowmein, thukpa,laphing, thali and list goes on and on. I have tried different dishes and NO REGRETS! One tip- make sure you check their special menu on the board!
