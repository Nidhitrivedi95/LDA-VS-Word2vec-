jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw This is my first time here and I love it. 
Pros:
-the decor is really nice and well thought out
-the staff is nice (Jamie at the front counter was helpful and polite)
-the food is fresh and delicious 
-lots of menu options (my husband and I are vegan and they had lots to choose from)
-they bring your food to you 
-good music 


I was going to take away a star because the price is a little high for a self serve place, but after tasting the food, I understand why. I got the veggie burger and onion rings, the veggie burger seemed like it was house made fresh and very tasty. They even brought out ketchup and ranch for my onion rings without me having to ask. The onion rings did not taste frozen. My husband got a falafel wrap and we both loved it. We also got the baklava but were to full to eat it. But it looks good! :P Overall this place is solid and I would recommend it to anyone.
