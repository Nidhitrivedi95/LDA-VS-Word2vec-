yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug We went for dinner here. Restaurant looked good with 5-6 tables occupied. I was craving for dosa and looking at pictures, we decided to go here.
1st disappointment- I ordered for dosa. After 5 minutes, I was told sorry no dosas available and the reason being chef has to switch from making rice/sabjis (curries) to make dosa, which is not possible!!! Then why is that on the menu??? 
2nd disappointment - after waiting for close to half n hour, there was no sign of food coming. When we asked about it, they said it's almost done. They served half of the order in next 10 mins and rest half was not coming. Next excuse they made is chef is new, so it's taking time. That too when not even half of the restaurant was full!!! By then i was fed up with their excuses.
Finally after 40 mins of wait my plate came. 
3rd disappointment - The food. My veg thali didn't have daal (the reason why i choose north Indian thali over south Indian). Palak paneer and naan were good.
Chole and matar paneer were not nice. So as gobi manchurian. They did offer 10% discount on our bill for the late serve. But we wanted good food and service, both were missing. Who wants to waste time on a vegas trip and get a bad experience!!
