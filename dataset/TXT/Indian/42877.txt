RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Again, I and so many folks I know agree that the Blue Taj is at the top of the list for authentic, delicious Indian dining. Very cute place and outdoor patio that is covered. I've only had one disappointment there, and it was recently. I had to use the lady's room for the first time there and found myself in an unkempt, dingy, dirty room that was gross to use. How easy and inexpensive it would be to upgrade the bathroom, make it cheerful, clean the stalls (and toilets!). I was not able to continue eating my dinner after using the room. Had it wrapped up for another day. Such a nice looking restaurant with excellent food and service, a dirty icky bathroom that doesn't even live up to some of the roadside rest stops can affect business. Some cheerful colors, décor & a cleaning person would do wonders to keep this place on top Maybe most men don't care about these things, but most women do.
