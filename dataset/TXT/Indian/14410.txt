C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA While on a trip to Toronto my group and I stumbled upon this restaurant totally by chance. We read the menu posted outside and thought it sounded interesting enough to try.

I would describe the menu as Mediterranean/Indian fusion. Naan was present in most of the lunch offerings, and when I went downstairs to use the restroom (or the "washroom" as they call it in Ontario) I saw all the staff were of Indian ethnicity. (btw - the washroom was spotless)

The atmosphere however was not Mediterranean/Indian, it reminded me of a little restaurant one might find in Germany, and it reminded one of the people in my group of a place you might find in Belgium.

The food was spectacular. I had the Hummus plate which came with carrots, apples, pieces of Naan, and olives. The Hummus was delicious and creamy, and dipping apples in it was something I would have never thought of doing on my own but I loved the way the flavors worked together.

Other people in my group had Nannettes, Scrolls, Quiche, and salad. It was all pleasant to look at, and everyone enjoyed their food very much.

The service here was excellent. We were a rather large group but they did everything in their power to seat us together. They placed us on the upper level in a booth in the back corner. It was very cozy.

Being tourists we had a lot of questions about the area and how mass transit worked. Our waitress was a fountain of information and even went a far as marking places on our map to go see...just so kind and so polite.

I highly recommend this restaurant. The food is tasty, and the service is the friendliest I have encountered in a large city.

Also - Not everyone in my group had Canadian money but they accepted US money no problem(of course the exchange rate was 1-1 at the time of my visit so that could have been why).
