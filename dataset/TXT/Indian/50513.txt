UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Very popular restaurant with a enclosed patio. Our table had a button to press to alert the servers but servers came by often enough refilling everyone's water so we never had to use it. Butter chicken was okay, a bit dry, and wasn't as spicy as I was expecting it to be. Naan came with way too much butter and a bit on the expensive side as well.
