So the food is delicious, and the wait was not long. Host/ owner was very friendly and talked with me while I waited for my chicken curry. The chicken in my chicken curry was moist and spicy. Rice was cooked well. The bad aspect of my meal was how the ingredients were misrepresented.

I asked what dish didn't have dairy, and I was told to get the chicken curry. Definitely my fault for not double checking the ingredients, but I assumed the owner knew best. Absolutely amazing curry, but gave me the worst stomach pain after. I almost had to call in sick to work the next day. I do not think the owner had ill intent, but I think he just pulled a suggestion from the menu and claimed it was dairy free.

Previous reviews are correct: this food is great, and the spices are so delicious. But my goal is to find and review dairy free food, and I was misled to think this place had dairy free chicken curry. I will return, but next time I WILL be skeptical and not take any suggestions (and probably read every ingredient on the menu)
