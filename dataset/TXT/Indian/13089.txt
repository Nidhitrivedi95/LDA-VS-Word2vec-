b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q I like east Indian buffets and this was was one of those that i like, hence the three stars.It is hard to find a 5 star indian buffet.This buffet had your typical indian selections tandoori chicken ,lentils,curry chicken,mixed veggies that were real good and some ground lamb burger that was just ok. for desert i ate those cheese balls that most indian buffets have. I do not know why they call them that they are not cheesy at all,i call them monkey nuts. anyway this place is ok but not worth going out of the way for.
