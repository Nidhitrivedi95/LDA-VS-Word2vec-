C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA When my family and I had lunch here the other day, the food was COMPLETELY INEDIBLE. 

-I ordered a 'smoked salmon quiche' (there is a choice between smoked salmon or spinach) and I received a soggy, microwaved spinach quiche with a piece of smoked salmon sitting on top of it. (They could have just told me that they didn't actually have smoked salmon quiche!!)
-Salads were gritty and tasted of earth and the tomatoes in the salad tasted like they were rotting. 

The horrific quality of the food here is just mind-boggling! I cannot even understand how they are in business. I am so fed up with garbage places like this in Toronto, making money off of food that a dog would probably not eat. I cannot wait for this place to be replaced by a restaurant owned by someone who cares, even a bit.
