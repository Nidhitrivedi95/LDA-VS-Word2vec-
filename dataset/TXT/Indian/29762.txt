jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Two days in a row I have tried ordering from Lazeez around 3 pm. Yesterday I called about 5 times in a 20 minute span and no one answered the phone in that time period. Today someone actually answered right away, but asked me to hold for one moment and I said sure. I've been on hold for 14 minutes as of writing this Yelp review.

Food is pretty good but the portions are getting smaller since I started eating here, and if you can't even place a timely order (I often order/pick up on my way into work, which is near Lazeez), then what's the point?

Update: Service has gotten better since writing the original review
