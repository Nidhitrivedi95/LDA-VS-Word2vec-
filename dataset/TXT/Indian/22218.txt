GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw We ordered samosas for appetizer and they were drenched in oil. The butter chicken and garlic naan were ordinary. The naan was hard. The butter chicken had no taste. The rice was dry and the daal was not tasty. The only good part was the pista kulfi which was sold as pista but was actually a kesar kulfi. We do not recommend this place unless there is no other option.
