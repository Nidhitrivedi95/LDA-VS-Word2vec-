yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg My favorite indian restaurant in the Phoenix area.  Staff are very friendly, give good recommendations.  Everything comes out fresh and hot.  They'll make your food as spicy as you can handle.  The meat samosas, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, shrimp korma, aloo gobhi, naan, and garlic naan were all delicious.  It does take a little time for food to come out but that's because everything is prepared upon order.  Have to say, didn't want to write this review in hopes the place wouldn't get busier but I have to give them their dues.
