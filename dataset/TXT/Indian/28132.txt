iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw One of the best Indian food joint that I have been to in Vegas. The spices were authentic Indian and the food was flavorful. I tried the tofu which was cooked with onions and bell pepper and it was one of best tofu dishes that I have ever had in my life. 

Special mention about the owner: surprisingly it is run by a white guy and he was very polite and generous. The service was also awesome.
