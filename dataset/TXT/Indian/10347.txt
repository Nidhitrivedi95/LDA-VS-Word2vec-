9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w I love this place. We've been going to Bombay Bhel for a few years now, and I love everything. The appetizers are amazing- the pani poori is sooo good! The paneer is excellent, I highly recommend the tikka paneer. I've been off meat lately and there are so many good vegetarian options. My husband always does the same thing- biriyani. It's pretty great. The service is excellent. We have eaten in the restaurant a few times and enjoy the staff, but the convenience of phone ordering for pickup really what keeps us coming back. The phone service is super convenient.
