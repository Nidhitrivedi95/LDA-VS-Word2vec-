o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Food was excellent and spiced as requested . I  do wish the vegetable pakoras were made from big enough pieces to recognize the veggies. As they were, they seemed to be all coating. Hats off to the gulab jamans. They were light and not overly sweet.
A  warning to anyone wanting a 5:30 pickup when ordering online.  That time is offered but when we arrived we were told they didn't open until 5:30 and the chef had just started the preparation. My guests were due at 6:00 and I  had wanted the food already there.
