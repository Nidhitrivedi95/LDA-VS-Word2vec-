jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Not bad for Indian food via delivery. Just a bit more bland than I typically look for in my Indian food. You can order spicier versions of most dishes, but that makes the food hotter, rather than more flavorful as one typically sees with Indian/Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine. Simple, straightforward, and serviceable. The naan here is, without a doubt, the best part of the meal. Have not tried Mediterranean leaning offerings and I have only ordered delivery, so experiences may vary.
