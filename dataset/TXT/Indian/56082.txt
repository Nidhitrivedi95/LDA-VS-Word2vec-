xhfGpXuXihc2y5xspUXFhg I've been here a couple of times. The first time I went to Drupati's I tried the curry goat, which was good. Second time was the Roti, decent size, not greasy and the hot sauce kicked my ass.

-sidenote- the doubles are kickass, brought me to "flavor town".

(Guy Fieri please don't sue me for using the flavor town quote)
