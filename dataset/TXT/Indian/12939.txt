b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw My fiance and I were excited to try Indian cuisine for the first time and namaste did not disappoint. We stopped in at 4 pm Saturday and we're promptly seated . The decor was nice with beautiful Indian artwork on display. Being our first time the server sat with us to help find an appetizer and 2 entrees that would satisfy are curious palettes. We settled on chicken 65 for the starter. It was small fried chicken pieces with great flavor and a mint chutney dipping sauce. The meat was juicy and the spices were unique and balanced. For the main course I chose the lamb chettinad with an 8 on the servers spicy scale. My fiance chose the lamb sukka spicy scale 0. Both of us were very satisfied and it's going to be hard waiting for our next visit.
