uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w When I heard that a new Indian restaurant was opening up right next to campus, I could hardly contain my joy. Campustown badly needed another budget Indian restaurant, and Ambar India fills the void perfectly. 

By no means am I an Indian food connoisseur, but the dishes that comes from both menu and buffet service taste phenomenal. I have been there several times, and I can't exactly recall the names of the things I ate, but trust me, they're great. And if one particular dish doesn't satisfy your palate, there are plenty more that will. The buffet changes daily, so there's no shortage of new flavors to try. Best of all, the lunch buffet is only $8, probably one of the cheapest and most fulfilling meals you can get for your money.

Vegetarian options are limited for the buffet, but as a meat-eater, it isn't much of a concern. If you're looking for something with more flavor and spice, try ordering a dish off the menu, but be aware that the portion sizes are a bit on the small side.
