Gtw-SpnhyNa0TwNETlysyw Stumbled on this place from the hotel next door, and we're glad we did.  Probably the best Naan I've had in a long time, and my Chicken Briyani was excellent - terrific intense flavors with quite a bit of heat.  We also had a very tasty Shrimp Marsala.  A plain but not unpleasant interior, and friendly and attentive wait staff.  Classic hole-in-the-wall strip mall place that managed to surprise with great food and service.
