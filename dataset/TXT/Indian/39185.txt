oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw Highly impressed. Great, family style lay-out, cool decor, great service and good menu. Half Greek, half Indian food, which is cool. I sat at the bar and had amazing service from the manager, who did everything in his power to appease my fussy appetite... and succeeded! I had the (modified) Apollo's Chicken (modified to my allergies), and it rocked... an awesome balanced, fresh, relatively healthy meal, perfectly cooked. Definitely recommended. I took off the star because the prices are slightly high considering the ingredients, BUT it is in a high rent area, so you can excuse that. Definitely going back. (I put NO next to the outdoor seating, but if you sit in the open window, you are basically outside...)
