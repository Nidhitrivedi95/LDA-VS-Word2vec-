UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I have been here twice, once for dinner and again for the lunch buffet.
Both times I was truly impressed!!

The food was AWESOME!! 
The atmosphere is sexy, and the service was friendly and o-point both times!

I was mentioning to a friend that I was yet to find an Indian food place that I loved, he suggested Mint. stating it was the best he had had since leaving "Little India" in London. OK, that is a TALL order, and Mint totally lived up to it! 

For dinner,there were 3 of us. We did the "vegetarian dinner for 2" and another entree.
It was the perfect amount of food for the 3 of us! And so good. A great selection of about 8 dishes, plus soup and dessert. 

For the buffet, there were a lot of selections, a bit towards the meat side, which is fine for me. 
If you are a vegetarian, you can definitely do it, but it is a smaller selection that your meat-eating friends will enjoy. I tried almost everything on the buffet, including goat! Everything was amazing!!

I can't wait to go back!
