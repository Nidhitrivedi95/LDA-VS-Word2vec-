K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I had the lunch buffet. Best sambar I've ever had anywhere, including India. The serve yourself masala tea is perfect. No sugar so you can sweeten to your own taste, and perfectly spiced with masala. I love that they don't sugar it because I have my own birch sugar, which has the consistency and taste of sugar but is not run through animal bone ash like regular sugar, so I can adhere to my vegetarian ethics.

The potato masala, which I smothered with the dal Tarka, was so good I had to test each individually to see which tasted better.  A dead tie--equally delicious.
The coconut chutney was subtle, & mixed with a little curd rice, I found it the perfect complement to the dosa. I went back to the buffet for a few extra mushroom 65 for an excuse to get some more chutney! I tried the curd rice & the chutney individually also, and while they were both excellent, it wasn't until their flavors mingled that an ecstatic explosion happened across my taste buds.

Living in Houston, with its plethora of excellent Indian vegetarian restaurants serving our large south Asian population, I am more than a little spoiled by the variety and have come to appreciate and recognize excellence when I taste it. If this restaurant were in Houston, the owners would become wealthy very quickly, while setting a new standard in a town already known and appreciated for its fantastic variety and quality of Indian fare.
