yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I've been to a few Indian restaurants here in the valley - namely Jewel of the Crown, Al Hamra, Tandoori Times, Bombay Spice Grill & Wine (not really Indian), Indian Paradise, and Kabab Palace - and Dhaba is definitely my favorite so far. I'm no stranger to the cuisine having travelled/lived in India & Bangladesh for a couple of years, and this place seems to have nailed the perfect balance of flavor, spice, variety, ambiance, price, and service. The hostess/server was warm and knowledgeable, the bussers were attentive (my water was always at least  full), and the food was delicious. A little Americanized, perhaps, but muted authenticity didn't affect the taste or my dining experience at all. I highly recommend getting the garlic naan and goat curry (ask for additional heat; it can be a little sweet otherwise). And good ol' chicken tikka masala for first-timers. Will be back for sure.
