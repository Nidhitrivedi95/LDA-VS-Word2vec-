pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA I had been to the Indian branch of this place, so I was very excited to try food here... placed order for veg Thali/meal and masala Dosa. This is what I thought:-
Quantity: 5/5
Quality: 4/5 ( it's pretty close to south Indian taste but not totally there yet, but if I crave for south Indian food, I will come back)
Ambience: 5/5
Service: 2/5 (the only thing they lack at for me is service, it's slow and the servers really didn't pay any attention to the our order, tried calling a server and reminding her of my order, but she didn't even listen, and when I tried pointing out this thing to their cashier, she was rude and made me feel that it was my fault, no apologies what so ever)

Overall, I feel it's pretty good, but would have been excellent with better service. Will definitely visit for the food
