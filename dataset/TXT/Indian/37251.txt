O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg I could say that this was the worst meal I have ever eaten at a Restuarant, definitely the worst indian food I have ever had. If there was an option for zero stars, I wouldn't even give it one. I came here for the lunch buffet, and was thoroughly scared for my health after eating a few bites. In fact, if I hadn't been in the company of two others, I may have gotten up and left after getting my plate of food.  

The food must have been sitting out for a long time because the raita was spoiled. It was sour and bubbly. The mint chutney was also bubbly and sour tasting as if it were fermenting. None of the food on the buffet was hot. It was barely luke-warm and the tandoori chicken was like a rock. I am appalled at the quality of the food here.  I LOVE indian food and was hoping to find a good place in this area, this is not it.  If you notice, all the photos on yelp are 3-4 years old. Must have been ok at one time, not anymore. There was NO ONE else here at 12:30pm - prime lunch time - and I can see why.
