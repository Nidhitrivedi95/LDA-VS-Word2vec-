2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA I would say this restaurant is the king of Roti in harbour front area.

The place is small and it can accommodate few people inside, so most of the orders are to take away. The average waiting time is about 20 to 30 min because they prepare the roti from scratch, they take only cash or debit but if you order online then you can pay by credit cards.

I ordered the first time the mix Vegetables Korma Roti with mild spices and it took me right away to spice heaven (which means it awakened all my senses), the next day I was curious about the other plates so I ordered the potato and spinach curry dish and it was delicious.

I would recommend trying the vegetable Korma Roti and next time I will visit Toronto I will probably pass by again to have something new.

One small negative thing about the place would be the prices, they are a bit expensive but it is in a prime location so I guess the rental is also expensive.
 
Other than that, my experience was great.
Cheers
