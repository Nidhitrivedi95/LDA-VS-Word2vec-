kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Ate here on a trip.  It was pretty much the only Indian place around, so we gave it a shot.

Decor/Ambiance= C.  It's clean, but pretty small and boring- "sterile" for lack of a better term.

Service=C+.  Pretty average server and timeliness.  

Food=C.  In total we ordered the chickpea ceviche, sauce taster, garlic naan, samosas, and most of the vegetarian entrees.  Everything was ok, nothing bad, but also nothing great.  I've had Indian food that was light, but still tasty.  This was light, but bland.

So, it's not bad at all, but it's also pretty ho-hum.
