PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA Ah, dosa.... how I love thee and let me count the ways.  I love it when you come out of the kitchen piping hot and appear thin and crispy.  Oh, and those chutneys that bring out all of your flavor... you know the ones... coconut and tomato? Scrumptuous! And, when the masala that fills your cripsy shell is superb (bonus points for the cashews), well... you had me at "Hello." Your crowning achievement: you were made in a Grade A (per the Health Dept.) establishment by people who are the real deal.  Too bad that I have to go to the Riviera Casino (aka the hotel the Strip wishes it forgot) to find you.  Otherwise, it would have been a love affair for the ages.
