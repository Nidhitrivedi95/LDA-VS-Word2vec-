7BIbvCkI7AXQMVC1-DHpCA The Good: 
Food was excellent and the service was quick (to fill my water as it was lunch buffet). This place would be packed if it were in Seattle where I'm from. As it was, I was one of two patrons. I enjoyed the minced lamb in spices; it was quite good! So was the Naan and other dishes. 

The Bad: 
I'm not sure what was going on, but the service was not very friendly. I engaged the waiter a couple times indicating that I liked the food but he didn't seem to care about my opinion. Can't decide if it was language barrier or what. 

The Ugly: 
The bathroom. It didn't seem diseased, but the tile was worn, the walls were ugly, and the toilet seemed like it came from a manufactured home. The mirror looked like a half-assed attempt at upscaling it, but they blew it.
