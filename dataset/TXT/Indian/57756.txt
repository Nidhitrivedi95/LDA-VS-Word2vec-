yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw We usually eat Indian food at a buffet in Mesa, but an Indian friend took me to Dhaba and it was amazing. 

I took my family soon after and they were impressed too. The meat was more tender than what we usually get at our favorite buffet. (Not saying our favorite place is not great.  It's the best buffet I have ever been to and I usually hate buffets.)

The naan was very good, but kind of expensive for such a small amount.  

Almost every dish was absolutely wonderful.  We ordered lamb vindaloo, lamb curry and chicken curry. 

I also ordered something that was supposed to have cubed potatoes and spinach.  It was tasty, but there were hardly any potatoes and it was really just spinach. 

Being that I am not Indian and am still learning about the foods I like, I would find it helpful to have images (I realize that sounds silly) or better descriptions.  No one in my party wanted to touch the spinach plate because it looked weird, but I thought it was delicious--just did not want to eat the whole thing.

Being that I do not know what to order, I will probably stick with our usual buffet because I can tell by looking at the dish if I will like it.  The waitress was not great at understanding my questions about menu items.  

Still, the food was good, and I will probably visit with my Indian friend again because the stuff she ordered was great.
