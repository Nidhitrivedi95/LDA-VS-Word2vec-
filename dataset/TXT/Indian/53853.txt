VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ The lunch buffet is a little over priced for me... Both times I went the food items I wanted were either gone or nearly so and not replaced while I was there. As for the food there is much better fare to be had even buffet (and I hear the by the order rather than the buffet is better). Overall a slight disappointment.
