De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA Love that their food is spicy and the selection is vast. Don't like that sometimes it's a bit too spicy and I can handle my spice! Also there is often way too much gravy in the curry dishes with 1 or 2 pieces of meat. That's not acceptable. Their food is great though and because of how close they are to my home, I will go back to get my East Indian food fix.
