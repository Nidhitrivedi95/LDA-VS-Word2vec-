XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw HUGE rotis with yummy, perfectly fresh and chewy dough with spicy (we opted for medium-hot) stuffing and very generous portions! i preferred our vegetarian option over the meat since you can't really tell the difference d/t the yummy sauce and the cauliflower and potatoes were cooked perfectly. forrest y ordered the lamb roti and was pleased by the tenderness and generous serving of lamb. they also offer my favorite, dosas (thin crepe-like dishes with a potato stuffing), but unfortunately ran out of the garbanzo bean soup that goes with it.  

service was friendly and helpful, spot was clean with bathrooms available, prices are decent but portions are so big that if you're from out of town like us, it's probably best to share a roti plus an appetizer or lassi so you don't end up sleepy-full!
