2nsMgH0zh8hK4Bu55fYxlA Well, surprising food in a surprising place. Since we've been here, we've been looking for a new favorite Chinese place that compared to where we are from. We've eaten at nearly all of the Chinese places in Gastonia searching for a spot we could frequent without having to wonder if we tried anything new, would it actually be good. 

Our previous Chinese place in Virginia had some out-of-this-world General Tso's chicken and so far nothing has even come close to what we would like. This place....it's oh so very close it's scary. Certainly far surpassing any other General Tso's chicken in Gastonia. 

We plan to try more things from the menu , so far we loved both dishes we ordered. We equally shared our plates with each other because they were both great.  

Atmosphere was ok. The staff was great. Super polite...and most of all, genuine. 

We got some to-go menus on our way out the door, will be perfect for Sunday football order out dinners
