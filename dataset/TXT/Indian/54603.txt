WHoPIk2kgQvqYYNpXSrURg This is a restaurant but I opted for a take away. This was the first time I tried this place and was a bit apprehensive but while I was in ordering the phone was going so often for deliveries that the man serving me barely got a chance to take my order which I took as a good sign.


 I thought the portions were a sensible size and I think I can be quite specific with how I want my curries, and I'm pleased to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this one. We also ordered a naan bread which was massive and they threw in a free side order which was interesting because it was a dish I had never tasted.


 The price was good and if you take the set meal offers it is really worth your while.


 There are hundreds of take aways around this area of the city but I will definately return here.
