o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg I had high expectations since this is a chain and since I just moved from Jersey I thought may be this will be my go to spot. But i quickly doubted that decision after I tasted the Shahi Paneer we ordered, if I could describe how I felt when I took the first bite of it: it felt like i am eating gum mixed with heavy cream including chewy tiny peices of paneer!!! I mean Where in the world is this Shahi paneer from!! Another disappointing item we ate was the chicken 65, it was weird in its own way. The whole night I felt uncomfortable and coukd have puked any moment. 

Mr. New management at HBH, you need to taste the food you are serving, and review the rating
