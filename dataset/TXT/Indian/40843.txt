PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g Went to Kamasutra this week. Been a few months since I've been there but i have to say that the food was amazing. The food tasted great. The chicken Vindaloo was spicy but incredible. Kept wanting to eat more and more. Never tried chicken quite like that before. If you're ever craving spicy chicken give this a go with some Naan bread. Simply fabulous.

Butter chicken was great too!!! So much better than last time. When i last went in May, i remember the food being on a bit of the dry side, but everything was fantastic this time. I had an opportunity to meet Raj, the new owner of Kamasutra. She is a really sweet lady and it was very nice of her to say hello. Absolute pleasure.


Thanks Raj and Kamasutra Staff,
Lovely meal 

Will
