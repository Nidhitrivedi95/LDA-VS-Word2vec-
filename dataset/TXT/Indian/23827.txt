gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We used to come here a lot and always loved it, and we always had a restaurant.com certificate.  But that site isn't what it used to be, and since Mt. Everest is quite a distance from where we live, we hadn't been back in over a year.  But I missed the place, and felt bad that the owner had always been so nice and accommodating to us, and didn't think we were being upstanding citizens by not rewarding his hospitality.

Not only did he remember us, he even remembered the fact that I hate overly salty food!!

I ordered a glass of the house Woodbridge Riesling, and for $5 got something rare: a FULL glass.  We thought we'd order a mulligatawny soup to share, in addition to the Mt. Everest thali that we were also going to share, but the owner talked us out of it, saying I'd find it too salty.  Now that's service!  He suggested the Chau Chau soup instead, which has noodles, onion, cilantro, and tomato.  It had just the right amount of kick and was very tasty.  And not salty.  

Having the thali was definitely like coming home again.  A large appetizer platter of  goodies, including a delicious samosa, tandoori chicken, beef kebab, and lots of pakora filled me up before the piece de resistance, the large silver tray with my favorite - palak paneer - which had a goodly amount of the paneer, lentils, chicken tikka, lamb curry, raita, and the dessert, kheer.  We had asked for kulfi instead of the kheer, and for it to be served at the end of the meal, since it's frozen.  No problem - we got the kulfi, and were told to keep the kheer anyway.  Everything was excellent, except for the lamb, which was tough.  I could have said something, but who needed more food?  We took some leftovers home anyway.

We're not going wait another year before going back to Mt. Everest.  It's that good!
