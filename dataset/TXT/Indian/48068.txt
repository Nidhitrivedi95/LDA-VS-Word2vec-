TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This was my first time ever having Indian food. It was a great experience. I'll check into some other Indian places. Unfortunately I can't remember what my wife and had because it was yesterday. But mine was Goat with rice and she had chicken with rice. Only annoyance was the goat still had the bone in it. It warns you about it but it had smaller pieces which were hard to find. Still worth it and will be back if I'm ever near again.
