vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w You get what you pay for with this place... I stopped coming here for years after too many things where bothering me whenever I would go, like how dirty this place is, the big wash room has some really disgusting ceiling tiles, almost always out of toilet paper, doors & walls would need an intense wash up.
The young thugs that try to pass as servers would need a course in hospitality.
The owners are always friendly.
The food is OK but after having ventured out to so many other indian restaurants, I would rather pay twice the price for everything and be in a cleaner environment and have less of a fast food feeling while I'm eating, after the young waiters practically throw the thalis on our table...
At least the Indian music is always loud enough and the price is so cheap you wonder if this place is stuck in time, twenty years ago.
The Pushap on Des Sources has had many cleanliness problems from the health inspector, I'm hoping this brother is cleaner...but by the looks of it all, I doubt it very much.
Just don't bring your new hot date here, wait at least a month before inviting them here...
I give them 3 stars, one more than before.
It's like McDonald's for vegetarians!
