5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ We had a pretty cool meal here on a Friday night. We had a reservation, and when we arrived, the table was ready to go. The people who own this place are gracious and welcoming. The restaurant is clean and cozy. It got pretty busy on Friday night, so if you head out on a weekend evening, it would be wise to make reservations. 
I had a Taj Mahal Lager. It was really good. Never had Indian beer before, and I'm glad I tried it. The naan here is so good. You can get it several different ways. I like it with butter. Order the Chicken Tikki Masala. You won't be sorry. It is scrumptious. So cool to be able to get authentic Indian food in little old Chesterland! We will be back.
