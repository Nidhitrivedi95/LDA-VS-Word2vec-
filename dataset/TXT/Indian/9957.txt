9coZa838egYONxSdTe-wUg Oh my god. This food is so good. I loved the veggie korma with naan and rice. We also ordered the chicken taka masala, and a pork noodle bowl. Everything was very tasty. We sampled some other items too and there wasn't anything that was a disappointment. The food did take a long while to arrive, but with an appetizer of mo mo, samosas, and pleasant company and conversation the time passes quickly. Maybe order ahead if you're in a hurry. We got these weird honey balls for dessert that tasted like parmesan cheese. They were strange, but ok to try. The inside isn't crazy fancy, but it's comfortable and clean. The restrooms are clean as well.  Also reasonably priced. Water and pop in bottles. I suspect they didn't charge us for bottled water and we had like 6 of them.  Also, I think I saw on the website that you can bring your own (non alcoholic) drinks. May want to look into that.
