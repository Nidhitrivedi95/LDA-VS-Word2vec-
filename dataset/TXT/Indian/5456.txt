33yClygMVQZb5y9WgOCHLA I have no expectations when entering this place. I suggest ppl who expect the ambience - this is not your choice. We ordered some poori chole with halwa and my husband tried the goat karahi with rice.

To our amaze the poori chole was a hit. And the goat karahi is so so for the price. But the quantity is enough . Overall I would try occasionally .
