b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Wonderful flavors without too much heat. Tried the chicken Korma and the butter chicken. Both were outstanding!

Many vegan and dairy free choices.  Southern Indian udupom and idly. 

Great beer menu! Service is good.  Waitstaff is very knowledgable.

Wish we'd found this place sooner, but we're making up for lost time.
