Started with the pani puri which was decent but a bit pricey. $4.99 for 7 pieces. Also had the small chicken tikka which was obviously not cooked in a tandoor and seemed a bit under cooked.

The masala chai was just drip tea, which was really disappointing.

This is mostly a take out place but it's no reason to serve food for eat-in customers in paper plates and styrofoam boxes.  It had a cafeteria feel to it.
