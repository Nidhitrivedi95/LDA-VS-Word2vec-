M56l-0DuaNhJ-SCJ1UAkgQ We are visiting from Chicago and just picked this from GPS. But it was a nice surprise. Good food, great service especially from the manager himself who was serving and helping too. Very personable! One suggestion i would make to themselves is that through out the evening someone should check the buffet, like try the food to make sure nothing spoiled. The pani puris were stale. The chole and a mango cabbage salad was really good!
