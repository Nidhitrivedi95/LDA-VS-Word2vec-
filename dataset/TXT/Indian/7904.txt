Two of us were seated at 6:30p in a restaurant with only 3 other tables taken. Two had their orders on the table, one's was being taken. 

After we were seated, 4 other tables were seated, two were seemingly Indian families. Literally every other table that was seated after us was tended to (sometimes having to walk directly past our table to approach them). There were 4 servers working the room. 

Even after eye contact, we were ignored. We stood up and crossed the enormous restaurant to the door at 6:53p. No one approached us or tried to ask if there was an issue. 

I considered telling them we were there first and still hadn't even been spoken to by a server, but since we weren't feeling comfortable and certainly didn't want to pay $14 a meal for that kind of service, we left. 

Check out Karaikudi Palace farther east on Shea. They're quick, polite and delicious.
