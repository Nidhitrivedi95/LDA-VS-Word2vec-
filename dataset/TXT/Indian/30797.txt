KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ This is by far is my favorite Indian Cuisine!!!! I even got family and friends hooked on their delicious Chicken and Lamb Tikki Masala. My absolute favorite is The Palak/Aloo Paneer which is Spinach and Potato dish with Garlic Buttered Naan Bread!!! Nothing compares to this dish in my opinion. I never have had any complaints. The manager who's name is Hapi and staff always greet me with a warm welcome. They are clean and have earned an A in their kitchen! Its like coming home for some good old southern cooking from Granny's house accept this is my Indian family! Try it out, you won't regret it.
