8GtI_5mG3V1e9vDODgWC1A Usually limiting the notion of Indian breakfasts to the remnants of the previous nights takeaway, I was pleasantly surprised by Iman's exotic delights. Admittedly, I had a little trouble interpreting the owners Indian accent and took the safe bet of ordering the breakfast special: Ghana Puri & Halwa (see picture).  Arriving on a shiny metallic platter complete with a pot of Ghana (a kind of spicy chickpea dahl), Halwa (a bizarre sweet tasting puree, flavour unknown to me...) and some moreish Puri (a kind of lightly fried flour tortilla) it seemed I was in for a feast. Rich, spicy, and flavoursome I found this dish a great way to start the day and at £2.95 and it's cheap enough too.  In typical Brit fashion I was left with a chilli heat induced sweat on my brow and a yearning for a cold beer. Nonetheless, I'll be back for more.
