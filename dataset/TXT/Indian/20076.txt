FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Could be the best Indian lunch buffet I've been to anywhere - England and India included. Wonderful variety, excellent spicing (flavorful without being overpoweringly hot). I'm vegetarian, and most other Indian buffets don't have as many veggies and are long on starchy dishes. On my must-do list every time I visit Madison. Staff can have a somewhat indifferent attitude, but hey, it's a buffet. They keep everything well supplied and get me whatever I ask for. Don't need ego stroking, just good food. Sometimes parking close by can be difficult. You might have to walk half a block. No big deal.
