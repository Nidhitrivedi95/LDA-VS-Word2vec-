16xoDNtEWbth_s--xqZxrQ We went for the 1st time last week, the menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering dishes. We had the masala dosa, harriyali and sukka, they were all exquisite. All the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of homemade food. We had an pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavors. Will definitely be going back.
