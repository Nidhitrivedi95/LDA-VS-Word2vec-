The food was pretty good, even for a lunch buffet. There isn't a lot of variety, but sufficient enough food to feel full. There were vegetable pakoras, butter chicken, samosas, chana masala, aloo ghobi, papadum, naan, etc. It was a little bit of everything. For dessert, they have ice cream and galub jamun. The galub jamun was cold, which I thought was weird.

Good food, but nothing particularly special. I'll definitely be back, though.
