PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Service is mediocre.  Plates are not cleared promptly, and the wait for the bill was endless.  The glasses of water were warm.  As for the food -  well, it's a buffet, so what can you expect?  Some dishes were okay, the butter chicken was decent and the biryani rice. The meat in the goat curry was unchewable, and another goat curry - well, where's the meat?  All I could find was bones.  The goat soup was a hideous mess of a quarter inch of oil floating on top.  UGH.  I got naan straight fresh from the oven, just buttered and it did not get finished after the first bite.  It was flat, and tough.  As I said some dishes are okay, nothing to rave over, not spectacular in any way, just okay.  For 22.99 I certainly would not return.   The salad bar was a big disappointment.  Very mediocre, no seafood at all and for that money I'm not interested in filling up on lettuce, hard boiled eggs and potatoe salad!  If you want quality rather than quantity, this is not the choice for you.  By the way, the lineups for food were bad, people rudely pushed into line, an entire family in fact just because one son was in the line already.  To put the icing on the cake, there was a "spill"  on the floor that instead of cleaning it up, they threw a large towel over it.  I didn't think about it until we got outside later and realized someone had been sick out there all over the walkway... and the "spill" on the floor?
