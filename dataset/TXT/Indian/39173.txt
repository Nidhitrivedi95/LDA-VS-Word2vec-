oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw It's been a few years since I've been here and things have changed. First of all, they have a pretty grubby looking serving staff and the restaurant is old and dusty looking. The food was fine I guess, nothing special but the portions were big and the price is just about right. I sat at the bar and could see into the kitchen which was nasty looking and I watched a server wash her hands in the same sink that was being used to rinse lettuce, I found that gross. Honestly I probably won't be back, is a shame because I used to really like it there. Keep on keeping on
