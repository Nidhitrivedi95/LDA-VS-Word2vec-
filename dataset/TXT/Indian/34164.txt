md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA Dad, I'm sorry. You always taught me to try everything, never take more than you can eat comfortably and leave something for the next person.
I never got to everything because there was too many dishes to try and everything I had was incredible. So I just had to have more. Before I knew it, I was way over full and had trouble not going up again anyway. 
Forgive me, Dad, I'll try harder next time. But you'll have the close the place first. I've found my new dinner hangout.
