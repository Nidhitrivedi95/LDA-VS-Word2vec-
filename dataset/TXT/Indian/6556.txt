3wJ4kJsJhayyfJ30HsS04g I have a good Indian restaurant that I like, but it is a bit far away and not very convenient with the evening traffic. I found Matka without any previous information (they have been here for a couple of months) and decided to try them because they are in such a convenient location (for me).

I had a great buffet lunch.  Very nice naan, very nice papadums, very nice pakoras, stuff that will tell you how good a place is.  I will be back this week for dinner, for sure.
