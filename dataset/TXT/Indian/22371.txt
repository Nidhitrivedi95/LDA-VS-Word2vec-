gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA For a food court on the Vegas strip the food was really good. I had the chicken biryani which was really good and the price was no bad @ 10.95.

They also have several thalis which come with a nan, rice and 3 types of curry which was good. really enjoy eating some Indian food right on the strip.
