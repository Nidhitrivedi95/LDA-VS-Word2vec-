tVPF1qCLivoxX33pIV5IOQ Ordered cheese dosas, mussel fry and a fish dosa. Out of this world Fresh flavors from Kerala. I would definitely recommend this small homey restaurant.

The Chef introduced himself to all patrons and he happens to have years of experience with the Taj hotel in Mumbai, etc.

Now they are a start up so be prepared to wait. They need additional staff serving guests. But take-out seemed to move smoothly...
