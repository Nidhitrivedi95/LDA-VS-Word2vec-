0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I tried their food first time on my friends recommendation and I really got disappointed. The taste of their food is not too impressive. Their food is full of sodium and colour. The taste of their food is garbage compare to other good Hakka restaurants. I have been to better Hakka Chinese places like wok n roll on Erin mills and Millcreek. And their price is same as any other place. I would never go back there.
