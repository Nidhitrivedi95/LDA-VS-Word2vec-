zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q I have been to Khyber Halal a few times and have always enjoyed the food. The mantoo (sort of like spicy beef raviolis with yogurt sauce) is awesome. However, they say they close at 8:30, so we got there at 7:55 and they said all they're doing is takeout now. If you're not seating past 8, say you close at 8 and then we wouldn't have wasted our time going way out of the way to go there or we'd have planned to arrive earlier. Ended up going to Tahoora grill nearby which serves Afghani/Pakistani food and was pretty good.
