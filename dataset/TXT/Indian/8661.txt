7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA awesome ayce indian food, their butter chicken is probably the best I've ever had (and I try it everywhere, it's one of my favs) and their naan is amazing as well. 

all of their meats are tender (which is sometimes difficult to encounter for ayce places) but they do it! 

it's a little pricy though so make sure you can fill your tummy full of their delicious stuff to get your money's worth!
