The food was very good! Quite the selection and I loved the fact that they included what the traditional name of the items were AND the Americanized version for those that aren't familiar. The goat curry was very delicious but contained bones in 3/4 of my bites so that was a little discouraging. There wasn't a place in their buffet just for silverware and napkins and I was very lost on that aspect and had to ask, but I was quickly directed and helped. 

Everything tasted great! Will gladly return!
