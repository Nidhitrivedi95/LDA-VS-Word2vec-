grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg I'm not very good with spicy food, but Babu is so good that I don't even care. It is oilier than I would have liked, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

The prices here are pretty average (although some items are very cheap). The service is slightly lacking, but since it's a fast paced take out place, it doesn't matter too much. My only real complaint is that the naan takes too long to come out. My solution is that I just don't order it anymore, but if you're willing to wait, then it's pretty good.
