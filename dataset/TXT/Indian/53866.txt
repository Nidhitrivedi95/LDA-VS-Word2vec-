VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ After reading all the positive reviews I decided to try out the buffet on Sunday afternoon.  My husband and I loved everything! The quality was spectacular and everything was super fresh.  The buffet offers  deliciously seasoned basmati rice (my favorite in Phoenix), chicken curry, chicken masala, pakora, palak paneer, goat curry, salad, fruit, tandoori chicken, chai tea, and regular or garlic naan.  There were a few other items, but I don't remember what they were called.  We ordered the garlic naan and it was to die for. It was perfectly grilled and had just the right amount of garlic brushed on it.  For only $8.99 it was one hell of a bargain. The atmosphere is also very nice with beautiful paintings and decorative fixtures. They also play soothing music.  We knew the place was going to be good when half of the patrons were Inidan. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone on the east valley. We will definitely return on the weekends for the buffet!
