VEfzBuWTF8wa6jQub5ArMw Ordered from here twice now, both times delivery.  Food was delivered hot and both times flavours were magnificent. There are many Indian places in the neighbourhood and I have finally found my go-to. Saag paneer was hearty, big chunks of paneer, and not at all soupy. Naan was a bit too doughy but lacha paratha was beautifully flakey and delicious. Chicken tandoori was the furthest thing from dry, so big win!  

Four solid stars only because I have yet to taste other dishes and have only gotten take out. So far, great representation, and can't wait to try more of what they offer.
