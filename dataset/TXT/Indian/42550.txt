R7SEUVtQN_ZYS_ATRb_K8w Ordered a mountain of vegetarian dishes from India's Oven last night for myself and my sick man. Nothing says 'stay in and get better on a rainy day' like delivery Indian cuisine. Food came within 30 minutes after ordering through Foodora, it was hot and high quality, and heroic in the wind and Spring rain. Next time I'd make a note that they can trust us with a higher spice level than they sent out to our delivery order yesterday, but I get why they'd aim pretty mellow on a delivery order. Still, even without the kick of spice, they flavours were rich and complex and delicious, and on an all veggie order the flavours were distinct and the veggies weren't all mush and over cooked. Tasty sauces, big servings, clean tastes. We felt healthier after which was the hope, so I am super happy and will definitely order from India's Oven again.
