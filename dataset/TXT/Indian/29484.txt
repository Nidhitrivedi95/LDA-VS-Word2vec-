Jr2qi4Nq3xrfNTa_jTVtYg Went here with a friend, we ordered aloo palak, mataar paneer, pilaw rice, as well as some samosas and naan. Cost $40 dollars before tip.

Samosas and rice was good, the rest was a bit of a let-down. I've had much better Indian food, and I was expecting more because of the price and the atmosphere.

The atmosphere of the place is great, and I liked the older Indian man who served us (I get the sense that he owns the place).

I won't come back here because the food simply wasn't worth the price. I'll go to Banjara instead, near Christie pits.
