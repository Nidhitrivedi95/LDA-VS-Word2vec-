JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw We're in town at Great Wolf Lodge and wanted something quick, but not fast food. This restaurant came up on Yelp and is walking distance from the resort. We order tika masala and butter chicken. Both were delicious and packed with flavor. My kids who are rather picky eaters tried both and were very surprised at how much they liked the flavors. Both cleaned their plates and wanted more so that's repeat worthy in my book. The portions are not huge but that's great when you're trying to work on portion control. We will definitely eat here again.

Our only complaint is that Yelp said they delivered and when we called we were told they do not deliver. Since they were walking distance it was not a big deal.
