-MpXo24qYu4DazQXDrs2oA I have been to this place more 10 times now. Apart from my first visit, things have drastically changed down south for this place. Today we tried the Thali which they now call as Platter. Two cabbage based subzi  really! For all the talk by waitress we thought they really made great changes but were completely disappointed. Although they say unlimited items by time they bring things you need more your appetite for it is gone. One Idly and Dosa, again really one Idly and that too no chutney and no curd/yogurt when asked was given in small bowl which was was 1/4 filled. Last weekend ordered to -go Vada and Idly so five each Idly and vada with one small bowl of sambar and no chutney. After I came home called to ask why and was told that India House does not expect it's customers to eat vada with either chutney or Sambar  really!!  Overall we decided that this will be our final time to go here. I am sure they will not be able to last long.
