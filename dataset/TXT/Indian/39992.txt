pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Taj Mahal provided incredible food at our wedding this August. I was planning a wedding remotely from San Francisco, and heard only good things about Taj. Usha was so kind during both our food tastings--she had us taste the food to our heart's content and was really committed to making our event special. She delivered a customized menu--for example I really wanted coconut water at the wedding, and she made it happen and even put little custom stickers on the coconuts. Usha also served mango lassi and kulfi at our outdoor wedding so the guests could keep cool. She made a pasta dish for the few people who don't eat Indian food, and also served cupcakes in addition to Indian sweets.

We were at a venue that had a tandoor, so all the food was made on-site and was very fresh. If you get a chance, try the tandoori shrimp, mini-lamb chop, and pani poori. My favorite part of the wedding were the various stations during cocktail hour. Taj provided a chaat station, dosa station, kabab station, and pain-puri station. Usher's staff were  professional and friendly, and the food was presented very nicely.

After the wedding, we did find out from the wedding planner that the cocktail hour food was delayed, but neither us nor our families noticed since we were enjoying our coconuts! The only logistical negative was that we didn't have an official contract and everything was done via email. So, it was a little difficult to communicate all the menu details/allergies/ingredient list etc. via email.

Overall we want to give a huge thanks to Usha and team for our beautiful wedding. Many guests told us this was the best food they've ever had at a wedding, and I have to agree!
