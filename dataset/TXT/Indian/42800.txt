RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I was overall really impressed with the Blue Taj.  My boyfriend took me here on a date a while back and it was absolutely fantastic.  The atmosphere was very upscale but still cozy, the food was delicious, but what really made it for us was the service.  We made a reservation which I would recommend, and the service was amazing from the moment we walked in until we left. 

I wish we could remember our server's name but it was forever ago.  He was so helpful (which is why I would definitely recommend this place to anyone unfamiliar with Indian cuisine but curious) and even suggested a dish that wasn't listed on the menu.  It was quite possibly the most delicious entree I've ever had.  Ever.

The Blue Taj is definitely an excellent date spot, however they did have accommodations for large parties.  I would recommend this restaurant for just about any occasion that calls for awesome cuisine and super friendly service.
