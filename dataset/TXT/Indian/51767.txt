UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA My friends and I were looking for a place to have dinner on Saturday night in Las Vegas. One of the girls looked up this place on her iphone and we decided to give it a try after we saw the raving reviews on Yelp. 

Food: I ordered a chicken saag paneer (aka chicken with spinach) and it came with an order of rice. I also ordered some garlic naan (Indian bread). The total for both including a 22% tip was $20 bucks. I had water with my meal. Food was great and the ingredients tasted fresh. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had since I've had comparable and better in the Bay Area (California) excluding price or portion. 3.5-4 stars for the food.

Service: Service could be improved. We asked if we could get out of the restaurant within an hour when we ordered. Waiter was eager and enthusiastic about getting us out on time to our 10pm show. 1 hour later (9pm), food barely started arriving. We ate quickly and was able to get out around 9:30pm. Considering that there weren't mainly people besides us (granted there was 1 large party and a couple small tables), they could have and should have been much faster at getting our orders out. Slow and not that responsive. 2 stars.

Location: It's off strip and cost our party about $10 dollars from the Flamingo to the restaurant. Considering the cost of strip food, the taxi ride breaks it even. Keep in mind that you must call for a cab or else it's rather difficult to catch a cab back onto the strip. Try to get the cab company # beforehand and call 15 minutes before you plan to leave the restaurant so that one will show up 15 minutes later (maybe make that 20 minutes considering ours was "late"-- even though we called 30 minutes in advance. 10 minutes passed its prime, we decided to flag another cab.

Ambiance: Average. Nothing out of the ordinary. A bit dark in some areas as well, but without justification for mood.

Payment: Takes credit card.
