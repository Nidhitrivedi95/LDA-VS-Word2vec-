-pfJvZEt9uaOV5AEWHVNCA This restaurant does not even deserve one star. I was craving real somosas and instead I got 3 undercooked, tasteless triangle looking god knows what. Who even serves samosas with salad?! Whatever happened to eating samosas with chutni. I was not impressed with the meals either. This was probably the worst decision I made during my visit to Scotland.
