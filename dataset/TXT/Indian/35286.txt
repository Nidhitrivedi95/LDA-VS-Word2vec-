mU4mvQSf81nLuxW1IC_mAA I would give this restaurant a 5star for there food but a 2 star for the portion of food you get for the price.i paid 68$ tonight and I barely got anything.there was no chicken or beef in the food.so disappointing. I order from here all the time and every time I tell them that I want more meat and they always say ok but they never listen.im fed up!!!! I'm not asking for more then I pay for !! I feel like I got ripped off. I called back and complained but I don't feel satisfied with the response I got. they just said next time they will give me more which I don't believe because every time I ask for more and get less it seems like.like I said good food but price is high for barely getting no food.its a shame.i will not be ordering from here again.
