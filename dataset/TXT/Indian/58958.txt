YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A In one word, the food was completely: 'shit'. It tasted horrible. I'm an Indian vacationing in Toronto, so I am very much aware of the authentic Indian taste, having lived in north India for 18 years. The naan I ordered was literally rubber! Couldn't even chew. Butter chicken was only spice, even though I'd asked for a 'little spicy'. On a side note, I love spicy food. The taste was just absent and it was only spice. Next up, Dal Makhni or black lentil had no flavor again. It tasted like colored water. And Paneer Makhni, even though there was a little flavor, wasn't good. The paneer, was rubber. Couldn't even cut. 

I had high hopes from this place--my hotels concierge really recommended it. Furthermore, when I placed an order for pickup at 8:40, I was told that the order would be ready in 10 minutes. I got my order at 9:05, 25 minutes later.

Service sucks, food is even worse, and you're in for a spoilt evening if you choose.

I wish the best for your choice!
