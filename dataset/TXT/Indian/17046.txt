DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I fell in love with Indian food when I visited London and decided to try a local place. Curry Leaf wasn't far from where I live and it was new so we went for it. 

Our waiter was informative and attentive - really good customer service. As well, it's super clean and the seating is comfortable. We ordered the Murgh Makhani and Meen Moilee. Others in our group had the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chili Chicken. We also ordered sweet naan and garlic naan for the table. Everything was really great and flavorful. The waiter's suggestions on how spicy we should order were on point. The only reason this place isn't 5 stars is because the Chicken Tikka Masala tasted very different from what we had tried in London and we didn't like it as much. I would definitely still come back though!
