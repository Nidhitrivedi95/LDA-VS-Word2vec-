oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q It's not the best but it gets the job done! I have been to the place for lunch quite a few times. 

The food is quite average but the pricing does the trick here. The food is quite cheap during lunch time and the portions are nice size. In the lunch special you get a soup, spring roll and a meat dish with rice, which is quite good.

The service is quite fast and their plenty of seating available.

For my fellow Muslims - This place serves halal meat.
