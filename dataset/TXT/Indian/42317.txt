qmcIsZjLpxd0V4RekSozmA For a fairly impromptu mid-price meal in honour of my friend's new flat and job, Tanjore did the trick nicely. The clean and compact interior feels welcoming enough and fuses East and West nicely with elephant embroidery on the ceiling around a classic chandelier.

We both boggled at the sheer range on offer within the menu's numerous pages - which include an entire page devoted solely to vegetarian starters - before eventually selecting our meals. She plumped for Chennai fish curry with mint rice, and I decided on Chicken Tanjore with lemon rice.

We were both happy with the delicate balance of flavours in our curries, and my friend's mint rice was pretty special too. The sweetness of the parotta was also a great accompaniment to the spicy flavours of the other food.

The service, though, was a little laboured and perfunctory from most quarters (we had three different waiters over the course of the evening; a special mention goes out to the young chap who served us last, though, with a smile that lit the room). I was waiting for my friend to arrive for a good ten minutes and was not asked if I wanted a drink. Similarly, nobody checked on us during our meal to see if everything was ok.

Our bill came to just under £35, which is really rather good for what we got, but I can't help feeling that the experience would have left a warmer glow in my memory if the staff had been a little more attentive and personable. I wouldn't object to another trip here but it's not somewhere I'd specifically recommend.
