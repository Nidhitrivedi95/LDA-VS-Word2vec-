Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ This is a tiny restaurant in Yorkville (surprisingly one of the more affordable options and probably the least pretentious).  It's a bit hidden as you need to go down a few steps.  It's clean and decorated simply - it gives it that humble appearance.  

I came on a weekday for lunch and it was about half full.  I ordered the Goan fish (I believe this is a lunch special only) which came with a salad and rice.  

It was flavourful and delicious - chunks of fish in that aromatic curry sauce make you want to go yum!  It's not spicy (not all indian food is!) but the spices melded nicely together.   I'd definitely come back if I was in the area and try a few of their other dishes.
