kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g If you're looking for "really" good , not greasy Indian food , this is the place for you. I highly recommend Bombay for people who haven't had Indian food and want to give it a try. The food is well priced and as fresh and flavorful as you can get . If they had a Bombay Spice in Old Town, I would eat here every day for lunch.
