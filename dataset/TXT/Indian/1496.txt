-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA I really like this restaurant. The owner is a nice guy and walks around to his customers whenever he is around. The food is great and they do try really hard not be just another Indian buffet.

The problem really is customer service. They have a new guy on the floor and I went at 2:20 PM yesterday.  He told me point blank that the buffet will be closed at 2:40 PM and I have to eat in 20 mins. No restaurant will ask you to "eat" in 20 mins. They will just ask you to make sure you take all that you need from the buffet in 20 mins and finish within a reasonable time. where do they get these "bozos" from? My wife just reminded me that he mentioned we have to pick up everything we need in "5 mins". Are we near Armageddon?

First of all, the advertisement says buffet is open till 3 PM. He was damn rude and reminded me of my hostel warden in India. I am a regular customer and go there at least once a week, sometimes with customers. 


It is ironical that they got a new guy to fix the problem and he is only making things worse.
