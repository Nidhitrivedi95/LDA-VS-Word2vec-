F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w Visited Pittsburg and found it to be a very nice place ! this restaurant has decent interiors. The food however, had no taste or life in it. We ordered paneer jalfrazi and navratan and bread, the items came with zeera rice. None of the items impressed us. By far, I have to place this restaurant at the bottom of all the Indian restaurants I have visited (visited only this in pittsburg). I have had a good service experience though, but it's simply time to hire a new chef. Also forgot to mention the discomfort next morning.
