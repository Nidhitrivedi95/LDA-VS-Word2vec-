C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA The concept of pizza with Naan as the crust is mind blowing in my opinion.  I'm obsessed with Naan, so when I heard that Kalendar served Naan pizza, I was all over that like a stripper on a pole.

I only took a quick look inside, but it definitely had that cafe like feel, with dark woods.  Joe and I grabbed a seat on the patio, which was fairly large, and had the added bonus of bench seating around the perimeter.

Joe and I decided it was too hot to indulge in some adult beverages, so we opted for the limonata instead.  It was nice, but a little too bubbly for me.  

For my entree I decided on a Naan pizza with goat cheese, chicken, pesto, and I think artichokes, but I can't remember 100%.  It was good, but I wasn't blown away by it.  Granted the flavors were nice, but the Naan was a little flat.  I've definitely had better Naan in other places.

While I probably wouldn't come back here on my next visit to Toronto, if I lived in Toronto, I would come back here to try some of the different options they have.
