-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ I had initially went to Cafe De Khan when it first opened in Heartland. My impression were that food was always good but the quantity was too low for the price when compared to other similar restaurant. This gets very expensive when you are with a family.

Shout out to Coco C. for her review. I read that review and I found out about their weekday lunch specials, which seemed to be bang for the buck. Hence, I book marked the place for a day off during the week.

Walked in to the restaurant and the only server was very friendly. We were given menus but no lunch special menu, so I asked and the server stated they are not serving the lunch special as it was the second day of Eid. This didn't make sense as the restaurant was empty and it was a working day, plus other people working nearby came for lunch and asked the same thing. Any how we looked at the menu and the prices didn't make sense so we left. The server came running outside to get us as she stated they are now serving the lunch special as she asked the folks in the kitchen because all the customers are asking about it. 

We love the options in the Thali  and ordered one with Chicken and other with Beef kababs. The Thali included 2 kababs, butter chicken, channa masala, rice, naan, rita, and salad. Price was very doable on the Thali and made sense. The Portions were satisfying and there is no competition with their Kababs. Foodwise I would give them 4.5 stars.

Overall, Food was great & pricing is reasonable on the Thali.

P.S. They server halal food!
