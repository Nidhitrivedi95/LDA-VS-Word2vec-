a3ENXfC1ska3HmRHb5Ew9w Great price for the amount of food!  Bummer was no naan, halwah, or mutter paneer.  But, it made me eat out of my norm and was great!  Spicier than I'm used to but enjoyed it!  Samosas were great and had okra in them which was a nice change.  Veg biryani was delicious also!  My dad had chicken and said it was exceptional.  All fresh, non-gmo and gluten free.  Loved!  Will go again!
