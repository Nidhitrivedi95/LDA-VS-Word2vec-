-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw Only for the restaurant part, the grocery area seem to be well stocked - so probably the one star goes to that; and the restaurant gets a zero star... 

Wow, don't quite understand how folks rated this place any more than zero stars!

Just 4 tables along the freezer aisle is where you sit and eat; self-serve kind of place where the guy hands out your food in plastic plates, water in plastic cups; its right next to  restroom too. Now let's talk about the food -- a thali consists of couple of spoonfuls of 3 different cold vegetable (dal, aloo-gobi, something else) + little rice lets say 4/5 spoonfuls + achar +  a couple of rotis. Pretty much all are room temp or luke warm. Of this food, just the rotis are what's decent. no sweet, papad, or sambhar or anything else. To top it , it no cheap food - all its like $8 bucks! May be if this is served for under 4 bucks or given free (like at a temple or something) - may be OK at that point, even then I will probably avoid though.  

Don't just waste your money here. Even you're a strict vegetarian or whatever - look else where, or in the worst case pick some fruit from the grocery store and walk away.
