YNut5B1o3FDtcdzwf9F_bw The biriyani was not so good as we expected cos of the name biriyani point we were hoping for a awesome biriyani but that was a disappointment. The tandoori had a raw masala taste and smell. The channa batura was very thick and did not taste good. The best part of our dinner was the Kadai chicken it tasted so good and we loved it. The dessert double ka meetha was very good. The prices  and a little high for the quality of the food. Not worth the money we spend on dinner.
