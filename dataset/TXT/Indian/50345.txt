UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w Tasty, cheap, and quick, Little India serves up various dishes and snacks that will please fans of the spicy complex flavors of Indian cuisine. The main component of Little India is a store with various Indian goods and foods, with a refrigerated section selling freshly made sweets. The actual restaurant is in the back, and to order, get an order card from the cashier in the front and check off what you would like. You can pay for your selections with the cashier in the front after receiving your food. 

I browsed through the menu and decided on one of the specials- bhatura, pickled veggies, rice, and mattar paneer. It was a good portion of each component, with the slightly greasy bhatura flatbread, piquant crisp vegetables, white rice, and richly flavored mattar paneer. The only negative about the mattar paneer was that the peas were overcooked, and thus grey and a bit mushy. They don't hold back on the heat, and for those that like more mild food, you've been warned!

Service was pleasant from the front and the back. Prices are very reasonable. The special was $5.99 and I was full after only eating half my meal. I also grabbed a container of gulab jamun ($4.99) from the refrigerated dessert section which contained a lot of the sweet dumplings and was pretty good. 

Definitely a good option for tasty yet cheap Indian food!
