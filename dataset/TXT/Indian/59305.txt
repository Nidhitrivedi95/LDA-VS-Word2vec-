YywWkWX235ZurTWSLqNPog I came here for a visit today not knowing this location is also owned by the same owners of the Etobicoke location (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rajdhani-sweets-and-restaurant-etobicoke). 

While the variety in the meal offering is pretty much the same (all vegetarian), this location is much nicer than the other. Presentation is the focus here, the service was not as good, but I'm going to overlook it as it was Diwali and they were inundated with customers. 

They offer thalis here which are very delicious, though a little rich. The rice was flavoured with raisins and almonds, but I know they have plain rice as well. I had a delicious dish with sliced fresh ginger and mixed vegetables. Rajdhani is worth a visit for vegetarian lunch or an inexpensive, casual dinner. 

I look forward to a return visit here.
