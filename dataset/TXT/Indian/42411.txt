QT4Ub4DlaDX52vdnKutD0A Been a fan of copper kettle on Phoenix for long time, over 8 years. Was very disappointed when they closed down couple years back. Looks like they reopened here in Tempe. Food was really tasty and good. However, they didn't have beef pays and Nihari at the lunch buffet. Very disappointed about that, which are my fav dishes at copper kettle. Other than that, food, service and prices are good. Next time, I'll call first to see if they have beef on buffet, before visit.
