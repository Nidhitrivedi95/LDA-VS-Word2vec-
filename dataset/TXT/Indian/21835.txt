gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Next time I come here (and there will be a next time) I will have to try the Super Gyro.  I am on a no red meat kick, so I had the Chicken Gyro.  It was really good, with a whole lot of yogurt sauce.  A tip for anyone on a first date type situation here,  get something you eat with a fork because the Gyros are really messy.  All that yogurt sauce gets everywhere, face, hands, and drips off your chin.  Porn star face aside, I really enjoyed the Gyro.

The hummus is the bomb.  Actually, I don't know what is better, the hummus or the pita bread.  Both are the best I have had anywhere.  The pita bread is really pillowy and almost sweet.  The hummus had a nice spice to it.  Paired with the pita and it was out of this world.  

It's a small place, and easily missed, so keep an eye out.  You won't be disappointed.
