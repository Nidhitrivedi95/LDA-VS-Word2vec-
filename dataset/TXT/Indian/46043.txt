SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg Danielle and i got a light dinner here tonight and it was really good. Danielle had a Chicken Tikka Masala rice bowl w/ sauteed veggies and fresh veggies. i had a Chicken Tikka Masala Roti w/ rice. I wanted no other toppings but the woman preparing our food insisted on sending veggies and various chutneys home w/ us to try. I tried them all (she left out the cilantro and cucumber ones because i'm not a fan) and I tried them all and they were really good. i also had a samosa which was pretty good as well. they were nice enough to offer us coupons for our next visit and also let us know that they will soon have sugar free chai :)
