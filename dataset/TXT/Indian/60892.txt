zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA This is one of my my favorites if not my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's a bit pricy for me as a college student, but the atmosphere is very modern, it feels like a higher-end authentic restaurant in India, the food is delicious, and the staff is very friendly. You really get what you pay for, if not more.

I would recommend going in for lunch because dinner is more expensive, but the food is superb regardless. Their naan comes with almost every meal and, I'm not kidding, it's the best naan I have ever eaten in my life. The fluffiness and texture of the bread is always perfect and always contains the right balance of sweetness and saltiness. I would recommend ordering one of their dishes that come with rice, curry, naan, and freshly tossed salad; you can't go wrong with those. I have come to realize that after eating Indian food, I always feel tired and lethargic shortly afterwards, but never at Yuva. Their food often makes me feel light, healthy, and provides sufficient energy for me to tackle the rest of my day.

Aside from the food, their staff is very friendly and always welcome me with a warm smile. I tend to drink a lot of water, and not one time has my cup been empty due to constant refills. They ask if everything is okay periodically during your meal, to ensure that you are satisfied and have all your needs fulfilled. When you are done eating, they always hand you the check at the right time not making you feel rushed, and they always wish you well as you walk out the door. 

Overall, the dining experience at Yuva is remarkable and rises well above the average restaurant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a satisfying lunch!
