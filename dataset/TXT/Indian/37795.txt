ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Being an Indian, I can cook some good food myself. So, for me it is really difficult to find some good Indian restaurant, where they serve delicious Indian food. We went to Origin India for a brunch and liked the food very much. Potli Samosa & Tikki were prepared very close to their real taste. Indian Chai was awesome. Their service was very fast and the decor is good. However, it is a bit pricey.
