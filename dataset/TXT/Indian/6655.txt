49sbCG7F2jvqJsfG6-N8Rw This Indian restaurant is the tastiest place we have eaten lately. The wait staff is amazing. We had chicken Korma, chicken tikka masala, and the mixed grill. It came with rice and a wonderful garlic naan. We also had vegetable somosa and Gobi Manchurian, and for dessert we had rasmalai. The prices are not expensive, you get enough to eat, (and to take home!) and the food,as I said at the beginning, was the best tasting food I have had in a long time!! Definitely recommend this place!
