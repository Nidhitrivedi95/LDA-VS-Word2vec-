PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA My wife and I have been eating here on the weekends at the buffet for a couple of years. First heard about this place on Yelp. We love it. My wife loves to make her own stuffed Dosa from all the vegetarian dishes. The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite. They change the buffet for Mother's Day and Father's Day so we make sure to go on those days each year. We eat here at least twice a month. The owner is very friendly. Their Tandoori Chicken is excellent.
