They have a lunch buffet, but I opted for Chana Masala ( Chick Pea Curry )  instead for my lunch.  It was very good and a pretty large size portion.  I would recommend it.  I also ordered the Chili Naan ( they have many different kinds ) it's basically Naan covered in Sriracha or some other chili paste.  It was pretty hot so be warned if you order it.  It also had what I thought was kind of a charred back to it, but it went really well with the Chana Masala so I'll go with that it being intentional.

Try:
- Chana Masala
- Mali Kofta
