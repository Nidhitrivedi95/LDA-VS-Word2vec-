A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA Oh my Tasty!!  This was a great experience!  I haven't had Indian food in well over a year, and this introduction back to it was PERFECT.  Curry Garden is pretty inconspicuous from outside... and inside lol They have a drive through, which was a little curious, but now it makes perfect sense.  The inside was just a few small booths and a couple of tables, and a TV playing an Indian musical.  The gentleman that served us had an EPIC mustache; we were instantly facial-follicle-friends ;-)  I had the Paneer tika masala which was PERFECT, with a side of Garlic Naan.  My family (mother, Wife and son (4 months))got a few other dishes, all of which were incredibly tasty.  OH, I also had the Samosas, which were great as well; their sweet-hot sauce that came with them weas excellent.  I also need to mention how friendly our server was; he checked on us frequently to be sure everything was going well with our meal, kept out water glasses full and a carafe on the table, and gave us a HUGE container of rice to take home to eat with our leftovers.  I can't wait to eat here again! One more thing! I did see that they have a lunch buffet, and I know there is at least one negative review on here about it.  BUT having experienced their food, I would be VERY surprised if their lunch buffet was as bad as that reviewer made it out to be. 

Happy Eating!
