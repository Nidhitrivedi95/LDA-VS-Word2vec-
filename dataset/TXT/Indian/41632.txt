Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I wanted to post this review as quickly as possible because we really want this place to do well.  

My husband and I are huge fans of Hakka cuisine and have been known to drive out to restaurants in Scarborough just to get take-out.  Let me tell you, our wish came true having Everest so close to home!  It's a cute, little restaurant in Mimico on Lake Shore Blvd W (on the north side between Park Lawn and Royal York) and has enough street parking.

I followed all the good reviews on Yelp and decided to try it last night.  I called ahead to place my order and the guy on the other end was so friendly and accommodating - he even offered to make my chili chicken with white meat for just a couple dollars more.  I ended up ordering that, crispy chili beef and mixed Manchurian noodles.  

I got such a good vibe when I went to pick up the food; they had this really nice Indian music playing, it was so clean and it smelled really good - a combination of good food cooking and some other nice aroma.  They were the most gracious and endearing people - even the chef came out to thank me for my business and offered to even make something outside the menu for me next time.

Anyway, the food was second-to-none.  Good quality ingredients, fresh, large portions (not a lot fillers like onions and green peppers like most Hakka restaurants), not greasy at all and everything was spiced just right.  The chef obviously takes pride in his creations - it was even packed and bagged properly. I took some the next day for my colleague and he couldn't believe how delicious it was; he said he'll even make the trip in from mid-town.  We plan to take two other couples there for dinner next month. 

This place really is a gem and I strongly encourage others to come down to the lake because Everest and a lot of other good restaurants have started to open up.
