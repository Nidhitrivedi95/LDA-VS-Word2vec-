2RtOfUD8-jbdHiBr0CUckw Best Indian restaurant in the city...everything is great.  WIll  not however win any awards for it's decor! Moreover....they seem to have a permanent problem with their electric supply...everytime I have ever been there (I have been there a lot!) their lights are continually flickering...annoying and funny at the same time...food is fabulous.
