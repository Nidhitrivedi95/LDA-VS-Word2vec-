rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I came to Pukka with my boyfriend on a weeknight. We made reservations beforehand but it wasn't too busy so for those who decided to walk-in, there were seats available right away.
Service was excellent.

DRINKS:
* Estrella Damm Beer
* Pomegranate Palmer (iced tea, lemonade + pomegranate juice)

TAPAS set of 3 (4/5)
* Chicken tikka (herb-infused + tamarind chutney)
* Stuffed paneer (Indian style cheese, spinach & mushroom filling + mild cashew korma)
* Gunpowder king prawn (moong bean salad + pineapple chutney)

I loved all three choices as part of the tapas set. The chicken tikka was very tender and juicy. This was actually my first time trying a paneer, it tastes like fried tofu haha - It's really delicious! The king prawn was very fresh. What caught my attention more was the moong bean salad that was paired with it, loved it!

BEEF SHORT RIBS (4/5) + naan bread on the side 
(braised with black cumin, Kashmiri chilli, garlic + onion)
Mm! The short ribs were delicious! The meat was very tender and it soaked all the flavours in. Our server told us this dish comes with a lot of sauce, so we ordered naan bread to dip on the side. 

NAAN BREAD (2.5/5)
We ordered the garlic flavoured naan breads - as a personal preference, I like naan breads with a thicker crust. Their naan breads were a little too thin for my liking.

OKRA FRIES (3.5/5)
(comes with mustard raita)
I love okras so we chose this dish.  The okras were very crispy. It was shredded and deep fried with their house sauce. Very appetizing! 

MANGO PANNA COTTA (2/5)
It tasted like mango pudding with caramel sauce (with a few pieces of cookies on the top). Not that special.

MASALA CHAI (3/5)
(black tea brewed with cardamom, cinnamon, ginger + warm milk)
My boyfriend decided to order this as a "dessert drink" after seeing another group order a bunch of them. What a cute display! There's a very strong cinnamon taste to this drink. I'm okay with this drink, my boyfriend loved it though!
