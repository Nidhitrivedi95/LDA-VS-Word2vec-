-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw If you have ever been to India's Sweets and Spices in Southern California, then you will feel right at home here.

This is a terrific Indian Market that also includes fresh produce for sale. It is the one place in town where I know I can find real fresh Bitter Melon!

They also have a wonderful restaurant in the store where if you don't know what it is - you can simply point to what loks good to you. As far as raw goes - not much in that arena in Indian cooking, but if you are okay with traditional Indian Vegetarian fare - THIS is THE spot for it in Las Vegas.  They always offer free chai tea and the woman chef who runs the place could not have been nicer. What a great smile. And you know... that smile gets translated into the food.
