8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ This place is only a few blocks up from our office. We placed a carry-out order for 5 orders at 12:20pm & they advised it would be an hour. After 75 minutes we called to check the status and we hung up on when asking if the driver had left yet. We called back hoping it was just an accident and were also requesting a discount because it was very inconvenient and messing up our office schedule. We were once again hung up on. Now when we call from any phone (office or personal cell phones) its going directly to voice mail. Its now 2:15pm, nearly 2 hours later and still no idea where our food is and we're considering it a loss. Their food has been good in the past. But now, the Butter Chicken Factory is dead to us.
