S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA My wife and I stopped in after she discovered this place and saw that so many fellow Yelpers were impressed. I have to throw my lot in with everyone else. The food was wonderful. We ordered the shrimp korma and goat curry. Both were just perfect, the shrimp was succulent and the korma was thick and delicious. We ended with home made pistachio ice cream that was probably the best dessert I've ever tasted.

Staff was so friendly and super attentive; even gave us free sample of the mango lassi, which was just perfect.

If your in the mood for Indian food this is a must.
