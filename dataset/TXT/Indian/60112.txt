zKSKmkBxfrltJau_4s1ZHA Very nice food. I have tried Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Masakkali , Veg dum briyani and Chicken dum briyani. All the items are taste too good. The restaurant is very good for business and team meetups. The staffs are very polite and responsive.They are providing tea as a complementary.The wait time of the order is bit more but this can be avoided by making phone order earlier. so that the order will be ready by the time you reach. Definitely recommend this restaurant for who seeks good Indian food for business and team meetups.
