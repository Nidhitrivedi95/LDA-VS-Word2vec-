x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA Went here for lunch. 

They had a buffet which was priced at $6/person (don't know if it includes beverage because they never informed us). 

They didn't have many choices to choose from. Their food was REALLY spicy!! We were quite busy wiping our noses due to the spice level of the food. 

The food was fresh because they kept refilling the entree choices. 

They had no dessert which I think is necessary; not because we were still hungry but anything sweet would've helped our burning palate. 

I would go here again during their lunch buffet but not anytime soon.
