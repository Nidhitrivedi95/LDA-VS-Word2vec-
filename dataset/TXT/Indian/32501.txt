Cute name!  
Central Location, convenient to light rail! 

There's plenty to like, theoretically, but our experience  here was one and done. We arrived early evening, before a ballgame.  It seemed a little off peak, like maybe the B team was on duty. 

We ordered via the touch screen, and after a couple tries, generated a receipt.  Then waited a long while for "fast food", and it seemed longer because you dont get a human confirmation that it's even in progress.  Half the wait, I wondered if there was a problem - moreso because workers behind the counter looked as disoriented and idle as we were.  Eventually, they brought the food (or we retrieved it, i forget), but none of this inspired much confidence or good will.  

My curry was on the bland side. Not terrible, but this place is altogether too tentative.
