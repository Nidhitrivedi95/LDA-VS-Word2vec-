TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Came here with high expectations, but we were disappointed. They didn't have any of the south indian items on their menu (dosas). The biryanis were ok and were made out of a different type of rice (not basmati) so it wasn't what we expected. The curries were salty and were not big portions. Wouldn't recommend this place.
