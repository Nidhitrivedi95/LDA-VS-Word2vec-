-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg Would have rated below one if there were an option ! We made an online reservation and were refused to be seated once we were there. Upon arguing , manager told us to wait for half hour or else SORRY ! We left without dining. Although they have great food but horrible customer service ! If your system allows online booking then pay attention ; refusing to seat your clients with reservations is not professional ! Not coming back & not recommending to anyone!
