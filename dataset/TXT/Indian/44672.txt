S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Hosted my Daughters BabyShower here and it was a success. Was able to go one day in advance and decorate a good size room and the staff was very helpful. The next day, which was the BabyShower,  we arrived early and again the staff was very helpful and The buffet was amazing.  The Guests keep raving how good the food was.  The manager Crystal was outstanding, took care of us personally and making sure all of our needs were met! Amazing service by her!
