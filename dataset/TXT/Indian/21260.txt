GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I'm becoming a regular here. after hearing so any different people recommend this strip mall curry joint, I had to try it, just to stop the looks of surprise that I had not been. food was excellent. cute interior. professional staff. charging for naan makes me sad, but worth it. now I find myself considering this a default option when considering where to eat. highly recommend.
