RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg Given the growing popularity of Indian cuisine, I am surprised that the Bombay Grill conglomerate (Green Street location, First Street location, Bombay Bazaar) have such a monopoly on Indian food in this town.  The other student-accessible restaurants (Zyggyz's and Mirsung) are good options for a casual lunch, but this Bombay Grill is the only viable option for a "nice" dinner.

If you want to try Bombay Grill, lunch time is the best time.  They serve a fully-loaded buffet that features both a cold bar and hot bar.  Almost nobody touches the cold bar.  What's the deal, people?  The raita and chutneys are some of the best things here.  Along with several hot dishes (curries, stir-fry, tandoori chicken), they serve a soup, dessert(s), and cumin chips each day.  Most dishes are above average, but the curry sometimes tastes watered-down.  The price of the buffet kind of makes me balk ($13), so I usually fast for a day before gorging myself (sorry, that probably sounds unnecessarily gross).

I try to avoid this place at dinner.  The quality of food is certainly better than what is available on the lunch buffet, but I also have to break the bank to pay for it.  If you want to sample a broad range of food at dinner, I would suggest going with friends who will split dishes.  The best dinner deal is probably the biryani (Indian-style fried rice), which is served with raita.  It comes in a huge serving for a reasonable price ($12-$14).

I can't complain about the service.  The wait staff is always awesome at refilling drinks and clearing plates without interrupting your mealtime conversations.  I've also often come with large groups, and they've been perfectly hospitable when accommodating us.
