wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw The food here was really amazing and why I'm giving 5 stars. Best chicken tikka masala I've ever had and the garlic naan is to die for. They also have a mango ice cream that is really delicious. Malbec on their wine list was really good and the owner/host is a bit loud but we found him entertaining and part of the experience. Food portions were a little small. They really need to modernize the receipt. Hand written and hard to understand
