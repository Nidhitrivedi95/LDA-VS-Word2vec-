GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Never have I experienced Indian food before, for the first time today my daughter and I decided to experience it together for her birthday. I do have to say the overall experience was great we were greeted immediately with great customer service, they were readily available to explain all the meals being that this was our first time.My daughter had beef masala, and I had chicken masala, with a salad and rice and of course the garlic naan, the naan was amazing! I personally was not a fan of the chicken masala, however my daughter and I loved the beef masala. It is a bit on the pricey side a little bit more than I wanted to pay for lunch $63.00 including tip. I did not like the fact that everything was al la carte off their dinner menu, they do have a lunch menu however nothing look appealing otherwise the dinner menu has better options. Hence the three stars just for pricing.
