9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw I wish I could give half a star for this review. We ordered chilly chicken - that seemed like left over chicken from the linch buffet, Lamb kebab - not worth the price and in vegetarian - makai kofta and kadai paneer. They were small portions not even enough for one person. The taste was very average. Never going back there again. Really disappointed!
