_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg The food was good but the terrible way I was treated far overshadows this.
I purchased a Groupon for New India Bazaar. I paid $12 for a $24 Groupon as advertised in the headline but it comes as 2 Groupons at $6 for $12.  Unfortunately, it expired and I went to the business to redeem my Groupons at the original amount paid today. I had a horrible experience. At first I was told by the waitress it was expired and no good. I explained Groupon's policy and she claimed to not know what I was talking about. I asked to speak to the manager and I was told to go find him on the other side of the store where he was sitting with his feet propped up (he would not come to me). He said he did not think I could use them for the original price and he did not think his account was active. When I objected, he finally checked and reluctantly and let me use only one of them for the original $6. I was treated very poorly and everyone was quite rude. I have absolutely no desire to go back to the business to make another purchase in order to redeem the other $6 I have already paid!  I was not even asking to get the discount, just to get the money back I already spent!  Needless to say, I am not going back.
