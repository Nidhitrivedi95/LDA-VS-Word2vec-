IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Is it the most delicious Indian food ever?  To be perfect honest, I'd have to say it's OK.  It's a small restaurant in a somewhat old shopping plaza, and I agree with the other reviews that it's a little bit dingy.

The best thing about Indian Cuisine for me is what you get for the price.  At $15 for an entire AYCE/buffet dinner, I think it's very reasonable.  There isn't a huge variety at the buffet cart, but there are at least 12 different dishes or so which range from the ever-popular butter chicken, fried cauliflower, lamb curry, goat curry, and spinach paneer.  

The best dish is one which isn't in the line - it's unlimited, freshly baked naan brought to you from the kitchen.  Soft, warm, and with a lovely char marking/flavour, you can choose from regular or garlic naan.  I recommend the garlic naan.  

Considering that the price of one dish at dinner will cost you about $12 anyway (without naan, which is an additional $1.50 or so), the buffet dinner is a good deal.  Though I wish in general the chefs would be a bit more generous with spices, I think you get what you pay for and the deal here is very fair.
