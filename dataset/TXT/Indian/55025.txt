Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw We stop by here on a regular basis; not because they have the best indian cuisine in the valley, but because their service is considerably better than most other Indian food places that we have previously visited.

The lunch buffets, no matter which day we have gone, have always proven to have such a large variety. No surprises here. Just good Indian cuisine.

The prompt and attentive service is what really differentiates them from every other place we have visited. The wait staff never ceases to fill and refill our plates with a generous amount of naan bread. And the drinks are refilled promptly. Some could say that their continual visitation could be perceived as annoying and bothersome. But, in comparison to other places, there is a very distinct difference.

The food is decent, not stupendous, but good. The service is even better. And the prices are decent as well. They have to, since most of their weekday clientele are ASU students. They would not survive long if they priced themselves out of their primary market.
