1eomYFLhoxC-y2PGnnNtlg The food here is wonderful.  Very authentic Indian and Nepalese food.  They have a wide variety of items.  Their prices are extremely reasonable and portions are good (actually loaded with meat). I've been to their all-you-can-eat lunch buffet (cheap at $9.99 a person) and for dinner.  Both times I've been very pleased with the food and the service.  Loved their tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and curry goat!  The naan is great too!  The owner stopped by our table to make sure that everything was to our satisfaction (very friendly and pleasant) and our server was very friendly and attentive.  It's better Indian food than a lot of the other Indian places around here, in Richmond Hill, and a much better value too (you get a lot for your money and it's much cheaper than the competition).  The restaurant, itself, is charming and clean; I will definitely be going back again.
