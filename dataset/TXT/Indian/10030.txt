9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Oh, Amber, how I love you so.  Your lunch buffet stands alone on the mountaintop of lunch buffets, looking down on the inferior buffets with their lack of variety and mass-produced blandness.

Seriously, though, this place is great.  I've only ever eaten there for lunch buffet, but in half a dozen trips, I've sampled most of what they have to offer.  I might have a minor quibble here and there with a dish, but the quality is consistently excellent.  The staff is hilariously nice to my daughter, which I always appreciate.  The mango lassis are delightful.  If I had to pick one thing to complain about, the suspense about whether there will be gajar halwa on the buffet is nerve-wracking.  When there isn't, it's so disappointing.

This probably isn't very adventurous of me to say, but the consistent execution of a good chicken tikka masala is usually my barometer of buffet quality, even though it's not my favorite Indian dish.  The CTM at Amber always gets it right.  

I haven't been to another Indian place since Amber opened, and I don't know that I would voluntarily go back to other places in town as long as this is an option.

It also doesn't hurt that it's right near I'm Board...
