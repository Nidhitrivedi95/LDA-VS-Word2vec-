UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I wished I had read the review on the briyani before I ordered it!  It was one of the more expensive vegetarian options on the menu, and it was the worst I have ever had, 
I ordered the briyani because the menu listed the following ingredients "bell peppers, onions, carrots, cauliflower, chick peas, raisins, cashews and almonds".  What they served was a rice with a red sauce and frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, corn, green beans) and onions. When I asked about the ingredients swap, they said they "we removed them because people have allergies".   I refused to pay for the "briyani", and they took it off of my bill. 

The service was very slow and some of the food was not thermally hot (or flavorful). We were 5 people and the staff inadvertently sent one of our meals out with a pick-up order.  The 5th person in our group did not get served until we were almost done with our meal.  At least the waitress finally told us why it was taking so long!

Loved the spicy vegetarian samosa.  The spicy okra dish was yummy too.
