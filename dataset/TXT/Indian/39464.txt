OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA Hakka food is a spicy fusion of Chinese and Indian cuisine.  It's characterized by heavy sauces, lots of fried meat and full of green and red chillies.  It's a seriously calorie-laden, but irresistibly good style of cooking.

Nestled in an unassuming strip-mall (again?), this is very likely the best Hakka food in Toronto. The portions are inhuman, so order less dishes than people. I never leave Lin Garden paying more than $10 for a truly gigantic portion of food.

There are lots of tables, fast turnover, quick but gruff service, and they can seat 12 people without much fuss.  It's not going to win any design awards, but the food makes up for the lack of ambiance.

Dishes to try include Chili Chicken, Chicken/Shrimp Pakora, Crispy Beef, Garlic String Beans, Manchurian Fried Rice, Chicken Corn Soup and Hakka Chow Mein.
