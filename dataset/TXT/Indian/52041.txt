UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We went to Mint for a friend's birthday, and were seated in a large party (20+ diners).  The food was magnificent and I can't wait to eat there again.

The servers were a bit unorganized in taking our orders, but everyone got appetizers and drinks in due course.  They were even willing to give us separate checks without a hassle!

We ordered one of the chef's tasting menus (Lumbini Vegan Prix Fixe) which was perfect -- we were able to try several dishes and loved all but one.  The Vegetable Korma was my favorite dish.

The most surprising part of the tasting menu was the dessert.  The Gajar Halwa (Carrot Pudding) is cold, spice-laden and delicious.  I think it's flavored with cardamom and nutmeg.  Yes, this sounds weird, but trust me -- it was great!   And it is vegan -- no dairy.  Perfectly yummy!

Eat here today!  You won't be sorry.
