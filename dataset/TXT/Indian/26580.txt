ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I think this Indian restaurant tops one of my Indian restaurant to go to, which is Blue in Ballantyne. Everything we got from the menu was really good. Here's the list of what we got.
-Masala-Chili Cauliflower Florets
-Murgh Tikka Masala 
-Radios Aloo Aur Pakode
-Mango Lasse

However, the one downside is eating at this restaurant was eating outside at night. We could not see the menu at all and had to use our flashlight on our phone to see the menu. Other than that, it's a great restaurant.
