ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw This place gets most things right--great service, expertly-made delicate cocktails, a unique and well-executed menu, great music and ambiance. There really isn't much more, right? I'm a Dormont resident and am happy to a very good business like this roll in. Many people will drive by this place and say to themselves, if they recognize it as 1) a bar/restaurant and 2) open,  "whoa, that place looks fancy for Dormont." They're absolutely right. Those driving by on their way in or out of Mt. Lebanon or Upper St. Clair should certainly take note of this place and plan a visit as soon as possible. You can't usually find this type of place outside the city limits. It also bares the prices of it's equal in the city. Nothing wrong with that,  just plan for it. If there's one thing I'd say as merely an observation, it's that it should be aware of and embrace it's place and importance in Dormont, not be the antithesis of Dormont's more "traditional" bar/restaurant scene. Not that they should go out, buy a TV and slap up some Steelers memorabilia, but rather try some twists on hometown specials (curry fries or masala perogies) or something that offers a palatable bridge to the new, unique kid on the block might offer some value and comfort to residents. In the meantime, they might have already tried...canned beer is a good start!
