eF0AwlWlTp16XneCF50QRA It was Labor Day and everything was closed... Except Ruchi! I tried this on a whim having been to Jaipur Junction in the past and wow, I'm lucky I did. Loved this place. Chicken Tikka was great, Nan was flavorful, and owners were very nice. I'm not a fan of the buffet, but I highly recommend you order off the menu!
