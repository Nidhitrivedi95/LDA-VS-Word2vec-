The food is always tasty, hot (spicy and temp), and fresh. I have only had vegetarian/vegan things on their menu, but I can highly recommend the paneer tikka masala and the vegetable korma. If you haven't had their spiced tea, it's definitely worth a try (but make sure you order it first thing, since it's handmade and steamed right then, it takes a while to cool down). And trust me, you will never leave hungry. 

The service is, as everyone has said, always slow. Even when you are one of a few people in there, it will still be slow. Strangely enough, it's just as slow then as when it's jam-packed. But the people are wonderful and friendly and truly want your experience to be as good as it can be. They will work with you on items that aren't strictly on the menu if what you see isn't what you like, or you want some variety. Just don't go when you're already hungry, and make sure to go with someone you can stand talking to for a few hours, and you're good to go! And paying with cash gets you a nice discount, so I highly recommend you have some on hand.
