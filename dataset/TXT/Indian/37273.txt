O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg TLDR: 10/10 would recommend. Great food. Restaurant isn't super welcoming but that didn't bother us. 

Me and the fiance went today because I had never tried Indian food before. The fiance was nervous because he has always hated Indian food.
 
 When we got there we were greeted by a mostly empty and quiet restaurant. It was a little awkward sitting there while the workers spoke in a different language to their small child running around, but the kid was cute. We were given some thin bread with some awesome sauces before we even ordered. When we did order we got the "Chicken Madras", "Lamb Do Piaza", and garlic naan and they were all super delicious. 
 
 For the Madras I got spicy and it was so perfect for my taste- almost too hot for the fiance though. The meat in the meals was cooked perfectly- I especially enjoyed the charcoal flavor to the chicken and the tenderness of the lamb. The rice it came with was finer then other rice I've experienced but was still delicious. 
 
In the end me and the fiance decided that we would for sure be getting food from here again. He not only enjoyed this Indian food, he Loved it! It was a pleasant first experience for me and I can't wait to try more of the menu items!
