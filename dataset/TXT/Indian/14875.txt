cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Been to 5th element once before and the food was pretty good with large portion sizes. Went back during Summerlicious for lunch and it was a total disappointment. 

Portion sizes were really small (probably a summerlicious thing) and the food wasn't that great. The atomsphere was nice, only one of the staff was attentive. 

For appetizers, we got the summer salad, which had lots of mangoes drizzled with mango sauce, I really like mangoes so I enjoyed it. Lamb kabob, it was more like a lamb sausage, it was okay but not amazing. 

For main, we got the lahore (beef) curry and the lamb curry. I didn't try the lamb because it was too spicy but the lahore beef curry, the beef was SO dry. I found a HAIR in my beef curry. Needless to say, I was disgusted. I didn't finish the rest of the food, not like there was a lot of food to begin with. 

The naan that came with the curry was BURNT. 

For dessert, we got the cheesecake and the pistachio kulfi. The kulfi was a bit bland but the cheesecake was flavorful. 

Would've gave it only 1 star if it wasn't for the summer salad and the dessert. Never going back.
