-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg If you are looking for a generic, cheap, quick and easy Indian meal go to the Amaya in the Square One food court. HOWEVER, if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Indian food then The Maharaja is the place for you. 

Located in a historic building, this place is visually pleasing from the moment you see it. The interior decor is like no other Indian restaurant I have ever seen. It's elegant. From the moment you step in, it's very apparent that a great deal of thought was put into each and every room. As the management mentioned on a tour of the restaurant (which was offered when they learnt we had never been there before), each of the dining rooms have a different decor that matches a theme. From the paintings ("Mena Lisa" was my favourite, The Indian Mona Lisa), to the door handles and light fixtures, everything comes together for an ambiance of luxury and quality. Even their menu has separate themes and you can order accordingly. The Maharaja also has a comprehensive wine and alcoholic drink menu which is not usual for an Indian restaurant. 

We ordered the Subz Hara Bhara Kebab as an appetizer, the Murgh Lababdar,  Amir Shaan Lobster, Mirch Baingan Ka Salan and Naan-i-Lasooni as the mains, and Lab-E-Mashookh as dessert. Each dish was delightful. I have never had lobster with an Indian twist and it was lovely. The Kulfi was perfectly creamy and rich with flavours of Saffron and Cardamom. 

At the end of dinner in true fine Indian dining style, there was a bowl of warm water with lemon to rinse our hands brought to the table. 

If you are looking for a fine dining experience with an extensive Indian menu that includes items not usually found in North America, then The Maharaja is a must visit. 

I highly recommend this place.
