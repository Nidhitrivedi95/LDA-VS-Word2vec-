FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw My friend and I decided to try Chutneys since we were in the area and they had decent reviews. The restaurant itself is clean and modern looking but the tables are pretty small. Nobody greeted us at the door or showed us to a table so we were left wondering if they were even open for business.

The butter chicken was delicious but it's not something I can't find elsewhere. Can't say the same about the garlic naan - it wasn't very garlicky at all. There wasn't a lot of chicken pieces in the butter chicken but I personally don't mind as I prefer less meat and more sauce.

The service was below expectations, especially because of their location. When we asked for containers for our leftovers, our waiter placed both in the same paper bag and there was sauce all over the outside of the plastic bag (thanks...). We were going to pay by cash but then he said he didn't have change. If this was an attempt to receive a tip, we were going to tip regardless, just not generously. And what restaurant doesn't have enough cash for change? Seriously.

Overall, I wouldn't say it was the worst experience since I did enjoy the food but I definitely won't be coming back. Better bang for your buck elsewhere!
