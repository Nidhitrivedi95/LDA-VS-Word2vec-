Lety me dispel something in the reviews below. The place does not smell of raw sewage. The place smells like a family Indian restaurant, and i like it. A good restaurant smells of the food prepared there.

Also I read that the service was not good. Not true. I was treated especially well. The owner was very nice, have me a free drink as I waited for my takeout order. Also, gave a free order of gulab jamun for desert.

We ordered takeout. We always used to order from pasand a few miles away, which sadly closed a few years ago. This place has a lot on common. Understated and unpretentious, they clearly put all their effort into the food. Palak paneer was fresh cheese and amazingly spiced. The tandoor chicken was redolent with spices and flavor. Prefect samosas and naan. Excellent tikka masala. 

I was sad when pasand closed and hadn't found a replacement it yet...until now.
