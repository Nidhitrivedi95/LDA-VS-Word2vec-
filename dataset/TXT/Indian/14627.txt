C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw There are so many good curry options around....just don't

To be absolutely fair, I didn't go at lunch...when I imagine things are hot and fresh.  I went at dinner time and it was really not very nice at all.

The Roti was edible enough...if a bit lukewarm.  It had some nice spice and the chicken had some good flavour..but it looked horrible (like it had been sitting around).

I also tried a fish curry special, which was horrendous.  It was a steak cut of some fish in with some rice, some peas and other vegetables.  Everything in the dish was super bland, but worse than that -The whole thing was cold... the fish had obviously been sitting around all day not on the heat. 

 Food poisoning waiting to happen.
