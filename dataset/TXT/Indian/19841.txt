FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Even with the somewhat limited Indian options in Madison, there are MANY other places in town that serve better food.  

We went to the weekend buffet.  Selection was limited but more importantly the food was BLAND, REALLY BLAND.  How Indian food can be bland is beyond me.  

The food was also only lukewarm.  By the time we got to our table everything was borderline cold.

While the service was acceptable you have better options for Indian in Madison.  Go elsewhere for good food.  

The weekend buffet at Maharaja on Odana, while not perfect, is a much better choice.

PS  To 'Sarah H', to live in NYC for 7 years and to not have Indian better than this is almost impossible.
