grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg The chicken in the Butter Chicken was cold!!! I do not mean room temperature like it was left out but it was actually cold! I've had many butter chickens before but never bit into one that was cold. This time the naan was hot and fresh.

Been here 3 times, first time the naan was cold and now the butter chicken was cold. Something about the ordering experience here doesn't feel good. Can't put my finger on it...

I think I have given this place enough tries will not be returning.
