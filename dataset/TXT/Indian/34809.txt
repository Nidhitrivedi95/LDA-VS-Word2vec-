Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I was excited to discover an indian restaurant bang in the mid of the strip. But is a disappointment. They only have Buffett for $20 and no Ala Cartè menu. The restaurant has huge seating area but the problem is they have just one small Buffett bar which makes the bar really crowded. One literally has to fight for the food. In a Buffett it is advisable to have breads served fresh on the table but they had it in the bar..cold and old. Any good - no! They are just making money because of their location.
