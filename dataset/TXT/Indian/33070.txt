llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Fellow Yelpian Ryan C. organized a little luncheon at India Palace yesterday (see, it's not only ladies who lunch, sometimes it's us manly men, too:)

I made the pilgrimage from OTowSco to the near reaches of NW PHX and met up with Ryan, Rand, Norm, Daren and Wes and we talked and laughed and we hit the boofay at India Palace pretty hard:)

Pretty good boofay...not terribly extensive as far as the food selections go...but the available items were all well prepared, well seasoned and my lunch ended up on the happy end of the "Crap to Quality Ratio":)

As we dug into our first plate of boofay, Ryan said "I hope everybody filled up on bananas and cheese"...a humorous comment about lubricative effects of the food at India Palace:)

In a happy coincidence, he almost exactly described my breakfast yesterday morning...4 bananas and a  1/2 pound of Tillamook Sharp Cheddar:)

When you get to be my age, the adage "never trust a fart after 50" isn't just a funny thing to say...it becomes one of the guiding principles in your life...so, bananas and cheese...all the curry's and tandoori's  and vegetarian squash/potato stuff and vindaloo's with basmati rice and naan in the joint aren't going to break through this particular firewall:-)

Oatmeal would have just been throwing gas (no...gasoline, not GI tract methane) on the fire (oh wait...that would work too:)

Although I'm not generally a fan of boofays (I really do think the "sneeze guards" seem to be just a suggestion to many of the people that I see rooting around in the boofay) this was a pretty clean and well maintained boofay...I had 2 plates of pretty decent Indian food and got a chance to relax for few minutes with friends and have a little light conversation:)

Things stayed sealed up tight and I sailed through the rest of my day with the confidence, dignity and demeanor of a man who knows that everything is safely locked down:)
