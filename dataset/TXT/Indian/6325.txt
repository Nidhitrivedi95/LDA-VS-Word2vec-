3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I do not consider myself an expert in Indian food at all.  I just know what tastes good.  I'm from Southern California, and there are 2 authentic Indian food restaurants where I'm from.  Delhi Indian Cuisine is right there in line with them.  I love their food, the servers and even owner are very nice.  They always ask you how the food is.  I come here so much that I'm almost a regular.  I haven't been to the lunch buffet yet, I've only eaten dinner here.  The portions are huge enough for two people.  I love this place
