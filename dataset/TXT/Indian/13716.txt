BQkfjQlvnaqHKSZuBAQflQ We dropped in here exhausted after a long day in the city where we ended up missing lunch. We were plenty hungry and ordered for chicken bhuna, chapati, daal tarka and steamed rice. The food was good and the service was quick. I am not giving them a 4-star rating cause the service could have been improved and the guy who greeted us could have been friendlier. 
My partner tried to use the Yelp checkin offer for 10% menu ( we both unlock and use Yelp offers which work pretty great) but the guy refused it by saying it is only on the takeout menu while as the offer says main menu which is what we ordered. We didn't argue but still as I mentioned before, the service could have been better and friendlier. 
Three star for the food.
