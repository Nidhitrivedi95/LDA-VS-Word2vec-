GmMZG6dsDqGVC275ZwD-cw I am all about great food for a reasonable price. The restaurant is ok nothing too fancy. The waiters are not very customer centered and it seems to be a family run place. There is a bollywood song channel playing in the background.  

 I came here for my bday and we ordered bhindi, butter chicken, and lamb sizzler. The food was delicious! There were two of us and we finished all the food! Ever since then, I have been comparing everything I eat to this place. I highly recommend it! 

Overall:
Pros: Food and Price
OK....: Decor and waiter service
