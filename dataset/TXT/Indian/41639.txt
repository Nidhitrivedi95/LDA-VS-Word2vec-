Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g A hidden gem! We went for Mother's Day lunch and were very impressed with the service and food. It was quiet around lunch but server said it gets busier at dinner (about 10 tables/booths in total) & recommended reservations. The service was excellent and staff were so pleasant! 

Lunch special was reasonably priced at $7.95 and an excellent variety of Indian-Chinese food. We could hear the food being made fresh (& judging from the time it took).
We had the chilli fish (fried but soft and delicious), veggie Manchurian chili, and veggie Hakka noodle lunch specials. Good portion size. No left overs. 

We also had the veggie spring roll appetizers which have a similar filling to samosas (potatoes). And we had the dry chilli chicken which was delicious & spicy the way we like it (no gravy). 

Really great service and we will go back for take out it sit-down. Recommend ordering everything at once since it is made fresh. 

We also went for a walk by the water afterwards since it was a nice day. My mom enjoyed that too.
