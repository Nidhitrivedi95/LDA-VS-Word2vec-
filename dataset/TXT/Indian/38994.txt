OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g If only I could give 0 stars on 5, I would definitely do that. Good tasting food. But it took them 2 hours to give butter chicken and white rice. Oh wait! Two hours for butter chicken and an extra half an hour for white rice. These times are not exaggeration. So if you want to have dinner here, you might as well reach the restaurant at 1pm and give your dinner order right away and there is a possibility that you might get the food for breakfast the next day. Also there is a good chance your order is given to someone in the next table!

Butter chicken did taste good.

And they don't give you forks or spoons or knives. I almost wanted to walk into the kitchen and get everything myself!
