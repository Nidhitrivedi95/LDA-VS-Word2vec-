P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I used to have an Indian restaurant I frequented weekly, sadly it closed down.  It took some time - but a friend finally discovered All India that was pretty equivilant to my old restaurant.

At many Indian restaurants - there is a TON of oil in the food.  It "floats to the top" and just sits there.  At All india - there is no oil making a mess in your food.  All India is the best Indian buffet I've had in Pittsburgh.  In all honesty - I have NO doubt that their regular/non-buffet food is fantastic.  

I don't frequent All India enough - but when I do the service is impeccable, the food is phenomenal and it's just all around perfection.  They have a HUGE variety for vegetarians/vegan and meat eaters alike.  They have all the food clearly labeled and an abundance of naan.  

Whether you go for lunch or dinner - All India will never disappoint - You will always leave fulfilled with some scrumptious food and tea!
