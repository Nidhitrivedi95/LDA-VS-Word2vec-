YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw Have tried their dosa buffet Tuesday nights and like the variety they offer in that buffet but the other day I ordered the chicken biryani and chicken seekh kebab and fell in love. The biryani was bursting with flavor and it is the second best I have had in delhi. The chicken seekh was delicious too and came with yummy mint chutney. Inhave found my go-to biryani spot. Highly recommend !
