iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw I was so excited to try this place, and I'm so glad I did ! This is a vegans dream come true! The veggie samosas are so tasty and full of crunch! They are priced by single serving. I tried the vegan tofu chili burrito. It was huge and I couldn't even eat half of it! Yes, I suggest you split the burritos or bowls. 

The masala fries are AMAZING! They are super flavorful  and give you just the right portion if you order a combo.  The man taking orders was happy to give samples of products to the customers before they ordered. ER arrived around 4, and they were already out of chicken, for all you meat eaters. 

My wife also had a mango lassi. She said it was good, but has had better. The service was fast and friendly. The food was huge in size and flavor! We will be back to try more vegan options. My only complaint is that they don't have vegan breakfast options. I would have been tempted to come early and try, if they did!
