His response was that he didn't need my custom as he has a Michelin Star (he doesn't) and has people flocking from miles to visit this restaurant (he well might). He the hit my wife and I with the wonderful linedo you want to eat here or not because I don't care. This is the owner remember. Obviously we were left with no choice so we declined to eat. This was a special night-out for my wife and me and we were looking forward to eating at this restaurant. The whole experience was genuinely horrible and wild horses would not drag me back to this restaurant.
