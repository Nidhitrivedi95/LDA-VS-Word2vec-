GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA There are a few times in your life when you have a baaad feeling about a place...Peeling plastic off of the menus, peeling plaster off the walls, filthy kitchen (which I mistook for the entrance to the restaurant before being shooed out) for starters.

Ordered some staple, vegetarian dishes. I think the food was watered down from a previously frozen and very likely refrozen dishes. There still was the distinct aftertaste of freezer burn...

I'm falling sick even a few hours after...bloating, nausea, and a general sick feeling. 

Avoid this restaurant like the plague.
