FuYTMNlkpe898_c0EiySFA NOT A 1 STAR BUT YELP WON'T ACCEPT A NO STAR!!!
Saw this new restaurant in our regular travels a free weeks ago. Surprisingly not a lot of Indian restaurants in the NW corner of Mississauga so wanted to give it a shot. 
In the neighborhood again today at 13:00 so decided to stop in. Parking lot was full but the lot is small. Lots of other stores in the area so plenty of parking available. Got to the door and was immediately greeted by who I am assuming was the hostess. Without asking us one single question she abruptly informed us that they currently had 4 parties on the go and would not accommodate us (even though there were a few others waiting to be seated). Without so much as an apology or even giving us a chance to say a word she told us to try back after 15:00. Funny thing was we were only a party of two and the restaurant is a buffet. 
Needless to say we will not be returning after 15:00 or at anytime for that matter. There are way too many new places to enjoy without having to put up with the lousy attitude or the poor customer service. Considering this is a chain of restaurants perhaps management should review who they hire to greet prospective customers ($$$$).  A big fat zero (my first) for this review.  Can't wait to see who opens there next when this place shuts down.
