A_05gZ2QwayLb0YeQ_TItQ The food flavour is excellent , but the wait is too long, and the hygiene is very low.
I got a piece of wire in my lamb biryani 
And the guy told me that the chicken biryani will take 40 minutes and pushed me to take the lamb.

Lamb biryani was ok
Butter chicken tastes very good but he didn't give me any bread 

Piece of wire ruined it all 

Gave 2 stars coz butter chicken tasted good 

Sorry that I had to wait for the food for 30 minutes that was not even clean.
