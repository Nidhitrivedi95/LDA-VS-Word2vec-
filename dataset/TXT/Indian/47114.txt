Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Very nice addition to the Gordon Square food lineup. We started with samosas, which were piping hot and flavorful. They came with two dipping sauces- a tamarind and a cilantro. I chose the paneer tikka masala for my entree, and my husband had the lamb Madras. My paneer was plentiful, the sauce was heavenly, and the veggies were perfectly cooked. The lamb was tasty and well-spiced per my husband's request. Of course we had to get the garlic naan, and were not sorry we did. 

No liquor license? No problem. Go right next door and fetch some beer. BYOB welcome.

The lone server on the evening we were there was running her tail off, and she did an admirable job.

The only reason I can't give 5 stars was the total lack of ambiance. It's just a little rough around the edges in there. That will, however, not stop me from coming back for more delicious food at great prices.
