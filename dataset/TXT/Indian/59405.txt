z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA The food here was amazing. Service was great and the overall atmosphere was very nice. I had the lamb madras, with aloo paratha, which went really well with the Taj Mahal Premium beer I was drinking. Overall the food was extremely flavorful and had just the right amount if spice for me, and when I got back my hotel I slept like a baby. Thanks for an awesome experience.
