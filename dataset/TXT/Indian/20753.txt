g8GNA1Np_tA_41_9v1S0eQ I would have given this restaurant 4 stars for the food and price range. Unfortunately, I have to give this restaurant 2 stars for the customer service and experience that we received from the manager. The female manager is incredibly rude. Her demeanor is mean and she lacks hospitality. When she was faced with a question she merely brushed us off like we weren't worth speaking to. 

However, I feel sorry for her staff who are super sweet. One young man memorized our orders considering we are regulars and another young woman who is quick on her feet when accommodating tables. You can tell that when the boss is there it's a completely different atmosphere and setting. 

The establishment seems to be relatively clean. Food is delicious, tasty and incredibly good portions. Yet, I recommend coming here during lunch to get a good deal and your moneys worth. During lunch 2 people could eat for about under $15 - 20 from the lunch menu, soda is included. If youre hungry their portions will definitely satisfy you. My go to dish is the Chili Chicken or Chili Shrimp on fried rice. 

My family and friends are regulars. Overall they deserve about 4 stars. I'm just very disappointed from the service we received from the female manage. This has been a ongoing occurrence everytime we've eaten there when she's present. Therefore I have to give them 3 for a fair in between.
