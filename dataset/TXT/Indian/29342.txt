JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ I love this place! I am all about trying new cultures' cuisines and Woodlands knocks their food out of the park. 

I work just down the street so my coworkers and I often go for lunch. They have a great special that offers 2 curries, rice, a samosa, and a rice pudding. I always tend to order the Malai Kofta and it's amazing! Order it with a side of the garlic or onion naan and your day will be perfect.
