NwLIEaqEz-9kcHkseLsfiQ Why have I not reviewed this place yet????

I've probably been here over a hundred times. It's one of our favourite spots to hit around 2am, because 

a) It is right next to the barn (now called the marquis) and zippers, super close to walk from the village

b) its the perfect place to stumble too when you're incredibly intoxicated

c) Its the only indian place i know in the DT core that's open super late

how british of us right?

The food here is pretty standard fare indian/pakistani food.

Don't expect bells and whistles. Food's served on paper plates and cups.

The tandoori rolls are what we usually get, but I have drunkenly tried other items (which I totally remember...)

Filled with cabbies everywhere too.


Notes:

I've seen people throwing up outside this restaurant a number of times

You may get approached by the ...ladies of the night here (I have been multiple times)

Just have fun!
