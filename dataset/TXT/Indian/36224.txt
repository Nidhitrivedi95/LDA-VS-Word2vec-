NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ Amazing food . Staff are very attentive and pleasant. The couple next to me had small kids- the waiter - Gautaum went on to make them feel at home. 
 I ordered the chicken special- the Chicken was succulent and daal makhani was very Tammy as was the naan. The wine was okay
One word delicious ! After a walking tour this was perfect comfort food.
