Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw BEST INIDIAN FOOD IN THE CITY. Take-out and eat-in are both delicious (but I don't do the buffet, no idea what that is like). No chemicals (MSG) like at other Indian restaurants. I wish, wish, wish they made Saag Paneer!!! 

Note, the decor is not pretty, nothing to look at, but the food is AMAZING.
