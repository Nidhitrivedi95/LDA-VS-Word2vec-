IxImEiJocfQHMl_xphWYag (Would actually have given 3.5 stars if possible.  BTW, what does A-OK mean?  Should it just be "OK"?  Going from "Meh" to "A-OK" seems like too big a leap.  Am I right, people?)

Ordered in last night.  Had the Aloo Gobi, Mattar Paneer, pilau rice, naan, raita and an order of pakoras (6).

The potato and cauliflower in the AG was recognisable, which isn't always the case.  The MP was a bit too saucy...not enough peas and "cheese".   The complimentary papadums were a nice touch.

They didn't ask about spice, and we didn't specify, so it was not "hot" at all.  It was tasty though, so we'll order again.
