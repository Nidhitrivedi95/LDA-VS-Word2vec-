hL3LFrwR1UQ-d0CcYF73Sg Came here for the first time for their lunch buffet based on the few good reviews here on Yelp.
I think the selection isn't that plentiful and the food was only marginally ok, considering it's only $8.99.  What bothered me the most was the fact my bill came out to be $9.95, which equates to a 10%+ sales tax.  When asked why the tax rate isn't the std rate of 8.1% for Chandler, AZ, the explanation was "the machine did it, give or take a nickel." Well, the difference is actually about four nickels.  They never even bother to offer to fix the bill, even after being caught red handed.
