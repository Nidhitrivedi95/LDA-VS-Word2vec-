-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Some coworkers and I went here for the lunch buffet.  Everything was fresh and hot.  They server garlic naan on request which was great!  Great selection with all the traditionals egg curry, tandori chicken.  Also, a small salad bar and dessert!  To top it off the buffet was only $7.50 per person.  We will be back!
