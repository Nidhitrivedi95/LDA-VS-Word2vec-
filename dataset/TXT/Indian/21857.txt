gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Customer service was great. I came in right at closing time. The owner allowed me to order food and eat my meal even though they were passed their hours of operation. The Gyro was actually the best gyro I've ever eaten my life. Everything was fresh tasteful. It was delicious I plan on coming back and bringing friends with me!
