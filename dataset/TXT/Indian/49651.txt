tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA We moved to Arizona from New Jersey 16 years ago. My husband and I first date was at an Indian restaurant. It became our favorite and he proposed to me there as well. So Indian food has always been a family favorite. When we moved to Arizona we looked everywhere for a good Indian restaurant and were sadly disappointed. Last year, my husband found India oven through Yelp. We went and we love it. Seriously love it. Their food is great, their prices are awesome and the staff is super friendly. I can't say enough how much we love it.
