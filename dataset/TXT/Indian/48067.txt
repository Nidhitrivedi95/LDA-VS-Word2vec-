TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Free Mango Lassi on check-in was really tasty & not too sweet. Both our entrees, Biryani & Tikka Masala, were excellent. Although the next table had Tandoori Chicken on a sizzling skillet and this looked even better than ours. This was the 4th Indian place we've tried in Las Vegas and definitely the best. Highly recommended.
