GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw We found that restaurant by walking by, they had $16.00 Buffet GOOD DEAL!
they have more naan selection, I haven't seen at any other restaurant.

service - is okay, slow. they short staffed only 1 person doing all the work

Prices are very decent comparing to other restaurant in this area. 

Overall- I will Def go back again, I love Indian food.
