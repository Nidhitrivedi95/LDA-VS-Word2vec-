vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w This is my favorite Indian restaurant. The food has delicious flavors, the atmosphere is very unassuming, the prices are way too low, and the deserts are phenomenal.

I haven't been, since I visited Montreal in 2005, but it was still just as good as when I lived there in 2002. I miss this place sorely.
