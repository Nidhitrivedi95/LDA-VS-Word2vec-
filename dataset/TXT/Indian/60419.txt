znc5ZpKCPANquABEm7SJuA Came in here for the Jerk Chicken lunch special.

$4.99+tax got me a giant piece of delicious, moist, flavorful jerk chicken, a giant pile of beans & rice (make sure to get the curry sauce from the curry chicken ladled over the rice, it's so good), 2 fried plaintain pieces, a big scoop of coleslaw, and a piece of fried dough (forget what that's called).

It was enough food for 2 people, seriously.

I couldn't finish half of it. 

Really good overall.

It was quick and tasty and filling. And CHEAP.

Just a note they take cash only, so if you only have visa/debit like I do, you have to get the receipt and go to the restaurant upstairs to pay with their debit (owned by same people). Not a huge deal.
