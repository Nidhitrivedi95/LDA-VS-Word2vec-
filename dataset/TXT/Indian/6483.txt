3quopZyL8WuqVFfsCi0z2A I have been here a few times since it opened and everything is top notch; the quality of the food, the serving sizes, and the attentive staff. And the prices are as good as I've seen. I have tried 6 or 7 different appetizers, 3 or 4 kinds of bread and 4 or 5 of the mains. I would rank this as my favourite Indian restaurant and I have eaten at dozens of Indian restaurants in Toronto, Kitchener, Waterloo, Boston, New York, London (Ontario and England) as well a India.
