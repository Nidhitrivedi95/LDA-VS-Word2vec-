abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg I wanted to check out the Early Bird Coffee a little east of here but the place was closed so I was glad to stumble upon this restaurant. The menu choice was simple but it took a while for my friend and I to choice some dishes to try. We asked the bartender for some recommendations which we were glad for the help. The dishes were wonderful and flavourful. They were on the smaller size but the aroma and spices used in the dishes were worth it. We ordered the lamb mishkaki, sesame brussels sprouts, shrimp makai curry, coconut panna cotta, and crispy milk pastry. Honestly, I thought the desserts were ok. Skippable because you won't be missing anything. But the shrimp makai curry and brussels  sprouts a must try!
