YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA In general my experience has been that Toronto has amazing Indian food. We ate at Kothur for lunch and it was definitely not amazing, though it was a lot of food for a decent price. For $7.99 we each got the lunch special which included rice, a choice of dish, a piece of naan, a potato and peas dish, and rice pudding. We ordered mattar paneer and aloo saag. Both of them were fine but not particularly flavorful. It wasn't that anything was bad, it just didn't have a ton of flavor either. Service was friendly and it was an ok meal, but there are so many options in Toronto that I can't see going back here.
