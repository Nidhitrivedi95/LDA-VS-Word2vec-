TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA This place is very unclean. Tables and chairs are filthy. Bathrooms are dirty filthy and without hot water in the middle of winter.

Place is full of crying babies, most likely crying after eating the food.

Food itself is mediocre, food is laden with spices, overall not a very pleasant experience.
