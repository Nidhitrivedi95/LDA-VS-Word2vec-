sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I have been eating Roti at Gandhi for years, except tonight, it seems as if they have made a change.

There is a new sign on the bartop that says something like "You can now order in MILD - MEDIUM - MEDIUM HOT - HOT - HOT TO VERY - VERY HOT"

which I didn't see until pickup as I called to order in advance.  I was expecting the Gandhiness of yesteryear, and was terribly disappointed when I returned home to find my "medium" roti to be mild at best.

I ordered a "Hot" Chana in 2005 and was surprised to find my taste buds ever recovered. Now I think "Hot" may be a necessity.  Gandhi has changed a bit in the last few years. They added another table, lost the booths, got more drinks, a price increase, A New Bronze Ganesh on the wall to replace the aging Toronto Star articles,  a variety wider of chutneys - but for the most part the wonderfulness has stayed the same.  

The meat Rotis are not as good as the veg. The Mixed Vegetable Korma is fantastic day 1 and less so next day. The Saag Paneer is epic at any time, even cold, and the Chana is heavily laced with tomato/cumin and delicious. The Chana needs to be spicy.  

The trick with Gandhi is call ahead and pick up. It gets crowded and hot in there and your outfit will smell like curry for the remainder of the ay if you stay inside for even a few minutes. 

Its true though, best roti ever. Well, Mother India is pretty much the same - but just too far west for me.
