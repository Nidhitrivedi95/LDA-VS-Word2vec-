1n-HH6BG913cKQ1tX3wQEg Not the best Indian food I've ever had, but certainly not the worst.  A chicken tikka masala, an aloo mutter, and two orders of samosas came to a little more than $25.  The samosas were decent in size and flavor, as were the dipping sauces.  The aloo mutter was a little spicier and saucier than usual, and I thought they skimped on the rice a bit, but for $7 my expectations weren't too high.  The entree size was also big enough that I had tons of leftovers for the next day.

Delivery is available through Campusfood.  I want to try the other Indian delivery places as well, but I certainly wouldn't mind ordering from here again.
