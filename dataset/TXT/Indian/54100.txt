VrftSduLIducNfEzITOL5A i ate here last night with one of my friends. we were in town for a conference and decided to check out little india. this was one of the place that seemed to have some patronage. the buffet was pretty good. lot of different dishes (goat curry, chicken curry), chicken buriani. the food was good. but not spectacular, although the mango lassi was solid. the cheetah's beer was no kingfisher but it did the job. this is a solid choice for relatively cheap north indian food buffet style. we ending up spending $28 each w/ tip (but we both had the buffet, a mango lassi and a beer).
