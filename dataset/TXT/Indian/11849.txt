AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ Good food and efficient service. The desserts is not something I expected them to be just your regular Indian one. The tikka wrap could use a little bit more heat and kick of spices. The portion size was a bit on the larger side especially the side of fries. Overall a nice twist on Indian food and no regrets
