yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This is my all-time favorite Indian place! I've never been disappointed by a meal at the Dhaba. This is the food I crave when I'm pregnant! The restaurant is very small, however it is worth the wait when it is crowded! They also do take out. I have dropped off my car at the Honda mechanic that is behind this restaurant, ordered my food and by the time I get to the restaurant it is ready. The chicken korma is amazing and the garlic naan is plentiful!
