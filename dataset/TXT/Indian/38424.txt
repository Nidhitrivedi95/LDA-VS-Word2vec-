OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We were in Vegas for couple of days with my friends. Food here is nothing like the usual Indian resturant is a positive way. The menu is so unique and food tastes awesome. Every item that was served had authentic recepies. We all just completely finished every dish to the last bit. Ambience and decore just right. Very good food options to choose from too.
