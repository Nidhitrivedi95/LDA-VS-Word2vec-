ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Awesome place! Nice ambiance, excellent food. The reason I give it a 3 is because the owner? (Or one of the two owners) who was going around greeting everyone didn't make his way around to our table! Granted we did just stumble upon the restaurant as we were driving past it and we weren't in our best attire, we were still paying customers who would have liked to be checked on by the owner!
That set a gloom tone to our overall dinner experience but that still doesn't take away (too much) from the fact that we had really delicious food!
