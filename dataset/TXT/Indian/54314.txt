Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I don't understand the wealth of positive reviews of this restaurant. I'm assuming these customers order carry out. 

I stopped here when I was passing through the area and had a craving for Indian food at lunch time. The food here is very authentic. But unless you're in a city like New York, LA or Chicago, you can expect most Indian restaurants to be pretty authentic. I had the lunch buffet, which consisted of three curries, tandoori chicken, naan, rice, raita and samosas. The samosas were great and the chutneys served with them were fresh. Everything else was just OK. The vegetables were mostly potatoes and there were no greens.

So, the food was passable (I don't care if it's "authentic" ... it has to have green vegetables!) but not a deal breaker for a lunch buffet.

The downside is that this restaurant is a little more than dingy. There were flies near the buffet and instead of plates and silverware, there are styrofoam lunch trays and plastic forks and spoons. I actually expected to see sporks! 

I'm sorry, I don't care how "authentic" the food is. Styrofoam is simply a turn off for me.
