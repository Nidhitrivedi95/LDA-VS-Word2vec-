Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ 4/5! I highly recommend this place. The service is fantastic and the food is authentic (chefs from Delhi). I recommend the saag paneer, chicken tikka masala and lamb biryani. It is one of the few indian restaurants where the saag paneer is not filled with oil. The chefs can tailor the spice to your liking. Make sure you go with a big appetite!
