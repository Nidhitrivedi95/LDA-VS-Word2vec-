It's tucked away in a strip mall I usually ignore after living here for many years, but the interior is fresh and welcoming. If you're new to Indian cuisine, or like a little of everything, start with the weekend lunch buffet. It had all the standards - vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, mator paneer, naan, veggie pakora, and even some dessert to try. Literally everything I tasted was good! And at $14, it was an excellent deal - I ate until I was stuffed but felt great because it was mostly veggies and rice. I will definitely be back. So awesome that there's a new place in Chesterland serving something besides bar food. A must try for locals looking for a new addition to a night out, and totally worth the drive for anyone who lives farther out. Head and shoulders above any of the other local Indian places!
