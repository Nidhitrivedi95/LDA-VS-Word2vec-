YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw I work in the area and this is one of my favorite lunch spots. I probably eat here 2-3 times a week. The main reason I love this place is the variety in dishes they serve for their lunch buffet. Most other places I've tried they serve a limited number of dishes and chicken is the primary meat. But here, they got chicken, goat, fish, etc. And they seem to put out a couple new items a day so it doesn't get old or boring. They also do brunch buffets on Sundays too. Great place for healthy and satisfying lunch if your into Indian food.
