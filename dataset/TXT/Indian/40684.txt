PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Loved the meat samosas and garlic naan, but the chicken tikka masala was seriously lacking. 

I came to Daawat after reading a great review about the meat samosas. Was not disappointed. They were stuffed with yummy well seasoned meat and vegetables. It came with mint chutney and a tamarind chutney, both had nice flavors. 

Then came the chicken tikka masala. It was a nice orange color that screams "I'm bursting with flavor!" However, first bite betrays all. Very, very plain tasting. The chicken itself was okay, veggies were good, but overall really lacking flavor. 

The garlic naan was very yummy and crispy. Would eat by itself. 

I would go again to eat more samosas and maybe try the biryani or another menu item since this place has a lot of nice reviews. But certainly wouldn't get the chicken tikka masala again.
