8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw When I first moved to Pittsburgh and had no groceries and was still grossed out by the perma grime left on my stove from the previous tenant, I pretty much went out for lunch downtown everyday. I am a big fan of Indian food and a big a cheap skate so Sree Foods was a perfect fit for me.

This place is no BS and the most unpretentious hole in the wall kind of dive you'll ever find. You go in with $5 and you get a styrofoam container and an elderly Indian lady gives you a big heep of amazing vegan Indian food. There's usually three vegan dishes and one chicken dish. They give you a little bit of all of the available dishes and throw it together in one container. They finally then throw in a piece of naan that is like the Indian equivalent of Wonder Bread but the great dishes make up for it.

It is a cash only spot and like I said, just $5 for this daily lunch special, and $1 extra for a pop. One thing to beware of is that they fill up your styrofoam container to the max. Sometimes the food starts to leak out, so if you don't want an unnecessary dry cleaner run, be careful.
