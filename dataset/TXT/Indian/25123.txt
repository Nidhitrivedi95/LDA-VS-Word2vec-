HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw I am very surprised with the poor reviews because this restaurant is amazing!

My friend and her husband have been going there for years and always rave about it. Since our office relocated up by the airport, a few of my colleagues decided to try it for lunch. Three of us ordered from the lunch menu specials (Beef with Ginger & Scallion, Chicken with Black Bean Sauce and Shrimp with Lobster Sauce) and all of it was incredible. The specials were about $6.50 and, no word of a lie, one dish was enough for two people. My other colleague ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein and it was cooked (crispy) to perfection. All the dishes came out fresh and piping hot.

I have tried so many Hakka restaurants throughout the years and I have to genuinely say that this is one of the best. I would rank it up with Yeuh Tung (behind City Hall), which is one of Toronto's originals.
