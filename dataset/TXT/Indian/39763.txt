P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg I'm updating this to a solid 5 as a result of my experience here today. 

We really couldn't decide what to order; we explained our criteria to the waiter, and he gave us numerous different options, explaining each one. 

At the end of our meal, I asked for the rest of the food to be packed up for take-out. After paying my bill, I had actually forgotten my take-out inside the restaurant, and I was outside getting into my car. The waiter actually came out in the pouring rain to give me the food I had forgotten inside, which I really wouldn't expect anyone to do. This is the main reason I'm giving this place a 5; the service is great, they really do care about their customers.
