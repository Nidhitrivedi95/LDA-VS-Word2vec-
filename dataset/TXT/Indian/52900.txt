v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug I think the only word you really need to know is: COCKROACHES... yes indeed we had one walk up the table and perch himself over our table, when we brought it up to the waitress she had us stand up and then reached over and killed it with a napkin (while our food was still on the table). She didnt even apologize, she just brought the check over. That is pretty horrible, the owner or manager doesnt even come over? So we brought her back and asked for some kind of discount since its nasty as hell in there and we were all nauseously trying to keep the "Indian" food down. (and yes it gets scare quotes because that was some shitty "Indian" food.. have you ever had a palak paneer without cream? made with frozen spinach????) So she goes to talk to the guy behind the bar and then just throws the bill on the table without a word... If we were jerks about it that I would understand but no we were pretty nice about the whole deal...  so my husband goes to the guy behind the bar and he then gives us a 10% discount, spluttering, "the place upstairs was just fumigated" yeah right... and my name is Kumar....its quite concerning that a roach is just going to show up on the wall and chill out under bright lights... that usually is indicative of an infestation. 

But mostly it was just the way the owner/manager and the waitress treated us. we didnt put your roach there dudes,  have some graciousness and treat us nice, say your sorry, come over to our table, take a meal off the bill, give us a glass of wine or a dessert. SOMETHING. 

I felt like these people just want you to go, eat like cows at their buffet trough then F off and leave them money. it was horrible.
