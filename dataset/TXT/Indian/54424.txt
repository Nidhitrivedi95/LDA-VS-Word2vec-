vZu3xxlMQSqFngDgdFLfXg As a proud Indian, how dare the owners call the food they serve 'Indian'. I understand that they're trying to adhere to western tastes and cook the food on the milder side. But that doesn't mean the food needs to be absolutely bland and tasteless. Care to put some salt and pepper maybe? Tried the chickpea, and chicken curries. It was just bland and the chicken was extremely dry. The Naan - don't even get me started. The texture was very thick, rubbery and served stone-cold. I understand this is mall fast food so my expectations aren't high. But I highly suggest that the owners visit a respectable dhabha (roadside fast food joint) in India and learn a few things about North Indian cuisine. Actually on second thoughts, no need to go to india. Just go to Manchu wok or mucho burrito next door and get an idea of how food can be edible with some sense of taste without necessarily being spicy!!
