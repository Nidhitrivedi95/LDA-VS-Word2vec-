2k38N8o_4mAVQwZrmBMPzw I've tried several Indian takeaways since moving to Leith and this has become my favorite. I stayed away from this place initially because, quite frankly, it looked a bit rough. But don't let the appearance fool you. This is place cooks some fabulous curries. The set meal for two (£13.95) is a steal and the staff are helpful and kind. Highly recommended.


 Cons: the on-line ordering doesn't always work. It's best to call. Also, they seem a bit understaffed and overwhelmed at times.


 Overall, A+
