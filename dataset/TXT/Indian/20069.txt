FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q This 5 star review is for their lunchtime buffet.  There was so much variety and each dish was delicious!  I've had Indian buffets before, but this is hands down the BEST one I have ever been to.  They really don't skimp on the good stuff (including garlic naan!)  

We also came here for dinner, which was equally delicious but much pricier and obviously less variety.  The lunch buffet is totally worth it if you don't mind being in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon.
