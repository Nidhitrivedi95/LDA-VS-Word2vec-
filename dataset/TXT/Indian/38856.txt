OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Awesome location and atmosphere at Urban Turban. Service was most excellent and the ambiance at the restaurant perfect for a night out. 

The best for last - the food is iconic. Really well put together menu selection and the chef in the bam delivers quality fresh Indian food as opposed to the oily dishes most places serve. 

Highly recommend Urban Turban for their traditional yet modern Indian cuisine.
