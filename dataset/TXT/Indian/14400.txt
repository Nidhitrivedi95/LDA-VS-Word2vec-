C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Checked out Kalendar with a group of 6 for a pre-Christmas meal and it was fantastic. It's been a couple years since I've been back to Kalendar, and that night, it was our Plan B since Sidecar was full and we had no reservations.

We arrived at Kalendar with no wait for a table.  Our group ordered a Scroll with salad ($14.95), 2 lamb chop entrees ($24.95), 2 orders of the seafood fettuccini ($23.95) and I got the lobster ravioli ($22.95), along with a couple pints of beer ($6.50) and a half litre of malbec ($22.00).

Our food order came up pretty quickly and all the dishes were hot and fresh.  My lobster ravioli was okay...it really was more ravioli than lobster.  I think I only tasted lobster on the first bite and there were at least 8 jumbo raviolis in the dish.  The seafood fettuccini was packed full of shrimp, scallop and mussel goodness...I should have got that.  Lamb chops were delivered exactly as ordered (medium rare and well done).  

A few of us decided to get coffee and split a couple of desserts - daily cheesecake ($6.95) and the black bottom pecan pie ($7.95).  The pecan pie was served warm and drizzled with chocolate sauce - amazing.  The daily cheesecake was orange cranberry and good but a bit on the tart side.

Our server was great...speedy on the service but let us enjoy our meal at our own pace.  We loved the warm, cozy atmosphere and the romantic decor with the twinkly white lights.

Overall, a really great dinner and impressed everyone in our group.
