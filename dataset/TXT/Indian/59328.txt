We stopped in here on our way to a family Thanksgiving dinner in Kingston as we were delegated to bring appetizers so we decided on samosas :)

Grabbed the large pack of 27 (I think!) samosas for just over $9!! This also included containers of tamarind and mint chutney dipping sauces.

We split one fresh samosa in the car on the way down and it was delicious. Flaky and light pastry and the filling wasn't too spicy.

Our family loved them too which was awesome.
