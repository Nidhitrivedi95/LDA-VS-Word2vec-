gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Per very positive Yelp reviews, a couple of friends and I stopped in here one evening... And very glad we did! Food was amazing & service was excellent! We ordered Saag Paneer, Chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan- all phenomenal (and I eat quite a bit of Indian food). Our server, which I believe was also the owner, was incredibly nice and sincerely thankful for our business. Such great service seems hard to come by these days, so this place really made an impression on me. I'd recommend it to any one in town craving something other than hangover pizza. ;) Excited for leftovers tomorrow!
