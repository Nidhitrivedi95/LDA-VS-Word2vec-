02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I highly recommend coming in for the buffet! It was the bomb! For $9.99 you can try pretty much everything on the menu. It's expensive if you do a la cart items. 

Service was excellent. Very clean restaurant. The buffet is fresh items. If you feel like anything may have been sitting, they replace it immediately, no questions asked. 

My favorite was the chicken curry and garlic nan. To. Die. For. I'll be going back for sure.
