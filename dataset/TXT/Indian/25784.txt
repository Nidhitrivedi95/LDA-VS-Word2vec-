Hz6pXloEBWboBaJuEpk0JQ This place was AWESOME!!!  Those who choose to give it less than 3 stars are not worth reading their reviews.  And really people?  Because it is inside of Rio Casino you are going to say the restaurant is not worth going too?  You need to get off of YELP and do not consider yourself as a Foodie person if you are going to let the location of a restaurant deter you from having a great experience.  And I know the Rio is a bit run down compare to all the new casinos...but the restaurant is a great restaurant to get authentic Indian food.  Usually when one goes to an Indian restaurant you expect most food to be super spicy and tons of curry!  Well this place offers more than spicy and curry.  The food has flavor, texture and authenticity.  The wine selection we had was great!  We had a Pinot Noir- ZD.

I would go back again and put up with the nusiance of Vegas Strip traffic to go have dinner again!
