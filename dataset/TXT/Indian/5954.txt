3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA The Skinny: the Nepalese/East Indian cuisine is very satisfying... not to mention great piping hot naan that is perfectly crispy on the bottom with a slight chew. Only sad thing is that they do not consistently have kheer which is my fav. (4) service: always pretty good - water glasses are filled consistently (4) value: for $11.99, the lunch buffet is a great value - good for groups due to the large dining room (4).

This is our new go-to Indian Buffet joint in town. Sporting a good variety of items, they offer both Nepalese/East Indian flavors. The dining room is spacious and is capable of serving large groups of people comfortably.

Service is usually pretty good and your water glass is never left unfilled.

My favorite items include the saag paneer, chana masala and the aloo gobi. So delicious and usually always there. Their raita is nice and thick. They do not have chutney available as a condiment however the tamarind sauce does okay in a pinch. The tandoori chicken is quite moist and tasty as well. The hubs is addicted to their butter chicken and daal.

Their naan is great - loved the crispy bottom with the slight chew. Order it with garlic at no extra cost. Awesome!

Their one weakness in my opinion are the desserts. They have a rather artificial, watery mango "custard". This is in rotation with the vermicelli payasam which I found to be a bit too sweet and one note. I kind of miss the kheer using rice pudding and cardamom.

Overall, these are minor issues to an great buffet. 4 starred review.
