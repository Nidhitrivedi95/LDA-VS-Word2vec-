jdylAP9AWIJVZ4O0T2YgIQ I just ordered $70 worth of food from here, if I could give this place zero stars I would. My orders of fried chicken wings and chicken and broccoli arrived by delivery with a pungent ROTTEN stench. After tasting the food, it was clear that the meat was completely rancid. I called the restaurant to let them know my food was very stale, however when I spoke to the manager he was adamant that the food was okay to eat and resisted having the delivery driver to come back to my house and give me a refund. Overall, save yourself the money and possible food poisoning along with the trip to the hospital. Hopefully this place gets shut down soon before somebody seriously falls ill. Absolutely disgusting.
