Or maybe it was just the item I bought. I got the weekend special which was the chicken masala. It was really good. Ordered it with just salad in order to be a little healthy.

Delicious. Best part- weekend special was $6.99 for a giant serving that turned into 2 portions for me. I am a big guy. So It is worth it if you want some quick Indian inspired meals.
