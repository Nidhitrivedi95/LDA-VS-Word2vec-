TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This restaurant, which is in an unattractive, sketchy part of town, has a "cheap" feel to it.  We were seated towards the front of the restaurant and found the seating and table to be average to low quality and we were close to other patrons.  The ambiance was not good.  The silverware and plates were average to low quality.  The food and service were unremarkable and forgettable (and we are avid fans of Indian food).  Relative to Origin India -- a place we've visited many times -- this place pales in comparison, in my and my wife's opinion.  Other than possibly saving a few bucks, it's a complete mystery to me why people have rated this place higher.
