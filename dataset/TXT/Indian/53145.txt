VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw I would not recommend this place. 1 star for food and 1 star for service. We were 5 people...when asked for nans, they gave 5 small pieces that too after 10 mins. The worst part was the check. It was lunch buffet they charged 18% gratitude. The total cost per head was $17 after tax and gratitude. Its not worth. The other highlight was gulab jamun, they were as hard as a marble. It took 2 minutes to chew it. 
I won't be coming back.
