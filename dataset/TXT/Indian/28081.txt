iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Desi Burrito was at the Indian festival down town a couple of months ago and I liked it there. They have an Indian and Mexican fusion concept that works out pretty good.

They have bowls and burritos that you choose which type of protein, rice, and spice level you want. I got a couple of burritos to go for my friend and I along with their masala fries and some veggie samosas. 

I like their food but it is definitely missing a wow factor that makes me want to return or crave the food. The food was good but nothing special. We got a chicken burrito and a lamb burrito with rice and we got the food spicy also. I did appreciate that the spicy was spicy. Perfect spice level! Their masala fries were good, but they were just fries that had masala seasoning on them.
The samosas were served with two dipping sauces and were delicious. 

The price was fair, food was good, and the service was not so enthusiastic. Wait time was okay. Overall I would come back but not anytime soon so they were just average in my opinion.
