qCTuGaciae73u7C57s2_0Q I ordered delivery from here tonight and thought it was really good.  I got the goat curry, tandoori platter and samosa. The tandoori platter had SO MUCH food for $14.95 which can easily feed two people. Hey maybe inside wasn't special but delivery sure was lol. I thought I got my money's worth and the food was pretty good.
