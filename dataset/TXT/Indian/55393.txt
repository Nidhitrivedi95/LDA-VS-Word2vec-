They didn't mind making food specially to my taste preference as I am sensitive to spicy food. Every time I've gone to Chand Palace I've been greeted by the same quality of delicious food and affordable prices. They even do takeout! Although they do not have an alcohol license, it is BYOB making an even more affordable option.
