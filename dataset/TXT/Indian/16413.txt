diXqpz9WOr4WLQq6uvARkg My family ( including a 2 year old toddler) came to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Our overall experience was fine- nothing super special. 
Service/ ambience- good
Food quality- fair
Price- $$$ (7 people and we paid $300)

Apps were better than dinner we ordered. We ordered veg and non-veg, meat dishes were apparently better tasting ( i am vegetarian). Dessert was a big disappointment though ( Falooda in a flat plate and we were given forks!!!). 

Lastly, neither men or women bathroom had a changing table and that's a big inconvenience as kids can be unpredictable. I would think twice before heading back to this place as this is a deal-breaker for us( people with kids might understand this better!).
