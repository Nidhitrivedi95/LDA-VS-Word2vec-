g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Fast, cheap, delicious!! I came here bc paradise valley burger across the street is closed on sundays and now im glad they were. I was hungry and wanted something fast, cheap and delicious and this place did it!! Friendly service, i asked what they recommend and the gent suggested a samosa chaat. By the time i came out of the bathroom my food was redy and it looked like a abstract painting. So many colors, textures and flavors, it really surprised me!! For $6 i walked out full and satisfied!! As for the pastries, they gave me a cpl cake samples and they were good, but nothing special, good flavor but jus seemed like regular american sponge cake. I will def be coming back to try some more food!!!
