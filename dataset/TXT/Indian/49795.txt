U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw Family owned and operated business.  The son is such a nice kid!  We always enjoy chatting with them.  The food is amazing.  We love Indian food and are pretty picky about it.  It is fast and pretty reasonably priced.  The food tastes fresh, and the chef is sometimes willing to do special orders for my picky husband.  I personally love the plain naan and the chicken curry.  They have a huge menu though, try everything!
