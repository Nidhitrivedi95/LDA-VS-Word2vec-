3S8nDh3gK2BmG-_HjDjh6w I recently ordered the vadas and Sambar to go along with a madras coffee. 
I fully expected the vadas to lose their crispiness on the outside and would have been ok with that, however, they placed 4 very small vadas in a styrofoam container that were soft on the outside and gooey on the inside. They seemed undercooked. 
The sambar was thick in consistency which is not that I was expecting - sambars are usually light and help cut into the oil that the accompanying food is cooked in. 
Lastly the madras coffee tasted ok as a latte but was definitely not a madras coffee. 
I don't think I will be returning here
