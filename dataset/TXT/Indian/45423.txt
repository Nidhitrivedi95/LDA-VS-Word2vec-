SaAtDmMKN_B5-8d-n5X86w The biryani here is really good (both chicken & lamb), definitely best in the north/north-central Phoenix area. 

Apart from the biryani I've tried the combo curry plates, served with 2 curries, rice and naan. The curries were all delicious & there is a good range of vegetarian, chicken, lamb & daal selections. Only downside was that the curries were drenched in oil, which would dissuade me from eating these too often. 

Overall the quality, quantity & price point make this a great value neighborhood joint, perfect for take out.
