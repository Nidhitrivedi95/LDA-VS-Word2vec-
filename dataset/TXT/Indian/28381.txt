J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ This past Friday I decided to have dinner at Little India for the first time around 6:30pm. My friend and I were seated upstairs since downstairs was completely full. 

I decided to order the $17.95 dinner special and my friend ordered just the saag paneer. The special comprised of chicken pakoras, something along the lines of a chicken kebob, butter chicken, eggplant, rice and naan and kheer (indian rice pudding). I also noticed there were a lot of awards on their walls.

Here is my review.

Food: The chicken kebabs were really good: moist, juicy and flavourful.

The chicken pakoras along with the eggplant were just average.

The item that they really failed on was their butter chicken, the sauce was way too sweet, I'm not sure if they are trying to cater towards their demographics but butter chicken should not be that sweet.

Also the naan bread was a miss, it was way over toasted and not soft enough.

Service: This is the area they really excel on, someone always came around on a regular basis to fill your water and the waiter was quite attentive but not interrupting. The service is really good overall, especially considering, the waiter upstairs was juggling 8-10 tables.

Overall, the food doesn't warrant all the accolades it gets on this site or the awards it has received but the service is definitely top notch.
