-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw An Indian friend of mine brought me here to purchase mixes for Indian desserts and I was so surprised by the variety of foods and grocery items this store offered. 
They had an array of spices, snacks and beauty items available. 
As for the prepared foods, they had over a dozen desserts made (I didn't get to try these,) but I did snack on chole bhattura (hot, fried bread with a side of tasty chickpeas,) and pani puri (puffed bread that you fill with cold chickpeas and potatoes and chutney.)
They also had Indian chai tea (not your typical Starbucks chai,) that was available for hot food patrons. 
Did I mention this place is vegetarian? I'm an avid meat eater, and this place had the most delicious vegetarian Indian food for a reasonable price. 
I will be heading back here very soon.
