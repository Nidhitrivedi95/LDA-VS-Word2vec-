1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g very nice Nepali food.. must try MOMO. usually people get confused with Nepali and Chinese food. though they are having similar dishes, it won't taste like Chinese food since it has some indian influence. i would highly recommend this place as Nepali food and not to compare with Indian or Chinese food. this is the most authentic Nepali food..owner is very humble, doesn't care much about money. I've seen him many times charging me less than what he supposed to  (may be because i eat there often).
