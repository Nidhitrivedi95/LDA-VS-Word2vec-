One eggplant dish was basically sweet, watery mush, inedible. The dinner buffet also had a very limited selection, and only two dishes for the lactose intolerant among us.

The patio is lovely for a relaxed dinner and the service was attentive and friendly. Also, the dishes are prepared fresh so I had mine made without cream which is a bonus.
