yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Pros: The Goanese chicken curry was good
Cons: everything else. We were the only customers when we got in around 8PM. It took them over an hour and three reminders to get us the food. We ordered some Momos, Nepalese chicken dumplings; they were so overcooked that it was an effort to tear it with our teeth. We had the Yelp 16 for 20 offer and the free fountain drink offer which they would not honor at the same time. It took them 15 minutes to simply get the check...

Recommendation: avoid like the plague unless you have hours and hours to spare.
