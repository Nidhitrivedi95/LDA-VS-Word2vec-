There is also a Sunday buffet that's delicious. I recently had a dinner party and had them cater the event. Again, their prices were amazing for naan, samosas, a large container of rice and large serving containers of 3 Indian dishes. It fed 20-25 people easily and everyone had such great things to say about the food. I would absolutely use Coriander again for a large event in the future. When setting up the catering order, the owner could tell that I had just come from work and offered me dinner that evening. It was overall such a great experience, great food, and I could not recommend them more. Just great! 5 stars easy.
