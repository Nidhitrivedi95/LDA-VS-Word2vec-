DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew It's really odd Feng Shui when you walk in - a long empty granite countertop strewn with beaded trinkets and no sign of a hostess, and a longish hallway reminiscent of a nouveau spa entrance from the 1990s. There doesn't appear to be a restaurant here. Welcome to Curry Leaf Flavors of India!

I might get flamed for this (do people even say that anymore?) but I feel pretty strongly about this: unless you're utterly desperate to have Indian food for dinner, avoid having dinner at an à la carte Indian restaurant. It's just a terrible value compared to the ubiquitous (and inexpensive) Indian lunch buffets available all over the world.

Curry Leaf is no exception. It's all à la carte, and the good stuff on the menu is $13-$15 a portion. The portion size is disappointingly small-to-medium. There are $7-$9 "side dishes" of things like baingan bharta (good but annoyingly small portion) and dal, and after you add in the naan ($4+) and biryani ($13) you're looking at least $30/person and you might still be hungry when you're done. There is no way that the parties of 8 that I saw dining got enough to eat. Ask for extra white rice and you will be dinged $3-$5 depending on how much more you want. That's pretty telltale.

The Paneer Tikka Masala ($15) was served lukewarm and it was a stingy portion, as was the side dish of baingan bharta ($7). A 22oz. Taj beer was $9. Again, *all the money* for a strip-mall Indian joint that would be impossible to find if it weren't' for Yelp.

Aside from the general bad value, dinner was pretty tasty, but it all came out *way* too fast to be entirely made-to-order. My guess is the curries are all pre-made the day before and added to the proteins you order. I'd bet a lunch buffet on it.

2 hours later, my stomach is growling from hunger. Not even kidding.
