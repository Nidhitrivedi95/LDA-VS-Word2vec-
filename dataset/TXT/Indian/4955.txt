2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Avani provides some of the most delicious Indian food I've ever tasted, if not the most delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered the samosa rolls as an entre, which were served with the perfect blend of tangy and sweet sauces. Presentation was gorgeous. 

We then moved on to a butter chicken starter, as well as the cauliflower starter (who's name I now forget..). My butter chicken was phenomenal, and came with perfectly cooked chicken (not too dry), smothered in a light, yet flavourful sauce. The naan I ordered was fluffy and delicious.

My only gripe is the price. While the portions are huge, I think it is unfortunate that they charge extra for the naan/rice that most people would see as a requirement when eating curry. The entire bill came to 46 dollars, which I think is a little exorbitant for 2 people. Regardless, the food was delicious, and I am almost positive I will return soon with my family.
