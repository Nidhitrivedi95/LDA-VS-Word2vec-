Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw If anything, come here for a decent buffet at a decent price. Coming here for dinner is like playing joining a pick-up dodgeball game. You're not going to have a good time. 

Once, I accidentally smeared a bit of poop under my nose. How that happened is irrelevant. But I hadn't realized this, and spent the whole day with a scrunched up face feeling pissy. Anyway, that's how all the waiters here look. They just don't seem to care about customer service at all. Missing one of your orders of rice? Oh, no, see, you just didn't realize that the one cup of rice you have is actually TWO orders, just on one plate. Want more water? How about being flat out ignored? I suppose maybe they're just deaf.
