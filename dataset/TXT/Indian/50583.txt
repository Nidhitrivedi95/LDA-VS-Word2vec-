UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I ordered take out from this place last week when I was stressed and feeling pretty stationary. I'd like to mention a caveat that I am rating this 5 star not because it's the best Indian restaurant I have tried, but because this is as good as it gets when it comes to Indian food in Toronto. I have been on the hunt for legitimate south indian food since I have moved here and this is the first time I've tasted anything close to it. I am so excited even writing about it and thinking of the smell of all of those spices. I ordered the Madras Goat and it was delicious. I'm so happy with this place I will definitely come back for more.

Also, their delivery system is so convenient. You can order online and set the time when you want them to show up (they even have lunch delivery, which is pretty freaking awesome).
