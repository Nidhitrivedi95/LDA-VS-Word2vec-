ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA It's pretty rare to find great buffet eats outside of Vegas. Seriously - buffets usually get sloppy, run over by hungry patrons. That's typically why I avoid them...they're usually not that appealing. However, Passage to India is a true exception to this rule of mine. 

The buffet is pretty banging. Not only is it (and the restaurant) quite clean and tidy, but you'll spy a nice selection of items. Fresh paneers, tikka masala, rice, two types of naan, fresh salads, and more. All of these items look to be frequently refreshed and judging by the full tables, this fab buffet is no secret. For just $7.50 per person (weekday) you can gorge on gorge Indian east. Some of my favorites included...

Tikka masala: Tender chunks of chicken swimming in a perfectly tomatoey sauce with a touch of cream

Cucumber, tomato and onion salad: Crisp and refreshing with bits of cilantro

Garlic naan: Hot and delightful. There's buttered naan if you prefer! 

And for those who prefer their food to go, Passage to India offers a pretty sweet deal: $3.99 for a vegetarian lunch box and $4.99 for a chicken lunch box. Those University area folks have it made here!
