grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg There is a lot of variety in curries at this restaurant. It is definitely a walk-in place, don't expect to sit down and eat here. 

I have the butter chicken and the chicken tikka masala, the meat Samosa and the veggie Samosa, and garlic naan.

I wouldn't recommend the samosas. They're 4 for $1 and they were on the spicy side but not very tasty and the pastry was dry and stiff.

The garlic naan was good at $2.25.

The chicken tikka masala didn't really taste like your prototype chicken tikka masala, the butter chicken was good and the chicken was very tender.

The serving is only enough for one person and maybe two if you don't eat alot.

They take credit card, debit and cash.

*They state that all the meat is halal including the Samosas.

There's always a long line inside but to be honest I don't think it's all that spectacular
