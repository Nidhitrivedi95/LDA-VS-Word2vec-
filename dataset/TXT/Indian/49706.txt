tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My boyfriend and I have eaten here for their buffet once and we loved it and ordered take out one other time. We ordered take out the other day and I noticed it did not come with rice so my boyfriend went in to let them know that they forgot to add the rice in the bag. The told him that they are now charging two dollars for rice so my boyfriend paid the two dollars, which I thought was ridiculous as they know by the fact that we questioned as to why there was not rice (indicating that we ordered there before and got rice for free with our meal). They should have given it to us for free this time as we did not know that it now costs two dollars. They didn't even ask us over the phone if we wanted rice with our meal for an extra two dollars. I don't care about the two dollars. It is just the principle of the matter. Would they rather us pay 10 dollars for a buffet or 30 dollars for takeout? Given that their food is EXCELLENT!, we will be back as it is the only Indian place in the East Valley that has the best food!
