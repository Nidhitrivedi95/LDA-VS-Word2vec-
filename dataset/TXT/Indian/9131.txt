82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Very good indian food!! 

If you like yours spicy...you know the kind that gives you a sweat mustache, you must ask them for VERY spicy. I asked for spicy and the heat level was minimal.
so, i ended up eating the entire cup of pickled carrots (also, not that spicy)

 i get the feeling that people dont eat crazy spicy here in Montreal. Im used to tabasco, sriracha, and chili peppers on everything from ramen to cereal so perhaps my perception of spicy is slightly off kilter.

Really good dishes to try? butter chicken, tandoori chicken, chicken jal farezi, and of course NAAN NAAN NAAN!!! Everything we ordered was very tasty though, samosas, some sausage looking apetizer, chick pea apetizer, rice with shrimp, lamb chops....
