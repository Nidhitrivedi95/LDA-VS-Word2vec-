JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ I'd say it's just alright.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about.  I expected more flavor, but our little bit of everything appetizer tasted all the same.  The curry was mediocre.  I had a bread thingy that was blown up with lentils (don't remember name) that was tasty.  For a vegetarian place, it was as expected.
