The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the expense of their dinner menu. A really great place welcoming atmosphere and flavors that will rival any of the other Indian / Thai places in town. I don't know what more there is to say go there have it experience it love it. Highlights: mango ice cream, coconut soup, cheese/yogurt ball things I don't remember the name of, rice to die for.
