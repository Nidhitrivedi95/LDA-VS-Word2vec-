tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This place does no wrong in my eyes.  On a sliding scale of quality versus value, it hits the mark right on target.  Whether it be the lunch or dinner buffet, India Oven has NEVER disappointed.  It appears to be family owned and operated and I have always felt very welcome and comfortable here.  They are very attentive and aim to please.  The naan... it comes with the perfect amount garlic and seasoning and is absolutely scrumptious!  The Tandoori chicken they bring to the table is also not to be missed!  The balance of veg and non veg offerings is also perfect, and the Mango Lassi makes a perfect sipping dessert.  This has become my go to when I crave Indian, and since discovering this place, I can't recall the last time I was at Copper Kettle.  The lunch buffet is $8.95, dinner $10.95.
