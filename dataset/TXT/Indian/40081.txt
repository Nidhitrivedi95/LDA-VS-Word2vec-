pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I've been to the buffet many times, as it's one of my dad's favorite places so we go each time he comes to town.  

The food at the Taj is tasty, but it's extremely unhealthy ~ often swimming in butter/grease.  Not only that, but the spiciness of the dishes is often inconsistent from visit to visit.  I assume this has to do with different cooks on different days.  

That said, the variety on the buffet is great and recently we have seen some new and interesting vegetable dishes added to the mix.  I would absolutely love to see samosa on the buffet more often.  It's rare and they're small, but it's like Christmas for my mouth when I see them. 

Because of the greasiness and inconsistency, I don't really order off the menu, as I assume it would be much of the same and more expensive.  I got the vegetarian thali platter once and it was OK, but I could tell they took items from the buffet and put them on my plate.

If I had one wish, I would love to see the food at the Taj become a healthier.
