J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Made the long trek by foot to get there and it was Well worth it. Although the place was packed it was worth the small wait. The staff was courteous and we were never low on water in our glasses. The chicken tikka masala was delicious as is the naan. We ordered another chicken dish but the name is escaping me at the moment. Nonetheless, it also was delicious. Took a but to get our bill but we were in no hurry. Other entrees going out to other patrons looked incredible. So glad we dined there.
