-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg The restaurant food is alright. However the staff is quite rude.(specially the bald guy with beard)

He comes in for taking the order ...we told that we were not ready and if he cud cme in a few minutes. 
When we were ready to give the order...he told us bluntly to wait and cant come again and again...he wasnt doing anything at that time either...
(We were the first ones on sunday to cme to the restaurant and there werent any other guests at that time).
He was also shouting at his staff all the time...

Our experience at the restaurant turned sour because of the staff behavior...
