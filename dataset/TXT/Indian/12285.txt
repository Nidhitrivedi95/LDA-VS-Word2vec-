auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I loved this place so much, and not just because the food was great--it was the service and recommendations we received from the staff (one of whom I was pretty sure was the owner) were enough to give 5 stars. I had ordered a restaurant.com coupon back in March for this place and forgot about it, so when one of my friends was in town and we were craving Indian food, we of course had to stop. I ordered Mango Curry Chicken and my friend had Lamb Jalfrezi, and of course we added naan and rice to our order. The rice was a recommendation of the server's--one I had never had with peas, white raisins, and nuts. It was quite good, and went well with what we ordered, but I am going to stick to rice without all the extras next time. It was pricey to have that much extra stuff in it when I just want some straight up plain rice.

The Mango Chicken was pretty much sweetened Butter Chicken, but it was delicious. The lamb was a little tough for my liking, but luckily that wasn't my dish! ha ha, sucks to be my friend. But it was minty and delicious and had a nice flavor but was a workout for the teeth.

We went a little overboard our $25 restaurant.com coupon and ended up spending another $25 apiece. That's the danger in those things--you think you're not going to be above the limit and then there you are, paying for stuff you didn't really need ($8 beer, that I will say was good, just not perhaps something I needed to complete the meal). 

I will definitely be back--I want to try their buffet as well as their lunch. It was a good dining experience overall, with minor details not upsetting my 5-star experience.
