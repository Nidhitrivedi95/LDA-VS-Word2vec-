NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg To be honest, not the best I have every had.  Choolaah has very interesting design choices but the food lacks in the wow factor that is Indian food.   It's sub par at best.  Was really looking forward to real Indian BBQ but sadly it turns out to be another bi-product of lack luster Americanized ethnic food.  Portions are incredibly small, I could feed a small chihuahua (yes, I know they are small already) and it too would be hungry after eating there.  Prices are really high for what quality you get,  I get the idea of a Chipotle/ cafeteria style place but the place falls really short of that expectation.

Would I recommend to others...eh but say check it out and make your own decision.
