TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I stopped today to try the lunch buffet.  What a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow Yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decision.

The restaurant was almost empty when I arrived at 12:30.  Service was excellent and I know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there.

While I was looking the buffet over, the waiter brought me an iced tea as requested.  Shortly after returning to the table, another server brought me a basket of fresh naan.

Here's what I tried:

Vegetable pakora - good but not a lot of spice
goat curry - nice spice and very tasty
saag paneer with cheese - flavorful with a nice zing
basmati rice - standard
naan - plain and good
chana masala - excellent with a nice spiciness
bhindi masala - this was noted as a house favorite.  I didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor
navratan lorna - good
karahi lamb - nice flavor and good spice
chicken tikka masala - excellent
ras malai - excellent sweet to end this feast

Lest you worry that I cleaned the place out, let me assure you I didn't.  I took small portions of all these things just to try them.  Since I was alone, I had a great time watching the Bollywood Bang-Bang music videos on their TV screens.  

I'm anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that don't show on the buffet.
