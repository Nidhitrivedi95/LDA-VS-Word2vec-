vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw Everyone in my family loves Indian food and we all think this is by far the best we've had in Toronto. We were there quite a few times and each time we would eat so much that we could barely move afterwards (for 3 people we usually order 3 appetizers and 4 main dishes as well as additional rice and naan, the portions are big but we just can't get enough of the food here! We''re all tiny people but we always finish everything.)
