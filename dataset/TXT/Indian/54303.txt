Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A Jaipur junction is one of those small but authentic Indian restaurants that might not be the best taste if you are looking for something that is modified for american palate. The food here is awesome because it is prepared in traditional Indian style. The amount of spices is adequate and mostly faithful to the regional cuisine. I ordered the thali, which was very filling. 
Most of the menu items are a little expensive for Indian restaurants and also because the interior of this place is not so good. I think this place needs some help in terms of interior and service. It is my personal bias against most Indian restaurants that they try to save money on these things. May be they don't care but many people do. I will like to see the same quality of food in a nicer place to sit and enjoy with a server who knows  English and communicate well with the customers. 
Location is nice and there is plenty of parking around this place.
