wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw This food was PHENOMENAL. I live in New York, among a plethora of Indian food, and this was by far the best I've ever had. Only open in this location for 6 months, this restaurant has a cozy, family-style atmosphere that makes the food even more enjoyable. The owner, Gil, is extremely amicable and loves to make conversation. He makes you feel right at home! I highly recommend the Chicken Saag and the Bhindi Masala. If you're in town, definitely try this place out!!
