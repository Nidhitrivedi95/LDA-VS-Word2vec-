ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ Lunch buffet really hit the spot. Nice amount of vegan options including my new favorite Navaratan korma. 555 chicken was perfectly spicy. Tandoor chicken had a beautiful spice blend. Only knock was that the chicken tiki masala was dry / over cooked. I will be back again for sure.
