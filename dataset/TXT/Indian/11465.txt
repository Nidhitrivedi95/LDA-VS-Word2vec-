AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw We must have seen this restaurant on a random trip a few months back, and remembered it on our way to the Ossington Strip.
Walked in - it was a bit cold, but they made a big effort to make it warm in the restaurant.
As vegetarians, we ordered:
Veggie noodle soup - Was pretty amazing, and a full portion
Veggie Steamed buns - tasty and made on the premise
Navratam makhni - normally I really dislike sweet indian meals, but this was pretty amazing..

Yes - I will be back
