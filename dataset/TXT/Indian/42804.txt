RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg This really is excellent Indian food and their drink list is the standard fare kind of drinks but with an Indian twist. So don't expect their Mohito to be your traditional Mohito. They spice it up Indian style and it's awesome. The last time I was there as a group of six we asked the waiter just to bring us some food. He was a little surprised and we said that we trusted his judgment and he could surprise us. Unfortunately neither he or the chef were all that creative and what we ended up with was standard fare items from the menu that we probably would've chosen ourselves. We hoped he'd be a little bit more exotic
