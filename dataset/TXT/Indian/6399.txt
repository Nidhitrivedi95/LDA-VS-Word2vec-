3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Was At Curry Twist about two weeks ago. The food was very good. Its a small location and the majorty of tables are at the back but its nicely decorated. Not too chinzy like some places tend to be. 
the server was very nice. I asked for a special order and they were happy to make it for me. The food did take a little time but that could have been because of my special order so I cant complain about that.  It was delicious though. I will say that when we first sat down they  gave us poppadums but no chutney to  eat with it-so they were a little dry. I think its their way to make a few dollars by having you buy the chutney. Rice does not come with your meal either. The price was a little deep i thought for not havng those extras ($35 , no drinks) but truth is I would go back because it was good !!
