XcgLpUOMkK2PoaUmieHR6A I wanted to like this place, i really did.  i had been looking forward to trying it for a while now since i love indian food and this place would be close to get to.  Unfortunately it was an overall disappointment. The Butter Lamb was a nice twist but nothing special and there was a LOT more sauce than meat in the take out container.  The Vegetable Pakoras were good, nice and crispy with a good mix of vegetables to batter and not greasy at all but.... they managed to omit the tamarind chutney from my order sadly.  Worst of all was that the naan was still half raw, might try cooking the other half and see if it ends up edible but... not holding my breath.
Won't be back and hunt for a go-to indian place continues.
