7NurnM6G9b_2jTEKpIkQpg This place is amazing. My only complaint is there are no labels so I am slow to order and likely annoying people. haha. The more I go, the more I remember the look of each dish. Love the curry chicken and mutton, the chicken biryani and, rotis and samosas do not disappoint. I love how spicy it is, instead of being some westernized  place that gives up on authentic flavours to get more business. My only question - does anyone know what that spicy pineapple chutney is? I got a small side of it with our last order and it is amazing. I would love to know what it's called or the recipe for it. I know they must pickle it in some spices - but obviously I don't know which ones or the exact recipe. Any help is appreciated!! Or tell me where I can buy it!!
