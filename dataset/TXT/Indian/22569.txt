gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I was pleased to know that this restaurant is vegetarian and vegan in some regards, but sad to say that I've had better Indian in other places in Gilbert, Chandler and Scottsdale. The portions were generous for the sample platter, and a variety of flavors were offered in metal containers, along with rice, plain naan bread and a drink which was nice, and for about $13. On a more positive note, the garlic naan I ordered separately was probably the best thing I had there. I enjoyed trying this place, but it didn't measure up like I was hoping in the gustatory department.
