llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g We have been eating at India Palace for about 12 years. They have fantastic food and we haven't found any other Indian restaurant that even comes close. They are open every day and offer an excellent lunch buffet as well. The staff is always friendly. Try the Chicken Tikka and Paneer Masala along with some garlic Naan.
