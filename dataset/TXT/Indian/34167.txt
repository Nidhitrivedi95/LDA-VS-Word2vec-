The buffet here is really good and well worth the 9.99 price. Loved the chickpeas, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, & fish pakoras. 

The customer service was okay, nothing outstanding. 

The interior is decent, however the flooring needs to be updated - the rug was giving me & another guest in our group allergies, this was the only real downside to our visit.

However, will come back again for more of the good food in the future!
