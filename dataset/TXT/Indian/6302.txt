I thought it was a good price for the quality and selection. I thought the Curry Chicken and Butter Chicken could have used a deeper flavor, but all of it was pretty tasty. The Chicken Tandoori was pretty dried out so that would be the only dish I recommend skipping.  The Garlic naan was made fresh whenever you ran out and was very good.

If you are vegetarian the buffet gets even better for you. They had a number of choices that were flavorful. Paleek Paneer is a personal favorite.
