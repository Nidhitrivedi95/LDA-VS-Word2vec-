eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Great spot for takeout lunch.  

Generally, I'm not wild on buffet, but if you're eating in, this is one not to miss.  Great flavours, always fresh, and attentive service.  The price is right, and I always leave satisfied.

Additionally, I'd be hard pressed to say I missed the meat.  It's a strictly vegetarian joint, serving totally satisfying foods.

A great desert selection is a fine way to end the meal.  Try the carrot pudding!

I won't speak to the authenticity of this place... I'm 100% Canadian, with no cultural diversity to my credit.  I just know when I enjoy a good meal, and I know I always enjoy one here.  Kudos.

Highlights:

Carrot Pudding

Aloo Bhaji (curried cauliflower and potato)

Samosa

GREAT Naan (prepared hot and fresh to order)
