B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg I have only eaten at Dhaba for lunch and always as take out. We place a large order, ahead of time, via phone and the service is always great! The order is always ready on time and 100% accurate. I give Dhaba a 5 star rating for superior service and quality food. Staff are super friendly!
