x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA Just don't go there! Chand Palace is 20000 better and the service much better. Somebody ordered something grilled. The whole place was full of smoke!!! We couldn't breathe and we were all coughing, no apologies from management. Nobody opened the windows! I know good  Indian Food and this place is just as commercial as any Tendoori....
