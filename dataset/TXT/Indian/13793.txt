BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ Popped in here for dinner the other night. We ordered the non-veggie combo dinner for two which was just over $40. There was a lot of food for the money, but I wasn't wowed by any dish. The best thing was the lamb curry though to be honest, the lamb tasted a lot like stewing beef. The service was mediocre. All in all, it wasn't a bad meal, but it did sit like a rock in my stomach for the rest of the night. As a side note, you can't use a groupon if you by a two for one dinner special, so if you are planning to cash your groupon, best order accordingly.
