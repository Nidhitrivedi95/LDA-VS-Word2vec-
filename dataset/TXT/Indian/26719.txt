iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA My wife and I flipped a coin between Salty Sow (I've been there before and love it) and Marigold (a place I haven't been).

As soon as we walked up, there was no host to greet us. We wait a minute and a host seats us on the patio. Including us, there are 3 other parties on the patio: my family, a group of four, and another group of four.

The waiter was ignoring us while the other two parties had drinks and appetizers brought to their table. As we're sitting there waiting for service, I see this guy dressed in black hurry into the restaurant (the patio is next to the entrance). A few minutes later, he comes out introduces himself as our waiter. 

I'm guessing that our original waiter knew that he gave us horrible service and shuffled us off to the second waiter.

After we ate, we had to wait another 10 minutes for the bill. There was no offer for dessert or post-dinner drinks.

I will say that the food is good. My lamb chops were actually really good. Just keep an expectation for weak customer service.
