CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ Amazing food, great service, cheap prices! Went there for dinner with two friends (one of them an Indian who grew up in Bombay) and had the thali. Authentic Indian taste, efficient and kind wait staff (our server was a pearl and she made a point of saying "You're welcome" each time we said "Thank you"), and extremely reasonable on the pocketbook: the total bill for the three of us including tax came to less than $50! I especially appreciated the fact that the food wasn't overly salty or greasy, as is often the case in Indian restaurants. The place isn't fancy (it feels more like a fast food joint than a family restaurant with cheap looking furniture and crowded seating), but it is clean with well executed food, and definitely worthy of five stars here. To sum it up: what all vegetarian Indian restaurants should aspire to be!
