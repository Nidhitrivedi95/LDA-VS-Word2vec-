wowGDYsOpR_mIMMFDL-qhg This is a delivery only food service. No dine-in.

I've been traveling from Boston to Toronto over the past several months. I missed eating home cooked veggie Indian food. I didn't have a car so this was perfect for me. Just call Vatica and freshly prepared food is delivered to your door-step.

I ordered dinner from Vatica 2-3 times a week. Mostly got the veggie thali (combo platter) which has chapati's (indian bread), 2 vegetable dishes, 2 soups (1 lentil, 1 kadi or rajma), 1 dessert, rice and pickle. The flavors are a combination of West (Gujrati) and North Indian. Although they have South Indian as well. The Veggie Thali menu items change daily. Call them to ask whats good today.

The price is quite affordable.
