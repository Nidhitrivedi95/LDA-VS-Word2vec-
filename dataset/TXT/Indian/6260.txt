Service: Attentive and kind. 

Ambience: White table cloths, red cloth napkins, stemmed glasses, uniformed wait staff, subtle Indian music, and clean. 

Food: Great!!!! Sooo flavorful hot and fresh! Right when you walk in the door you are hit with the most wonderful, herbaceous, warm smell which reflected the food to a T. What a treat. Fresh warm garlic nann made and brought to the table. Every single item (which is plentiful) on the buffet was absolutely delicious and had its own flavor. 

Price: Cheap/moderate $25 with tax for two lunch buffets. 

Would recommend!
