Jq60uSolPAPJKXulKzyP4Q Brar is a great place to go if you're with a large group of friends who all want to gorge themselves on obscene amounts of Indian buffet. It's completely vegetarian and there are literally hundreds of food choices to make. Watch out for the breaded cheese balls as they'll quickly fill you up - they are super addictive. You can easily go back six, seven times to fill up your plate with entirely different items. And that's before you've even glanced at dessert.

Whoa.
