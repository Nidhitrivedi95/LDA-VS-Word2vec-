DrdhxvpwlZGhwF5vTR_QnA A great neighbourhood Indian place with good service and reliable food, all at reasonable prices. You probably won't find it in any resto guide but it boasts a devoted clientele. Tandoori chicken and aloo ghobi are great. Their take on chana masala is more tomatoey than u might be used to but quite good.
Spices are fairly reasonable but they can accommodate u if u want to blast out your sinuses.
Naan is fluffy but firm enough to mop up with. A solid standby when u want uncomplicated Indian food.
