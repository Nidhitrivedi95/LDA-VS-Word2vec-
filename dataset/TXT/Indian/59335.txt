z1RP-_vmj00EunHu9YA4-Q The Prince Balti is out the way for me but it's worth the drive. The food and staff are great and it's a reasonably priced night out if you want to sit it.
They do deliver and once they've got your address you will always get a Christmas card. Their nan breads are huge, so take care.
