TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA Stopped in for dinner the night before our visit to the University of Pittsburgh with one of my kids.  We were quite hungry and ordered both appetizers and main course.  In summary, this was really very good Indian food, definitely exceeded our expectations for Pittsburgh.

Appetizers were Samosas and chicken with Manchurian sauce.  The samosas were tasty, well cooked and served with a very nice plum  sauce.  The chicken dish was delicious!  Coated, fried chicken pieces topped with a fantastically hot and spicy sauce.  Highly recommended and we would order again.

Main course was chicken tikka masala, mutter paneer and shrimp korma.  The best of the three was the mutter paneer, peas and paneer in a creamy sauce.  Next best, the chicken masala had a great sauce, but the chicken was a little overcooked and a tad tough.  Bringing up the rear was the shrimp dish, again sauce was good but the shrimp got lost in the dish. 

We also ordered the bread basket, a mix of different types of Naan and Roti.  Greta deal, and the bread was delicious,

Will we come back?  Without a doubt.
