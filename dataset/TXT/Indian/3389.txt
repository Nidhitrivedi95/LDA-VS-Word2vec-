0NDbUCHi9YsRwgG3iZO8Kg Very, very tasty Chicken Tikka Masala.   My husband and I shared it, along with the good Roti and oh-so-light saffron rice.  We also split a chai.  We both raved over the dish and the chai was perfect.  

   Despite other reviews, this place was almost packed.  Maybe because it was Holi?

  My only complaint would be that our initial service was kind of odd.  We were seated and then kind of ignored, but their redeeming quality is that once we did order, we received our food within 10 minutes.  

   This was a refreshing culinary experience and was well worth the money.
