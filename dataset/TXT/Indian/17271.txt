DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Pretty sure this is "Indian" food not done by Indian people. It took a while for someone to seat me, because no one was working the front area despite there being next to no people in the restaurant. The music they played was loud, vulgar club music, though they switched to Indian music for a little while when a father and his young son came in. Then they switched back when they left.

The food was mediocre. The paneer tikka was about 50% overpriced (I initially misread the menu and thought it was $10 when I ordered, which would've been a more reasonable price point); four pieces of tikka with some out-of-place veggies accompanying it (broccoli, carrots, cherry tomatoes). The flavor of the sauce was too sweet, not complex or sophisticated, and underspiced, though the latter is a general trend in Indian restaurants not overwhelmingly patronized by people who really know the food.

They focus a lot on their alcohol, and it feels like a place for Americans to come and have a few drinks and eat something somewhat resembling real Indian food, like a non-chain "Indian" version of P.F. Chang. No thanks.

I reserve 1 star for the insultingly bad--stuff that makes me sick, or service that offends me, etc. This doesn't sink to that level. But I was deeply, deeply disappointed and given that there are other, better Indian options fairly close by, I can't imagine ever returning to this one.

EDIT: the same person who has responded to other negative reviews messaged me that I "should've known that paneer is flavorless", a rather odd response given that my critique was of the sauce, not the paneer itself. The paneer was fine. The sauce was not. It wasn't a matter of it being flavorless, it was a matter of it being too sweet, and not complex. It's no wonder their operations are not good, they don't even understand customer feedback.
