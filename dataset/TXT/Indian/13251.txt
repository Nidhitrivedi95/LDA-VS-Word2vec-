BA13Ogw1hQV8hx376j-B-w At Hakka places I tend to order only two
Dishes: Singapore noodles and shrimp fried rice; the shrimp fried rice was just so-so and will not order again; the Singapore noodles was good; got alot of food but shrimps were lacking; 

The location will be a struggle as a few restaurants have been thru that space, but if they get a big sign by the road they might get noticed;
