GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I am not a review writer ever. Until now. I have been a foodie my whole life and certain thing like quality, simplicity and authenticity are all keys to great food. Curry Corner has truly stuck by tradition and has done an amazing job showing the people in this state what good middle eastern food is. If you don't like the food here you most likely don't have the knowledge or pallet to enjoy this type of food. With the exception of mostly American produced ingredients everything is authentic. Choose one or all of the dishes. You can't go wrong.
