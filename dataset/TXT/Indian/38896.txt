OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We made a reservation for 5 on a Sunday. There was one other table besides our table of four and it was only two people. They couldn't manage to get all our food out at the same time and it left a lot to be desired. I got the bottomless butter chicken...thank goodness it's bottomless because I think there was about 4 pieces of chicken in the entire bowl. Food is average, service is way below average. There are much better Indian places in Las Vegas.
