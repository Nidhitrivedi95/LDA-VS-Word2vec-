EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Not a classy place but price is surely classy. They have limited veg option. We ordered veg biryani... There was no veg item in it...n quantity was not filling.
They did not offer water. When asked they said they dont give water, bottled water was there to buy. They also missed our order of french fries (it never came, got refund as their gas got over).

One star: Only good thing is location (its near strip east end) n open time till 2am.

Dont take free yelp tea (its average quality).
