nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ Ordered take out here on a Sunday night and it wasn't ready when we picked it up but for good reason.  We had ordered tandoori chicken and they were making a fresh chicken for us instead of scooping it out of the buffet.  Sure enough when we got it the chicken was burning hot, blackened on the tips, uber fresh.  

The accompanying curries were all excellent, chicken was tender and moist and not crazy spicy.  Naan was chewy and pillowy.  

It's a bit confusing when you walk in because there's a sweets counter to get take out from but the food doesn't come from there.  Just wrangle your way to the person at cash and tell them you ordered ahead of time.
