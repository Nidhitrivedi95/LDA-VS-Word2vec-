rnEsf4rD5a_BuaJysOezCQ I never liked this place. The only reason I go there is because they make egg-less cake and my wife does not eat eggs. I went there today with my wife and little kid. After more than an hour of placing my order I checked with them about why I still did not receive anything, only to realize that they took my order and billed me and left it at that. Never went about preparing the stuff I ordered. It was not even crowded. When I said If they have not started on it yet, I would like to cancel they did not even care.

They did not even offer an apology for making me wait for more than an hour for nothing and wasting my Sunday evening. I shout have gone to Rajbhog where I have lot better experiences than this place.
