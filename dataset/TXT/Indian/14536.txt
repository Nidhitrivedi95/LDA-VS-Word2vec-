c65l1HepL-5Zqh_2fJ7ezw I've heard great reviews about this place and was super excited to order from them. 

I ended up waiting a total of 2.5 hours before my food arrived on delivery (by this time it was already 9:30pm). It is absolutely ridiculous to be waiting 2.5 hours for food, and when I contacted customer service to check where the driver was, the restaurant owner lied about contacting me to let me know that he had called to tell me the order was going to be late, he did not! This is poor customer service on the restaurant/owner, if he could not fulfill the order in time he should have warned the customer/suggest a cancellation or be HONEST about the delivery time, and also not blaming it on traffic when he is only a 20 minute drive from my house. 

On to the food, I had ordered $27 (with tax) worth of food - butter chicken roti, chicken biryani and veg pakora, the positive: food arrived hot. The negative: food was tasteless and bland and nothing special, just big chunks of chicken breast and potatoes. I will never order from this restaurant again! Better to go elsewhere if you're craving for authentic Indian dishes.
