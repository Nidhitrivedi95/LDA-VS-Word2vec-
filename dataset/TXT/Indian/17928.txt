ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ Went on a Sunday afternon.  The good:  the doshas are huge and good.  The bad, they don't have a thali platter except for take out!  They told it's because they have a luncheon buffet.  It was pretty good (hubby has this) I had the coriander masala dosa.  Anyhow, they cooked fresh poori's and had mini dosas at the buffet.  I think anything on the menu is there at the buffet so it's worth it if you want to try a bit of everything (lemon rice, curd, sambar etc)  
Hubby was the only white guy in the place ...we took this as a good sign! :)
