llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Average Indian lunch buffet. We went on a Saturday , and there were fair number of choices, but many of them were not Vegetarian, or were not classic dishes and just seemed like something they threw together with the leftover ingredients they had from throughout the week. Dessert options weren't exceptionally tasty either, though not bad. Didn't seem like the flavors were that developed, and they used heavy-handed spice to make up for it (and we like spice).
