5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ I use to go here all the time since my family likes it. We were their very first customers too and they were very kind [the husband] who treated us with lassi and everything. Now whenever I go in to get food it's one excuse or another. I told his wife I'm a regular and she's like oh I don't know you. And I said is there some type of discount since I buy a good amount of food to feed the fam and she's like yeah check in to Yelp so I did and then she's like okay I'll give it next time I was like wtf ?! And then next time I come in she's like oh we don't hand it out after 1 pm. (Her words) I'm like are you serious????? I don't like going here just because of her she's very sly and as a previous business owner I don't recommend being shady to someone that's been a regular at your restaurant since the day you opened and was your first customer. Overall I don't come here anymore because she is very shady and she lies about her offers promotions and she claims she's Indian but I don't believe she is as for the food it's average. I'm Indian and I've ate better Indian food in Vegas. The food they hand out isn't prepared fresh and the taste/favors are not consistent however if you're a college student and want cheap Indian food then it's the place for you.
