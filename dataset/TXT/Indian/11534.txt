ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ I want to give Madras Masala four stars but I can't. After many visits to Madras Masala, I have to admit that their dosas are good but they are not outstanding. 

We ordered the veggie cutlets and medhu vada as appetizers and paper masala dosa as mains. The veggie cutlets were filled with spiced potatoes breaded and fried to a crisp and paired well with the mint and tamarind chutneys. The cutlets were a nicely-sized portion and were easily shared between two people. Yummy!

The medhu vada (fried savoury lentil "donuts" aka vada served with sambhar and coconut chutney) was only OK. The vada were not crispy and both the sambhar and coconut chutney lacked flavour. Disappointed!

The paper masala dosa was beautifully large and perfectly crispy. The crepe aka the dosa was not very warm by the time it reached our table. The potato filling aka the masala was good. The coconut chutney was bland, maybe even stale. The sambhar was too mild. Overall, the star and saving grace was the tomato chutney which gave the savoury dish a slightly sweet tartness. 

Overall, I will be back because there are many other dishes to try!
