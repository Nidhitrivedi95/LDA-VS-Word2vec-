gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw This is the 2nd time we have been here.  The Super Gyro is the bomb!  Not your run of the mill frozen pressed meat.  This has some substance.  They grill the meat with onion, peppers, and tomato.  Served on a grilled pita with lettuce and fantastic feta.  Priced right.  Don't let the neighborhood throw you off.  Just east of Fremont St. Experience.  I mean this is one good gyro!!!
