UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Bah. Good food. Horrible service. That about sums this place up. Went on a Saturday night and we were seated in the non-LLBO section. Was too impatient to wait to get inside. No complaints about that.

But man after we sat down we waited like 20 minutes just to get our order taken. And then it took FOREVER to actually get the food. And it came piecemeal. Annoying. 

We found out at the end that there was a button next to the table we were supposed to press if we wanted them to come over. Completely non-obvious to newbs. 

The food was good, but not mind-blowingly good. I suppose I would go back if it wasn't a long wait with extremely non-judiciious use of the table button.
