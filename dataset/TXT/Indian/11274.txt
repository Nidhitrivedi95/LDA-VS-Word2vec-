aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q I don't know what people are raving about. I'm from NYC and while Mexican food isn't our claim to fame, we can still get much better burritos than this. I'm not even sure what's served qualifies as a burrito. 

I had the lamb satay burrito and my wife had the ground beef burrito. Neither had rice, beans, sour cream, guacamole, cheese, salsa fresca or salsa verde. It's also open on one end so basically what's called a burrito is more like a gyro using a tortilla instead of a pita.

Should I hold any of that total un-burrito like stuff against them? I'm willing to overlook all that if it tastes amazing. Neither did. The taste was basically average. Inoffensive is the best way to describe the flavor. Like I said, I have no idea what people are raving about. This is basically a 3 star quick wrap place, but a 1 star burrito place so I split the difference.
