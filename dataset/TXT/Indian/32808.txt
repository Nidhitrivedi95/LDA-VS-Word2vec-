LIjlU7K-0SPXPtYFQiXamQ I was going to get McDonald's. That should put you in my head alright. I was in a mood for what I knew. Giant diet cola, double big mac, fries coming out my ears. But Kent P said that there were sloppy joes made of Indian food. I was torn, stick with something old that works or try something new.

Man alive, Magic Oven is the new old. There's something very comforting and nostalgic about the sloppy joe. Just a regular old hamburger bun with some awesome sauce in there. But Magic Oven blew my mind with how well put together (and delicious) everything was. The curry is fantastic and the chicken slices moist and succulent. He even tossed on a chili pepper for me to give it some extra kick. And what's even more amazing is that it held together okay. Is Tony one of those awesome Indian guys with a PhD in engineering who is applying his skills to making indestructible sandwiches? Hopefully not, that's kind of depressing, but the meal was really good. The sandwich and a whole other meal of samosas (3 for $3) came to a grand total of $8. $8 for a lunch that actually would have put me to sleep at my desk if I didn't use a standup desk (like Hemingway and Churchill - essentially it's an invitation to be a drunk). 

All in all a huge find for Kent P and easily one of my top new restaurants around.

Note: the tables are all along the sidewalk so it's a bit crammed. Food to go is a better way to do it, although there's nowhere to sit within walking distance that isn't crowded with drunks or punk ass kids, so it's imperfect when it comes to location.
