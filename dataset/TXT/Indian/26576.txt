ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I have been here 3 times and I have been underwhelmed each time.  The food is good, but just doesn't stand out.  I love the concept of the restaurant, but the "modern" dishes need to still have more Indian flare, as this claims to be an Indian restaurant.  If you are really looking for Indian food, stick to the traditional meals or you will be disappointed.  The traditional meals are fine, but I also don't want to pay that much for something I could get much cheaper at Maharani or another great Indian restaurant in Charlotte.

The location is beautiful, but the service is lacking.  It is a small place and service should not be that difficult to get right.  The last time I went was with my wife, sister and brother-in-law.  The dishes were brought out at different times, given to the wrong people, etc.  After the appetizers were cleared, the "busser" took my used fork off my plate and put it back down on the tablecloth - kinda tacky for a seemingly nice restaurant.

Before our dinner, we sat at the bar.  My wife was pregnant and she ordered a mock-tail.  The bartender was great about making something up.  After making the first drink, she realized she had some mint and made another.  It was nice seeing a bartender go out of her way to make my wife feel like she is getting a special drink, even when she can't drink alcohol.  She did not charge us for the second drink, but she definitely got a great tip.

I am giving this 3 stars because I can't bring myself to giving it 4 stars, but is should be about a 3.5.  I do recommend trying this place, but do not expect an Indian focused dish if you order from the modern menu.
