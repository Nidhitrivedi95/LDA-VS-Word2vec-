V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg I went here about two weeks ago, because the line up at the glow press and the burriito place didn't entice me.

I had:

Two Kathi Rolls. One with chicken and one with lamb.

THe lamb was the best, hands down.

THe only qualms were that I thought it was way too expensive.

Its just a small chapati with like a tablespoon or two of curry, a few diced pieces of onion and some letture. Is that really worth two for ten? Should be more like two for five..

The rose-lemonade was really good. Im guessing the made it the same way I always did growing up...Rooh Afzah syrup with lemon. Its the best. Like legit. My favourite thing that's come from pakistan.

I might come back, but its expensive.

Whats with the city and all this expensive indian food?

Indian food is supposed to be cheap and yummy.

.end rant.
