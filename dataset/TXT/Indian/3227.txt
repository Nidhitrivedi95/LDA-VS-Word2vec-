We were in the area and looking for a snack and had the Padpi Chaat, Dahi Vada (lentil balls in yogurt sauce) and the Gobi Paratha (bread with cauliflower). The spice level was just as requested. We're looking forward to getting back and trying more (the dosas looked fantastic). The menu includes many Indian dishes you don't see at other restaurants. Our only minor criticism was we wish the Padpi Chaat had more potatoes and less of the crunchy crackers.

You order at a counter and they bring your food to a table. The staff was quite friendly and checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying everything. Very reasonably priced - especially considering the portion sizes. They also have beer and wine.
