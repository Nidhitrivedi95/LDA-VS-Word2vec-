llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg We went here for the lunch time buffet.  The buffet tables are set up in the back of the dining area in such a way that the line queues up pretty quickly yet moves very slowly.  Some of the dishes are harder to reach in the back left corner.  The food itself is ok, the one stand out dish was the Manchurian cauliflower.  The staff demeanor is about the same as any of the other Indian restaurants around Madison, not particularly friendly, but not downright rude either.

I like the decor, dark red, black, and gold colors, and lots of wine bottles up behind the register.  The day we were there they were having technical difficulties with their debit machine and were asking everyone to pay by check or cash.  

I think they have potential, they just have a few things to work out.
