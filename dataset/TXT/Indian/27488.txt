Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Hands down our new favorite place for Indian cuisine in the Charlotte area! The atmosphere is warm & inviting. Every detail inside is beautifully modern and intentionally hand-crafted, from the menus to the unique terrariums on each table. The restaurant's striking attention to detail carries over into the kitchen too.
Service was quick and friendly. We started our dinner with samosas and mango lassie, then ordered the Lamb Tamarind Curry and Chicken Tikka Masala. 
The spiciness of every dish was customizable so we got the lamb spicy and the tikka masala mild. Both were out-of-this-world delicious and perfect in terms of heat. We'll definitely be back for more!
