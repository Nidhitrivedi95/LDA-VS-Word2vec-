Lunch: They're lunch buffet is HUGE! With $11, I was given a selection of 45 items. 45 dishes (15 is usually standard in any indian buffet)  in an Indian Buffet is unheard of. And it gets better. What makes India Masala stand out from its competitors  is that besides having nearly triple the quantity of dishes to choose from for less than $11, you're always in for a surprise. Unlike other traditional indian buffets, the items on the buffet at India Masala change everyday. Some traditional items such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Dal Makkhani etc. remain, but for the most part, dishes change each day. Also, it features both North & South Indian dishes in their buffet. In the end, best Indian buffet in Vegas. 

Dinner: When i step into any restaurant, there are 3 things I stick my neck out for: Food, Ambience, & Service. The food is phenomenal. My friends and I ordered a Family Dosa. Its a BIG BIG CREPE about 4 feet long! Also, I had the Chicken 65 as an appetizer, Lamb Madras Curry, and Garlic Nan. Chicken 65 was highly recommend by our server. It didn't disappoint. It was a dry red chicken. The flavor was quite different and thus hard to explain. All I remember is that each bite felt electric, literally. Lamb Madras Curry was also great. I ordered a spice level 7 and it was PERFECT. The curry had a great depth of flavor. Ambience is very beautiful. As for the service, this restaurant knows what it is doing. They're service is outstanding!
