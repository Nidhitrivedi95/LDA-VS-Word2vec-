QEqMHowTTj5GKvpiKheGlQ Amazing food. I couldn't stop eating it. My friends and I ordered daal makhani and paneer tikka masala and both tasted amazing. The people working there are really nice too. The place is not nice looking but the food is amazing. Oh and did I mention it's open until late so more eating pizza and McDonald's when I am hungry late at night.
