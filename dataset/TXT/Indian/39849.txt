PHb9AgEVXzuV4ETl3w5onQ Me and my girlfriend Helen were going to a friends birthday bash at the ship inn up the road from the viceroy and decided to pop in for a curry. So we made a reservation with my yelp app . We weren't disappointed the staff were very friendly and welcoming I ordered a beer and a lamb madras which was lovely and hot ( I love a hot curry  ) my girlfriend Helen had the lambda shanks which she absolutely loved she said she can't wait go back and have some more . I've been there lots and lots over the last 30 years absolutely brilliant 10/10 I highly recommend them
