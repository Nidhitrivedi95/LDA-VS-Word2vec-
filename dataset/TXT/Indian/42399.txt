They never offered to seat me, so I asked if I should seat myself. They said yes, like it was obvi and I should have done it already.  So I sat myself and they let me know that the buffet was to my right as were the plates. They offer a full menu, so I was a little dissappointed they assumed the buffet. I tried the buffet and non of the food stood out. There are LOTS of great Indian restaurants nearby, so I couldn't give them more than 2 stars. The tikki masala was bland and the tandoori was dry. I did enjoy the fruit custard for dessert, it wasn't too sweet and I could tell it was fresh. The highlight was the naan bread, I would seriously buy it by itself if I could. It was fresh and tasty, best of all it came out very warm. I might head back to try an item from thier ala carte, menu.
