B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Weekend lunch at dhaba bistro - Their Thali, is  economical, yummy and the perfect quantity. Better than most Indian places that offer a buffet. A buffet offers a lot of variety but variety, in my view, comes second to the quality of the food. Dhaba's thali promises great quality along with adequate variety. Weekend Indian food - think Dhaba thali.
