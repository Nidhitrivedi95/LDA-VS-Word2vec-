_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA I guess Im catching up on my reviews. This is about a year late. 
I believe I was here for last winterlicious? 
I can say I would def be back and would recommend.

Great portions and great selection and tasted yummy!
Im not Indian though but a couple of my friends that went with me are and they liked it (not sure how much they raved about it but they liked it) 

From the Naan to the main to the desert and service. All very good. 
The place is also well ventilated and has a closet to store your jacket. 
As most know but maybe dont want to say that sometimes a night out for Indian food makes you come home smelling like the delicious food - which isnt so great. (Just like going out for Korean BBQ) Not so much in this place. 

Classy ambiance for a romantic dinner. 

I'd be back for any of the --licious events!
