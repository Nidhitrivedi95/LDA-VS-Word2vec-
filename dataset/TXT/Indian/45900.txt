sJ0MYSAIVK28cMzh-s-NPA I tried this place a long time back when urban eatery first opened up, and I remember not liking it... but recently, during one of my "i'm too lazy to cook dinner" runs, I mustered all my will power and walked past schezuan express (their placement close to the entry stairs, and the very appetizing aroma wafting right into my face makes it impossible for me to try much else in this food court!) and decided to give Amaya a second chance, plus i was jonesing for some curry. I got their combo deal, with two meat dishes - the beef vindaloo and coconut lamb curry, and the potato/cauliflower veggie dish and a plain naan to go with it all. All of that plus a soda came up to $18 - kind of ridiculous by food court standards, but then again urban eatery does not really fall into typical food court classification. 
One bite into the food, and it came back to me very clearly why I didn't like this place the first time I tried it. I don't know how else to describe every dish than watery. Like literally watery, I almost feel like they were running low on their food, and decided to just add water to it. And usually I think Indian food is pretty hard to mess up - every Indian restaurant I have tried have all been average at the very least. Congratulations Amaya, you have defied the norms of food court prices and Indian food quality! 
No, just NO. I will still with Schezuan Express next time, or try the other indian place at the food court across the street (below AMC yonge/dundas).
