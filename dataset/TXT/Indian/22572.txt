Lunch, dinner, whatever the meal and whatever the dish - it has all exceeded my expectations. The spice level is plenty high - hardcore heat lovers may think it's too low but I love me some heat and it's at an enjoyable level.

The staff is welcoming and goes out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.

Just stop reading and try it. You'll like it.
