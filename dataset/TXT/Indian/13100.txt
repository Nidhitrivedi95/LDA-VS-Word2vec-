b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q I've had better elsewhere. However, there aren't a whole lot of cheap indian buffet places that I've seen around here. There weren't very many people during lunch rush, and only one patron was Indian, so either the food is not up to par or they didn't go that day

The food was decent, not much selection, but the stuff I picked was tasty. They bring you naan which I liked, and I had a mango lassa, which I get every time I eat Indian buffet. I had the usual chicken tandoori, curry, basmati rice, and biryani. It was definitely filling, though a bit spicy for my taste. I'd prob go back if I was desperately craving indian food, and it's close to school so that's a plus
