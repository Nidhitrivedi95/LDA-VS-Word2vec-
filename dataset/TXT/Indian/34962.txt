Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Once you're inside the restaurant, sitting down, enjoying the attentive service, this place is great.  Very pleasing decor and comfortable seating.  The food is excellent.  The service is excellent.  
Our service was terrific.  Engaging but not overbearing.  Very proud of the restaurant and super helpful with picking out menu items.
I'd recommend Tamba without hesitation.
