B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog Service was poor and inattentive - we had to call the waiters over everytime.  Chicken dish we ordered was really good, but the vegetable curry was truly awful and the veg biryani forgettable.  Ok at best, but quite honestly inexplicable why this restaurant has the rating it does.
