JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ I've been trying to find a good Indian restaurant for some time now. I've visited several popular places but could never crave a second visit. I found this place through instagram, and I'm so excited that it wasn't a coincidence. As others have mentioned, this place is pretty impressive if you're a carnivore enthusiast. There are so many great, tasty, and filling options that meat seems alarmingly irrelevant. 
We went crazy ordering a sh1t ton and everything was very good. They have good Indian beer selection also. Enough said..Def go try them out.
