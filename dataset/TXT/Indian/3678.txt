0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Not a cool or trendy place, but a great place for foodies.

Chili Chicken was really good, and the shrimp pakoras were excellent.
If I'm going Hakka, then I'm going here (note: that's no knock to Eddie's Wok n Roll which also has solid Hakka, but is a bit pricier and a bit farther away).

A decent place where you can grab a bunch of takeout, and munch away for a couple days.
