XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw Did the lunch buffet today. The food was authentic and generally okay although some of the dishes were not sufficiently heated. The ambiance of this place leaves a lot to be desired. The carpet is worn and the tile floor area was rather dirty as were the walls. I will keep looking for an Indian place that I will want to go back to.
