b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Great food and impeccable service. Everyone was friendly from the owner to the server and manager who checked on the table. We had butter chicken and a lamb dish both amazing. They let you decide your level of spice from 1-10 which is cool because I've realized everyone's medium is different. Fresh cilantro on the dishes made them even better. I tend to shy away from desserts that are unfamiliar but we opted for fried little fritters in honey sauce that were very good. Highly suggest you try this place, we for sure will be back.
