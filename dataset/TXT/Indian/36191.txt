NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ Horrible customer service! We read the good reviews and went over for dinner. After a 15mins wait, someone came to check on us to see if we have a reservation. We said we didn't and she told us to wait and came back to check on the person who came after us. She went back in to check on the table for him and came back and told him to wait 10mins for the table. When I asked for the wait for me, she said it would be hour and half. I don't get how the person behind me without reservation gets a table in 10 mins but I have to wait for 1&1/2. Seems messed up!
