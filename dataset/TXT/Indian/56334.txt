XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I've been looking for a Tibetan restaurant to try and after reading the other reviews, my boyfriend and I had to try this one. As soon as we walked in, we were instantly greeted by Garab (I think the owner!) with a huge smile on his face. We were already off to a great start! 

As we had never had traditional Tibetan food, we had Garab recommend us dishes to try and they were absolutely delicious! We started with the momos which are traditional Tibetan dumplings (3 steamed and 3 fried) and they were great. For entrees we split the chilli chicken and the Shaptak, and the flavours and spice were perfect (spice level would probably be rated a hot at Thai restaurants in the city). Both dishes also came with a bowl of white rice. 

It's surprising this place wasn't busier on Friday night because it definitely should be. The service is fantastic and I would highly recommend this restaurant. We will definitely be back!
