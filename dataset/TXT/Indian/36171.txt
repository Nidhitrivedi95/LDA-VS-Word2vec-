nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw This place easily ranks as my favorite Indian restaurant in Madison and serves some of the best vegetarian fare in the area.  My favorite Indian dish is Malai Kofta and I've never had a better tasting version than at Flavor of India and the naan is also perfect.  On top of tasting great the food is all very reasonably priced, especially for being located downtown on the square.  The Palak Aloo and Mixed Vegetarian Platter appetizer are also excellent and they serve what I believe may be the best Mango Lassi in Madison.  The staff are very friendly and helpful, the restaurant is very clean....I can keep going on as there is nothing negative about this place and there's no reason to give anything less than five stars.  The only thing I can't rate them for is the lunch buffet as I have not tried it yet.
