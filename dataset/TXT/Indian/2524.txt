02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Grabbed a lunch buffet to-go while running errands this afternoon. Priced at a reasonable $10 the styrafoam carton i packed with rice, veggie curries, pakoras, and tandoori chicken will feed me for days. Each to-go buffet is portioned one piece of delicious fresh naan. 

The curries were just okay (palek paneer, daal makhaini,  and aloo mutter). Palek "paneer," while flavorful, was disappointingly served without the paneer, my favorite part. Both the daal makhaini, aloo mutter were watery. The pakoras tasted like yesterday's leftovers, reheated and thrown on the buffet line. Mint chutney was delicious, some of the best i've had. The raita, also watery, added an extra tang to the curries. The tandoori chicken (legs n' thighs) while tasty, are a bit dry.  

Overall, I'd prefer the home-cooked and spicy palek paneer from Udupi Cafe. But for the price and convenience, the to-go lunch buffet from Indian Delhi Palace is a great deal.
