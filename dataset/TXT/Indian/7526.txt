5vxp6inj3sY4Eb2MFyOOPg Decided to do an impromptu business lunch based on reviews. I would rate it as average. My Doug was a little too watery and the addition of ice cubes did not help. Too much rice with the entrees. Kababs were good but lacked that extra spiciness that keeps you coming back for more.
