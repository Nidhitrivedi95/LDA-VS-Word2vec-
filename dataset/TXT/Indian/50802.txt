ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w Great take out. Lots of space. Really nice wait staff, Indian items too as well as a wood burning oven for pizza on the menu.
 So solid.

Nice music and affordable. 

Need to try brunch if I can get a chance.

It's a nice spot for after work beers for folks who work in restaurants themselves.. Nice vibe.
