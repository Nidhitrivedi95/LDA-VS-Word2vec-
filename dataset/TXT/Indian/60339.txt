We had the lunch buffet, and to drink Masala tea and mango lassi.  The food was superb.  The buffet turnover was extremely high, with new food served every few minutes.  The vegetable biriyani, goat biriyani, tandoori chicken, tikka chicken, and chicken tikki masala were all great.  The naan was crispy and the gulab jamun was par for the course.  The tea was almost certainly not from a powder, and the mango lassi differed from what I was used to by having chopped pistachios in it.  The nuts added a sense of depth and texture I have not yet seen in other mango lassi.  The dessert bar had rice pudding along with a host of unrecognizable desserts.  Absent were the expected fruit cocktail, jello, and ice cream offered at "cheaper" buffets.  Instead there were interesting mixes of chick peas, almonds, and other presumably homemade desserts.  I will update this review once I try their dinner menu.

Pros:

- Inexpensive.  Lunch buffet for $10 a person is great.
- Food is freshly made for a buffet and turnover is high.
- Wait staff is friendly and keeps the drinks filled.


Cons:

- There were a lot of indian customers, which I take to be a sign that the food is legit and authentic.  However the wait staff did not have a set uniform or nametags.  They were for the most part dressed casually.  It was difficult to determine who worked for Passage to India and who was a customer.

- After eating the lunch buffet, I had the worst food coma I've ever had post lunch.  The food here is heavy.  Be prepared to take a long afternoon nap after eating at Passage to India.
