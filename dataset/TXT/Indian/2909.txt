0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw I have been going to this place for months and want them to have more business because I want to keep eating there!

This place is a great choice for a dinner outing in Avondale.

My families favorites are the Chicken Madras, Chicken Tika Masala and the Garlic Naan. They will adjust for spiciness on request and the hot is not extremely hot for those versed in spicy foods, I consider it just right.

The staff are always friendly and attentive and the interior is decorative and always has Indian music/television on to add to the environment.

If you want a way to checkout all of their food, try the buffet to get a feel for it. It's everyday from 11 to 2, but don't expect everything, just the most popular items.
