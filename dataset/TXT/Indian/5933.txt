3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Long wait times and we realized server missed orders requested after an hour. Requires repeated follow ups for the orders placed. Waste of time and a horrible experience knowing food was not prepared after an hour wait. If you are lucky to get the food served it's not any better too
