7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ I went there for buffet twice. Moving from NYC hub of Indian restaurant, I am ought to be biased. I certainly have had better food. It gets crowded on weekend, wait time could be overwhelming. 

Food was okay there were plenty of dishes to try, Chicken tikka was good. The appetizer is average. Tandoori chicken was okay could have been better. The goat curry was not something I would recommend some one. Vegetarian dishes were better than the non vegetarian dishes. 

I was actually surprised to see it so crowded.
