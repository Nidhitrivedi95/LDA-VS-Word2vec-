auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I really liked this place a lot.  I am a little scared of Indian food, because not sure exactly what I am ordering.  The waiter was really nice and explained everything, without being sarcastic.  We ordered a couple of things, that was good, but next time, their medium will defintely not be okay.  Very hot for me.  I think mild next time is the key.  I love spicy food but am used to the asian spicy so this was a little much for me.  I will pass on the app platter too, and go straight for the samosas, which were so good.  The only thing that kinda sucked for me that it closed between lunch and dinner for a couple hours...whats up with that.  Aren't we still a 24 hour town.  Lunch and dinner hours...what is that???  Oh and excellent mango lassies...
