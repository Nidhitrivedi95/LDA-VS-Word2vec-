8vq9tnnH5qvnbBdeXYBJyw Service: service is a hit or miss. The first time I came here I was quite disgusted with the owners level of professionalism. The second time I came my server was this sweet younger lady who was patient enough to explain to me the various dishes and the ingredients. 

Layout: this location was renovated this year and it looks much better. I will snap a few shots next time I remember. It is also quite clean. They serve your food cafeteria style. They have one person that rings you out and another that cashes you out .

Food: it is not the worst Indian food I've ever had but it is not the best. Nice alternative to what is offered on York lanes but a bit bland in comparison to authentic Indian food. I assume it is probably to cater to the palate of those on campus. 

Note: if you have never tried a mango lassi you are missing out!
