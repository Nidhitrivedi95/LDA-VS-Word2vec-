ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Discovered this place when we were out shopping and looking forward to going back! It's small which I've actually come to enjoy in a restaurant. The decor was inviting and intimate and I was happy to see a small patio off the side. The view is limited to the parking lot and the back of adjacent buildings but still, I love patios so I'm looking forward to visiting during warmer weather.

The service was average on speed but excellent on charisma. Being relatively new to Indian, I had a few questions about dishes I had yet to try and they were very accommodating and suggested I come back for the lunch buffet which I fully intend to do. It's offered seven days a week and at under $10, I can't think of a better way to explore some different dishes.

I don't know if this place is the best of the best but I think it was good food at a great price in a charming atmosphere.
