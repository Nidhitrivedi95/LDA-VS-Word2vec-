wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw This is a second location to Gill's Prescott, Arizona one. I have loved Indian food for over 20 years and this is the tastiest anywhere!!
The buttery and creamy Chicken Tikka Masala is on point although ad a little heat and it makes it that much better. You can not find more fun hosts and great crowds as well. I highly recommend you try the food here Scottsdale!
