Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Definitely the best, freshest Indian food I've had in Charlotte so far. Found this little gem by chance, as I was in the CPCC college area for an event, and me and a coworker were looking for a place to grab lunch after. Yelp suggested Tamarind, and we decided to drive down. 
Walked in and we were greeted warmly by the hostess/server. We ordered the lamb rogan josh and the chicken tikka masala, and naan to go with it. The chicken tikka masala was probably among the top 5 that I've tasted. Delicately balanced gravy with a hint of tang from the tomato, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. The lamb Rogan Josh was pretty close to what you would find in the dhabas of Old Delhi. Made me reminisce. Enough said. 
For dessert we had the kheer and the Gulab jamun. It seemed that they had just cooked the kheer, and it was still hot, and the milk and rice were separating. This was the one item on the menu that did not impress. The gulab jamun was yummy, sweet but not overly so. 
After the meal, the chef/owner came out to greet us and I spent a few minutes talking to him. Overall, I had a good time, and Tamarind is another restaurant to add to my list of hole in the wall places with great food.
