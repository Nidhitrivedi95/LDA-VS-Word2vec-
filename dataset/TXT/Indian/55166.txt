Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Review based solely on the Lunch Buffet.

This buffet definitely has some features not common in other buffets. 
-Extensive dessert offerings
-Chai Tea
-Plenty of nan

What I like the most:
-Variety in the vegetarian curries and a good kick
-Lamb, Goat, and Tandoori Chicken in the non-veg section

Doesn't disappoint. I recommend the room with the buffet is and not going with more than 4 people. The larger room was dark and too loud.
