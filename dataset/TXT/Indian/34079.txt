m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw If I could give this place 3.5 stars I would but I can't and I don't want to be unnecessarily harsh to a place that was not too bad. Service was normal; nothing outstanding yet nothing to complain about. Now to the food! When I read the reviews here I will be honest; my expectations were a bit high and I was let down enough to initially want to 3-star this place. Kohinoor is a very clean place, the food is clean. That being said, the food was quite bland, especially for an Indian restaurant which are usually known for strong and robust flavor. I have been to more than a few places in town that have been better. I went with 6 friends so I had the chance to test taste quite a few dishes. The tandoori chicken and the samosas were standout-good. The lamb and chicken biryani were extremely bland. The lamb Korma was meh and the chicken curry was pretty good.
