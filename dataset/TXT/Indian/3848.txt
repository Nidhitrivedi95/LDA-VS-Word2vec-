0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I love this place. It doesn't look like much but they make excellent indian food from scratch. They will do any substitution you need and ask for. If you eat there rather than getting your food to go you will get very generous portions for a decent price. They also have wide selection of indian desserts and snacks, most of which are made fresh daily.

It's family owned, if you are nice to them they will be very nice and helpful to you!
