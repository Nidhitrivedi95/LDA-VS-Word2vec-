lO-IY5X36bLI8vnQR4O18A You're killin' me, Curry n Cake. 

I'll start with the positive: The food here is really, really, really good. The Chicken 65 is a fantastic mix of spicy and crunchy  with just enough sauce to make it moist, but you can still (and you'll want to) eat it with your fingers. There's a nice mix of "old standards" of Indian cuisine - Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, Goat Roganjos, Malai Kofta - and dishes I've never seen before - Chicken (or Gobi) 65, Hakka noodles, and Bhel Puri. Be warned, the spice level tends to be medium-high. That said, the food is delicious and fresh; the flavors are well-balanced; the breads are nicely cooked. I have not been disappointed with their savory food.
I've only had a couple of their pastries, but those were great, too. On food alone, I'd give this place five stars without hesitation.

Now for the not-so-great: Even after being open for several months, they don't quite seem to have caught their stride. If it's busy and I'm ordering takeout, I have to call three or four times (and sometimes more!) before someone picks up the phone. They generally say "20 minutes" for the food; it's sometimes taken 40 or more. On one day, they ran out of rice. How do you run out of rice? (They did have biryani, which they gave away instead of plain rice, but it was really simply too hot for me - I like to use the rice to cut the heat of the curry a little) There is frequently an air of "WE'RE GOING AS FAST AS WE CAN!" in this place, especially during the lunch rush. It has the feel of a place that could use a lot of help with efficiency.

Here's the thing, though: These are growing pains, and they're minor headaches. In any case, the food is ABSOLUTELY worth it. I'd recommend going there in person if you can - you won't have to worry about waiting for a phone order, and they have counter service there, with about eight tables.
