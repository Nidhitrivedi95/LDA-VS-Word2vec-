arDp3i7B_ULDsbZcYk_57A Oh my god! The owner of Glory of India I believe has been harassing me on YELP for the past few months like a psycho ex girlfriend for my honest review. I had no idea who it was first, now I figured it out lol How pathetic. Instead of doing this, how about washing your hands, not licking the spoons/spatulas and putting back into the very dish he's cooking. Disgusting. 

It is not like I went there again, he keeps coming back to this page and reading that someone called out on this disgusting behaviour, so instead of taking this as a constructive criticism he can't get over it.

Check this out please.
