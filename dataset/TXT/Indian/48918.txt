tsUFlp2DQw7Nk2I9mRL2hg When I first moved to Scarborough, my friend took me to all the places she used to frequent in the area when she lived here. Places she thought I'd enjoy - and Hot Wok was one of those places. Since then, I have come to Hot Wok on a number of times, mostly with that same friend. 

It had been a while since I had revisited Hot Wok, and then I saw it be reviewed on Yelp - and it made me want to come back all over again. So I convinced a couple other yelpers to join me on yet another Hakka meal. 

The food was mostly as I remembered it - good, but not great. Greasy, bright coloured and mildly spicy. We ordered a variety of dishes and this was the verdict: 

- Chicken Pakoras - Were WAY too greasy, even for me. But the sauce it came with was yummy! 
-Chili Chicken - This is the one dish my friend and I would always get when we came here. I remember this dish being much better; more spicy and less gummy. I was let down by it this time around. 
-Manchurian Noodle - I really enjoyed this. Yes, it was oily - but I didn't mind it. 
-Manchurian Vegetable Fried Rice - For some reason this had a vinegary taste to it (that only I could detect). But I still enjoyed it - I love rice in all its forms. 

The friend that introduced me to this place no longer wants to come here - she just doesn't like it anymore. But I might return - Whenever I have a craving for some greasy, spicy Hakka food. Hopefully by the time I return, the Chili Chicken will be back to being the way I remember it.
