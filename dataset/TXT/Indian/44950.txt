S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA We ordered 2 veg entrees yday for Togo (malai kofta and dal makhani) and mistakenly they gave us Matar paneer instead of malai kofta. When we called the restaurant,  and explained the front desk of their mistake , lady at d front desk put us on never ending hold and did not even apologize.  Guys , at least have some courtesy to apologize...Very Bad of Such a nice Name Restaurant...and we had to throw Matar Paneer out since it was not of the taste and pathetic to eat. MONEY WASTED !!!
