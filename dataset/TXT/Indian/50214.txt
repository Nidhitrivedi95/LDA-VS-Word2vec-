UAXz2KC1aXpxzV-MLdXbmQ Props to the chefs for making really delicious food. I had a lamb madras and a rasmalai as well. No complaints! 

If it wasn't for the terrible attitude that the waiter gave me, I would definitely go back.

I was there with some friends to celebrate my birthday. Some of my friends had to leave early because of other engagements so they paid before the rest. We were told at the END of the dinner, that a split bill was not possible.

The waiter apparently wrote down the price my friends paid BEFORE tax and tip and accused my friends for not paying tax and left. 

I ordered a serving of naan and my friends and I ordered a couple more to share so I told the waiter that I needed to pay for that 1.5 servings. He asked me rudely how he would do that. So in response, I said well, what is a half of one? Before I could even finishing helping him out with the math, he said "okay, you're giving me attitude...blahblahblah... I'm not even supposed to help you pay individually but I am so blahblahblah." I was just so taken aback by his reaction to me that I didn't know what to say at first! Then I calmly said, you asked me how, so I was helping you do the math. Then he raised his voice and said that I should look at the price myself and tell him how to do it. But with the combination of having bad eyes and the receipt being upside down, I told him I couldn't. He gave me a dirty look and started calculating using his iPhone.

If I hadn't been watching him and told him to change the price he wrote on the receipt, he would've written all of our prices as before tax even though we paid tax and tip. I don't know how to explain this well enough but essentially, the guy was trying to get more tip from us but in a very sketchy way.

I would never go back in a million years. I apologize to the chefs, because they're the ones that deserve tips for cooking good food. But with service like that on my BIRTHDAY, EFF THAT SHIZ.
