KXqOT3vyx8Ao7com4yST-g Pleasantly surprised here! I like the concept and the food is quite good!! I am usually a vindaloo fan, so only real improvement could be a bit spicier sauce option. 

The staff was quite knowledgeable and pleasant as well which is always nice being you don't get that everywhere no a days! 

Would recommend to anyone liking Indian food to give it a shot. I'll definitely be back and probably quite often.
