ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA As an absolute novice to Indian cuisine, I had always been a little hesitant to try it out because I wasn't sure I would be able to stomach the spices. Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the flavors and the dishes I ordered at Passage to India.

I tried this place thanks to a suggestion of my best friend who works nearby and asked me to join her for a Friday evening dinner. Passage to India is situated in a tiny strip mall right down the street from UNCC (aka my alma mater, go 49ers!) and is quite small inside so the place can fill up quite quickly. I joined my friend around 6:30 p.m. and walked right in with no wait.

For my beverage, I ordered the mango juice which was pure, delicious mango puree and the vegetable samosas as an appetizer. The samosas were brought out nice and hot and served with two different dipping sauces. One was green which had more of a cilantro flavor and the other was brown which was on the sweeter side. Forgive me, as I have no idea of the "official" names for the sauces.

I didn't have the chance to look over their menu online before I visited so I relied on the knowledge and preferences of my friend to walk me through the menu possibilities. I would personally recommend checking out the online menu before you go because it can be a bit overwhelming especially if you're an Indian food newbie. I settled on the chicken tikka masala which is grilled chicken breast cooked with tomato creamy sauce and served with basmati rice. My friend ordered the tandoori chicken. I have to rave here: THEY WERE BOTH DELICIOUS. My taste buds were so relieved!

Our waiters varied throughout our meal but all were so kind and accommodating and checked in to make sure we were satisfied with our meals. As a newly-minted Indian food fan, I am happy to have a place to recommend and cannot wait to come back to try their highly talked about lunch buffet.
