OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This star is given for the service.  Didn't get to try the food.  We arrived at our reservation time.  Never been here before, we asked what  they recommend. We ordered.  After an hour, still no food and we noticed lots of people going for the buffet line (which was not made known to us).  Found out, our order never made it to the kitchen.  Very hungry at this point, we told them to cancel the order and we'll do the buffet.  Went to the buffet line and there was NO MORE FOOD in the buffet trays!  This was not working out for us so we had no choice but to leave and go next door to Tacos and Brew (really good, btw).  This was too bad cause we really wanted to try some authentic Indian cuisine.
