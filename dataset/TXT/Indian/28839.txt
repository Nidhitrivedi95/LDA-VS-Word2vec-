jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Nice view of the strip. Samosas were cold inside. Probably didn't microwave them long enough.  Rice, naan and butter chicken were decent.  Extremely long wait time to get food.  Wait staff was very nice and apologetic about the wait time.  Oh, one more thing.  The music videos they play need to be expanded.  Seemed like the same three songs played over and over.
