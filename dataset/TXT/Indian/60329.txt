ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I have eaten here a few time now and am impressed with the place.... The lunch buffet is affordable, and you can say, (this is great food!) the price changes after lunch, but the food is well worth it. I am always greeted (with a smile) and seated quickly. Dirty dishes don't clutter my table and my glass never runs empty. Check it out!
Indian food at it's finest!
