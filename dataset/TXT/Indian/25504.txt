hq10TdILrwtTcAESKY251Q Was craving saag paneer and this place delivered indeed!!!! Above expectations great price and generous portion sizes. My husband got the butter chicken and he was satisfied as well. Definitely gonna try to visit this place in person one day - I ordered delivery through SkipTheDishes
