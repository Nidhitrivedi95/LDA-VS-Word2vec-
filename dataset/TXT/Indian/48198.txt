TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA This place is always busy. We went for family day lunch. We waited for 10 mins after which we were shown our way to a table. After siting for 15mins (and waiting for the menu)  we were "informed" that they only have all day buffet that day. 

The dosas were served fresh and piping hot and aloo masala was a favourite at our table. The rest of the food was average; uttapa, Idli and medu vadas were all cold. For dessert they had gulab jamun (avoidable) and rava kesari (yum). 

In all a good place for South Indian food. The dosa and the rava kesari are a must have.
