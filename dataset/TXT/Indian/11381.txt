afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w In a word, delicious.  That sums up Hopper Hut.  The food is fully authentic and the portions are massive.  None of the five of us Yelpers that went for lunch could finish what they had ordered.  The waiter was extremely helpful with navigating us through the menu as none of us had eaten Sri Lankan before.  Also, he spoke perfect English, bonus!

Make sure you try a hopper.  It's similar to a pancake or crepe but in a bowl shape.  I had the Chicken Kuffti Roti which is like a normal roti except they chop up the bread into the dish.  My suggestion is that you order what you want, but the whole table shares what they ordered because any way to look at it you'll be taking home a doggie bag. 

My only hit on this place was that they were out of a few things and the waiter had to go to the kitchen a couple of times while we were ordering to see if they had what we wanted.  The once dessert we all wanted to try, the pineapple pluff, was not available that day.
