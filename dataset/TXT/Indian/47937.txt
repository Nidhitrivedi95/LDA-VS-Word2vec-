TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Honestly amazing!
Im not from NV and I usually have indian food in california but this place was comparable to my favorite place in Cali. It is authentic and the service was on point! The server helped us choose the most popular items and was so nice to us. We had shrimp biriani, butter chicken, and tandoori chicken and it was all perfect! The garlic naan was delicious as well, we had to order a second serving.
I highly recomed it here if u want some authentic delicious indian food.
