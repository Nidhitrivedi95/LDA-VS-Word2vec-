gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Up until now I never really liked Indian food, especially a buffet.  Everything just seemed soggy, overcooked and old.  THIS restaurant however,  is completely the opposite of my preconceived notion. 

We went for the lunch buffet.  It was amazing.  Everything was fresh and hot.  A very good selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes.  Most everything I tried was absolutely delicious.  I went back for seconds and even thirds.  The next day, I came back for more!  

The restaurant was clean, the decor tasteful and comfortable.  The price was very good too. 

Careful though, all that curry can get to you.  ;)
