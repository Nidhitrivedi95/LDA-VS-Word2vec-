TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Zagat rated pretty much indicates that a restaurant is quite excellent. And they're correct with this place. Best Indian food in Vegas so far. The only place that I know of that knocks this place out of the map would be Curry In A Hurry back in NY. But. This place will do. Unless I visit NY again! Go for buffet during lunch. Great price and selection.
