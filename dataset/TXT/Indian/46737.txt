t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I went here for a lunch buffet on a recent visit to Vegas. I was really impressed with the Tiki Masala and the Chicken Curry dishes. They had a good sampling of vegetarian options as well which were also delicious. I didn't think any of the food was overpowering either but the right mix of spices and flavor. I would definitely recommend it!
