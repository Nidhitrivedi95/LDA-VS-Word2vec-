5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ I had never heard of this place, but I've been living on the east side and got a Groupon for this place. I figured that I have never had lousy Indian food (even the most average Indian food is good to me). I hadn't looked up Pari before going there, and had assumed my $25 Groupon would cover most of a meal for myself and another person.

Let me say that the food was good, but not great. There are far better Indian restaurants in town, and the portions are not nearly as plentiful here as they are at other places. When we showed up on a Sunday evening we were the only people there and over the course of an hour and an half only one other table showed up (2 people). I don't know that I have ever been in an Indian restaurant so dead. 

We started our meals off with samosas that were excellent, and the stand out of the meal. I had Saag and it was good, but again, nothing outstanding. I also ordered Garlic Naan that was pretty good, but a little burnt, and as with my meal it seemed a little smaller than what I usually receive at other places. 

The service was good, but nothing outstanding. When I went to redeem my Groupon I found it a little weird that the employee copied down some of my information on a notecard (not sure why he needed my phone number - that has never happened). Now, it also seems to be more expensive than most other places I go.
