PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q The service here seemed kind of spotty.  The wait staff seemed upset and frustrated that I was eating at their restaurant.  Maybe this was because I was requesting ridiculous, difficult things...like a beer with my meal (I know, I know, I'm a terrible, crazy person for even thinking of doing something like that).  Speaking of beer, the drink menu said $1 drafts all day.  Crazy, $1 drafts?  I couldn't believe it.  Well, when I got my check, my $1 draft cost me $4.  Meh, that's not a bad price for what I got, but it would've been nice if I hadn't have been mislead about the price of beer.  Oh well.  I'm still giving this place 3 stars, because if you're okay with poor service , this is a good place to grab a meal.

They have a $9.99 dinner buffet that's probably the best value unless there's a specific dish you want or you really want made-to-order food.  Everything in the buffet was flavorful, although it certainly wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had.  As far as spiciness goes, all the buffet food was around medium - not too mild, but certainly not hot.  There were a good variety of dishes in the buffet - I'd estimate somewhere around 8-10 main dishes plus a variety of sides.

Overall, the food is good, but there's definitely better Indian food out there.  Also, be prepared for less-than-stellar service.
