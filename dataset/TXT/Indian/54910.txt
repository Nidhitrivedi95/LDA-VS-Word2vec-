WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA We got a Host gift card from a friend, so that enticed us to go.  We always wanted to try.

Came here for dinner on a Saturday night and it was busy.  Very friendly service.   We stuck to the award winning dish, Buttered chicken (you can ask for the spicy version, made my nose run - in a good way) and it was tasty.

We also had the tandoori sampler that had 3 types of tandoori.   all good , but felt could just order the green chilli tandoori - which to us tasted the best (turns out that was award winning too).
