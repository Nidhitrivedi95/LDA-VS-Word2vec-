CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA This place is amazing! Such great food. I had saag paneer lunch special and it was perfect! The mango lassi was delicious.... and I loved how every lunch special came with chai. The staff was attentive and kind. We dined with an 11 month old and a 3 year old. They made us feel welcomed. Great service, amazing food. Can't wait to go back.
