CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw We ordered take out from Dhaba because a friend recommended the place. We didn't even get the food because 2 hours later we still hadn't received the food. To cancel we were put on hold multiple times and were told an additional 20 minutes each time we called. Very frustrating.

After all that, they charged my credit card after us explicitly saying no. If there was a possibility to give zero stars I would. Terrible!

Please note I was not in a hotel and the order placed was through delivery. In the end the resolution did not come through Dhaba or their third party online system partners orderIndian.com but rather through RBC, my bank, and through their fraud program. Terrible service from Dhaba and extremely frustrating that all of their comments from the owner/manager following bad reviews places blame on the customers. After numerous phone calls and attempts to resolve with Dhaba I had to resort to my banking institution to declare fraud and will have to follow up with the BBB. Dhaba definitely needs to handle customer incidents with better care.
