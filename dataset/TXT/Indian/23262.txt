gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This place is so yummy!!! I went for the buffet which is a great price for all you can eat. The owner is really inviting and made sure we were comfortable. The Naan bread is so fluffy and good. Everything I ate was delicious. I will definitely be a returning guest and bringing more people with me!!
