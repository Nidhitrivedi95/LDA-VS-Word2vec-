P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I found a band-aid in my food tonight, and the manager just shrugged it off, saying there's only so much they can do to control contamination of their buffet food. 

Worst part? The manager didn't even make the effort to see what was going on besides quickly taking away the plate with the chewed-out band-aid. He just kept sending over the poor waitress who would relay nonsensical excuses like 'oh it must have been paper' or 'it could have slipped off another customer so we can't do anything about that.' 

When I went up to confront the manager, he kept repeating how he doesn't know what I want him to do about it. 

Take my words or leave it, that's up to you--but the owner of this restaurant clearly doesn't take potential health hazards seriously. 

Does this place have good food? Yes. Is it worth the possibility of ingesting a band-aid that came off of someone? I don't think so.
