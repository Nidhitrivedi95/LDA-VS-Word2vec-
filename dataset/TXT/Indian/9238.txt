8cDP0mjK0J6lk292IeKRGg This is you average roti shop but a bit more spacious. Very bright, large flat screen TVs, loud music playing, and a weekend buffet (Sat.-Sun. 9am-2pm). This place is definitely nothing fancy nor is the service anything to brag about and the food, well it's just average  

My mom is Trinidadian so I know good Caribbean food when I taste it and this definitely wasn't great. I got the shrimp roti and my man got the boneless chicken roti. Honestly, I got like three pieces of shrimp in my roti, no lies! My man hardly got any chicken in his roti and he got the regular size so you'd expect more meat but that wasn't the case. I feel like it's usually a bit more tasty but today's curry was pretty bland if I'm being honest and it tasted like there was hardly any pepper sauce. 

Anyways, I know the buffet is usually pretty decent so I'd come back for that in the future but other than that, I probably won't be back to eat curry from here again. My mom can definitely cook up a better curry than Drupati's.
