A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA This place used to be THE place about 15 years ago but it's lost its sparkle. I think it now caters to a crowd that's largely not geared towards it's native south Asian population. And that kind of changes things.  And it's disappointing to write this review.

The dosas were not the greatest and the typical side dishes of sambar and chutney were not good. The service was okay and the food came out quick. The poori and curry was decent overall. 

Perhaps their apps and 'chaat' items will be better 

It's been years since I came to Gerard street since the south Asian community now ha many restaurants, clothing stores spread out across the GTA. So I expected it to be good. And it was just okay. Nothing to write home about.
