TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw First Indian Place I have been to in las vegas and i was excited. I had read the reviews on yelp and was anxious to try the place out.

You walk in and immediately you are succumb to a dark, woody, quiet environment. It is calm, soothing and relaxing. The booths were nice and big and very comfy.

I deducted a star because as an American, I should always have the option to American drinks. No tea, no lemonade, no soda. Water or Lassi seemed to be our only option and I was disappointed in that.

The food was good, not great. I have had definately had better Indian Food. I was extremely happy that they had Butter Chicken but in my opinion it should have been a little more creamier. 

The tandori chicken didn't seem authentic either. So that was big a NO for me.

The naan, wasn't the freshest or softest I have had either. 

Maybe it was the day we went but I felt they should have had more variety for chutneys.

The buffet itself was a bit pricey for the amount of different choices they offered. 

I did like most of what I had. Very filling. Ate one and half plates.

No indian people eating there either. That should have been my number one sign.

I would go back - maybe.
