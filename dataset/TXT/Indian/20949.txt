GaymsFE7jVr9PtLwYRYiAA I came here on a Monday or Tuesday evening a few months ago and fond the service was actually quite good, probably because there hardly any customers.  The waiters were welcoming and the food didn't take too long arrive.  The food, although not particularly bad, was far from being the best Indian food I've tasted.  I ordered the chicken bhuna with pilau rice and I'm pretty sure the chicken was overcooked, but the sauce was excellent with a good mix of vegetables and spices.  The rice also tasted a bit overcooked and soft, as if it had been sitting out for a while.  
In its favour, the menu is enormous with plenty of curries, kebabs and vegetarian options, all of which are pretty reasonably priced around the £5 mark.  Although my meal wasn't the best I've heard good reports about it and would probably give it another chance.
