cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Went there for lunch with coworkers.  It was during Christmas so it was pretty empty.  

Locale: clean, very well lit.  The view from inside the restaurant surprised me, you could see a lot of building in the distance, and the skyline.

Service: The staff was friendly.

Food: I ordered the lunch special, (15$ with tax and tip).  The waiter brought a few Nan's and told us in advance to request more if necessary.  Which we did once, and he kept an eye and refilled our baskets multiple times without us requsting more. The food tasted good.  Even the tofu which I usually can't stand was tasty. 


 The food was tasty, service friend.  would go again.
