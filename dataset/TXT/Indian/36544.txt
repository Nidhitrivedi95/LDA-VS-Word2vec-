NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg In Cleveland for a business trip and I found Choolaah on Yelp. I knew this was on my top 10 places to visit and it was right down the road from my hotel. 

This place did not disappoint. I got the lamb meatball BBQ with masala sauce and it was a great mixture of flavors. I love how this was build from an old car lot show room. 
I will definitely be back before I leave Cleveland.    

Looking forward to when they open one UP in Fairfax, VA.
