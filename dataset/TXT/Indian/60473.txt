ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw Needle&Pin was great! It's an excellent mix of English and Indian food

Colin did an outstanding job with the interior and ambiance. 

The food is top notch-- standouts were the Chilli Paneer and the grilled cheese/coconut tomato soup. The chilli paneer had great heat and was a generous portion. The grilled cheese was made with custom bread that was to die for (so light and fluffy!) and an aged gruyere cheese. Honorable mention to the Wellington bites and tikka masala. Tons of great shareable dishes 

It's a gin bar but the manhattans were A++ 

This is a great addition to the South Hills... I can't wait to try more cocktails and other items on the menu soon!
