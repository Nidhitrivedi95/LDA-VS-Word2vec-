Qlebt777MOvHmu7p7QiM_Q This place is horrible. the staff was extremely rude and i have to wait 20 minutes for a roti. it was unreal.

and any time i asked for info on a menu item the waiter was ignorant.

i would strongly suggest people do not eat here. there are alot better places to eat indian food.
