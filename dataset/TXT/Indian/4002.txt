112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA Take 2 on Chutney Rolls! 4.5 this time around. 

I went again because the owner reached out to me. Total 5 on customer service and satisfaction. I think that is one of the most important things - he and his team cares about doing a good job with their business and representing their food well... And of course, making sure the customer is happy! Great small business. I am satisfied. 

Onto the food. I retried the mini samosas. This time, they were prepared better-definitely try the palak paneer. 

For the mains, like everyone said, you pick your "base" of a wrap, salad, or rice, and then choose your entree. I had the wrap with the paneer tikka (love paneer... Cheese cubes with onion and pepper) and the rice bowl with phool gobhi (roasted cauliflower). Sadly, they were out of palak paneer. Seems like they sell till they run out so it's better to get in earlier.

The wrap was flaky and delicious, not an American style tortilla wrap for sure. The flavor and spices were good! Just a heads up if you are sensitive to spice. But, happy to know that there are places not willing to compromise on flavor to more accurately represent your cuisine (even tho it's fusion)

The rice bowl was pretty interesting. The rice also had peas in it, topped with the phool gobhi (good) and chopped fresh cabbage. The cabbage was a bit of a surprise but still good because it was fresh. Overall everything was fresh and well prepared. 

We sat outside - they have a few outdoor seats. The inside is small but trendy - good for smaller groups to hang out in. 

Finally, I was pretty full after the wrap and took the rice bowl home. It's a good meal for the price ($5.85-6.15)

Thanks for reaching out, chutney rolls!
