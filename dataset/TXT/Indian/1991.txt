_4UyKqVcyO8xajUgMKK-Nw I ordered in from Nouveau Delhi.  When I opened my container of saag paneer, I was perplexed at seeing little more than a mound of greasy spinach.  After mining, with no success, to the bottom in search of freshly made cheese, I gave up in defeat and started eating what was there.

Mid-way through what was already an unsatisfying and disappointing meal, something caught on my teeth.  I thought it might have been a random bit of kitchen debris, but I was wrong.  There was a metal staple mixed in with my food.  Yes: the same kind of staple I use to bind sheets of paper together and that I've never found in any recipes at all.

While the meal did include some free office supplies, it was, overall, lacklustre. The "garlic chili" naan tasted neither spicy nor of garlic, and my dining partner's plain naan was burnt.  My dining partner gave a lukewarm review of her chicken korma: it was "not the best" she'd had but also not the worst.

I can't recommend this restaurant in good conscience, but, given the other positive reviews, maybe I just caught them on a bad night.  It was a bad enough night, though, that I don't think I'll be going back to grant them a second chance.
