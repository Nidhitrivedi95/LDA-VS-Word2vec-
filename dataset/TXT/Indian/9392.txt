8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Great food. Awful service. I went one night at 7pm and was immediately sat at the bar. I waited 15 minutes to order. After ordering I waited at least 45 minutes for the food. Drink refills were slow. Waiter was not friendly. Honestly, order take out and then you don't have to deal with the service. The food was great but didn't make up for the time spent waiting.
