pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw First off, I never write reviews. After eating here though, I felt compelled to write one. I had the lunch buffet and it was incredibly delicious. They offer a large variety of food options, which is great if your interested in trying Indian food, or just love it already. The staff seemed super genuine and nice, the food quality was fresh and full of flavor. Highly recommend.
