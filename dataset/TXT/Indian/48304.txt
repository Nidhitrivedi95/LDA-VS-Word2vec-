ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA I can't believe I've worked around corner from this place for four years and never been here! Absolutely delicious!! I had the lunch buffet. $8.95 all you can eat. What a joke! In a good way that is. I stuffed myself silly in just two trips. The buffet doesn't have all the items available on the menu but for the money you're going to get great value. Very friendly and attentive staff, very clean restaurant, very great place to eat. I will be coming back here often!!
