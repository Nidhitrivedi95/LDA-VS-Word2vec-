grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg Briyani with Tandoori chicken leg, hard boiled egg, a ton of rice, and a tiny side salad for $5.00 cash. (single size but is huge) I believe there is a family size as well. 

Fills me up every time and satisfying. (and I'm a big boy) Great cheaper alternative to your typical fast food joint. Their butter chicken (not dry!) and naan are also very delicious although will cost you closer to $10

Its located near the back of a very busy plaza. The line can get long but I've never had to wait longer than 10mins as it moves fast.
