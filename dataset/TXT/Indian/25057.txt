H4YK4AK3TimOFmv9GtqPGQ I have a boyfriend that is not so keen on Indian food but I love it. When he goes out of town, i keep myself on a steady diet of paneer, somosas and naan. I ordered Mezbaan (as it is the only Indian restaurant that delivers to Mt. Washington) a few weeks ago and half of it was really good and the other half, not so much.

My initial issue with the restaurant is a $5 delivery charge. Smithfield street is not that far from Grandview and certainly is not $5 far. I ignored the charge because I really needed masala to survive and pizza just felt like settling. Luckily, the paneer masala was great. There was a great portion and the masala was creamy and delicious. The garlic naan was also enjoyed without complaint. However, the somosas were an incredible let down. There was very little curry, which seemed to be concentrated in one small area, and the rest of the filling was flavorless. I will admit, shamefully, that I will order again from Mezbaan because of how few options I have but the somosas will definitely not be on the menu.
