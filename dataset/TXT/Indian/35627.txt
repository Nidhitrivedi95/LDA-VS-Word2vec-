N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg I guess we're in the minority when it comes to this place. We don't have a lot of experience with Indian food so can't speak to this restaurants authenticity. So we will judge by taste and value. Talking about value when you're in Vegas is an oxymoron. It's like finding a unicorn. Value wise this place is not. You don't get much food for what you pay. Taste wise the food was just mediocre. We wouldn't go back here again.
