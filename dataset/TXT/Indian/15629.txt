cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w Upon entering ISFC, we were greeted with an eclectic and vibrant entwinement of tradition and modern Indian decor. There was a traditional food cart, hanging puppets, an assortment of photos and murals that blended beautifully together. Loved the vibe!

On to the food! A combination of hits and misses with generally more hits than the latter. For starters we had an almond crusted Aloo Tiki which was one of our highlights. The perfect balance of tanginess from the tamarind and combination of spices with the crunchiness of the potato cake and noodles off set with fresh herbs and chutney was delicious! The next item was the seafood bhel. This was like an Indian ceviche and was lackluster due to the meek and waterdowned flavours. The last thing we got was the luxury fish thali which came with an assortment of curries. Ours came with butter chicken, daal makhani, Kerala fish curry and saag paneer. Pickles, raita, papadums, rice and naan came with the thali. Good item to order to get more variety. We ordered an extra garlic naan which was truly buttery (or ghee-y) goodness :)

Overall we had a good meal but sad to say we were the only table for the entire Saturday lunch period. Hope with time ISFC can can attract more customers. Looking forward to when their "high-tea" becomes available!
