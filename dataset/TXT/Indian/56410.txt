XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw We've tried a few other Tibetan restaurants in the area, and overall, our meal here was just alright. While service was absolutely wonderful and friendly at Tibet Kitchen (I would consider coming back since we had such a positive customer service experience here!), the food was a bit of a hit or miss for us. 

We visited on a weekday evening and ordered: a) 6 Pan Fried Beef Momos ($6.99), b) Tsey Khatsa ($9.99 - deep fried marinated vegetables in chili sauce), and c) Chili Chicken Dry ($9.99). For us, the Chili Chicken Dry was the best item - crispy, with a kick, and a great array of flavours. Unfortunately, the Tsey Khatsa was a bit soggy and wasn't crispy at all, and it lacked the flavour we experienced eating the same dish at another Tibetan restaurant down the street. As well, the beef stuffing of the Momos didn't taste appealing to us. The Chili Chicken was the definite standout, and is the item we would order again if we came back to this restaurant. 

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $37.05. Note that they take reservations, and there is street parking available in front of the restaurant. Overall, an okay experience - the wonderful service and the chicken were our positives!
