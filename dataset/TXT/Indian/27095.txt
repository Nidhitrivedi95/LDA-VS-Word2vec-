Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Visited Turmeric when I was in LV last week for some recreation. I think it is fairly new on Fremont Street. Unfortunately I was alone, so I couldn't order several different dishes; hence only 4 stars because of my small sample.  But... good garlic naan, and the Lamb Saag (lamb in a savory spinach sauce) was outstanding, probably the best I've ever had. Definitely will be back next trip.
