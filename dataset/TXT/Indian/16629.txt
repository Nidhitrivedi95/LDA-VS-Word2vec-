DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg This review is long overdue.

While visiting Bangalore (where I ate delicious dosai with chutney every morning) in 2005 I met up with one of my friends from college who had grown up there. A few months later, back in Arizona, I asked him where I could find authentic South Indian food, and he recommended Udupi Cafe.  I've been hooked ever since.  This has been my favorite place to bring friends and family members, and now that I live out of state I make sure that every visit to Arizona includes at least one trip to Udupi.  I've dined at countless Indian restaurants in several cities and states across the U.S., and this one is still my favorite.

The lunch buffet is a great deal -- curries, paratha, idli, desserts, biryani, salad, raita, papadum, and chutneys are served, plus chai or Indian coffee and UNLIMITED DOSAI!!  All for about $12.  Dinner prices are higher, but then they really knock it out of the park on quality so it is definitely worth it either way.  Besides, I always end up with 1-2 meals of leftovers after eating dinner here (and I'm a man with a sturdy frame), so you are not going to be ripped off here.

All dishes are fully vegetarian (like me, yay!) and there are many vegan and gluten-free options as well.  My wife has a severe gluten and dairy intolerance, and she eats here just fine.  

The staff have always been really sweet and helpful.  The wall artwork is beautiful, and the music is awesome.
