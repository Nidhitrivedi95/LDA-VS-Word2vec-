RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg We tried to Blue Taj a couple of weeks ago since we are planning a trip to India and were inexperienced with Indian food.
First, like others had mentioned, the decor is bright and mod and I think it added to the enjoyment of our meal.

But what I really enjoyed was the FOOD!  

We had a great waiter, his name is Vikrant (I don't know if I spelled that correctly) and we asked him what we thought we should order.
He asked us how spicy we like our food, did we like chicken, fish, beef etc. And then he planned our meal.

I highly recommend this method when going to a place (or traveling) where you are outside your comfort zone.  Waiters know what food is good and they often do a great job with recommendations.
We had the chili prawns to start (I don't think they are on the menu) and I couldn't get enough...just spicy enough.
Then we had Chicken Tikka Masala--make sure you get some garlic naan to dip into the creamy sauce.
And we had a lamb dish which the name escapes me but it was also great.  It was cooked in a tandoori style and very flavorful.

I have been craving the Tikka Masala and Naan (and the chili prawns) ever since and am looking forward to going back.

Vikrant was very friendly and helpful and I would ask for him again.
