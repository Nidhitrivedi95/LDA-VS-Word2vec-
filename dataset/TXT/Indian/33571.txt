LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg Delicious indian street food in great sharing size portions so I could try everything (my favourite past time). Very impressed with the vegetarian selection for my friends. Also BYOB is always a bonus when you want a slightly cheaper night! Great atmosphere inside as well I just felt the service was slightly lacking. Otherwise a fab evening and tasty food.
