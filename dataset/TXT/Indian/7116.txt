4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Great buffet selection for vegetarians. Service is good, ambiance is OK. It seems to be quite noisy and expect lots of families with lots of children. 

Buffet is priced well, drinks are reasonable. If you don't like spicy food, be cautious, many of the hot dishes are quite spicy! 

Not as good of a selection as the Brampton location, but there is enough on the menu to suit your whole party. 

Will come back. Will recommend.
