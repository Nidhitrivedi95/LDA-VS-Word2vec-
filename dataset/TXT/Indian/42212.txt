qkmi4fccR60HhX1QBDMZpg Since there is no reviews about this restaurant, We didn't expect how great it is. However, the dishes did surprise me. We ordered lamb leg and king prawn, both of which were accompanied by tasty sauce and well-cooked. And the size is generous. Overall, the experience was great. We will come back again:)
