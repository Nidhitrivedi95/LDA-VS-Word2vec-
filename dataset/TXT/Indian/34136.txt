md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA This is my go to place for Indian food in Durham. The Naan is fresh, i really like the Peshwari Naan. I often take one home and have it for breakfast the next day. The Raita is nice, with a bit of tartness it makes an excellent foil if your main is a bit too spicy.  The mains that I've eaten have ranged from very good to excellent. 
I've been for their lunch buffet on a number of occasions, I especially like that the Naan they serve with the buffet comes straight out of the kitchen.
