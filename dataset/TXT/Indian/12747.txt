B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg I really like this place because the food is really that good and it's very close to my house. The restaurant seems very clean, the decor and music are pleasant. They use white linen on the tables which I think gives a good touch. I always get the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. My mom gets the lamb curry with soup. Super delicious!  I like it better than swagat in middleton. The employees are very nice. One time I had to wait extra long for take out and they gave me complimentary glass of wine.
