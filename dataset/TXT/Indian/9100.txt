82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA I went to Le Taj for dinner last night. First, I loved the decor - it's very simple, with lots of brass sculptures of Hindu deities. No complaints there. The layout is good as well, with tables being spaced apart such that you don't feel like you're dining with your neighbors. 

The person who I assumed was the host, was not friendly or smiley. He barely acknowledged us when we arrived and when he showed us to our table. 

Our waiter was OK but not great. If I ask you whether or not your Shrimp Tandoori is excessively salty, you should be able to answer my question - I mean, you work there. If I'm asking about the shrimp, it's because I want shrimp - don't recommend your most common dish (butter chicken) assuming I've never had Indian cuisine before. 

We ordered the vegetarian plate to share as an appetizer; I must say that there wasn't much on the plate. One samosa, one onion Bhaji, one Aloo tikke to share between two people. As this was an appetizer, it's not that big a deal that the portion was that small, but I've had samosas at other restaurants that were bigger than the three appetizers combined. Just saying. That said, each item was flavorful and we enjoyed them. 

I ordered the Bhunna shrimp (green peppers, onions, spices, tomatoes). I wasn't crazy about the dish; there were 6 shrimp in a tomato-based sauce with LOTS of onions. The shrimp were a bit tough and chewy, and on the small side. The sauce was OK but something was missing. As a side, I ordered the Pulao rice (Basmati with onions, green peas and saffron) - I found it lacking in flavor and a bit dry. I wasn't expecting the rice to be incredibly flavorful, but I was hoping for something. 

Where price is concerned, the appetizer and rice were decent at $7 and $5 respectively. However, the shrimp dish was $19, and I found this to be too high for 6 small shrimp that weren't cooked properly.
