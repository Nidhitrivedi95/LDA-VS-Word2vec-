KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw This is THE spot for all y'all South Asian Mississauga hipsters. Good food, old school hip hop and R&B, couches, some photo ops for the 'gram... What more could a millennial ask for?

The masala fries with butter chicken were just about the best thing I've ever had. So much flavour and texture... The fries themselves were delicious, but topped with crispy onions, butter chicken, coriander and some creamy goodness? Sheesh... I think I have to go back right now and get some more. I also got the shahi paneer naanwich, which was delicious and full of flavour.

The food here is super creative and deliciously flavourful, the vibe is laid back and fun, and the staff are great. Love it.
