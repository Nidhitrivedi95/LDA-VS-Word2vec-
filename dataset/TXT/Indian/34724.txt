Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Had come here about 8 years back and really liked the food and ambience. This time the experience was not at all good. Out of the blue they decided to not have a la carte menu and only had buffet. The reason was that they had a tourist group and hence no a la carte menu. We had walked all the way with kids so decided to go ahead with the buffet anyways. The ambience was just horrendous, people were loud and very ill mannered. They probably should have closed the restaurant for the general public. The only consolation was that the food was good.
