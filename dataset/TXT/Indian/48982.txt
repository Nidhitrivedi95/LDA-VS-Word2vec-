TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Awesome place.  We stopped in last night and after deciding to try something new.  This place hit the spot and they were also having an "Open Mic" night.  Which was kinda weird in a cool sort of way.

The owner Melque was really nice and she recommended some dishes for us.  Our waiter Rob was really great and personable.  Toward the end of our meal, Melque got up and sang a song!  

Overall this place was great!
