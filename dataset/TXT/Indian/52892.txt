v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug This place is just okay. I saw the star rating and wasn't too thrilled, but it was the closest Indian buffet that was open on Easter Sunday, where they were only serving buffet that day, and for a deal of 11.99 per person, before tax. 

The taste of the food was great!  No complaints, though i have had better at All India. There were cupcakes as dessert at the buffet. Odd. 

Service was soooo weird. The young server girl seemed terrified to get near us, took a while to refill our empty water glasses, and just looked dazed/confused/mortified by strangers.  She also disappeared when it came time to pay the check. 

Strangely enough, there was a violist playing music for the time we were there. Her page turner friend had the most bored look on his face.  We weren't sure if we should clap or not when she'd finish each song. Once the dinner crowd mostly left, she stopped playing and got a free to go box to fill up by the staff. Huh. Were we supposed to tip her, or is she just being paid in food?

Also, I noticed several times some white dudes would walk in and just go straight to the bar, order a shot and a beer or just a beer, chug it, and leave. They have a full bar, so get ready for that amusing encounter. 

All in all, I will come back here for the okay food. 

Another tip: Cell service sucks inside, and it's very dark. Street parking only!
