LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Indian food in America is like Chinese food in America: it is either really good, or really bad. Indian Paradise, in my experience there several times (dinners), falls into the really good category. Lots of great flavor from healthy entrees, breads, salads, and sauces.

I haven't tried the lunch buffet yet, but I would definitely recommend this place for a really good Indian dinner.
