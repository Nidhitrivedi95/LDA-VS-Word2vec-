r7JM2s-kkcFf47H7yl0PUw BEWARE!!! Total rip-off. I felt cheated at the end of my meal.

We were 5 people, and had ordered 5 thalis for lunch. The price should have been fixed. One of us was not able to eat any curies that were available (due to religious and allergy reasons) - and when asked the server said they would be happy to replace it with another from the menu. AT THE END, the bill charged us separately for the curry and the naan ordered for 1 of us (who had asked for a replacement curry to which the server HAD agreed).  He misguided us at the beginning and was not willing to admit he was wrong, probably scamming us. He also charged extra for the papadam - again, he served it and did not tell it was chargeable.
