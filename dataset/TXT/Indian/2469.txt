02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ For those who have come here and ordered anything lower than 7 on the spiciness scale, you shouldn't be eating Indian food in the first place. The Chinese buffet is down the road. 

That aside, my boyfriend and I have been here twice and have been blown away both times. We order the samosas, lamb vindaloo, chicken tiki masala, a veggie dish I can't remember the name of, garlic naan, and basmati. The first time we ordered a spice level of 8 and the second time 9. I'd prefer somewhere in between. 

The food makes it to the table quickly and is full of flavor. The two times we've been there for dinner, the service has been friendly and attentive, so I'm confused by the yelpers who bag on the wait staff.  We spent about 50 dollars on a ton of food (half is in the fridge to be enjoyed tomorrow as well) and it's always worth it. 

There's also a small market with a wide selection of authentic spices, marinades, chutneys and other ingredients so you can attempt to cook Indian at home.

We crave this restaurant constantly and would recommend it to anyone who thinks they know good Indian food!
