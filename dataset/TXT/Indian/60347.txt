ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Buffets are quite the norm here in this city; it's still taking me some time to get used to this fact.

If you are in the mood for some quick Indian food, Passage to India is a great place to satisfy your quest.  The food is ok, if a bit watered down.  But for about $7 lunch buffet, the food is passable.

I wish there was the more expensive lamb, which I'd gladly pay $10 for, in a lunch buffet.  

I'd come back if I was hungry and needed a quick Indian food fix.  Otherwise, I'd go to another one of my favorite haunts in South Charlotte.

Pluses for the quick, attentive service, and overall positive vibe.
