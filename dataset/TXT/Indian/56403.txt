XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw My visit to Tibet Kitchen was the first time I was trying tibetian food and I will definitely come back for more. The much talked about chili chicken is really worth it! Its different from any other chili chicken. I found the dish to be good without the gravy. The chicken was crispy on the outside but so soft on the inside! We also got momos as a starter, which were also great. The best part about the restaurant was the owner. He was very friendly, came and spoke to us, and made sure we are satisfied with everything at the restaurant. I will definitely revisit!
