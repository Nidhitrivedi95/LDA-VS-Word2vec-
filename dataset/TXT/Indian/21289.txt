GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA My friend heard about this place through the Food Network and we decided to get lunch here one day! The food was quite delicious, and the staff accommodated how I wanted to bring a cake in for my friend. The only downside would be how we attempted to order certain items, just to be told over and over that they could not make any at the time.
