zC3SVx1pfr1WujB5a6GqTg Any true desi will tell you that the ultimate rite of passage into browndome is to be able to consume brown street food without a whimper or a tear and with a smile on your face, much like the smiling faces of the clientele of Lahore Chaat and Paan House.

There are 3 reasons I adore this place:

1) Bun Kabab: Ok here goes the literal translation. Bun = Burger buns, Kabab = ground meat patty with spices, dipped in egg, pan fried. sounds simple and boring? NOT. These bun kababs pack a serious punch. The spicy ones contain a chutney that consists only of green chillies and coriander. Get a accompanying Fanta/Thumbs Up (brown soft drinks) in true desi fashion to douse the fires going off in your mouth.

2) Paan: I had to turn to wikipedia for help with this one. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paan.  Essentially consumed in South Asia as an after meal digestive tool.

3) Kulfi/Falooda: Ice cream seasoned with pistachios or almonds, cut up into pieces and served in a rosy milk concoction with shredded nuts on top. Life does not get better than this.

All of this for a grand total of $12. Yup, being brown has its perks :)
