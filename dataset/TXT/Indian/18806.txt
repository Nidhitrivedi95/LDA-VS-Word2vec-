epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg Ordered takeaway from Roti Cuisine of India after coming across the restaurant's name online and knew I would be in that area this evening.

SO good!

We had the mutter paneer roti and an order of vegetable samosa with mango chutney. So delicious. Large portion sizes and the amount of paneer was awesome. The place was full of people picking up orders. We called in our order and it was ready in less than 15 minutes on a Friday evening. 

We will definitely be eating from here again.
