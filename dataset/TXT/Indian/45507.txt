ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Came here for the lunch buffet on a Saturday after a hike at Rocky River. I loved the food in the buffet, it was very fresh tasting and I could tell the ingredients were good quality, especially for the price. The service was also excellent-- they brought fresh naan to the table for us, and the waiter was very nice and personable. I will definitely come back when I am in the area.
