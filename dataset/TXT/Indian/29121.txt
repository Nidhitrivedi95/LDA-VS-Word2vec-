JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw Flavors are ok! But there is something wrong with guys running the place. We were 2 people, reached at around 9 pm and half the place was empty. We requested to for the booths but he said he was saving the boths for a larger group. The 2 seaters were so small and placed in the center of the floor. (They really need to consult someone on how to position the tables to have enough privacy). We ordered mutton sukha and chicken biryani with medium spice level. But the food was soo spicy that we were almost in tears. In asking why it was so spicy, the guy sad this was not even medium spicy. Guys.. you really need to learn customer service. 2 stars for the flavors.
