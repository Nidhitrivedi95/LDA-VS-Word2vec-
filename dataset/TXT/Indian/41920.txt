qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Ding! It's all in the timing. In life. In going to The Red Room. 

Go ahead, choose a school's in session weekend night. See how that goes. More chairs than square footage within a place crammed full of students and I'm sure, yes, you have something to knit pick. Or go ahead, choose New Year's night. Whether you're a nerd looking to find just the right table, parents catching up with their daughter for a casual dinner, or a three set of friends looking to commiserate in a booth, this is the type of night where the Red Room will surprise you in being a sturdy parliament of wine-sipping that's easy on the dimes. 

Carafe. Wine. A litre. $18. 6+ glasses. 3 people, and I'm a lightweight, so do the math (and you other 2 can go ahead and heel click). On a quiet night there's room enough for a multicultural choir who rolls 14 deep, and a nerd date to pick just the right booth, and for us to spastic-ally spout off vulgar witticisms. Hello, time traveling worm holes you don't have to over think to find! Take that, Hawking. 

Now. You're going to remain skeptical of my positive review of this place. You'll say, what kind of Yelp review doesn't mention food and service. You don't need to care about either of those. You need to care about a booth, more mirrors than a stripper's green room, and the cheapest bottled wine you can find outside of a box. But. Yes. It's all in the timing. In life. In going to The Red Room. Ding!
