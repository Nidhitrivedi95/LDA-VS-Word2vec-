Rk82QHtWp268GM93qWj3dQ Positives: GREAT FOOD!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!! I dont think I've ever had a bad dish from this place but if I had to call one out, it may have to be their desserts...not always the greatest options there.

Negetives: They open at 11:30...not sure if that's the magic moment, but it seams a bit later than what everyone else does. This place also seams to be newer, so their process of bringing customers in, seating them, and serving them is still a bit rusty. However, everyone is friendly and the food is great so this sorta makes up for these minor flaws.
