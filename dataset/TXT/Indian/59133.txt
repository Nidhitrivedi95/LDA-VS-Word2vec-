yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Free mango lassi with checkin!! That being said, I had the lunch buffet. The highlights for me were the chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, garlic nan, and keer. The potato pancake was interesting as well. Similar to what I've had in Korean cuisine, but this one has a bit of sourness to it. There are different types of chutney and also salad. Some of the vegetarian dishes were tasty as well, but I'm disappointed there was no paneer. Overall it is good. Service is excellent as the staff was very friendly and helpful. I think we had 6 yelp checkins and they were so happy to give us our free mango lassi, so much so they even gave us an extra one. There is also pineapple n cantaloupe for those who like to end their meal with fresh fruit.
