PlJ5Tf9T4QlFQoNZf99aTg Can't believe this restaurant has been open for several years now and I've only been here starting last month! Love the owners of this restaurant. So down to earth and very friendly. 

Obvious favourite dishes include Chili chicken (both dry and with gravy), chow mein noodles, shrimp wonton, chicken pakora and shrimp pakora!!

One thing I wished they did was have a smaller portion menu (like the lunch size) available for dinner as well. Their dinner portions are quite large and is shareable amongst 2 people!
