kMgdZVLzAXM1JQwFsPXIlg Yay! I'm a fan and a big one at that. I happened upon this place during my first few days in Toronto when I was craving Indian food. This was the only place we found on Queens Quay. Tried the butter chicken roti and fell in love. 

We ended up moving closer downtown and the Church location became a staple go-to for fab tasting Indian food. Although the butter chicken is awesome, I love the Korma, Chicken Biryani and Chicken Masala as well. I'm always looking to try new things on their menu and they've never failed me :) 

Its not that cheap but the quantity they provide for the cost is pretty good. Also, usually when we order in it costs around $35ish (3 items). But I'll still keep eating here. :)
