Vu_BoGOSL70odzqCBr_vIg Came here tonight because I was getting pizza from Chunky Chicken, a few doors down.  My daughter wanted potato curry, so I walked in here to see if they had any.  

There are a few tables to eat in but I wanted to get takeout.  I asked if they did potato curry, the guy said it was the weekend special.  It was AYCE potato curry for $7.99 but dine in only.  I asked if you had a dish of potato curry to go, he said no.  But in the end he said he could do me a pot to go with 6 roti.  I paid and went to Sunny Supermarket, picked up my pizzas and went back.  I had to wait another 10 minutes in the store. 

The food itself was ok, but not enough potato.  Just don't come in here if you are in a rush.  I wasn't expecting the special of the day to take half an hour to cook, absolutely ridiculous.  I might return again, if I was in the area but driving up to Babu Babu would have been quicker than here.  Run by a nice family but it's not a very professional place.
