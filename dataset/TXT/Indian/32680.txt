LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Let me start of by saying kudos to Guru Lakshami for properly combining authenticity and innovation in their restaurant. I rarely come across a restaurant owner who does not care about making money but cares for his food quality and his customers. 
Two things done right here: Vegetarian and South Indian. The owner who also happens to be the chef has kept the beautiful Indian traditions alive and I respect that a lot. I have come across enough fake Indian restaurants who have murdered the beautiful cuisine. 
I was a walk in and was lucky to get a table. Ordered Methu Vada and Mirchi pakora at first. Sambhar done really well, Vada's crispy on the outside and soft inside. Chutney's all made by hand were delicious. Mirchi Pakora done very nice with chilli not being too hot but also telling me that "hey! I am a chilli I will be hot". Ordered the Pav Bhaji Dosa and I am in love. It was by far one of the best innovative dosa's I have had. 
To the people here leaving negative comments. You are all idiots and clearly have no idea about authenticity, because you have been eating fake Indian food all your life and simply cannot appreciate quality. Make a bloody reservation!!! How loud do they have to say that to you? They just offered me a business card just for reservations. Let me put it in a simple manner which you will understand "GOOD FOOD", "MAKE RESERVATION", "WILL BE BUSY". 
Also to top all this off all the food I had was recommended by the server and I talk to 3 servers and they all knew the food and restaurant by heart.
