Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg My family and I were craving Indian food and were pleasantly surprised by the warm yet contemporary atmosphere of Tamba, which is located right on the Strip. The aroma of the place drew us in and got our taste buds working. We ordered chicken tikka masala, fish tandoori with naan and rice. It was all very delicious - full of all the flavors you'd expect in an Indian dish - tied together with thin and crispy naan. The service was great as well - the waiters were very accommodating to every request we made for our food and water was refilled in a timely manner. Definitely returning to this restaurant next time we're visiting Vegas.
