3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Took over an hour to get 2 Cold entrees and Half cooked Naans for dinner (not buffet). With regards to taste, its average. Samosas were bland. Dal Makhani was OK and Paneer Tikka Masala is nice. Garlic naan was awful. Portions size is below average.
I'd give it a miss and try something else next time.
