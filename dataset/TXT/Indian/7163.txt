51yM2HV5lsE8Feuhvs-pGg I had their Masala Dosa and my friend had the Uttapam. Both good. They give you chutneys in jars and also Sambhar in a jug. Which means you can munch/sip as you wait for your food. I liked all 3 chutneys. Very flavourful. They have added North Indian food as well but I wanted to try their South Indian offerings. And was not disappointed. There is a lot of variety amongst Dosas themselves.

Service was good and friendly. The owner is a very gracious person. There is a lot of space inside, it looks small from outside. It is clean and roomy and they have a phone charging station as well.
