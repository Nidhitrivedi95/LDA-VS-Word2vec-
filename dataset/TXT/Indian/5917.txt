3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA What an excellent surprise!  Babygirl and I were out shopping in the area and were arguing - oops, I mean "discussing" our options along Maryland Parkway, and had finally reluctantly agreed to go to Jason's Deli, Turned out, the parking lot was jammed, it was unseasonably hot for October, and we were ready to turn that car around and go home when I remembered that the old soup place in the next lot over was now an Indian place. I admit I didn't hold out much hope, but it's a cuisine of which we are mutually fond, and I figured we could find SOMETHING good on the menu.

Yee hah! Turns out they featured the ubiquitous lunchtime buffet, so we could try it all. 
The tandoori chicken was surprisingly moist, the butter chicken rich and tasty, and the curry had a satisfying kick. There were lots of vegetarian options involving rice, lentils, spinach, etc., which I never got to. Not because I don't like them; I happen to believe that All Foods Matter, but I had slurped up so much sauce with that nice hot naan, that I had to tap out. Did manage to wash down a big glop of sweetened carrots that made a fine, if unintended, dessert.

Might have been a four star, but it's getting five because there was actual meat in all those steam table trays, not just the sauce with a few barely detectable chunks as is too often the case at Indian buffets. Good job. 

Highly recommend that next time you're in the area, skip the "Deli" and hit the "Delhi".

(Did you see what I did there? Hee hee hee).
