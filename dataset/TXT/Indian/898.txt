-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw A friend told me about this place a few months ago. They have the best Samosas in town and I love that they make them fresh. And at $1.25 each it's hard not to order lots of them. They have fresh sweets too. The lady working behind the counter is sweet and gives plenty of samples.It's worth the drive from North Las Vegas.
