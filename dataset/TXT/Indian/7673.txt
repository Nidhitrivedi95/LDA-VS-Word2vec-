63Kl0Yi5uDzfdXiiGfR2aA I was in the plaza for some south indian food (Nilgiris) and decided to see if they had a nice sweet for me after my meal.  

I was not disappointed! The quality is really good.  I only ordered 3 flavours as it was just for myself (besan, gajar and pistachio).  next time I will try the milk cake!  

As for service, they are slow.  one person in front of me and there was several people behind the counter but no one offered to serve me and the one person who was serving people, must had been training someone because all they did was follow them around, so I had to wait to be served.  I'm glad it was worth it. It took 10-15 minutes just to get served!
