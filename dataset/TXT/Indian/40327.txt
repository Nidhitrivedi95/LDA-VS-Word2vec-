pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA Prepare yourself for a bold statement: Quite possibly the best Indian buffet I've had! 

The food here was fantastic, and is the closest thing to home cooked food I've experienced at an Indian restaurant. Coming from Sri Lanka, South Indian cuisine does not stray too widely from some of our dishes and that really came out while I was eating. 

You know that moment in Ratatouille when (spoiler warning) the food critic was transported back to his childhood after tasting the ratatouille, well I had a similar experience with some of the food here. 

The right amount of spice, affordable pricing, very friendly staff and not an overwhelming choice before you makes this lunch buffet hit you in just the right spots. 

The restaurant filled up while we were there with other groups and I didn't see a single non-South Asian face. That could be because of a fact I learnt while there, which was that Anjappar Chettinad is a chain found in a few countries (originating from India) and after having experienced it, I am not surprised at why a lot of Indians covet it. I can only eagerly await my boss taking us out for another lunch here in the near future!
