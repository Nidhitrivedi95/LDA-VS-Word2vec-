B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Really good food with really, really, really, really poor service. In short, one appetizer and two entrees for two people took a total of two hours -- and 45 minutes of those two hours were spent waiting for the check.

Our server was almost nonexistent all evening. We never received refills even though our drinks were empty, and he never checked on us after the food arrived. When we were finished eating, we sat for about 20 minutes at our table while our server waited on other tables. My husband finally walked to the front and told our server we were ready for the check. For the next 15-20 minutes, we watched our server walk around and take other orders, refill waters and bus tables -- but no check delivery. We finally both went to the front, ready to go, and told him we needed the check. He printed the check, set it on the counter, then walked away to continue tending to the other tables. No "thank you," no smile, no waiting for us to sign the check and hand it back to him.

We really loved the food at Dhaba; our appetizer and both entrees were delicious. With such poor service, though, I can't give Dhaba a positive review. If I return at all -- which I doubt I will -- the visit will only be for carryout.
