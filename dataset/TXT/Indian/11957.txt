auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ buffet is great for the price (for 89123 zipcode folks) until i came across this odd situation ... well it needs to be mentioned here. 

I noticed there tandoori chicken is half cooked. not just one piece , the whole thing there. after i showed them, they immediately fixed it. Not even an Apology from the manager or the waiter. I should have taken some pictures but before i did they grabbed my plate and took it into the kitchen. Tandoori chicken is often seasoned well so you might not recognize the half cooked chicken until you see what you are eating. Tandoori chicken is one thing i like there but they ruined it for me.

I am pretty sure, its not the way indian goat curry will taste. There Biriyani is tasteless.

I like the samosa portion, very filling.

There vegetarian section is not great either.

Indians do not like to taste the rawness in the chicken. Normally they cook it to perfection in Turmeric and other spices. Americans might not notice it but Indians do. if you want to notice what i am talking about, take any chicken piece , clear off the sauce and take a bite and you will find the difference if you ever had a authentic Indian meal at a friends house.

Can not say any thing great about there desert but if its your first time go for it.

There Nan tastes good and during lunch buffet hours , they don't charge extra for garlic Nan. 

staff is very kind and courteous. bathrooms are clean.

There is no use of having a TV in there, always some decoration will be blocking your view from any side.

Summary:
Overall there is no soul in the food and i will not recommend this restaurant over other indian restaurants like India Masala (1040 E Flamingo Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89119) or Shalimar (4001 S Decatur Blvd #31, Las Vegas, NV 89103)
