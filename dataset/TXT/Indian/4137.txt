1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA As others have written, these are the BEST samosas in town. Fluffy yet crispy, not too spicy, generous potato-veg filling, and they give you two dipping sauces complimentary [mint and tamarind based] which is just alright - I prefer them with spicy mustard or a hot chutney. The pricing is really good, something like 3 samosas for a dollar which for the quality can't be beat anywhere in Brampton [or possibly the GTA]. There are a couple of different options for fresh fried pakoras which are ok but not as good as the samosas, although it's nice to have variety if you're looking to grab quick/delicious sides for a BBQ or dinner party. 

Of course they also have a great selection of traditional Indian sweets onsite, perfect for grab and go for any type of event. Their sister shop nearby offers fresh Jalebi by the pound which seems to be very popular on weekends and ethnic holidays. I know they have a decent lunch Thali special but personally I'm not really a fan of their curries as they are a bit bland and I prefer spicy Indian food. I mainly come for the samosas and sweets, but the restaurant is usually pretty busy round dinner time and on weekends.
