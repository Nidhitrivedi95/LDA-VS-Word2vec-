h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA Like most of the reviews have already stated... no one else was in the restaurant. I don't understand how they stay in business, and I assumed the restaurant portion of the building was merely a front. 

I did not enjoy the atmosphere of this place, at all. A nice woman took our order, then went to the kitchen to make it, I assume. The food was decent, actually pretty tasty. I ordered the vegetable platter, it was about 15 dollars which was twice as much as what my friend got, for half as much food. I didn't care, I thought it was pretty delicious. 

I don't think I will go back because I'm fairly sure I can find a decent indian food place with a slightly better vibe.
