FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ The first few times I went here, I wasn't very impressed by the flavors. However, it turns out that with curry, you really just need to find the type best suited for your taste! I've since discovered their Yummy Green Bean dish with red curry, and it is AMAZING. Not only that, but the fresh steamed pork buns they serve are out of this world. Only downside is that sometimes by dinner they are sold out of them, but I guess that's a good thing, since they're so delicious and everyone loves them!

We've also started trying out their Aladdin's Noodle menu in the evenings, and it's just as delicious. They house soy sauce noodles with chicken was amazing. If you haven't tried this place out, you really need to do so! I've branched out on many of their many other menu offerings (their robust wonton soup is PERFECT on a cold day), and have found many other favorites.

Their new remodel of the restaurant really freshened things up! One of the area's best curry hot spots!
