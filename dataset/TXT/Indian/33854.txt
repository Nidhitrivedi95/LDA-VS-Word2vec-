LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng Went here for lunch with my friend today. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and a Lamb Vindaloo. Not sure what other posters are mentioning regarding saltiness of flavor, the curries we had were great. The naan was buttery and soft, rice was great too. LV was more vinegary than spicy, but good. CTM was flavorful and filled with veggies. Portion sizes were just enough, would recommend a side if you're a big eater though. 

Interior design is top notch, there's ample natural lighting or darker booths if that's what you prefer. 

Service was great, the server persistently refreshed our water and was generally very attentive. 

Would come here again! For its price and flavor, I'd say this is my favorite Indian restaurant in Champaign.
