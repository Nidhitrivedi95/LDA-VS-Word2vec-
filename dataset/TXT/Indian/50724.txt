UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I want more!!! 

Ordered Tandoori Cauliflower (got medium because my friend isn't a fan of super spicy), Goat Madras and garlic rice. My friend ordered something vegetarian and I can't remember because I was super fixated on my own delicious meal. Do yourself a favor and get the goat here; it is super tender and satisfying. Our bill came to 45 bucks which isn't awful. The cauliflower was the priciest app on the menu (the other items were around 5 bucks).
I will be back.
