QMB3hmb_Yv6Vk-HLiM2cdA I am a fan of the Veggie Thali.

Came in for late lunch around 4:30 pm and the place was empty. Friendly girl at the front and another older lady in the back. They specialize in vegetarian Indian food, especially their Thali plates. You get 2 pieces of roti, 3 sides, a small salad (onion, mango, green pepers), + a semolina dessert with raisins. All for a very reasonable $9 and change.

I ordered the : Thali with
-butter chicken paneer (with cheese instead of chicken lol)
-cauliflower (my fave)
-chickpeas

Id recommend this spot for a quick lunch! Good is good. Just wish a few dishes were warmer.
