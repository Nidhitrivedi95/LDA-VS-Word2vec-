RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Just wanted to note that I have never been into the restaurant, but my boss and his wife had them cater their wedding reception. The food was fantastic. Can't wait to get down to the restaurant for more. 

(Note to other posters: the 'spice cream' is probably kulfi, which is a sort of condensed milk ice cream. Yummmm. As for the lack of beer, I wouldn't expect a halal restaurant to have alcohol! Try the lassi, it'll put out the fire better than beer anyways.)
