nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA Food is good but the two times we ordered, there were issues with delivery. Tonight was a joke- it didn't arrive after over 90 minutes. After lots of calls between restaurant and eventually driver, it seemed restaurant lied about when they have the Just eat driver the food. Manager then said the food was free and they would deliver asap- however when we called the driver again after ten minutes, he said they called him and said to bring food back to them. Absolute joke.
