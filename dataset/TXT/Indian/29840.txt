jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Oh my goodness.

Second time getting food here. 1st time was a Gyro and fries and it was great.

This time Chicken Tikki Marsala with Garlic Naan and Baklava. 

They have a nice setup inside, very nice. The girl that helped was was nice. This is definitely my go to spot. Delicious!!
