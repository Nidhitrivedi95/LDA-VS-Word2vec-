1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g I expected to drop a 5 star, but cannot. First, kudos to Subba for transforming a drug infested crime laden after hours spot into a family restaurant! Onto the food... J had the vegetarian Nepalese platter. It was spiced with garam masala which gave it a warm character and slight heat factor. The veg mix was carrot, broccoli, onion and a potato or two in a thick gravy. A large plate of rice accompanied the bowl as did two additional sauces and a pickled side dish. My lunch mate ordered a lamb dish and this is where I'm knocking off stars. Half of the meat was clearly past prime and mixed with fresher meat. That's a problem. We brought it to the servers attention and nothing was done to correct this situation. All in all this is a nice addition to East Ohio. Even my carnivore buddy said he'd come back. He just might go vegetarian:)
