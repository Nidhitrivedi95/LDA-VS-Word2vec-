xNK43KL8NRnoN9azyyrJ6A The worst customer service I have received in my life. Our chicken manchurian and chili chicken tasted the same. We order spicy deep fried fish and received pieces of soggy fish on which the fried batter was falling off. The chow Mein was extremely spicy, almost inedible. When told the server about the food, he argued to make his point. We waiting 25 mins to get ice which is kind of ready made. I went on a recommendation and was deeply disappointed. NEVER AGAIN!!
