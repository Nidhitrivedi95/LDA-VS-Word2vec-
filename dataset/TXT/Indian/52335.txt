uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA Hmm.... where to start..
Honestly.. I would never think I would try Babu... but one day running through yelp reviews and so on.., I had a craving to try biryani rice and omg.... I'm so glad I came across babuuu ;) !!

Seriously guys... if you love spicy food...  COME HERE AND TRY THEIR LUNCH SPECIAL .... 

I ordered  butter chicken biryani rice and omgggggggggg sooooo delicious.... BUT SO SPICY... its so spicy that I  couldn't take more than 3 spoons of rice/chicken every 15 minutes..  but seriously.. its so good.. the chicken is so soft and falls apart easily ... the rice is so yummy... 

the bad thing is i got a stomach ache afterwards.. Not sure if its the food or its from something else but... 

I will get it again! Because it's honestly so worth $5....  I had to split the rest of my lunch for dinner cause there was just TOO much...
