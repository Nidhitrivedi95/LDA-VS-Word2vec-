gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My boyfriend and I tried this because of a Groupon Now offer, and we weren't disappointed.  We ordered a chicken appetizer, the paalak paneer and a lamb dish we had not heard of before, along with some garlic naan.  The order was more than we could finish, even though we enjoyed every bite! Particularly, the lamb was so tender and succulent!

The atmosphere was comfortable and the owner came to greet us.  We would definitely go back again.
