afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w What is the power of a good Yelp review? Write one well enough and you'll go to the ends of the Earth to try their restaurant of choice. Or in this case, to the ends of the Toronto subway system. My lady has a Yelp crush on a Detroit reviewer. It's been a rewarding crush, as it has led us to an introduction to El Salvadorian and now Sri Lankan Cuisine. More to the point, it's changed our definition of lampries from fish that clings onto sharks to kick-ass curry stew dish.

So what is a lamprey you ask? It's a package of meat, curry, yellow rice and an egg, wrapped to cook in a banana leaf. When you open it up, it's like opening the best present under the Christmas tree. And this is coming from someone who had a Weber grill under the Christmas tree this year. Inside, you find perfectly stewed meat (chicken just waiting to fall off the bone in this case). The curry adds just enough spice to make your mouth burn without the painful need to guzzle the nearest liquid, be it soda, water, milk or lighter fluid. 

The lady, however, would argue that the chicken kottu rotti was the winning dish. It was probably the least spicy thing we ate, but it had a good flavor to it especially when it was doused with lime juice.  We also tried the #1 Hopper combo (1 Egg Hopper, 3 Plain Hoppers) with sambol, which was more for those of a spicy inclination. The hopper was almost as if an Indian restaurant hired a French chef to cook naan, and ended up with something more akin to a crepe. It was light, airy and the perfect sidekick to the spicy sambol.

For about $15, we got enough food to feed an army. We can't wait to come back and take a another trek to Sri Lanka on our next Toronto trip.
