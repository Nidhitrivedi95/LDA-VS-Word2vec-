0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ This is a small family run restaurant that has friendly service and amazingly delicious food that is more than reasonably priced. I've been a loyal customer for over a year. It always seems to be busy, especially on the weekends--expect a line up for both take out and dine in! Order food at least 30-45 mins ahead of time and if you are dining in, make sure you've had a snack. I'm a huge fan of shrimp pakoras, Manchurian chicken, and crispy beef. Request your entrees to be done "dry" (no gravy), as the dishes are already very flavorful.
