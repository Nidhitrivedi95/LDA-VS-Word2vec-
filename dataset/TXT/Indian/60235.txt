ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I am very confused on how this place has such a high rating.  The Goat curry I ordered for pick up may or may have not have actually had goat in it.  The actually curry tasted all right.  However, the "meat" was nothing but bones, fats, and tendons.  I am not the type of person to who would freak out over finding one bone in my dish, it happens.  The problem comes when I ordered goat curry and there was actually only on small bite of meat in the dish with the rest being bones and random other bits.  If they where running low on actual goat meat and had to make due they could have given me a call and I could have ordered something else.
