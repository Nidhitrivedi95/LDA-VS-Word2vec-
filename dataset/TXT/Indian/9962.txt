9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A The food really was overpriced for the small portions they passed off as being worth 15.99 the butter chicken was like a good microwave dinner nothing a small jar of butter sauce and some chicken cutlets at IGA would have probably been a better meal. Second platter was lamb vindaloo, small portion not like it mattered at this point, the sauce was too much heat for me but maybe it was ok  (I can't be a good judgment cause im not eating spicy foods like I use to to I don't have as much tolerance, but the lamb was on the chewy side. Third plate was chicken tiki masala and it was pretty good. I don't have much to compare it to but I thought it was pretty decent tasting the sauce was just enough sweet/spicy/creaminess and the Naan was fresh baked and doughy in the middle and crispy on the outside and tasted delicious in the tiki masala sauce. 
The mix rice stuff had like absolutely ZERO flavor... like it was made with a watered down flavor packet and old frozen veggie mix. Ordinarily I wouldn't know how that is suppose to taste but my neighbors wife  made me some and that shit (she owns rajastan on saint denis) and it was the bomb compared to the tasteless overpriced sad excuse this place tried to pass off.
