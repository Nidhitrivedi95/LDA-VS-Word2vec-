TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA Not very fancy in appearance. Its actually kinda ghetto looking in a ghetto small run down plaza. 

However, the chicken biryani was great. Under $7.00, and it was a HUUUUGE portion with lots of chicken in it, which is more than you can say for most Indo-Pak restaurants. 

We asked for more raita and they gave it for free (unlike Pak Centre) even though it was small and a lil runny to begin with.

The menu is quite limited also.

But what I can say was the chicken biryani was very tasty and I would return!!!

My friend is Pak and she said her fam always caters from there.
