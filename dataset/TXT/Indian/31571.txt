KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Terrible food. I don't know how to describe this food it was super sweet. Not Pakistani food that I love. None of the stuff has taste and it was bad tasting and not authentic. And the worst thing of all, is that none of the food is fresh and because all the food is cooked in the microwave. It was just plain terrible and you should never ever waste your money here.
