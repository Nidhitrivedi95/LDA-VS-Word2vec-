TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw With a coupon from Restaurant.com, $25 off $50 makes dinner here affordable for us every few months.  For four people, we order the Mixed Curry Dinner ($26) and Vegetarian Dinner ($20) plus an appetizer if we're still hungry.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite by far, and the mango pudding is a great dessert.  I love the mint chutney, but sometimes it's a little too salty.  The service is always pleasant, but often too attentive with five different waiters checking on us.  I didn't know they offer a lunch buffet, so I plan on checking it out soon!
