o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw My wife and I came here for dinner on Friday and were very pleased with our experience, especially given the dearth of good Indian places in the NW Valley. It's not strictly traditional Indian, but everything we had was good. We had the Samosa Chaat to start. The Paneer Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo were both very good as well, and I really liked the Firecracker Chicken. Similar to chicken you would get at a Chinese place, but better! Naan and rice were both fine. We'll definitely be back!
