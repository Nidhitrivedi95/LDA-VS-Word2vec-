t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Ordered take out at 6:25pm, still waiting and it's 7:40pm. We were told 30 minutes on the phone when we ordered. Not the greatest experience to sit here and wait after a long day at work. First time here so can't comment on the food yet - since I've only seen it pass by for the past 45 min.
