yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ I went here last night with a couple of friends of mine. The decor is very fancy for being so close to the Quad. The service was great... the owner was there to explain the dishes to us and help out in picking a variety of dishes. My water was being refilled after only a sip or two, which isn't really a good or bad thing. They have that same yellow rice as Bombay. They don't give much rice with the curries so I think a higher quality brown rice would be more appropriate for the prices. Overall I though it was just okay, and very much like Bombay (same owner). I had the impression that it was very middle eastern but I found no falafel, hummus, or tabouleh to eat. The menu is centered around kebabs and indian food.

I tried a variety of dishes including both curries and kebabs. I had the Lamb Makhani which was fantastic. The sauce was delicious and the lamb was cooked just right. The portion size was ideal but at about $14, it could have been cheaper. I can probably go to Bombay and get the exact same thing for a couple dollars less. The other curry that I tried was the Chicken Vendaloo. This is in the same spice family as the Makhani and is also tomato based. It had potatoes and more of a kick to it though. The chicken was tender and overall the dish was enjoyable.  I tasted two kebabs. The beef one I had, unfortunately, was tough and overcooked. The char on it from the tandoor made it quite pleasing to my taste buds. There was also a ground chicken kebab on the table which was rather dry and not very flavorful. The naan was delicious and one order kept 4 of us happy.

I'm not itching to go back, but I would go in the future to maybe try something more middle eastern, and possibly get a dessert.
