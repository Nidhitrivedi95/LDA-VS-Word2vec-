KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Pretty great food! I got the dosa burger with the loaded masala fries and cheesecake samosa and I really enjoyed it all. My friends got the Paneer lasagna special which was great, and the butter chicken Mac and cheese, Yum! Have to say I still prefer traditional Indian food, but this was different and very enjoyable. Plus the staff were super friendly which made the experience that much better. Would definitely go again!
