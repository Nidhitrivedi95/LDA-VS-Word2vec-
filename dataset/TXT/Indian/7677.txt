They also sell meat and veggie samosas which are simply amazing. You would never think that a sweet shop would sell such great samosas but I dare you to try them for yourself. Al-Karam is well known for their sweets since they are a sweets shop, but they are also well known for their samosas.

Their storefront is small but quaint. They have a takeout setup where there is almost always a lineup, no matter what time of day it is. They do all their cooking and production in the back, which makes up the majority of their unit. You can select what you wish to order from the display counters, and you're good to go. 

Very quick service once you're up, and the service is great. I've heard some reviews of bad service but I've never had any issues with them and I really wouldn't expect anyone to have any either.

If you're looking for the best Indian/Pakistani sweets in North America (seriously), or samosas which are to die for, Al-Karam Sweets is your #1 choice. A must try - you will not be disappointed.
