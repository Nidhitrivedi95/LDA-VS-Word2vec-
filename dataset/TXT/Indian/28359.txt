J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Little India on Queen St. West has been a fixture for so long I half expected to find a wiki when googling it. Restaurants that survive for this long have some kind of chemistry right and Little India is no exception. Sure the butter chicken isn't what the hardcore know and love, but this isn't Brampton, and one look outside through a spotless picture window onto Queen St. will remind you where you are. The Rex almost right across the street, and pedestrians hurrying, cars getting the hook from a tow truck, so what can you expect?
Consistency is the key to long term happiness, and one such institution is the lunch buffet with fluffy naan and sweet desserts to compliment the crispy on the outside, yet moist on the inside tandoori chicken.
But evenings are different here, mainly because of the crush of customers darkening the doorway extending the dark and moody colours onto the sidewalk. There is no room for the buffet with their galley style layout. In the past there were two Indian restaurants side-by-side but it appears Little India bought out the neighbours so the restaurant is divided by a long wall with two dining rooms and one usable entrance. When it's freezing cold out and you need some spice to warm you up, this is the ideal layout in To.
We ordered the meat combo for two, and the veg combo along with come chicken pakora for the free app using the Yelp check-in offer. (The offer had expired last year but they still honoured it).
Everything was delicious with one of my fav's being the prawns. How do they get the sauce to permeate the meat like that, yet not have it turn into a rubber ball? Just fantastic! What a nice combo meat array served on a sizzling hot cast iron platter. Like other fixtures downtown, Little India delivers.
