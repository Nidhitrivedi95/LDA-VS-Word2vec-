FlOvCwPUrRCicfbpd1tUIQ We were the only people in the restaurant and the service was very poor. Had to ask 3 times for silverware. We also had to ask twice for glasses and for water.  We ordered the spring rolls.. they did not come with any sauce. When we asked for chutney or a sweet sauce they brought out yogurt. Chicken 65 was good.. on the spicy side nothing amazing. The chow mein noodles were delicious and the Chinese chicken was good as well.. had a sweet and sour flavor to it. The restaurant itself is nice and clean. It is all booth style and they have plenty of seating. Some cute indo/pak decor. They do have tv's as well. Bathroom has 2 stalls in it, but one of the stalls was out of order. This restaurant is halal so that is a good option for all the zabiha waters! The service is slow so if you are in a rush this may not be the best place to come too!
