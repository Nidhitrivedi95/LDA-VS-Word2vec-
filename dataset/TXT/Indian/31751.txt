kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA This is one place I remember in my 2-day trip in Edinburgh. 

We pretty much found the place while walking down Bridge St. My friend, being vegetarian, called the shot.  After some sickeningly sweet and over coconutty chicken tikka masala in London, this turned out to be one of the better surprises.

We just went to the market and had picked up a couple bags of food and drinks for breakfast. The waiter jokingly asked if we bought our own food.

I had paneer masala. It was rich and creamy if a little blend. I liked Vijay's Saam Savera better, nicely spiced and flavourful.

After the trip, I talked to someone at work who has lived in Edinburgh for years and he agreed that Kalpna was one of the better Indian restaurants around town.
