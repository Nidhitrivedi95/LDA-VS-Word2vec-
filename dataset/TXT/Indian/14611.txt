C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw I could eat this food every day. I'm a big fan of roti, and indian food. This was a easy choice for me, it smelled good from the outside, it was near where i was staying.

This is a small place with only about 10-12 bar stool type seats around the place, definitely more of a quick pick type place.

I'm not sure what we ended up ordering because everything looked and smelled so good, enough said that we scoffed it all way faster that we expected, friendly people behind the counter. The roti was hot (temp) and we got ours spicy it did not disappoint. If you haven't tried it, don't wait any longer, you are missing out.
