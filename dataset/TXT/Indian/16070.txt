DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Worst food ever. We group of 10 people went for buffet -lunch on Sunday and had a horrible experience. The restaurant was not at al crowded , just one family apart from us.  Food was cold and old. Soup was cold and spicy , they had chips which had smell in them we had asked them to change it . samosa were not cooked and frozen (peas and potato inside were super cold and hard) rice and biryani was dry . cocunet chutney was completely spoilt . Dal was also not good . we had to ask them to change 3 to 5 items because of smell and bad taste. Ras malai milk was smelling. The person at the cash, said that they don't expect much people on Sunday so they dont cook and we should have called before coming so that they would have cooked the food right.manager was not apologetic. Worst indian food i ever had in charlotte. 
Would never go back.
