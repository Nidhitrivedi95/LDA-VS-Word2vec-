C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw I heard about this restaurant from the khotu fest I went to earlier this year. They had the longest line and ended up running of meat! So I decided to make note of their location and give them a try... 

Fast forward a month or so later, I got an opporjtkty to try them out at their location. There is no dedicated parking, you just need to park where you find a spot on the street. 

We got a couple Mutton Rolls and a medium spicy lamb khotu roti. The rolls were a big disappointment... They were more like potato Rolls.. Barely any mutton. Thumbs down here. 

We had high expectations for the lamb khotu - and were disappointed here as well! There wasn't enough flavor in my opinion, and the spiciness wasn't there (even though we got medium). I really want to say I'd give this place another shot sometime, but that is highly unlikely as the food just didn't leave us wanting more.
