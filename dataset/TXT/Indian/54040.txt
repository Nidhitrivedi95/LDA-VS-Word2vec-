vrAZ6qenlYwHfgzSSlmkiQ I really love this Indian buffet. The food is delicious, and they have great selection (even for vegetarians). The service is good as well. Also, the had some sort of amazing mint ice cream for dessert...not that you go out for Indian looking for mint ice cream, but I'd go back just for that!
