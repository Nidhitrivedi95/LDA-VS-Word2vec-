QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg This place is inconsistent. I am giving two stars because they should be four...meaning if they paid attention to consistency they could be good. They don't and that is really disappointing. Having potential and not living up to jt is a huge fail. 

I have had lunch when dishes were fresh. I have had lunches where the food was slop and seemed baked under hot lamps. This flux is unacceptable. Expect more from a place that purports to be a finessed Indian dining experience. Shouldn't have airport food days:)
