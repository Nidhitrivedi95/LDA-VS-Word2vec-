xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Green Chili Stew is intense and fantastic! If you can handle spicy foods- I would say that this is a must try! Only knock on this place is that it is tiny and not ventilated very well. There is a lot of grease trapped inside of this small restaurant, and you will smell like fry bread for the rest of the day. That being said, it is worth it!
