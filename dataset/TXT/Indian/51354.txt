UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ I'm reluctant to write this review because I want to see more diversity of food offerings in the area, but I gave Kabob Express a try last night and it wasn't a good experience.  I ordered the lamb shish kabob and it was overcooked to the point of being hard.  The flavor wasn't right either - far too much black pepper.  Even the side of onion rings I ordered was overcooked and hard.  I'm hesitant to give the restaurant a second chance.
