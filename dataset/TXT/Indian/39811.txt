P8Tnt4o-CruzckdhTRYD6w This place is right across from my house, so strangely, we don't normally buy food from here.  It has also changed management (?) and restaurant names 3x in the last 2 years (from Moti Mahal, to Soaltee, to current one), so that made us a bit apprehensive about ordering from here.  On Tues this week though, feeling a bit lazy to cook, we ordered from this place.  Hubby had a small tiff with the owners because their business promo on offer wasn't very clear:  the billboard outside said free dish if you order 2 dishes worth $30, the promo inside says free dish for 2 dishes worth $20, but the servers inside claims its actually free dish for 2 dish orders of $25.  The prices on the menu also doesn't tally with whatever their cash register price is, and when hubby pointed this out, the owner at the till just smiled and said 'thank you very much' but didn't clarify nor apologize nor give us any concession for the error.  Clearly, their business sense sucked, and we nearly wrote this place off as one of those places we shd never venture into again without risk of starvation. HOWEVER..when we came home and sampled our order...we had a change of mind.  The food was awesome.  We ordered chicken fried rice and the morsels of chicken were impressive, the rice not too oily, the ingredients, visible, and the overall seasoning was great.  We also ordered a fish curry and butter chicken, and both got wiped clean fast.  I guess we will just have to bear with the business' business-sense in order to avail of this tasty food.
