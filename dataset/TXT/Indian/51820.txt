UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Being from the bay area, I have Indian/Pakistani restaurants by the dozens everywhere. So, when we looked up for Indian food in the Vegas area, I wasn't having high expectations. I was surprised by what I had there. It was freaking amazing! And the cherry on the cake, it was zabihah halal. We had the following:

Chicken fried rice: absolutely awesome. The rice had a slight crunchy texture and though by concept may sound like raw, but was actually superb.

Yellow dal: the best dal I have had in the US. Period. Low in spices and full of flavor. In love with dal now.

Malai kofta: didn't care much for the kofta, but the gravy was awesome.

Chicken kadhai: wasn't bad but we had far superior food on our table.

Chicken momos: the momos were amazing but the sauce with it wasn't. I have had a lot of momos in India (my fav roadfood snack after chaat). I used to love the chilli sauce served with the momos in India. Here the momos were pretty close to the original though.

Paneer pakoda: good. Liked the sprinkling of chaat powder over it. 

Chilli chicken: was nice. Not like India, but am not complaining.

The portion sizes could be upped a notch. The half portions are way too small and the full aren't that large themselves.

The decor is nice. Not date night but better than Indian restaurant standards. The service was really good.
