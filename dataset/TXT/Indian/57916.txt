yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The Dhaba is perfect, I could leave it at that... but I wont. The atmosphere is nice I love their cutlery and plates and tables. My husband and I love their Papdi Chatt appetizer, chicken tikka masala is amazing and another dish with spinach an chicken, sorry,  drawing a blank on the name. Every time we have been there our experience has been wonderful. 

I will add one note, I am hoping this was just a fluke, but the last time we were in the owners were not there and the young Indian girl working there had on club music so loud I could not here my husband speak. At first I thought ok they just opened maybe they'll turn it off. Nope it played loudly the whole time. Also the bus girl and the Indian girl just disappeared we needed water and there was no one around, we waited 15 minutes plus for someone to get us our check, we actually had to stop the girl to ask for the check because she just kept walking by.

With this being said, we still love the Dhaba, and will continue visiting often. However if this ever happens again we might have to consider finding another place to get our Indian food.
