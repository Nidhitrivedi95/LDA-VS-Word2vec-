9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw We normally go to the Mint location on the east side. Well since we live here we decided to check the place out. It's in a shopping complex, occupies a large corner section. On entry the restaurant is impressive as it's massive( talk about thinking big ) very big buffet station( but we were not there for lunch buffet) 
It's a Tuesday night so not as busy and we got seated right away. Seems like there were two servers and two bus boys. Our orders were taken and we ordered out food. Seems like people were waiting a long time for their food. 
Tried the regular samosa chaat( good) and stir fried lamb( asked for 10, the spiciest but when it came it it was rather a 3 at max) waiter said since its appetizer the sauce will not be too hot; I've had it much spicier at the East location. Oh well who cares it was still good. 
I ordered the Masala paper dosa and it came out first before our other food so I had to wait and not be rude and eat. Well when the dosa came out, it was not crispy around the corners and was rather soggy. Didn't enjoy it at all. 
Naan was good/ so was butter chicken. 
Overall being that it's new, I wasn't disappointed but not impressed either. I could have driven a few more mins and had what I always had at the east location. Oh well. Hope with time, the chef gets the food right so we can come back again.
