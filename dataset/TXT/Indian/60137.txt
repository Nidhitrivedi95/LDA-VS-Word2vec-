zKSKmkBxfrltJau_4s1ZHA This place is my new fav for biriyani. It's a quaint little place in Glendale with friendly staff at the front desk where you place your order followed by self service.Its not just their biriyani that's my fav but also their chicken chettinad curry. Lunch portion is quite good. This place to close to work and so I plan to come here often. I took the leftovers home and my husband just gobbled the rest .
