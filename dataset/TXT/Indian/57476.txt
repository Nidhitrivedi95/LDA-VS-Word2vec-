YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw On the hunt for some Indian food away from our usual stomping grounds, we decided to hit up Persis, out Ballantyne way. Turns out it was a good choice - but only after we had a stumbling block (perhaps even a rather large stumbling block) in the form of the first waiter. The problem was he had no idea what he was serving - may not have even realized that he was working in an Indian restaurant.

Luckily the manager/owner/someone off the street rapidly walked over and began explaining the history of Indian food - at least Persis Indian food, or something that we could believe as such - and wham! the night was saved, just like that.

Would the food itself have been as good without this save? Probably. But it was made a whole lot better with it, especially such items as the cauliflower appetizer that we may never have spotted, and the personal touch that we had thereafter. Definitely made it just a wee bit better, so even though it wasn't bad before, grab this guy if you can.
