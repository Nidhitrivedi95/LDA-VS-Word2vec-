AyAnxKMDJedvuMCRXE2YCg Checked out this bar on Saturday afternoon.

Forgot the bartender's name but he was cool peoples. 

Told my friend and I about the nightlife, little bit of the culture of the city, some places we should visit, things like that.

We returned later that evening to a nice packed bar(25-35 people). People playing Poole, music on the joop box, very much  a dive bar atmosphere but awesome time all the same.
