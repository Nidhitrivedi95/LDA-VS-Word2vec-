OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This place is catered towards non-desis (Americans). Everything from the way they serve the food to giving forks and knives but no spoons shows this. 

The decor is nice and the place is one of the cleaner Indian restaurants I've been to. 

The paneer tikka is one of the best I've had in the U.S. Samosa was okay. We did have a confusion with the waiter who accidentally gave us 'Paneer Tikka Masala' which was more like Tomato purée. Nevertheless they fixed it right away with some Palak Paneer which was low on salt. They fixed that right away as well and the second one was awesome. The place does have bottomless curries which is great!
