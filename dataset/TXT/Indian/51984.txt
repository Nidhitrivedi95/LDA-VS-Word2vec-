UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I have eaten the lunch buffet about 6 or 7 times before and decided to Yelp my most recent visit.

Really enjoy the cool and laid back vibe at Mint.  The lively Bollywood style background music adds a nice touch. Also, the creative art on the walls contributes to an air of whimsy.

Now, onto the food. The buffet starts out with a small but nice selection of simple lettuce salad, various chutneys (mint and mango are my favs) and plain yogurt to tamp down the heat of the curries which aren't really that hot anyways.

While I didn't try all the the entrees, a few of my favorites included: Paneer Tikka, Veggie Korma, and Chicken Tikka.  The basmati rice is always a nice addition and works well under the entrees.

I always look forward to the garlic naan bread and it did not disappoint. Just a nice pillowy, but crispy bit of deliciousness. Yum!! I'll take another order please! And another...so addictive.

Found the servers to be attentive and courteous. They are always sure to bring another carafe of ice water.  All restaurants need to have carafes of water as it's a major time saver for the servers and keeps customers happy. 

Can't wait to return, but could do without the three children who kept screaming during my lunch.
