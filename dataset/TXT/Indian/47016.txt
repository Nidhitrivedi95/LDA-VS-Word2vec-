t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q We first tried Hakka King with a Groupon and loved it so much that we came back two more times in recent months.  They have very reasonable lunch specials for $6, but even their entrees from the dinner menu are excellent value.  Portions are very generous, and the food has just the right amount of spice and heat!  We love spicy food, so this restaurant is perfect for us.

Recently, we came for a birthday, and the servers were so kind and friendly that it inspired us to write our first Yelp review.  Simran was our server, and she was very good at recommending dishes, advising us that any of the dishes that are marked as Chef Recommended [CFR] are worth trying.  She also mentioned that the Chef has cooked in India for a number of years.  We tried the Bombay Mutton, Manchurian Tiger Shrimps, and Chili Chicken with gravy.  The mutton was delicious and spicy, and there was a complexity to the sauce that we loved.  The tiger shrimps were also huge and spicy!  The chili chicken was crispy, and the gravy was very good with onions.  Each entree came with its own complimentary scoop of rice which we appreciated (since most Chinese restaurants tend to charge for rice).  

At the end of the dinner, we were very surprised when they brought out a slice of yummy cheesecake with a candle for the birthday person in our party!  Not to mention, the birthday person got their entree free.  Overall, the great service and delicious food makes Hakka King one of our new favorite go-to places for Hakka food.
