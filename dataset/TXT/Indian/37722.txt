OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg After spending the day at the ROM, I needed to find a place nearby before I headed off to a baseball game. I wanted something decently priced, as well as sit down. I looked around on yelp and found this restaurant! I decided to give it a try and I'm very happy I did. Since I was getting an early dinner (530 pm), I was one of the first people in the restaurant and was sat right away. I ordered the matar paneer, butter naan, rice, and mango lassi. Everything was very delicious and the naan were huge pieces, so you could share it easily with two to three people. I think if you got what I ordered, minus the drink, it can be split between two people! The service was great, too, as my water glass was always filled and the servers were attentive and nice! I highly recommend eating at The Host!! Lastly, the price of the meal was perfect. For everything I got, it was CA$26 and I know I will get another meal or two from my leftovers.
