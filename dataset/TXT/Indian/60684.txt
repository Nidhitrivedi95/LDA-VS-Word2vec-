zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q If you're looking for a little piece of Afghanistan heaven, KH Chicken Boti with rice is where it's at.  I get it to-go on the reg, at least once a week; 3 times if I'm lucky. My life is more complete with this rice...I'm actually eating it at this very second.  The staff is all very kind, too. Don't mind the so-so parking and bus stop outside...curb appeal doesn't matter when Chicken Boti is concerned.
