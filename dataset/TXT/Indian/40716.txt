PX1g0RQIdVdsJI9b6ATsgQ the service was very bad and it's bloody expensive. one worker there was disrespectful and didn't acknowledge me once. she probably hates her job. also she has no social skills whatsoever. also they need food upgrade. and the bell is broken, so you have to ring it 5 maybe 18 times to get noticed.
