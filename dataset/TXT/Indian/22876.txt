gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is my favorite Indian resto to go to. I was a little intimidated by the surrounding area but this restaurant definitely worth checking out. This is my second time here and I love the food. Chicken vindaloo and the chicken korma are very delish! My 2yr old is a picky eater and he was totally tearing up the cheese naan and chicken korma. The mango lassi is one of the creamiest drinks I ever had. The service is great and staff is very friendly. I will definitely come back for more!!
