-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw I was visiting Montreal from the US and happened to discover this little know spot. The platters are more than a complete meal (with only the dessert missing) with large and testy portions at great prices.  Being close to McGill and Corcordia the restaurant  keeps the prices low as they cater primarily to students.

Decor is simple and very low key but the restaurant, tables, utensils etc are clean and not getto. 

Coming from NY where there is no shortage of Indian Restaurants I was impressed with this place. If you are craving some good Indian food without breaking your budget try it out. You wont be disappointed. Tasty food atreasonable prices.
