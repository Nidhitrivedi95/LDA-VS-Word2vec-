DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ This was our first visit to Sangam for the buffet.  It was simply fantastic.  We tried everything on the buffet.  All was prepared and presented very well.  The ambience was very nice.  Nice decor and very nicely arranged tables.  The best part was the food.  Everything was very good.  I thought I had experienced the best buffet north and west of I-85...I was wrong!
I will be back again and again!!!
