eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Really delicious. The butter chicken is soooo good. The samosas we ordered for an appetizer were really fresh. And the garlic naan is an absolute must addition to any meal. I've tried many Indian places through out the USA, and this is among the best of them. You should go, don't even think twice about it.
