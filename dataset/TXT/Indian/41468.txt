The menu also delves into southern Indian cuisine which I've never seen elsewhere.  

The servers actually care whether you're happy and do a good job.

Like others have mentioned, the atmosphere is a little bizarre but the very diverse crowd usually dining there makes it feel like a 'big city' restaurant.  

One of my favorites in Madison.  Did I mention that its cheap?
