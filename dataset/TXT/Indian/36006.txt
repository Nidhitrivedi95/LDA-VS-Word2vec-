NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ By far the best Indian food I have eaten in Cleveland so far. The flavors are so well developed and the dishes are truly delicious. The pricing is so reasonable too. Have recommended without reservation to any Indian native coming in town (who all vouch for its authenticity), or anyone for that matter! If you can't handle hear, be sure to request it be made mild. Most dishes are quite spicy. Have loved everything we've ordered from here: chicken biryani, lamb korma, chicken vindaloo, chicken 65, samosas, samosa chat, etc.
