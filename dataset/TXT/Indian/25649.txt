hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw The food I've tried is so/so but nice decor and the owner and staff are very friendly.  

The naan can be hit or miss here.  One time it tasted like pita bread (maybe they ran out?) and another time it tasted like OK naan out of the tandoor.

The Chick Tikka Masala is decent.  Vindaloo is not great, in fact most of their curries (like the Mantra Masala) taste alike just different heat levels.  Have tried the tandoor mixed grill and it was satisfactory.  The malai kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup.  

Also, one thing I noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned.  I read somewhere that most Americans consider Indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that?  Not sure.  But I always have to add salt to the entrees.

Pricing is a kinda high and they charge you a lot for every little thing - rice, raita, mango pickle.
