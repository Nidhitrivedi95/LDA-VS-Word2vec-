iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA First time to Marigold Maison and will definitely be back.  Have searched all over Phoenix for great Indian food and have finally found it!  Love southern Indian given lots of good heat and spice.  Had the Dosa Masala (outstanding) and Lamb Vindaloo (equally outstanding).  Gina was our server and she was phenomenal.  A true asset to Marigold!  Thanks for an outstanding meal - we will be back for sure!
