GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Very good tasty food. Not too spicy for my taste. Compare to Little India, a little too spicy for me.

Here r what we ordered:
Spinach Dosai, if u r into spinach
Chenna Batura, 5 stars for me
Mini Masala Dosai, big portion, 4 stars for me
Paneer Butter Masala, 5 stars, taste like meat dish but it is not

We will try other stuff on the menu for our next visit.
