x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA My Mom and I decided to have a girls day today, starting with massages and ending with Indian food on a whim. My mom said that she hated Indian food, but then it came out that the last time she had had it was 20 years ago, so we decided to give it a shot. The place is dark and a little run down, but once you get past that it is a decent place. We split the chicken tikka masala thali with garlic naan and a mango lassi. The drink was really tasty and my mom loved it! The chicken was good, but it wasn't as good as I have had it other places and it wasn't that spicy. The sauces that came with it were all pretty good. For dessert it came with a little fried donut thing that was sorta chemically tasting...not my fave. Overall, the place was good, it just didn't measure up to other places I have tried BUT it did change my mom's opinion on Indian food, which is awesome!
