P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA By far the best indian buffet in Toronto. A solid 4 as far as Indians buffets are concerned, but a 3 for their made to order food. 3.5 overall.

I usually go there for the buffet, which is far superior to the generic stuff dished out by Little India and somewhat better than Trimurti's. Went there as recently as two days ago, with some friends visiting from India who oohed and aahed about the quality of the buffet spread: the gooey samosa filling, the succulent lamb kebabs, the tender okra, and the divine rice pudding (their dessert is always on the mark and without the accompanying artificial sweetness).

The service is friendly and attentive: the owner has chatted us up every time since the very first time we went. The restaurant's a bit on the cozy side and the decoration nothing fancy. I've always enjoyed my meals here and I am not going anywhere else on Queen St. for Indian food.
