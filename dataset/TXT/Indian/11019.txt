A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ This place was great! Lots of delicious choices, with a lot of the choices not being too spicy, as well as friendly amd welcoming staff.

The environment was also quiet and relaxing. Simple decoration but a comforting place in general. I would definitely recommend this place for its food and IT'S BUFFET PRICE. Man oh man, I am stuffed :p
