BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ That's some tasty Indian right there.

Chicken tikka masala (like butter chicken but with some heat and sweet peppers), mutter paneer (cheese chunks with peas in tomato/onion sauce) and daal panchratan (soft yellow lentils spiced with tumeric).....all good baby.

The naan here is also exceptional...it's got just the right amount of chew. You could say it's..."second to naan"...

K thanks bye :)
