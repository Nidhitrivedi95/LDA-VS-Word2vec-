JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng They have a buffet at lunch time and a full menu at dinner. The buffet is a great stop over and this is the only Indian food in the Concord Mills area. They have truly first rate Indian food. The service is great too. Dinner here is really good. I like the Chicken Marsala, it was delicious and just the right amount of spiciness.  This is one of my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte.
