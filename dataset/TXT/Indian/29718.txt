jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg This is fast becoming one of my favorite restaurants. We are here every other week, and have not found a dish we didn't like. The Chicken Tikki Masala and the Chicken Bryani with Garlic Naan are what we usually get. The spice levels are always right on with our tastes. The two servers we regularly see are very nice, and are always ready with a recommendation of something new to try.

It's always quiet, with only a handful of tables full at any given time, but that makes it a nice place for conversation, versus some of the busier places in Old Town.
