This is like actual food. Not restaurant food, oversalted and overcooked and lukewarm under the heat lamps. This is homecooked food. I can actually taste the peas and paneer. Most Indian restaurants oversalt and overseason to the point where you can't taste the food. 

This is just awesome. Four stars for now, just for the quality of the food. (Prices are good too, $7 and change for a very substantial 'small' curry on rice.) There may be more stars later as I try more stuff there.

Practical stuff: there are no stairs to get in but the door is a bit narrow. Folks with wheels can probably get in, although I wouldn't be too sure about big scooters. The menu items are marked if they're V (vegan) or GF (gluten-free). There's very little seating inside but they do large orders for business lunches. Debit, Visa, and Mastercard are accepted as well as cash.
