b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Verryyy impressed by Namaste's Southern Indian cuisine!

I admit, when I think of Indian food, I often think of your typical Tikka Masala type.  I eat it quite a bit, but that's generally what I think of.

Namaste was refreshing in that it was different!  I brought a large group and we sampled a wide selection of foods.  We looooovveed the South Indian dishes - which we used as appetizers.  The Dahi Vada was indeed a donut in yogurt sauce.  I really liked the Punagalu balls served with coconut and tomato chutney.  There were plenty to share and had a really nice taste.  (and they too tasted great with the yogurt from the Dahi Vada)

For the main entrees, we tried a few of the Kormas and Curry's and the winner was Chettinad.  It had a deep stewey taste and nicely complimented the lamb or goat that we paired it with.  They were all good though!  

In short, this may well be my new favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland.  That's saying something!  

Service was great and with our larger group they were even happy to split the check.  Bonus points there, Namaste - so thank you!
