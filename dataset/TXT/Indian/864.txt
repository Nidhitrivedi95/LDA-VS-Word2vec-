-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw This city has a million ethnic specialty grocers: this one stands apart from the pack a little. In addition to a smorgasbord of Indian spices, rices, and teas, they have jewelry, accessories, and some kitchenware as well.

Food sections also include  Mediterranean aisle and a British/English foods row. Unfortunately, the produce is not particularly fresh but they have tons of sweets from nearly every culture here.

The food counter on the right hand side of the store sells vegetarian indian foods: mostly paneers, dosas, and chaats. The samosas are tasty and the chutneys and other sauces are no joke. Pricing is good, just wish they offered a bit more and weren't necessarily limited to a vegetarian menu.

Insider note; they have 6 locations of Rani's, this is the only one in LV and there's another in Houston with the rest in California.
