Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Came here on a Wednesday night around 7pm. It was very quiet, but started filling up a bit by 8. The food was fine but came out a bit slow (not buffet style) and everything was mild for my tastes even though I asked for the food to be spicy. My parents loved it.
I liked the tandooori sampler. The lamb vindaloo was tasty. The paneer tikka masala had a very mild creamy flavor. The garlic naan was what I expected: naan with garlic. Can't go wrong there. Other condiments were served at the table and were fine. 
The service was very polite and I really appreciated it, however our bill was delivered to the table next to us. All the dishes were little pricy for me; it was $4 for just plain white rice. My family liked the food overall though, and the location is convenient.
