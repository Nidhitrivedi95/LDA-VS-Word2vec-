kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w We had been here once before and had found the food rather bland so did not have very high expectations. However, was pleasantly surprised.
We came in for the Sunday buffet.
They had a nice variety of dishes and everything was good. The chicken tikka and tandoori chicken really stood out. Good stuff.
Looking forward to come back and try the a la carte.
Also, did i mention...unlimited mango lassi with the lunch buffet. :) :)
