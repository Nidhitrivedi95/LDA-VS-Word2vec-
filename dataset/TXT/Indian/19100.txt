f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I have had very little experience with Indian cuisine and this place wad the absolute perfect introduction. I loved that they offered a small buffet option. It was a great opportunity to try a breadth of different foods at one time. It seemed extremely authentic and the owner was extremely personable and helpful. The food was delicious and we will definitely be back.
