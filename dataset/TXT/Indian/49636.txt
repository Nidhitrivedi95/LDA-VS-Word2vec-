tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Sunday buffet is delicious and well-priced.  Not too spicy--which is great for me, because now I can enjoy the food and not suffer for hours afterwards.  Meat AND vegetarian choices--hooray!  Garlic Naan is delicious.  Service is rapid and pleasant.  Everything tastes SOOO GOOD . . . and I am not a big fan of Indian food.  But I guess I am now!  These folks really deserve a shot at your business!  Comfortable and well-decorated interior.  We'll definitely be back!
