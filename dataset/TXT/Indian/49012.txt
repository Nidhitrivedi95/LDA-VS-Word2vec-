TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw I have been to many many place and tried various Indian Restaurant and this can be ranked the top in terms of
- Pathetic Customer Service
- Horrible quality of food
- Worst Customer Service/ under staffed...
- Shabby decor
Still trying to think if there was anything good that I could write regarding this restaurant

Here are some more details

1. We wait for 10 minutes before Glass of water was served.. oh and best part had to call two to get some water refill....

2. The waitress (I think also the owner) was so cold and promptly said they have none of the appetizers that we wanted as they were running very busy however the place had not more than 10 people at around 6:30 pm.

3. Finally ordered food and mentioned that it should be mild as my little one was eating. Food was awful (wish there was any worse adjectives to explain this) and was spicy.

4. Oh the best part, food arrives after another 40 minutes.

5. Now the food
- Cold
- Rice was lumpy and yellow and tasted weird.
- The naans - Tough, full of flour and bad.

Guys and Gals if you still think that you want to try this??. I understand Indian food and suggest you never visit this if you nothing else to do and waste money. This is something I never right. but the service and lack of even remorse or feel bad was far from being even thought off.

Finally the best part, they donot even have a pen to sign. I had to go to the counter to get the check after waiting for another 10 minutes.

I am sure if health department made a surprise visit even more fun stuff could be revealed.
