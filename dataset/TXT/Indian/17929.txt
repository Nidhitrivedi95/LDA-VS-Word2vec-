ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ This is easily my favorite southern Indian vegetarian buffet restaurant in the Toronto suburbs. The main vege menu changes daily but the staples like dosa and poori are reliably the same and deliciously fresh. My favorite has to be their vadas-- so light and airy, it soaked up all the piquant spices on my plate just so that the burst of flavors would be delivered in one bite.  I can't say that I've had anything bad there and highly recommend all to check it out. 
Seating is very comfortable but when it does get crowded, you are expected to leave within 30mins (as instructed by a table notice) The wait staff are very polite and helpful but don't expect them to check up on you every 10 mins. Who wants that anyway??
