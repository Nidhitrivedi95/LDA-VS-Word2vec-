nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Absolutely refreshing experience...The simple menu choices makes eating dinner not a complicated affair especially when you've had a long day at work, but an easy and pleasant one. There's nothing as refreshing as starting with a nice bowl of tomato bisque, light in texture with a sweet undertone. Left me waiting for my next course...which of was pan seared salmon...I was watching my meal being prepared...and surely my dish showed up to my table in no time. If I were to judge by looks alone this was going to get 5 stars, however after the first few bites...nothing but affirmation that these guys know exactly what they are doing. The simplicity of the salmon garnished with vegetables was a compliment to the first course. The salmon was paired with a five vegetable pasta with a basil pesto sauce....I am not one for combining Salmon and pasta, however the pairing worked here...the vegetables brought all the flavors together to make this one balance entrée. I was left struggling to find room for my dessert (Mango Panna Cotta).  The dessert was pleasant but that's me being slightly biased. Anything that taste like custard to me always gets a pass.  
The icing on the cake is that I was able to enjoy all this for just $25.....I'll be coming back for sure!
Thanks Bernard for recommending
