Items are good and tasty. Especially chilli chicken is tasty, staff are friendly. I ordered white rice with Chilli Chicken, lamb curry , chick pea curry for $9.62 . Lamb curry pieces are smooth but taste is just ok, chick pea curry is good and chilli chicken is awesome. Rice is basmati rice. I would recommend to others.
