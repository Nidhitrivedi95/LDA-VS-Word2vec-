C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Kalendar Restaurant continues to impress.  We have gone here over the years for brunch and dinner, and we never leave disappointed.  We love, love the "Warm Apple Walnut salad" -chopped apples and walnuts sautéed in a sweet brandy sauce over chevre cheese on a bed of greens.  

We also adore the "Scroll Three": oven roasted chicken, sugar snap peas & carrots with a sweet curry sauce.  Going back soon to try the Lobster Ravioli!
