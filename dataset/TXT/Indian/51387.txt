UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I come here every time I'm in town and always bring new friends who leave very happy.  The various nan are always fresh and hot. The lunch buffet is well stocked and has something for everyone and great value.  Parking  in retail plex is not very welcoming but don't let it stop you.
