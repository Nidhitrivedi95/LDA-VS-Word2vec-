Sd1UqBycilIJO-m9Cmmz8g I really wanted to like this place as it's very near to my house and I love Indian cuisine. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

I tried the buffet lunch and was not impressed. The tandoori chicken was really dry; the butter chicken was too sweet and the chicken tasted like the cheaper thigh meat, rather than chicken breast.

There were a few vegetarian options but nothing particularly tasty.

There are definitely better options in the area. I will not be returning.
