GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA SO GOOD! my husband loves diners, drive in's and dives and when we saw this place reviewed and realized it's five minutes from where we live, we decided to go there today for lunch. I'm not a super adventurous eater, but this was AMAZING!
Awesome service.......our servers were attentive, helpful and helped us order! 
We will FOR SURE be back!
