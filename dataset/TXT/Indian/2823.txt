0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw The customer service is great. If you're on the west side, go here for the lunch buffet, there are a lot of choices. The food is alright. I just think they are afraid to make their food spicier because some people are wimps and can't handle a little heat. Indian food is supposed to be a little on the spicy side! It can still be spicy and flavorful without it being too hot, the food is just plain mild! Not much variety with spice. I get bummed because they used to have butter chicken in the lunch buffet, but now it's always chicken tiki masala. It's okay, but I like the butter chicken more. They used to have these really tasty meatballs in the buffet as well, but the last 2 times I visited, they weren't there. Bring those back! 
I also enjoyed the tofu matar curry- mild but very flavorful! 

Dinner: I don't recommend dinner here because the prices are ridiculous. Charging extra for rice is lame because rice is not that expensive and most Indian restaurants usually give you rice with your entrée. It's stingy and not very smart for business!

Overall, India Garden isn't bad. The service is great! The people who work there are very nice. The food in the buffet is good, but it definitely seems more mild than other places, so if you prefer your Indian food on the mild side, this is your place!
