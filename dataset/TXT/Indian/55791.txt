X9sDrd6Uia0uQFFKwwQcJg To sum up the food experience, i have to say that i've had better.  I went to try out their lunch buffet.  The restaurant was clean as it was still showing the Grand Opening sign out front.  The buffet options was not very impressive.  They had veg. pakora (cold) and no samosa's.  Their meat options were Chicken Tikka Masala which was very dissapointing.  It was a tomato base with absolutely no spices.  It could have used some garam masala and some ginger and other indian spices.  It tasted like tikka masala out of a jar.  It just did not give you a sense of any effort was made.  The tandoori chicken was also bland with absolutely no flavor.  Again, where is the Indian spices?  The vegetable dishes were saag paneer and dahl fry which were both ok, but no Aloo Gobi??  I have to admit the basmati rice and garlic naan were the best thing there.  Another big disappointment was the Gulab Jamun dessert which was ice cold.  I prefer the honey syrup to be warm....as if it was frozen and just defrosted.   Basically nothing, other than the rice and bread tasted home made.  I will definitely not be back!
