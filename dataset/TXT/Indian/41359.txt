Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ We came as a group of 25 for dinner. We initially didn't know the restaurant only seats around 35 people, so we took up most of the restaurant. The service staff were very patient with us throughout the night despite the difficulty of us ordering a la carte instead of from a prix fixe menu. Understandably the kitchen was a bit swamped, but the food was still very excellently prepared.

We tried a lot of their appetizers, and the group seemed to particularly enjoy the fish tikka and murg malai tikka. I had the Goan fish curry paired with lachha parantha and it was simply exquisite. The curries are probably not that spicy, but still very aromatic and flavourful. Overall, a delightful experience at very reasonable price, especially considering its location in Yorkville.
