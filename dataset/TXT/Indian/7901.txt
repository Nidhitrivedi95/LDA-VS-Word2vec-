6P4ZzCdd_YQqncnQv1jplQ Hi All,

At first it appeared to be a decent place, was even impressed with it. But then there's this list of things happened which made me think otherwise, would NEVER visit that place again !

1. The owner was pretty rude and arrogant, I was taken aback ! Hospitality goes in the trash ! Wonder how he is running the place !

2. Chicken tandoori was soaked/floating in water in the tray. The artificial red/pink color made it quite repelling !

3. Palak paneer was no good.

4. All variety of chicken curries tasted almost the same, just with different shades of red.

My huge turn off was the attitude the owner had towards his customer ! This reviews being long overdue actually.

Hope it helps !
