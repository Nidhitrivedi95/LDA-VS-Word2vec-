o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Went to pick up my food that I called in and the guy behind the counter acted like he was doing me a favor! Seriously ? You are in the service business you might want to tone that attitude down. I get it that we all have bad days but you are in the wrong line if you want to be an *bleep* to the paying customer. The food itself wasn't too bad but I might stick to Persis in Ballantyne where they are at least friendlier.
