t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Been to a few other Indian places in town and tried this place for lunch. Wasn't as good as the other places and had a poor selection for there buffet. Service wasn't too good. Asked waiter for drinks which never arrived. After asking him for our drinks he said he was backed up. Besides our table of four people there was one other table which he spent a great deal of time conversing with and obviously forgot our drink order. We cancelled our drinks since we were done eating. He didn't offer more water since that's all we had to drink. In all poor service and subpar food. Most likely won't be going back to experience dinner.
