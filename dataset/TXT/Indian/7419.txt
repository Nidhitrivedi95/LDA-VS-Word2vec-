5OHW43gqdoWOGWDmUmps6A I just discovered this amazing place!! The food here tasted homemade, fresh, spice, delicious. I always pass by here and the spice from inside always feeds my mind for some indian food cravings. The interior of this place did not look appealing to me so i always just walked by not in. I finally caved in and went to this place and purchased the vegetarian combo platter. It was around $12 the portion was huge!! Could literally eat for 2 people. The naan was delicious when dipped with the chickpea concoction. The service was from mom and pop but they were excellent and detailed. I opted to eat in. I cleared everything in my dish and was full. I opted to come the next day and the day after. It was that delicious. I would definitely come back again for lunch or early dinner. It's a hidden gem and great find in my books.
