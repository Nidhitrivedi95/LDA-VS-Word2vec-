LZWXP-D4YPlzsFjVx6b9XA I really enjoy coming here for the weekend buffet, and there is so much variety for someone to be content. 

Oddly, sometimes they will make you dosa and sometimes not upon your request. 

Service isn't all that great. 

The biggest downside is that the price is a bit high for a buffet, so be sure to eat as much as possible to get your money's worth.
