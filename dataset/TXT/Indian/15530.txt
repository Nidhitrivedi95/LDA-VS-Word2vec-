cu1CvIzOyf-R91pT92NShw The Anjappar Chicken Masala really tested the limits of my tolerance for spicy Indian food. It was full of flavour, but damn was it spicy. Their paratha was absolutely divine, serving as a perfect companion to the Anjappar Chicken Masala gravy. Overall the food was alright at this place. The service was prompt, courteous and friendly. I'm not sure I'd be back necessarily. Next time I'm in Mississauga, I'd be more tempted to check out one of the myriads of other good Indian restaurants since this one didn't impress me that much. I haven't tried their buffet, as it was closed, but it could very well be worth the money. Their buffet prices are very reasonable.
