nbf4o8gUP2y9JKFE2wBO2A For ten dollars I had rice, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, paratha (pardon my spelling if I'm wrong), and a soda.  Affordable, delicious, and quick.  It is take out only, which wasn't a huge problem since I was walking distance from my hotel but it is why I'm only rating 4 stars.  Be prepared for heat, but I was warned by the lovely girl at the counter about the chicken tikka.
