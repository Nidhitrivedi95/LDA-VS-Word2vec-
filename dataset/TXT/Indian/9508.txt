8NRrrHLOWgEq4NUAcv55Cw - FOOD: 5/5. OMG!!! The food tastes amazing. They offer medium and large portions for your convenience. My wife and I ordered 2 medium veggie dishes + rice + garlic naan and we were thoroughly full afterward. The food was genuinely tasty with a rich combination of flavours that you can expect at a more upscale Indian restaurant. Honestly, it's truly a gem IMHO, because from the outside and inside this place looks pretty sad, but the food is top notch.

- SERVICE: 5/5. The service was friendly and helpful. Aman, the guy who served us was courteous and prompt. No complaints whatsoever about the service at this restaurant.

- INTERIOR: 2/5. The interior feels like a remodeled cheap and tacky roadside sports bar. The hideous LED lights inside were giving me a headache. They were absolutely awful, even though they're probably saving the owners money on electricity bills every day. They could have at least opted for the daytime-type LEDs, not those blue-ish bright ones. The washrooms are gross. Old and dark. I hope the owners of this place invest some money in a proper reno. It badly needs a reno of the main dining hall and the washrooms. Perhaps, 80% of this restaurant's clientele are not so demanding like I am and perhaps it doesn't bother them as much as it bothers me. If I can provide some advice, I'd suggest taking design cues from the amazing interior of Bhai's Indian Canteen (8-115 York Blvd, Richmond Hill). The owner of that place really put his heart and soul into creating a modern and welcoming atmosphere at his restaurant and I applaud him for that.

Bottom line: If you don't mind the tacky interior, you won't be disappointed in the food.

THE BEST PART: This place is open until 2am 7 days a week. :)
