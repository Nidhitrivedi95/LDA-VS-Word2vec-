They also let me know that 7 days a week they have a buffet from 11 am to 3pm.  Great way to be able to try some new stuff!  So happy to find such a great Indian place in my neighborhood.  It was reasonably priced and the service was fantastic.  It was about $35, but the portions are good.  That's two meals for me.  I even heard the guys at the table beside me saying how good their dinner was.  Will definitely go back!
