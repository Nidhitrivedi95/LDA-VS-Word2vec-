I've only really had a few of the curries, naan, and one of the fried triangular things (made from chickpea batter and something else) but every time it's been delicious. I have cravings for it every now and then. 

They have waiters here, which I didn't expect from a smaller restaurant like this. 

I think I would come more often if the prices were a little lower.
