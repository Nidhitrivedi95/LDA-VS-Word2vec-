g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ Coming from scarborough/ markham, my fiance and I were scared to not have good indian food in our area. Fortunately we found bhukara through a random yelp search when we first moved into our house. Located right on bloor is this underground (literally) indian restaurant. It is difficult to find at first glance since it's only a single walkway down to the basement but once you are in you can't really get lost.

We've dined in twice and ordered take out many times. The last time we dined in we got the panner tikka tandorri and also got the green chicken (tandorri). Both came out hot and delicious. Portion size were fair as the chicken we got about  5 big chicken breast and panner we had 5 big slices. The flavours were bang on and was so delicious when hot. The only down fall to this dish is I wished they served it on a sizzling plate instead of a regular plate.

For mains we usually get their butter chicken (spicy) and palak panner. Both are very good dishes and we never are disappointed with them! We've also had their aloo golbi and that is also really good and have a good spice to it as well.

Garlic nan and butter nan comes to your table piping hot and leave you wanting more and more once it's done! Pricing for this is also fair (1.99/2.99) 

Overall Buhkra grill is our go to indian resto in our neighbourhood. Just wished they delivered to us!
