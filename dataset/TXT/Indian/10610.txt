A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA This is definitely the number one Indian restaurant I have ever been to, and I know I will return there over and over again.

In my experience, this is the best vegetarian place in Toronto, especially for lovers of cooked vegetarian food. 

Because it is a restaurant that serves South Indian dishes, be prepared for a totally new culinary experience. The dishes they carry are very different than those you can find at the mainstream Indian restaurants.

Coincidentally, this is also one of the cheapest eat-out places out there. You can be fully stuffed for $13-$15. The bill for two persons rarely exceeds $30.

Perfect for children - they have a place for them to play, as well as a children friendly menu.

The atmosphere is also great. It feels like a dining room. If you dislike posh places that make you uncomfortable making the napkin dirty, then it is definitely a place for you. 

The only negative thing that I experienced was the fact that sometimes it might be difficult to get the waiter's attention, but you could say it gives you more time to think and decide.
