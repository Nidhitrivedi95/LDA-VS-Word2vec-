P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA I dropped in here once for the buffet on a snowy Sunday afternoon.  It was quite quiet except for two or three tables, but the waiters were cordial and made sure we had everything we needed. 

For the herbivore, there are three or four dishes at the buffet.  The rice was satisfactory but one shouldn't complain considering how expensive grains have gotten in the past year.  The dal were great and left me quite satisfied.  For dessert, fruit is available.  The gulab jambu isn't too bad either although the syrup is a bit on the heavy side.

When it comes to buffets, expectations tend to drop, so this is nothing fancy.  I've not tried any of the other buffets on the strip, but I'd come back if I'm not feeling too fussy and just want a hearty meal for a reasonable price.
