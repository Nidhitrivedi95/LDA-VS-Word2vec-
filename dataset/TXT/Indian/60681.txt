zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q This place is bomb! I'm always excited to discover authentic gems in the Valley. It reminds me of LA, where you can get food from any country that's presumably as good as what you'd get there. 

My roommate and I stumbled upon this place after getting gas at Circle K, and were delighted by the airy garlic naan--best I've ever had--and the well-balanced, perfectly seasoned mantoo. (That Afghan term for dumplings sounds just like the Korean one!) The dumpling skins were incredibly chewy and the sauce-to-filling and filling-to-skin ratio were ideal. The lamb kabob was tasty too (just reordered), though I've had more tender. The green (cilantro?) yogurt sauce was the perfect complement to the lamb, rice, and fresh veggie mix.

To top things off, our server Kamila was super friendly and fun, giving us helpful recommendations and, when we returned, remembering our exact order! 

We will be back again and again when in the area.
