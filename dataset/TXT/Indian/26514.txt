ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I've read the raving reviews and I would come here maybe once a week on average to pick up their chicken tikka masala and a cup of mango lassi. Very solid atmosphere - perfect date place - and I love how they have this restaurant in a house which seems like a more residential part of town. Very classy place in a cool house. However, the food quality, while good and definitely above average, isnt the best I had. I found the chicken tikka masala to be a bit bland and creamy compared to other Indian restaurant's I've been to.

Blue Taj by Ballantyne definitely destroys this restaurant in terms of food quality.
