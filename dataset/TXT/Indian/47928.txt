TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Went there for a buffet on Sunday. The lamb was horrible. It was like diced lamb and good luck in finding those pieces.

Talk about tandoori chicken and I know it was a buffet but still it was so dried out and yes I am talking about the dark meat pieces.

If you want great food go to mint India and not this place.
