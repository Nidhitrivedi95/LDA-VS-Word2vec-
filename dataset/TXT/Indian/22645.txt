gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Food is good, excellent lunch buffet pricing, all vegetarian though so sorry carnivores ... I'm not sure why it's so hot inside though but the atmosphere is not comfortable because the AC doesn't seem to work well, but anyhow good food good service at least during lunch buffet, only complaint is it's too hot inside every time ...
