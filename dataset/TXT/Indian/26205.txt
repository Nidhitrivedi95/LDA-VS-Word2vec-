IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA I really do enjoy Indian cuisine but just like any other type of food, the cook has their own style. I have a favorite Indian place that I am used to in AZ. The food is good here but some of the things like the mint sauce, which is traditional, I just like the way that some other places make it. Overall, good food and friendly people here.
