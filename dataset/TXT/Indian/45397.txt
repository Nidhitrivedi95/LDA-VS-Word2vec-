s8N66BJ9P-sqhisX47o1Sg This use to be my go to place as I've been going here for many years. 

The management of this establishment does not want any help during lunch rush hour, many times I go for lunch I have to wait almost 1hr for a roti. It's good to call ahead and order. The portion is much smaller now compare to many years ago(5-6). Price has risen as well for every roti on the menu. There's only a few pieces of chicken and fewer potatoes. I am disappointed, this use to be my place for roti. 

The place is pretty outdated, they need a good updating. 

It taste good and smells good, but I'm not full at the end and have to go get fast food.
