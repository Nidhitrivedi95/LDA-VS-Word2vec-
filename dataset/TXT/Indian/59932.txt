ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg After reading positive Yelp reviews I finally sought out this place and tried the lunch buffet.  It was worth the trip.  All the flavors are spot on.  The selection is better than most of the local lunch buffets.  The naan bread was so fresh it was too hot to touch.  I especially liked seeing  papadum on the buffet.  The palak paneer was great.  The tandoori chicken was tasty.  The chicken tikka masala, the kheer, the curry, the raita,...  The chutney selection was really nice.

Service was friendly and quick.  We never had to wait for anything.  The place is very clean and in a very nice newish neighborhood.  Freeway access is close.  Plenty of parking.  Next time I drive to Flamingo & 215 at lunchtime I am going there again for sure.
