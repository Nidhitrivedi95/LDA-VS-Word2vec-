uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg This place has good food from local sources. My food was prepared very quickly. The person at the counter was friendly and informative, he seemed to be in charge or the owner, I didn't ask to be sure. I don't know a lot about Indian food and he was helpful in telling me what things were on the menu.
