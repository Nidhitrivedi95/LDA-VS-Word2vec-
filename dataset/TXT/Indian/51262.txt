uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg 5 stars for a spectacular vegetarian lunch special.

Curry, rice, dessert for under $8. I totally did not mind the "fast food" ambiance or that the meal was served on a plastic tray (please don't let this deter you from experiencing quality Pakistani grub at a reasonable price)- the food is DELICIOUS.

I will be back.

Thanks FB!
