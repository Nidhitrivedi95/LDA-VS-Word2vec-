CHrH99pDvs_jPA22o1xBAA We first visited here 17 years ago. It remained in our memory as the best Indian food we have had internationally. Yes, I visited India and have enjoyed their food in multiple countries. Most of my Indian palate has been satisfied in California.

Each region has its own seasonings and this version tops them all, in our opinion.  Thus we return here again today.

As we approached the entry someone opened the door and we were immediately seated. Within moments the waiter came to take our order for drinks and brought us four chutneys. OMG!  There are good chutneys at most every restaurant we go to and some are rather unremarkable. Here these have a variety of non-spicy to mildly spicy. And the other seasonings, I am sorry to say, are beyond my description and delicious! It took perhaps 10 minutes to receive our food. (By the way, they do not ask you if you want spiciness at the mild, medium or hot levels. One gets what one gets.  I rate it as "Mild+". 

Ahhh . . . !
