gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Girlfriend brought me here at 2:30, just 30 minutes before they close the buffet. Normally I would never go to a buffet right before they close because of the poor food choices that are left but this is not the case! All the food was still being replaced and hot and ready. The chicken curry and sweet rice were especially delicious! Price is cheap too. Only $10.99 for a Indian buffet for kings? Yes please! Will definitely recommend to friends and return for more!
