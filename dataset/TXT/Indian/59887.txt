ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I just had probably the best dahl I have ever had - and I have had a lot! I asked for 5/10 spicy which was PERFECT!!! Holy moly it was yummy! I liked it best with naan-dipped in it, rather than with the Biryani rice. I had a glass of Prosecco wine - pretty good. My brother had the shrimp Biryani- he said it was VERY GOOD (and he's picky). He ordered 7/10 spicy.  

We WILL be back! I couldn't finish the whole serving, so this will be my very delicious lunch for tomorrow.

Try it!! Really! Very reasonable prices for Summerlin, as well.
