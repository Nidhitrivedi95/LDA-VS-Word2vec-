0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Finallllllly got to try this place out yesterday night on an impromptu date with the bf. We drove originally to Anathan for their lamb rolls but sadly their Yelp hours were wrong. 

So my bf asked for saucy meat with rice...bingo!!!! So I got to share my wonderful knowledge of Hakka food with him and sold him before we even arrived. We snagged the last table and right from the beginning we felt welcomed. Being that it was almost 9pm and the place was packed, we knew we were in for a treat! The staff (every one of them) were kind and on point! Water was always filled and food came out hot and proper. 

The food was delicious (hot and sour soup and chili chicken with gravy)! My mouth is still watering from the gravy. The portion size was great, filled 2 of us plus leftovers for lunch! It did have spice to it, but not over powering. 

I'll have to go back to try their other dishes because everything smelled great. When paying we put down a 20 and the tip in change, the owner (manager???) still asked if we need change before thanking us. It was a small but for me significant gesture. I feel like for them it's really about the food!

A place to write home about :)
