UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA My boyfriend's and I favorite Indian place, not only because of the all you can eat buffet at lunch, but because of the atmosphere, excellent customer service, traditional Indian dishes and drinks! We go at least once every 2 weeks, it's that good! I recommend doing the lunch special all you can eat from 11 to 3pm on weekdays. They give you fresh naan bread (garlic or buttered) with complimentary water. Then the fun begins with the delicious Indian dishes! My fave is the paneer tikka marsala!
