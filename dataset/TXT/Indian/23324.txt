gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Our first experience here was good enough that we returned and this time brought some guests over. The entrees were pathetic...we had ordered the butter chicken and lamb kadai. The chicken was super creamy and tasteless and the lamb was tough and super salty. Our guests felt sick that night after dinner and suspected the food from here to have done it.
