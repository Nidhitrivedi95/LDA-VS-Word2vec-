JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Went with family for Lunch. With average expectations. 
We ordered Chola Bhatura, Chilli Pakora, Schzewan Noodles, Mushroom Masala, and more. 

As per my friend this was the best Chola Bhatura in US, I loved the schzewan noodles its like typical Indo-Chinese flavor that is available in India. 
Very good place, surprisingly very distinct Indian food.
