QShxCR0mR1vvZIylInZDAQ My sister, Mom, and I have dined here a couple of times.  Great lunch buffet and good service.  Good naan and freshly-prepared dosas, although, as Mimi B. mentioned, the crepes aren't as crispy and golden as I've enjoyed at other restaurants .  Chai is good, but the desserts are even better!  Loved the carrot halwa.

Udipi is a region in India, as well as a style of cooking, that is known for its vegetarian specialties, so veggieheads, as well as carnivores, will love the vast menu options offered here.  Definitely a great lunch stop in the Queen City!
