GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw First of all, delicious food! Love the chicken dishes (yum vindaloo) and the seasoned rice is very tasty!  But second of all, I am positively impressed that this restaurant in Glendale delivers to North Phoenix (in the "Streets"). I live just under 10 miles away and they deliver to me!! Yes, the wait for delivery can be long, but they are a very busy restaurant at dinner time and they use third-party delivery drivers. However, I tried delivery last night from my home address (I have had delivery from them before from a closer location) and even though it took exactly 2hrs and 15 mins from when I placed my order, it arrived piping hot and was DELICIOUS! It was worth the wait. I hope they continue to offer delivery at such a distance and that people will grant them the patience (and the drivers too) to get to you!
