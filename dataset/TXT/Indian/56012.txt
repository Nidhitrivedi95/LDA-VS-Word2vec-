XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw With no menu to be found online I decided to just call and ask for some more general indian food as well as whatever they recommended to go with it. Fifteen minutes, she told me.

Fifteen minute was perfect. I was hungry and some indian food sounded great. She put me down for Chicken Masala (with jeera rice) and Naan. Later I would find out for the great price of about $13.

Upon arrival, maybe 10 or 15 minutes later, I realized the entire place was empty. Now I am scratching my head "why?!?!" as the food was delicious! Perhaps just not enough people in the area like indian food.

Now I have a paper menu and perhaps I can be more daring than just Chicken Masala.
