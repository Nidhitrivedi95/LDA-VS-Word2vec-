pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Went a large group of friends for a birthday dinner. So we had the group menu, in the basement. The room was very dark, music very loud. Beautifully decorated but made it very hard to socialize. 

Onion bhajis were good, nothing over the top. The spring rolls were pretty good. The fig pizza was AMAZING on this crust naan. It is a must have, you will not be disappointed. I couldn't have a salad because there was no b vegetarian option unfortunately. I was quite disappointed with their lamb korma. The curry was too sweet, didn't taste like korma at all. I didn't end up eating it. My friends tasted it and all agreed that it was too sweet. The naans were fresh and very soft. They had a few mocktail options, I had one but can't remember the same and it was great! 

Overall a great fusion restaurant. Definitely plan on going there to try other items on the menu.
