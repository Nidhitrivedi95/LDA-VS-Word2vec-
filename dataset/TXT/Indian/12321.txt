auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Decided to try a place in the plaza it is located in since we always drive by and NEVER stop so we avoid the moronic green valley drivers and their needs to all be on the road at the same damned time. This stop was more than worth it. 1 st time ever eating Indian and was extremely pleased with everything....Friendliness, atmosphere, aromas and visuals. Owners are so happy to make you experience the best possible. We had the lunch buffet and have been back several times
