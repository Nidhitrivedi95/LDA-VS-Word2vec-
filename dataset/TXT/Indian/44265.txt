RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Service was great food was delivered to the table very quickly but overall I felt it lacked flavor. The butter chicken was tart/limey not creamy and semi-sweet. The tandoori chicken leg was decent for $6 but didn't make me go "yummmm so good" it was just basic, the butter naan was ok, good portion, the samosas where great and the popsicle ice cream bar was good.
