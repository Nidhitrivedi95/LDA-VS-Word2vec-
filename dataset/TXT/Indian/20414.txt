FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ Quick and easy restaurant. The menu is on the wall and you order before you sit. The smell is great and I was pretty excited. 

I concur with some of the other reviews that it is a bit pricey for lunch, but they do have a specials menu. I'll have to check that out next time. 

Anyway, the masaman curry with beef and potatoes was very good and quite a decent sized portion. 

Overall worth a shot if you're in the Madison burbs.
