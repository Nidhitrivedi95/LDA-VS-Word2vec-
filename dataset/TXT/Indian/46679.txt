sY6AR_JqHBLxBkKZLfBJQw We came as a party of 3. 

The server was really friendly and a pleasure to deal with. She was very attentive and quick to come when needed.

We have mixed feelings about the food though. We ordered 6 items from the a la carte menu as they no longer do the buffet dinners on weeknights.

The fish pakoras were excellent! The basa filets were perfectly battered and fried. $14.99 for a plate. A bit pricey but we would order them again.

The samosas were fridge-cold in the centre so we had to send them back. The house-made tamarind chutney and green chutney were amazing! The samosas themselves were nothing special. Order them only if you're desperate for an appetizer.

The chicken tikka at $11.99 was overcooked and overpriced--it came with one naan on the side, and two small drumsticks and one thigh cut into two pieces laid on top of some julienned vegetables on a sizzling plate. We will never order that dish again! 

The butter chicken was passable. The sauce was too sweet it almost tasted like ketchup. It was served with one naan and a bowl of rice.

The highlight of our dinner was the chicken biryani. Oh, my gosh! That dish came with ample, tender, juicy pieces of chicken breasts and perfectly seasoned basmati rice dressed with raisins and cashews. We loved it and would come back just for that!

We had ras malai for dessert. It was delicious! The cream had the right amount of sweetness. The chenna was firm yet moist. It was sufficiently garnished with pistachios. We would order this again too!

As this is a new restaurant, we hope they take our feedback and improve the dishes that fell short.
