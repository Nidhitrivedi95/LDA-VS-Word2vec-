OJLR2T3CgXQkUgFmqrkTwQ I've never written a review on here before but this place compelled me to do so. My husband and I went on a whim, and boy am I glad we did! The customer service was amazing, the food was great and the portions were huge! The prices are really reasonable for what you get, we went in after the lunch crowd and some of the stuff was done, but they made the effort to get us fresh portions from the back. 
We got bar b q chicken legs, chicken tikka and butter chicken. Everything was delicious and warm. 
Please don't be scared because of what the place looks like from the outside, go inside it's totally worth it!
