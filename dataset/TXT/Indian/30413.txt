KbI5OOTOGUwh8aeiSU4b6A I've only had the vegetable pakora, but it was goooood. 

Light, flavour-some with a nice hot kick at the end. Also, I find with a bunch if places the pakora ends up being more flour than anything else - not so with this pakora! 

The menu is decent but I'm always wary when an Indian restaurant has pizza on the menu. 

I'll be back to try out the set meal for one which looks like good value - so watch this space!
