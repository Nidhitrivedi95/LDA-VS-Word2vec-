f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Got a chance to visit this Halal restaurant. Loved the food and ambience. Decently priced. Had loads of variety of both veg and non veg in the weekend buffet. The chicken 65 was just too tasty . The Sheesh kabob was awesome too! Would definitely visit again. Worth every penny!
