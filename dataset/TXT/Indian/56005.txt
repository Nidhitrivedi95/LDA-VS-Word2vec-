XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw I have been there many times of the last few years. I LOVE their garlic naan bread!
I used to love their Chicken Korma, but over the last few months they have changed the recipe or use a commerical sauce. It is thinner and yellower than it used to be, and just isnt as good.  I will go back and try another dish, but miss my favorite korma!
I was there last week and a young lady was our server. She was very attentive!
