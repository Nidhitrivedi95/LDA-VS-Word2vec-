IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Since many of us use the internet to hunt down a place to order from, it would be advantageous to state whether or not there is a range for delivery. I learned this tonight after speaking to a less than open to feedback driver or owner. 

After I had been told delivery was available in my area, she asked me to speak to the driver, I said this should be posted on the website he let me know in a snotty tone that "there are other indian resturants in my area", "we wouldn't drive there and back on a 20 twenty dollar order" (which for the record it would be have been more). 

Truly disappointing experience when a simple "yes, we should look into that" would have easily settled the conversation. 

Looks like The Indian Cuisine would remember its manners or just continue to argue its self out of customers..
