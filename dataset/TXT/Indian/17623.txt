DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ I live in Brampton, where there are many Indian food joints.  I have to go all the way to Malton for Sweet India's Shahi Paneer and Butter Chicken, because I haven't yet found a place in Brampton that makes them as good.  Both have the same rich curry sauce. Shahi Paneer is even more richer than Butter Chicken with the bits of cheese.  Their Channa Bhatura is also very good.
