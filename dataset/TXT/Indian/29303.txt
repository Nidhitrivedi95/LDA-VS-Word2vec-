JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Went here a for a family dinner and had a great dinner! The paper masala disable is massive and super filling! It's nice and crunchy - exactly what I want out of my dosa! Extremely authentic dishes! Wish they have me more sambhar to match the size of the dosa. Service was ok - food came out super fast!
