ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I made dinner reservations to celebrate a friend's birthday and I was very pleased. The service was good and my meal was excellent. I ordered chicken chettinadu, which had just the right amount of "kick" (spiciness) to it. The Naan was also very good. My friend had lamb curry which he enjoyed. I have been looking for a good Indian restaurant in Charlotte and I must say that this one is almost as good as my favorite in New York.
