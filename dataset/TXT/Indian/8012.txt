75HVFV2yYaaz0qH_KCgyFQ Tried the vegetarian buffet at dinner.  The food was generally fine but not exceptional.

The dishes I enjoyed the most were the eggplant and cauliflower.  The mint chutney was awesome -- very fresh & flavourful!

I was not especially impressed with the pakora, samosa, daal, or other dishes.
Naan was so-so.

Service was fine.
