rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ I have been here many times and it never disappoints. Naan is always fresh and delicious. Tandoori chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Butter chicken and spinach chicken are both fantastic. Kadai chicken is my new go to. It is a great tomato based stir fry. (Big chicken fan overall if you can't tell). Everything is served fresh and hot. 
The service is always good. Order at the register, sit at your table with a number card and your food will be there in 10-15 minutes. Staff is friendly and helpful. This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. Worth the trip to Carnegie.
