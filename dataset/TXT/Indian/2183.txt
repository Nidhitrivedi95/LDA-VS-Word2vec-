_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Went with my mother for lunch. Ordered the Chicken Thaila, had a few bites and realized the chicken was stone cold... checked further and the meat was bright pink, cold down to the bone.

Asked the waiter if they could check and make sure the chicken was properly cooked, which of course it wasn't. When they brought the bill, it was clear the restaurant expected me to pay for this cold, raw chicken they had delivered as lunch. I had to approach the manager and ask for the Chicken Thaila to be removed, which he accommodated with a scowl.

Mom liked her meal, though. Fingers crossed that I purged the raw chicken before any damage was done to my system.
