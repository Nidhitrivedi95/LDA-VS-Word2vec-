llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg My husband and I came here and neither of us had ever had Indian food before. We thought this would be a good place to go because of their lunch buffet where we would be able to try multiple items. The place was busy and the fresh naan that was brought to our table was delicious. We however we not very excited about the food. We believe this had nothing to do with them and a lot to do with us just not liking the food. The ice cream they had was good too. I would be open to trying again but we would like to go with someone who has ate Indian food before.
