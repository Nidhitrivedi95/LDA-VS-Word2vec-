RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Took my mom here during the day for lunch since it always seems to be busy during dinner times in the night, and we end up eating somewhere else on Gerrard.

The place itself gives you a feel of being in PakiLand! It's fun, and has a rickshaw and a taqat outside. The service was good, however I thought it was totally ghetto that you have to write down your own order on a white board and hand it over to the cashier. Why can't they just take your order at the register?? For the portions i think this place is way overpriced. If they wanna be ghetto about the ordering system then they need to bring down the prices to match it up.

They don't have a lunch special either. It's the same menu prices all day, every day. Negative!
