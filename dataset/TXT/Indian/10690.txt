A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA A craving for masala dosa led us to this basement restaurant. The place was packed with people of various ethnicities. We got a table right away. We ordered two crispy dosas: one masala and one Mysore. Within 10 minutes, our piping hot dosas arrived. They did live up to the hype. There were small portions of chutney and sambar, which were both delicious. We ordered one more: onion rava dosa. This took a little longer, as the waiter had mentioned. This one was quite fragrant and flavourful.
This is a dosa spot that we will definitely visit again.
