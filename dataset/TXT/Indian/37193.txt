o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ Ordered the mutter paneer roti, mild-medium spicy, and masala fries. The fries were literally just fries with a spice blend and were 100% not worth it. They were crispy and whatever but just didn't add anything to the meal. The roti was served piping hot, so that was good. Unfortunately, the spice was overwhelming. It's a cool gimmick, but the fact that the second-lowest spice level was almost painful to eat makes me wonder why anyone would bother.

The roti had minimal paneer and was filled with potatoes and peas. Like, it was ridiculous. I tend to shrug off reviews that talk about how a place tries to fill you up on cheap carbs so they don't have to give you the good stuff (because that's kind of how things work), but this was really noticeable. I kind of wish I had ordered something less vegetal to compare, because the peas really got in the way. I ended up with like 65-70% of the actual roti bread left, filled with sauce and peas, because I just didn't like it. Too spicy, not particularly good flavor, outright bad distribution of fillings.

This place was super forgettable and not good and I only remembered to write a review once someone wanted to go back and I had to express my revulsion. Pass.
