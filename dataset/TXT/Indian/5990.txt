3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I came here for dinner because I am traveling solo for business and they offer a thali (a kind of combo plate), which is great because I enjoy variety. It was wonderful. The tandoori chicken appetizer (2 pieces, almost a meal in itself) was amazing and the assortment of dishes was just right. If you like Indian you must try this place.
