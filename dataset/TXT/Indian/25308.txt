2 experiences - 

1. I just came back from a fairly average lunch buffet, having paid $19.75 per person. The food and the ambiance was fairly average and I would have ended up paying $12/13 for this at any comparable restaurant. We were a party of 6 people (mind you, not 8 as would be at other places), and they charged a gratuity of 26%; and that too, for service in a buffet (where you serve your own food). 

2. Dinner a few months back - We arrived at 9.15pm and got the first round of our order served at 9.35ish. When we ordered more bread, we were told that it is the closing time and their chefs had gone home (probably around 9.40pm). Mind you, there was no last call before they closed their kitchen.

In short, alright food, mediocre service, and greedy management.
Never going there again.
