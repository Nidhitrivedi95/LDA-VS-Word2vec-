Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I find myself wanting to come here multiple times a week. The service and food are both excellent. I love coming here for the lunch buffet, but the dinner options are also great.

 My favorite things here are chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and then gulab jamun for dessert.

Tip: It is not that spicy compared to other Indian food I've had, so order it extra spicy if you want it hot at all.
