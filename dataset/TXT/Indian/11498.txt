ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Unintentionally ended up here. Definitely not a bad thing though. I was with a buddy that is of Sri Lankan descent so he did all the ordering. We order Idly which was something I've never had before and the Dosa. I'm a huge foodie and am very open to trying new things. The Idly was great tasting, I'm happy I had it here first so I know what to expect elsewhere. The Dosa on the other hand, I've had at other restaurants but I must say, I was quite surprised when it arrived at our table. The size was very large and crispy and the fact that there was cheese inside was such a delightful addition since I've never had a Dosa with cheese in it before. Sauces and curries were very flavourful... Or maybe we were just hungry from all the walking we did prior to. I would definitely go back again.
