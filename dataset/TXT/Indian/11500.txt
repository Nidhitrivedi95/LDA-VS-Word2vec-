ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Four words: chilli cheese masala dosa. 
It is SO good. I had never had a stuffed dosa before, so when it came (it was twice the size of my head) i was in shock, but i ate the WHOLE thing. It was dense, gooey, potato-ey, spicy. I'll just say it again... it was SO good. I tried the special rava dosa but the chilli cheese is way better. The place is small and sometimes you might have to share a table with someone, but go. Go and eat the giant dosas. 
Also, there's limited parking out front, but if you drive to the other side of christie, there is plenty of free parking there. You will need the walk after you eat anyway.
