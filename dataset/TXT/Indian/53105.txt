vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg This restaurant is weird. It's an Indian restaurant but the decor isn't Indian and you can tell that this used to be some kind of bar (as the most prominent things in the restaurant is a old wooden bar and a stage). It's definitely a weird ambiance. They also rent out the restaurant to reggae performers after 10pm... so if you go to eat late be prepared to hear a bunch of reggae artists setting up and doing soundchecks on their drums/guitars. 

The food was really good though, the vegetarian combo platter is good and so was their lamb vindaloo. Their naan while not the best I've had was very good. Their pappadums were kind of weird and rolled up. I feel its kind of bad that their curry dishes don't come with rice and you have to add in a side of rice, most good Indian restaurants automatically give you rice. If I was in the mood for Indian, I'd do takeout from here.

The service was bad just like the other reviews said. Even though it was a quiet night, the two girls working just weren't attentive to their customers. I had to get up and get my server. They seem to always be busy behind the bar but what are they doing?

Anyway this place is okay but I'd probably go elsewhere for a restaurant dining experience. I would definitely recommend them for takeout however or a Groupon.
