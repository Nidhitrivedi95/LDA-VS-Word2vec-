PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw I went here while reuniting with a group of friends I met originally in Nepal and this was a wonderful place for dinner. I know most folks visiting Edinburgh will likely be more interested in trying Haggis for the first time or going on a whiskey tasting adventure (make sure you try some Lagavulin), but once you've done all of that, you should really have dinner here at Namaste Kathmandu.

The Momos were delicious, as were the Mango Lassi, but the main courses were the real treat. I don't specifically remember all of the dishes we enjoyed (they were all vegetarian), but I can tell you we have a number of them and ate family style (always the best way to go because you get to enjoy much more than a single menu item).

So if you find yourself touring through Scotland, or if you're fortunate enough to call the beautiful city of Edinburgh home, then this is definitely a worthwhile place to eat!
