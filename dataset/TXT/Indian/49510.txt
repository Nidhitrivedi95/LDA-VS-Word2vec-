tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I drove 3 hours to get here...  and it was totally worth my time and gas!

As we walked in, we were greeted and promptly seated.  I noticed how nice and clean the interior was.  Then we hit the buffet...  all you can drink chai and mango lassi?  YES!  Warm basket of naan at the table?  YES!  Pudding desserts?  YES!  Vegetarian selections?  YES!  Various chicken and lamb curries?  YES! YES! YES!  (That's what she said).  Everything was tasty including the rice!  Some of the best Indian food I've ever had.  Can't beat the price for $9/person for lunch.
