OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A delicious and welcoming. we ordered samosas to start and meat thali as a main course. coming from a central jersey Indian food fanatic, I must say that the samosas here were among the best I've ever had the pleasure of eating. meat thali was satisfying as there was a nice variety of food all separated on the metal plate (lentils, tandoori chicken, curried vegetable, biryani, naan, butter chicken, and papadum). aromatic, delicious. 

very nice ambience and very good food especially for the price! 10/10 would come back.
