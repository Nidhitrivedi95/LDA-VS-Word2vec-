cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg I would say the food is decent and you can specify any sort of modifications. It's not 'wow' but just 'meh'. You could go to any other Indian restaurant in the same price range ($9 and up) and get the same tasting stuff. It also takes forever for the food to get on your table. 

The decor is just ghastly. It's terribly lit. And I don't think they have had a make-over in more than a decade. The music, furniture, and staff make it one hell of a gloomy place. 

If you are in the area and want to fork out money for 'Indian food'  - then you might as well go to 'Biryani House' which is just one block north, by Wellesley station. Their food is definitely worth every dollar!

I have visited this restaurant a couple of times over a few years. Recently, there has been a huge turnover off the staff and I am definitely not going back any more. The service is just terrible now.
