Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Mixed experience, first time I happened to get Buffet which was amazing and good price for money. But in my recent visit the buffet was not available and we chose their recommended platters ( Buddha's and Ashoka's ), except for the starters rest of the food item were not upto the mark and the portions were very less too. $60 Dinner for two, I was expecting much better experience. 
Will ensure the buffet next time by calling them before visiting.
