CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ Monday evening. All empty save for a couple dining in one corner. We are asked if we have reservations. Hmmm. No. You can take table for 2. Wife politely requests for bigger table. Owner is called upon. Looks uncomfortable. Signs and says ok go ahead. Just when we are sitting down: 'We don't like to ask people to move. We get very busy all of a sudden.' All this while looking swollen as if we asked for the world.

The girl on the floor was a pleasant person though. Our previous experience (again in an empty restaurant) was good too. 

But you can't be unaccommodating to present customers for what or who may follow next!

I consider myself easy going enough to pay for unevenly uncooked dishes (if owner doesn't offer to take it off the bill) or even if I have to wait for long time before being served, but I never felt insulted, ever. Until now!
