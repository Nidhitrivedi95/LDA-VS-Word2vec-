rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ My husband hounded me for almost 3 years to try this place as I had never had Indian food.  I was leery at first but omg it's fantastic! The chicken tikka masala is amazing! My son, who is a very picky eater, absolutely loves it as well.  Everything is made to order so it's always fresh.  The girl who works the counter (Brown curly hair) is very nice and always chit chats with me as I wait on my order, so I feel her customer service is on point. They must be doing something right as they are always super busy when I go down.  I have tried 2 other places in the area (downtown Pittsburgh) and the food I've gotten at cafe Delhi is far more superior and it's even less expensive. I feel that the portions are large because I always get 2 meals out of one order, so to me that makes it an even better value.
