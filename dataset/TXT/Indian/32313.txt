LgqGDQsUurUh6qUocPeSsQ It's a little walk from any subway station but who doesn't enjoy an evening stroll in the freezing Montreal cold!?
Small inside, you might have to wait a bit before being seated and this even on a week night (prooving that I am not the only one enjoying an evening walk!).
We opted for the thalis, vegetarian and lamb (tip: rice is not included so you will need to order it as well and pay it above the thalis price). The food was bland, lacking in quality and clearly reheated (if heated at all) and the host was just looking annoyed to be there and almost throwing our food on the table. Fortunately, the other staffs were more pleasant and attentive.
Overall, it's more pricey and less good than other options in the area so next time I will take my evening stroll in another direction...
