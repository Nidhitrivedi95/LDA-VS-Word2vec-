KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA Been there twice.  Nice casual place.  Had Bhindi & Goat Masala.  Both were very good.  Will go back.  Next time had the Chilli Masala Dosa.  Dosa was nice and crisp.  The rest was mild and with minimal flavour.  Absolute no South Indian flavours.  Real disappointment.  If someone does not know South Indian flavours it may not matter.  Will go back but will stay away from the Dosas.
