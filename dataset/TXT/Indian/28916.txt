jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Let me start off by saying that we're Indian and eat Indian food on a regular basis. That being said, the food here is exceptional. The flavors were authentic and reminded me of the street food found in India. We tried both the vegetarian and non vegetarian food. (Malai kofta and chicken curry) We've already come here twice during our stay in Vegas and will definitely come next time we are in Vegas.
