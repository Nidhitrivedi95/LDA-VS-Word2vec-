DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew This place is for real. Great food. Nice atmosphere. Nice staff.

We ordered the chicken version of the chili paneer or chicken appetizer.  Very good flavor.  Like a  Chinese/indian fusion.

Chana Masala, chicken Tikka Masala, and the eggplant which I cannot remember how to spell. 

All were very good and all had distinct flavors. 

we will be back to try some lamb dishes.

Only suggestion is to have the door cleaned where the previous business had its hours. it is unattractive.
