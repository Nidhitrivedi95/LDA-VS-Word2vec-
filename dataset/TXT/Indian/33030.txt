llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Come here for Indian buffet. Food is flavorful. Somewhat cold.... So I recommend stirring the food a bit before putting it on your plate. About twelve different items. Very common dishes you see at most Indian buffets. Half vegetarian section, half meat section with lamb and chicken options. Complimentary naan is offered.
