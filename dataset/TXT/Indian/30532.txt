KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ True story: I ordered the daily special, which was to be Tandoori Red Snapper, and received something that I think was Swordfish. Not kidding. Even worse, the waitress made a point to tell me it was fresh--yeah right. It was definitely over cooked, frozen fish. Then again, we couldn't decide if she was high or just a new, nervous waitress. The only redeeming factor was that the seasoning on the fish and veggies was so good that I kept eating it. The chicken and curry entree my companion ordered was absolutely delicious, so I might consider returning when the fish fiasco is a distant memory.
