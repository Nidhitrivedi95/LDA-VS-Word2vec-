-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Ordered carryout: Paneer Tikka Masala and Navratan Korma. Wasn't a fan of the flavors. The paneer dish was better than the korma dish because of the sauce. The paneer dish here was not as good as good as other restaurants. The basmati rice was also a little different in a slightly unfavorable way. 

Indoor furniture and ambiance is nice but I prioritize food taste.
