nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA Maroli was one of my first times at a sit-down Indian restaurant, so keep in mind that this review is written from the perspective of the inexperienced. We ordered butter chicken and a few types of biryani. The taste was outstanding, with each bite a burst of flavour. Service was prompt and polite. The price is a bit higher than some other places; that is not to say that it is at all expensive, it's just that many other Indian places have rock bottom prices. I'd say Maroli is worth the small premium. I'm definitely coming back here again if I'm ever in the area.
