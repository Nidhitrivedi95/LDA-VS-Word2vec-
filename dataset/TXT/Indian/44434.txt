rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg Pretty good. I wouldn't go out of your way (which we did). The dosa was good, but my husband ordered a chicken dish that took forever to come out! I was already far done my dosa by the time it came out, so that was unfortunate. Also the uttapam was way too thick.. not how it should be. I wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back.
