h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ The 3 stars are for the food only! The quality and taste of the food is phenomenal, the best I have had in the valley so far. However, the service is horrible. Actually horrible is an understatement. If you make the mistake of going on a Friday or Saturday evening be prepared to wait and wait long to be seated, asked for your order and served. I hope they put some serious thought in improving the service because the food is boss!
