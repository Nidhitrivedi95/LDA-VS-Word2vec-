TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw My wife was craving Indian food so we went to her favorite Indian restaurant.  I ordered a Taj Mahal beer & free mango lassi with the Yelp check in.  We ordered the following food items: Vegetable samosa, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, & mixed grilled tandoori.  Everything was excellent as usual.  Our server Garry was very nice and helpful.  I promised to let everyone know that he was the best.
