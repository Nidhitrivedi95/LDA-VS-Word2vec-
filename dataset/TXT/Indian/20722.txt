Located downstairs by the Pizza Pizza, the restaurant is a lot bigger and more slightly more formal than expected.  The staff is courteous and friendly and helpful making recommdations.  

I went with the butter chicken, which was spicy and creamy with large chunks of chicken. ($12)

The eggplant Bharta was super fresh and flavourful.  I could have eaten then whole dish.  ($10)

The garlic Naan was more buttery than garlic, but pretty good.  ($3)

Overall, I had a really good dining experience here and I will be back for sure.  They have several paneer dishes that I want to try next time. 

The place was quiet for a Thursday night, but they had a lot of pickup orders.  There were a few moments where I was the only patron.   I wasn't offered the appetizer crunchy bread basket because I was there on my own.  The other tables got them.  I felt like I missed out (-1 star).
