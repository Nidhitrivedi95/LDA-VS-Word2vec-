NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Kudos to the owner of the this restaurant! It truly revolutionizes the Indian food cuisine experience. I can see it as a large chain in the near future. 

Food is delicious. Service is great. The place is very clean and the kitchen operation is behind glass - so you can see everything, which is pretty cool! 

So glad that I live 5 minutes from this place! Would definitely recommend it to anyone! Believe me, you will not be disappointed at all!
