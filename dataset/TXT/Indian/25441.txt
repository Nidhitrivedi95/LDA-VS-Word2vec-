hMh9XOwNQcu31NAOCqhAEw My coworkers and I came here during our lunch hour. We arrived at 12:15 and saw that the place was empty, it was a bit dark inside, and part of the restaurant smelled like sewage. 
We were greeted by this friendly man who told us that there is no buffet since they were preparing for inspection. We got put off by the "no buffet" thing and started to walk out. The man then told us he would give us 10% off for the inconvenience if we ate there. So, ok, we agreed to stay and they seated us. There were 5 of us but they only gave us 4 menus. I asked if they had more, but they said those were the only ones they had... ok... so I waited for my turn at one of the menus. 
Five minutes later, he took our orders. He said that it will take 15 minutes for us to get our food. We were ok with that since it was around 12:25 and we had time to eat quick and go back to work.... we ended up waiting 30 minutes for our food, so at 12:55 we asked one of our waiters to just pack up our food and we'll just take it to go since we had to get back to work. The waiter started arguing with us and told us we should eat there. What??? He refused to give us to go boxes and insisted we eat there. It took another 15 minutes of us trying to convince this rude guy to give us to go boxes and when we went to pay, they didn't give us the 10% discount that they promised. We ended up late and starving after this incident. We should walked out sooner than that, but we didn't want to be rude.

The sad part is that the food was actually good. I ordered Chiken Bharta. Their food doesn't come with rice so you have to order rice and naan separate. But it was delicious. But we couldn't even enjoy it because we were treated so badly.
