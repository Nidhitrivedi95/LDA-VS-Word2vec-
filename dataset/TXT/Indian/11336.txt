Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w I'm glad I gave Himalayan/Nepalese food another chance. The very first time I had Himalayan food was in Cali and it was sooooo bland.

Nice, bright place with comfy booths and sweet, welcoming staff. 

ORDERED:
-Chili momos with beef - delicious beef dumplings in a delectable spicy sauce
-Sha Bhaley - Tibetan beef patty was ok, didn't like the side sauce
-Bhatura - similar to naan but more spongy with a satisfying chew to it. Loved sopping up all the sauce from the chili momos with this. DELISH!
-Mango lassi (yogurt drink) - thick, not very cold and a little too sweet. Asked for ice and thinned it with a little water and it was perfect. I don't mind doctoring up my drink because I got more drink for the price I paid.

Reasonably priced, filling, delicious food; yeah, I will be back when I'm in the mood for more Nepalese food.
