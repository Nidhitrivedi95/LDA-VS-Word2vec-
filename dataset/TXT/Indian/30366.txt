K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Great Indian place, most memorable was their fresh naan... mmm... service was quick and courteous however the only issue was when we were being seating, our server was being yelled at by another Indian family. Something about them only caring about the non-Indian folk and leaving their own people aside. Not sure what it was all about but it was quickly taken care of and soon after the food definitely made up for it!
