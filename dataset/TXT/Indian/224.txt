They served us pepper papad with sweet sauce and mint chutney(complimentary). The sweet sauce and mint chutney were good, though, the mint chutney could have been a bit more fresh. 

The Garlic Naan, Malai Kofta , Aaloo Gobi and Peas Pulao were brought at the same time which is good. The food was served hot which is what we really like. The Naan was very good and it wasn't burnt. We had requested them to make the subzis spicy. The malai kofta was totally  yummy. The kofta was so tasty and fried to perfection. We just wish they had more paneer in the kofta. It was more of potato. The gravy was so good and had the right amount of spiciness and masala. The Aaloo Gobi was also very tasty. The potato and cauliflower were cooked perfectly.

The peas pulao was different though. They had added tomatoes i suppose. Not sure. The rice was good. No complaints, but it was not the authentic peas pulao that we expected. 

We thought we would go for desert too so ordered Carrot Halwa. Now this was a total let down. It wasn't halwa nor was it carrot kheer. The carrot was not cooked and milk was still there and it required a lot more sugar and we couldn't find any nuts. Thoroughly disappointed.

Overall, we liked the food and we shall surely go there again. We are yet to try the lunch buffet.
