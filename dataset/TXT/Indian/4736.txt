Inside didn't seem to be renovated much from whatever restaurant was there before.  Staff was polite.  Buffet was reasonably priced and had numerous options, with quite a few being Indian dishes that are uncommon at other buffets in town.  Dosa was just just ok, as was the Naan.   The fried appetizers were not very fresh and some of the buffet area was a little messy.   Place was very busy and filled with native Indian customers, which is a very good sign in my book.
