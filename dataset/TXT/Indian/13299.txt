bfR-vJvrjdOJaWsXGJgzPA Did not enjoy this place one bit. I am a huge foodie and was interested to try their 'healthy Indian takeout' place on Yonge. Hugely disappointing in respect to the food. A letdown on every level taste and food wise.  It was not even fresh that day (asked the girl and she said the sauces could be 3 or even 4 days old and the rice not even fresh everyday!), was flavourless, tasteless and the quality of the chicken in my butter chicken curry was poor at best. My girlfriends sauce for her beef madras was one of THE blandest, weakest,  most forgettable curry sauces I've ever had. My naan bread was average at best and my girlfriend left most of her meal. Usually I would at least try to help her finish it but sadly at Veda it just sat there until we very quickly left. Bland, boring, not actually that fresh and healthy and an underwhelming meal was hugely disappointing. I gave it a score of 1 out of 5. Weak
