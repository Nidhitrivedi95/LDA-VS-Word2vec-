1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw Off a recommendation I gave this place a try. I think in the downtown area at least, it's one of the better Indian places around. I called ahead and order garlic naan and Chicken Tikki Masala. (Spicy) . When I got there to pick it up , I still had to wait about 40 minutes for my order. However I think the food was well worth the wait. I ordered take out and I'm glad I did because on the Saturday night when I went it was packed and just about every table was filled. I'll for sure give this place a try again. Also I hear the buffet is pretty good as well so I will have to give this a try.
