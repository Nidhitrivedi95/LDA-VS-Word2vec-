ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw This is the second time we visited Origin India.  The first in 2012 and enjoyed the tasting menu.  The second time was April 2014 with only a vague recollection of where the restaurant was located but enough memory to seek it out we enjoyed it so much the first time.  We were not able to indulge in the tasting menu this time but enjoyed our selections as much as we did in 2012.  The restaurant was fearfully dead the night we went so hopefully other Yelp readers will give them chance.  You will find it worth your time.
