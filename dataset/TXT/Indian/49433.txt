tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I'm not usually a buffet fan, but this place was outstanding. The help bends over backwards to make you happy and the food is wonderful. In addition to the buffet choices, they bring naan and chicken legs directly to your table. Both were incredible. I'll definitely eat here again.
