ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA While this is my absolute favorite Indian food in the whole charlotte area. They did take away there lunch buffet and substitute it with a small lunch option now. I enjoyed the buffet because I like to have a little bit of everything. We do have them deliver to our house or eat dinner there weekly. And will continue to support them. Hopefully they bring the buffet back soon. Or on the lunch menu offer more than the two options. If I could mix and match that would be better.
