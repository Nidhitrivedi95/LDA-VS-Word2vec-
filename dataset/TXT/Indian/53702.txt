ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA Great authentic Indian food. Was very skeptical of ordering Indian food as most of Indian restaurants serve tasteless Americanized version of Indian food but this restaurant delivered food to my hotel, on time with perfect amount of masala. Tried goat biryani and dal makhni. If you are Indian looking to revive Dhaba taste buds, look no further.
