RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg The Blue Taj is my favorite Indian restaurant in the Charlotte area by far.  I've been twice with my latest visit a few months ago.  I ordered things that weren't exactly on the menu.  The waiter, who was really nice and knowledgeable asked what things I wanted and I said I like tomatoes, peppers, and I like my curry spicy. The dish they brought out was exactly what I wanted and tasted awesome

The Naan was good and the paneer appetizer was great as well.  If you've never had Indian food or you are an Indian food pro, this is a great place to go!
