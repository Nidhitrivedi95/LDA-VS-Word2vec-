tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Let me start by saying I am a total Indian Cuisine Noob.  I have loved Indian food every time I've had it, but I usually go with Indian guys who just order for all of us.  So I was a little out of my element when I called and ordered take-out.  

However, on the phone I attempted to order what I thought I wanted.  They were very helpful asking me what I had liked in the past, and based on my descriptions confirmed I was ordering the right dish.  They asked if I wanted some Nan with it, and not knowing what it was I said no.  They were surprised and asked, "No nan??" and I confirmed.

When I went to pick it up, the woman at the register said, "I think you want Nan so I included it, no charge." She was right...I should have ordered it with Nan.  Noob mistake, but they took care of it anyway.  Food was delicious and I will be returning!
