LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA So I came here with my friend on Sunday night. Its insanely busy so make a reservation. They open at 5 and their phone was busy til 6 so just be prepared. If you don't make a reservation you'll be waiting an hour. So the actual dosa was amazing. I got the one that's recommended by the Toronto Star with cheese, I forget the name but its one of their most popular ones. I have a high spice tolerance and it was still a little spicy for me as a brown person. My stomach  hurt the next morning lol. So over all I would totally recommend this place for the food but the customer service is pretty bad. What we had a major issue with was that they brought my friend and I one bill. When we tried to ask them to split it or process it with two different transactions they wouldn't do it. Apparently its their policy to not give separate bills during their busy hours. Which is crazy and unheard of at any dining establishment. If you go with a big group of people one person has to pay and it can be so inconvenient afterwards. So after arguing with the manager he gave us a refund and processed it in two different transactions but its not their policy which is incredibly stupid.
