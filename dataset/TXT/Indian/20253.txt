fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA I went here for the buffet.  There were several vegetarian options, as well as chicken, lamb and goat.  Everything I ate was very good to delicious, and I tried to sample all of the vegetarian options.  The buffet is adequate, maybe a little small if it gets crowded.  They brought fresh naan to the table, which isn't a big deal to me, because I'm more interested in the other offerings.  There were also cold items, such as Greek salad, onion pickle, carrot pickle, as well as plenty of fresh fruit.  I will definitely go back here, and recommend it to anyone who likes Indian food!
