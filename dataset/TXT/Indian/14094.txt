BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ The interior of Jaipur Grille (JG) is tastefully decorated with really simple yet elegant motifs. The tranquil atmosphere and aroma of spices escaping the kitchen made me happy just to sit by the window and sip on my mango lassi. 

The appetizers; dahi bhalla chaat, samosa and tandoori wings were all fresh tasting. Tandoori wings and mint sauce pairing was especially good. I found the dahi bhalla pretty unusual and I can't really say I enjoyed it. 

Main course dishes lacked variety. They were 3/4 identical, which took away from the fun of sharing. All dishes came with a side of rice, saag paneer and raita. The warm and fluffy naan came in generous portions. The saag paneer side was my favourite part of all the dishes I tasted. It had actual pieces of cheese and it was much more flavourful than the typical runny stuff you get elsewhere. The rogan josh lamb was tasty but a bit too heavily salted for me.  

The fresh mango lassis and golab jamun (soft spongy dumpling infused with warm syrup and saffron) really hit the spot after the big meal.   

The food, on the whole, was less than spectacular but the friendly and attentive servers along with the great atmosphere turned it into a good experience.
