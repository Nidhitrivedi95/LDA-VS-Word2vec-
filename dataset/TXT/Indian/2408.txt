01I5pFCvJrrGuY3A-KoNIA Decided to order their food this evening. Used their website to order. It went through some website called Beyond Menu. Everything seemed fine- made my selection and paid. They called to confirm I would be picking up. So far so good. 

I arrived to get my food but they insisted I still had to pay them. I corrected them saying I had already paid on their website-it said so on the receipt they printed on their computer. They still insisted I had to pay them. So, I pulled out my email invoice- they still didn't believe me. Then I called the Beyond Menu company 12 times before reaching a customer service person who reiterated what I was already telling these people. Oh, and did I mention I also pulled up my credit card account to show them the transaction was currently pending and they still didn't believe me?

Only after the Beyond Menu called the store twice to tell them I had already paid (and a half hour after I entered the store) did they let me take my food with no more than a short "sorry for the inconvenience" and a shrug telling me to order by Grubhub next time. 

I get home, happy I was finally able to eat, only to find that my chana bhatura was smashed and I had sauce all over the bag. 

Let's just say I wasn't very happy with my service this evening.
