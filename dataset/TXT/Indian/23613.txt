gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A The usual disclaimer: I have not visited this restaurant. This review is regarding my recent delivery experience. 

I love Indian cuisine. I'm no expert on it though; there are a few things I like a lot, but many dishes I haven't tried.

I ordered the Chicken Korma, a tandoori plate, and regular naan. The Chicken Korma was described on their on-line menu as "mild." Now, I generally like spicy food, but I sometimes prefer a mild curry, so the flavors of the spices are present and the protein can be enjoyed. If this Korma was "mild," I'd really hate to think how spicy their Vindaloo is! It was also of a consistency more suited to hummus than to curry. I never got a chance to taste the chicken in the Korma (I usually find myself ordering a curry just for the sauce); the curry itself, while unexpectedly spicy, and thicker than I prefer my curries, was still quite flavorful.

The tandoori platter consisted of some white meat tandoori chicken nuggets; predictably dry, but well seasoned and a great pairing with the tamarind sauce. Also a samosa, which I haven't gotten to yet; some very lovely, moist lamb kebab; and these little fried things which I've never encountered before, but were quite tasty.

The naan, I'm sorry to say, was very dense and a little too moist, possibly because of the way it's packed for delivery. Naan is my favorite flatbread; this fell a bit, well, flat (really, no pun intended!). 

I think I will order from this establishment again, but I'll put a request in for the chef to ensure that the mild curry I order is actually mild, and perhaps I'll try the garlic naan, for some added flavor.
