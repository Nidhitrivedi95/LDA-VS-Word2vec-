Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I have eaten in Indian places all over the country and this place ranks up there with one of the worst.  The wait staff is nice, the water stayed full, but the food is dead avg at best.  One of the reasons I love Indian food is the depth of flavor.  Last night I had to salt the lamb dish b/c it was so flat.  We have left overs which is usually a hot commodity for lunch the next day.  Neither one of us have touched them.  I've just moved to Madison and this is my first time here, but I don't envision returning anytime soon.
