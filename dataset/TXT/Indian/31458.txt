KtNPcK6x9Dxj3aYGis5wgg Service was pleasant, but slow. This is definitely not fast food. They make to order so lunches are a min 15 minute wait. 

Also, My chicken has a strange texture, too tough am hoping it's actually chicken. You really have to put a lot of trust in a food service that has the advantage of masking their proteins in heavy sauces. I could just be paranoid, but am not going to go back. 

Driving there is not recommended either. The proprietor of the convenience store next door threatened to have my car towed when he didn't immediately realize i was a customer of the plaza.
