OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA We LOVE this place.  My husband used to dine here twice a week.  Unfortunately we don't work in the area any longer, so we are down to about once a month.  We've often taken new friends and family to impress them with the different flavours and food selections.  Maria and Michael are two of my most favourite people.  We've been going here for over 17 years and keep coming back.  Our sons will often check the fridge the next day to see if we brought home any left over Hot & Sour soup or Manchurian chicken for breakfast.

Food favourites: Manchurian Chicken noodle, Manchurian Chicken, Chili chicken, House Shrimp, Green beans, Chicken pakora, Veg rice, Beef w/black bean sauce and of course Hot & Sour soup.

Staff: Amazing, from the moment we walk in we are greeted warmly and seated right away.  Water and plates are delivered, and our order is taken (we don't look at the menu).  Our water glasses are filled and our empty plates are taken away quickly.

Overall:  The decor is a bit dated, but the food and staff make up for it.  We'll keep coming for lunch and dinner.
