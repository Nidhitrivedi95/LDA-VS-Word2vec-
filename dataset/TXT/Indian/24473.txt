h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ By and far the most authentic and tasty Indian food I have tasted so far in the US. I had come all the way from Albuquerque to try their food and every dish we ordered was very well prepared that I felt that I was back in India. Even though there are some delays in service at peak hours, it is obvious largely owing to their awesome food.
I will come back again to Phoenix just to try the food here. Hats off to the team there!!
