8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg BEWARE of this place. They do not use a calculator for some reason to add up your bill and end up charging you more. Most people wont notice it but clearly they do it more than often. I am pretty sure its not a mistake because it has happened more than twice.
Also, while ordering they DO NOT specify if rice is extra or if they are trying to cross sell a product, they make it sound as if it comes with the entree. I would be careful of their practices. 
Finally, the quality of food is no different than bombay grill... its same old bombay grill type of food.
