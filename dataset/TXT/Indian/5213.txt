2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA i tried the chicken roti.

my bench mark is Ghandi Roti which I like very much.  i'd say it's very similar to ghandi.  and perhaps slightly better.  the roti shell is softer and more delicate.  in fact, i dropped my fork and was too lazy to go back to get another one so i just ate it with a knife.  it was pretty easy to cut through it with just a knife.  the filling was more aromatic.  there was a green herb in there i couldn't identify.  could have been thyme but not sure.  definitely gave the flavor a lift. 

everything is made to order.  I had to wait 20 min for mine.  lots of other people waiting.  

place has virtually no seating.  only 1 standalone bar table and 1 row of window bar seats. some seating outside.

the location is quite inconvenient as there is limited parking on queens quay and it is off the beaten path of the downtown core but if you are near harbour front this place is definitely worth stopping in.
