gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA This is not authentic south Indian food. Just  because this is the only south Indian restaurant in Cleveland area does not make it okay for them to serve bad food. Coconut chutney is not mixing dry coconut powder with water. Bad  attitude and bad service do not help. I am amazed that this place is still running in this economy.
