Rk82QHtWp268GM93qWj3dQ I've only ever been here once for a buffet lunch, so the al-a-carte menu might be good, but we were ignored by our server, and found the dishes to be greasy, bland, or overwhelmingly spicy.  I love Indian food, and was really hoping this would be better.  I'll keep going all the way to South Kings for Maharani's infinitely superior butter chicken and fresh naan.  

Also, Naan bread should never never never never never be served in a buffet dish under a heat lamp.  A proper Indian restaurant should have a tandoor (clay oven), and should be cooking it fresh for every table.  It's the easiest thing in the world if you have the right oven.  Their's was soggy and dry at the same time, which is an awful combination.  I doubt I'll be going back.  (I'm a little psychotic about my Naan, but when it's done right it's amazing.)
