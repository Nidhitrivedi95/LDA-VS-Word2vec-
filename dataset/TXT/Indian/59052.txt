yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Awesome hospitality. Very clean. Joseph, Nicole were serving us with great hospitality. Being vegetarian and indian too, we know the taste of indian dishes. We ordered papadi chaat, idly sambar, rasam, and uttpam. All there taste excellent. One note, if you love spicy, and real spicy you need to say 10/10. Try pista kulfi as dessert. Sambar, and coconut chutney was not that great but it was just Ok. Wasnt hungry much so tried only appetizers. Did not try any main course. Definitely we will come here again. Awesome place...
