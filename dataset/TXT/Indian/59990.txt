zJRJX2-xnxHCUXA5WbBYPA Yum yum yum we had the indochinese... Manchow soup and gobi manchurian.... Finger licking good. The kids ordered naan. Paneer Tika masala, palak paneer ... They loved it which is high praise coming from the kids. Hubby ordered lamb kebab and he absolutely loved it.  
Hope the restaurant stays the same and we will be back on one of our next trips into Charlotte.
