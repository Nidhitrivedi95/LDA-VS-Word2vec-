UoS_IvuwY-8mAq0PY7n0kg I went there in a Saturday night and the place was half full, but still chill with calm music.
The waiter was willing to answer our questions about the food and all, one of them I believe is the owner, he was very friendly and even told us a little about his history...
We ordered the Table d'Hôte for 2, with two starters, 2 main dishes, 2 desserts and coffee/tee at the end.
We started with soups, both tasty, especially mine made with blue cheese (only thing, I think there could be some bread).
The main dishes were Momos, a typical gyoza-style Tibetan dish, it was delicious!
The desserts were good too, mine was a little small, just a little Indian candy ball covered with syrup, stay with the chocolate cake if you want to stuff yourself with dessert! ;)
We had a great experience there, I totally recommend!
