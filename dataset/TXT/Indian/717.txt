-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ The service is slow, the food is mediocre and the setting is not as great as you'd expect for the price you pay. Their parathas are fried bathuras. The bbq tandoori chicken was too dry and when we ordered a gravy based dish we literally got 3 pieces of chicken tikka in an ocean of gravy. They kept forgetting our naan and once we revived it it was hard, they did replace it with a fresh naan but then had to wait another 15 mins and by then our food was cold.
