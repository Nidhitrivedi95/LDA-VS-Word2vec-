KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Just had lunch buffet with wife for first time at this 3 week old new restaurant. Noticed several parties of East Indian descent eating there, so took that as a good sign. I gave it 5 stars for my goat dish, wife gives it 4 stars as she wished her chicken marsala had more spicey kick. Bare ambience, but food more important to me, so will come back to try dinner.
