22nkIQ4BeSYwsyaPOczOeA One of the best Indian restaurants ever! The restaurant his a tapas style menu, which means smaller portions (much less expensive) about four pounds to five pounds per portion. We've had literally just about everything on the menu, it's all fantastic! Go with friends everyone gets two to three dishes, then share the smorgasbord! Never have had a better Indian meal anywhere in the United Kingdom. From super expensive, to cheap spots, this is by far the best! DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE!! And make reservations or you just might, fills up fast!
