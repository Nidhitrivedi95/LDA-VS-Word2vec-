VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg I was having a serious curry craving, and I went to Cafe Tandoor knowing full well it might not be that great. I can't fault the service -- it was friendly and efficient. The ambiance was nice enough. But the lamb korma -- the tough chunks of meat came in a wobbly whitesauce-like mixture, kind of like a Campbell's "cream of" soup before water has been added. The saag paneer wasn't bad. But none of it was spicy; the korma was particularly bland. And the portion sizes were small for the prices. The mango lassis didn't have that rich yogurt flavor. I doubt I'll be back, expect for a takeout saag paneer when the craving hits.
