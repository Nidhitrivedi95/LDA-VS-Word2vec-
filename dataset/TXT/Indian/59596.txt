ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ Came here Sunday night with gf. Probably best Indian food I've had in a long time. The onion bhaji was so flavourful...butter chicken was recommended and was super tasty. The server also recommended the cg lamb specialty and this was probably the best dish. We ordered the garlic naan, gf liked it while I thought it was just ok. Highly recommended overall!
