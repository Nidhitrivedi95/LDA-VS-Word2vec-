x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Having had Chinese food in India while growing up, we went with a lot of anticipation. Amongst the ten of us, we ordered some twelve dishes, including hakka chicken and shrimp, chicken 65, chili garlic noodles with chicken, garlic pepper chicken and shrimp chop suey.

The Chicken 65 was very good, with slightly tangy pieces of boneless chicken that had a crunch on first bite, garnished with red and green bell peppers. The chili garlic noodles were tasty, but we initially thought there was a mistake with our order since we could not see any chicken in it.  On close inspection, we noticed a few miniscule pieces of chicken... The shrimp chop suey was about average, although the few shrimp were rather small. The garlic pepper chicken was neither garlicky nor peppery, instead swimming in a pool of watery gravy. But the biggest disappointment was the hakka dishes, which are a signature Indo-Chinese noodle dish.  These were completely bland, and we had to resort to adding more than a few dollops of the 6 sauces at the table to pretend we were having Indo-Chinese cuisine.

We wished the portions were more generous, like we get at most Chinese restaurants. We had to order a couple of extra entrees since some of us were still hungry, whereas we almost never can finish our food at other restaurants.

The service was competent bordering on perfunctory. One of us was curious about Nasi Goreng on the menu, but our server could not describe how it was prepared, instead steering us to a couple of other choices on the menu.

Our receipt invited us to share our experience at a "Talk2us" link, which only produced a "survey error."

Having had great Indo-Chinese food in Calcutta, Vancouver and Houston, we are still waiting for a comparable experience in the Phoenix area.
