3iUabwGw2Wlf3Qm93NUm5g We've eaten here many times. The prices and portions are very good. Certain dishes are great and others are just ok. The chilli chicken has too much gravy but there's a pineapple chicken dish that is delicious. The service is always friendly and restaurant always clean. It's definitely worth return visits if you're in the mood for Hakka.
