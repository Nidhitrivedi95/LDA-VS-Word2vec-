02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Don't be put off by the fact that they're super rude on the phone, it's probably cultural, and the food is totally worth it! Have eaten almost every vegetarian dish on the menu and d*mn do they do it right! Amazing flavor, spice level is pretty precise. If ur going to get a 7/10 you'll need a water standing by, other than that its amazing spices as you requested. 
Bf is in love with the Mixed Grill- as a non meat eater I have to say: it looks and smells AMAZING! And per his review its the best things he's ever eaten. A little pricey at 18$ but he says its worth it. Watching him eat it- I completely agree. :) 
Been eating here for the past 3 years and even though the customer service has yet to take a giant step forward I still keep stepping through their doors, inhaling those delicious spices, picking up my 'to go' order and grinning like a thief as I enjoy it for days and days to come. :)
