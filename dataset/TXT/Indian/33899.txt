m1O3uIJPZelo58EaOsrvQQ This place is ridiculously slow - I called in 20 mins before to pick up just 8 nans and I've been sitting here waiting 15 mins. Meanwhile all staff are cooking a catering order with no one at the front to seat or welcome customers. The guy is even eating while he cooks, NO gloves, no washing hands. I've come here many times in the last and the only things that is consistent is not the good but the time t takes to get it. Pathetic.
