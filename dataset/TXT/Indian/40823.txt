PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g I've been here several times in the past, though not recently. And while it was always decent, in my mind it was usually edged out by Amaya up the road. But I was walking past today, so I decided I'd give Kamasutra another try.  Unfortunately, I get the impression that they've replaced most of the traditional spices with salt. The person who took my order was sweet and helpful, so I can't complain about the service. But the food was really a disappointment. With the slightly better Amaya within walking distance, and the stellar Banjara just a short drive away, I don't think I'll be coming back here.
