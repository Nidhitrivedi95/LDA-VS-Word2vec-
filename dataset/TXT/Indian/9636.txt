8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ This was a mixed experience. The waiter was like a zombie. I want with my girl and we were alone in the restaurant, only accompanied by a fly at our table. The food was not great and the portions weren't great. 

The food tasted fine but it took a long time to arrive considering we were alone in the restaurant at dinner time. I was not impressed and for the price of the dishes I think that better can be experienced eslewhere

Highly unrecommended.
