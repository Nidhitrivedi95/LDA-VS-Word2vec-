TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I would be giving this place a 4 but they really really irritated me. 

OK so all that aside, the selection is good the atmosphere is good, the two times I have eaten there the food was IMO overly salty but not enough to keep me away. 

Now the third time I go in there, they were down right rude. There was NO ONE IN THERE and we asked if we could sit in the little room by the windows. Yes we asked politely and were answered by; 

"No, Sit here" *points to dark dark corner* by some older lady who seemed to be having a bad day. 

I responded by gently telling her we did not want to sit in the dark corner and we wanted to read a bit while we ate so.. we asked again if there was anyway we could sit here or is there some reason we can't?" 

"No, Sit here" *points to dark dark corner* 

Oh man so I stood there a second wondering if maybe we were having a language barrier issue and this nice old lady wasn't intentionally being rude. So I look to the young man who was holding the ice water pitcher. He looked like the woman scared him $hitless and he pretty much tried to usher us to the dark seats. oh man 

So I turn to my girlfriend and we both walk right back out the door. 

we went to India oven down on Sahara and las vegas blvd. instead. 
and yes they have good food and good service. They even let us in before they were really open for the lunch buffet.
