BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ I was actually looking forward to writing a good review for this place. 

The food was quite good and a step up from lot of other Indian places I've been to. 

I went out with a group of friends (1/2 vegan 1/2 meat eaters). We were very clear about this when ordering.  After were we done we asked for our left overs to be packed up.

I just went to eat the left overs only to find a HUGE piece of meat - beef, lamb? its brown..and some other meat rice dish mixed into my veg left overs. This over-site is really unfortunate. I called to complain and the apology seemed very insincere.  First I had to explain to a server the problem and he just totally didn't understand, then I was passed off to the manager. As a vegetarian it really is upsetting to have meat mixed into your food. I don't think this place understands this. The manager was just giving me some excuse that when its a large table they always put all the left overs together.  

Our main server was very attentive and nice, but the server that packed up our food was obviously clueless. Not sure if I will return.
