CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A With a smaller selection than other nearby Indian restaurants -- quality counts. Unfortunately Taj has consistently delivered only "Okay" levels of quality. 

The price is on the lower end of average which helps make up for it and I haven't ever had anything BAD here at all but I've had some unfortunately fatty pieces of meat that did mar what would have been an otherwise good dish.

I definitely get the impression that their lunch buffet is just "going through the motions" -- perhaps their dinner service is better? 

That being said I'll speak for the lunch buffet only -- unless you're only going because it is in walking distance for lunch -- you've got other options that will deliver better selection and better taste.
