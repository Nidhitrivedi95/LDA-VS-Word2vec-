qMw7mFHAjgG7qN82aXmeZg I ordered the biryani and kebabs but i made a big mistake.  I assumed these guys were like other restaurants and give rice with a chicken leg but these guys made there biryani with pieces of boneless chicken which tasted really good. 

The reason why i said i made a mistake is because they fill the box of biryani and i couldn't finish the biryani and couldnt make space for the kebabs which also tasted really good. I bought the chicken ones. 

I do highly recommend this place to others however i do have to warn you that if your alone you wont be able to finish their portions unless ur a big fella.
Good luck and happy eating!
