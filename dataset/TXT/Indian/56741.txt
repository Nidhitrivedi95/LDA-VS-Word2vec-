xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Met up with the International Supper Club at The Fry Bread house to give them a try, I have been meaning to check them out for a while now and glad that I finally got to! 

The 1st thing I noticed was there were plenty of signs telling you that they are moving soon, well dang it, I finally get here and they are moving! But it's not too far from this location, so don't freak out too much.

The menu is on the wall and it's pretty simple to follow, so when it was my turn to order I went with the ultimate fry bread taco with red chili. Took my number and headed off to our table.

One person in our group also got chips and salsa, and let me tell you, their salsa, its amazing! Great in flavor, I mean I could just make a meal out of there fresh fried chips and salsa, so good!

Order came out to the table and I have to say ITS HUGE!!! I mean HUGE!  It was fry bread the size of a plate, loaded with beans, beefy red chili, cheese, lettuce, sour cream folded in half, I swear I didn't know how to attack this thing, it is def something you eat with a fork.

The red chili is soo good, this fried bread taco was amazing, I couldn't believe I ate entire thing! So good, in fact I want another!

Another person in our group ordered the fry break with chocolate and butter, offered a piece for me to try, and man that too was simply amazing it was real melted chocolate and warm melted butter, oh that was sweet bliss!

If you haven't been to the Fry Bread House, you should go! I look forward to checking out the new place next month!
