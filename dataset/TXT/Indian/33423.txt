LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw If you want authentic Indian food, there is no better place than Jaipur. The owner is adorable - others might think that he's stand offish, but he's really shy. Once you get to know him better, he really looks out for you and treats you like one of his family members. 
Besides the great management, I love the food. I would recommend the chicken curry. And if you are a fan of spicy food (I mean so spicy you can't feel your tongue or stomach) I would go for spice level "spicy +".
