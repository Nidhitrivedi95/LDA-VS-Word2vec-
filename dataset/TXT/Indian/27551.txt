Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Better than any of the Indian food we've had in Los Angeles! My husband and I were visiting the area, and I was dying for some curry. I ordered the chicken tiki masala and he got the rogan josh (a lamb dish) lunch specials. Let's run down the list of great things: 1) perfect amount of spice! I got medium, husband got spicy. Gotta love a place that's not afraid to make something spicy. 2) best naan I've had in a decade. Oh man, I'm coming back for another basket of that before we leave. 3) generous portions, especially rice! You get so much for $10-12!! 4) super fast service. 5) adorable ambiance. (It's like a Pinterest board in there.) Love this restaurant. We'll be back.
