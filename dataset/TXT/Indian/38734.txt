OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We decided to visit this new hot spot last night and called them for a reservation. They quickly gave us a confirmation. The owner was greeting all the customers at the entrance and welcoming them which was very nice. Ambience was good, music was appropriate, bar has a lot of variety. Food was served quickly, waiters are very courteous and were willing to accomodate our every need. We liked the Naan and Dal the most. Definiately would visit this place again. Only one suggestion is the prices are just a little high, but hey its vegas, we don't go with a budget in the sin-city right ?
