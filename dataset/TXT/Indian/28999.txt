jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Good decent Indian food at standard prices.
Friendly service.

My date and I split the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Malai Kofta.
Both were exactly what we expected, though low on the spice scale - even though we asked for a 4 out of 5.

The Nan was really fresh and hot. So often if feels like it's been sitting under a heat lamp. Here it felt like it was right off the tandoor. 

Not crazy about the overhead lighting - even though they've gelled it in pretty colors, it still feels harsh. 

However, the view is pretty awesome. We watched a storm roll in over the strip, and that was worth the price of the evening. 

I will definitely be back.
