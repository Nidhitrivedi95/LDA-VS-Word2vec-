pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw This is the third Saturday in a row I've had an Indian buffet and was delighted to find this one even better than the last! The selection was huge and they were able to keep everything fresh, filled and inviting. The crowd was very diverse and included many young Indian families with well behaved children. No offense intended - this is one of the ways I judge the authenticity of ethnic cuisine. There are plenty of tables ranging in size from two seats to round tables of 6-8. I tried a lamb and peas dish that tasted better than it looked. The baby eggplant was also yummy and the tofu with broccoli was a spicy surprise. The buffet staples did not disappoint. They had plenty of hot naan where the last two buffets brought it to the table after you were seated. They also had two other types of breads that I'm sorry not to be able to give a title to other that, yummy!
