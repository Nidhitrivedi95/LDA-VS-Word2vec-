nQRl39v-SrVDd2qDXvD1zg This is an excellent Indian Restaurant/takeaway. I have eaten here many times in the past and have always had a really nice meal. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the service is excellent! The food was excellent and sells all the Indian food from my favourite Chicken Tikka Masala, to more spicier curries. The meals are medium priced, not cheap but not too expensive either.
