Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag I was excited to see an Indian food restaurant downtown and was equally excited to try it.  My friend and I went for lunch and we were not disappointed. We ordered the chicken and lamb entrees and both were outstanding. The lamb had just the right amount of heat/spice and the chicken was a little more mild, but very flavorful. The entrees come with choice of plain, butter or garlic nan. We had the garlic nan and it was delicious--light, crunchy and chewy in all the right places. Service was nice, I appreciated the honesty when I asked about having the chicken tikka appetizer as my lunch, and was advised that the appetizer portions may be smaller than I would want. Decor was hip and clean. Nice people watching location. Prices were a little on the higher side, but the quality of the food reflected that. I'd go there again.
