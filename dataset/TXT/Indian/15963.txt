daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ Not the friendliest service.. I placed my order and the man held out his hand for money. Didn't bother to tell me my total until I asked. Chicken biryani is mostly fat. Samosas nothing special. For 2 samosas and a small biryani to go was just a some change under 20 dollars. Ridiculous.
