JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg I already liked this place, but their recent hospitality just made me love them. During Toronto's must recent Armageddon all the electricity went out in the North York region an many other places. My husband and I were starving and couldn't cook anything being that we live in a condo and have an electric stove. We called Earth Indian and not only were they willing to deliver amongst the deadlocked traffic, but offered to have us come into the restaurant for dinner. We decided to go to the restaurant.

When we got there, we weren't the only ones there either! They were delivering and serving other people as well. They set up candles for us on the table and the owner was cooking our food in minimal light. The food turned out great and it was quite romantic! They were so concerned to make sure our meal was good as well. Right as we were paying, with the one batteried powered credit card machine, viola! The lights turned on. 

Definitely recommend this place for their food and homely service.
