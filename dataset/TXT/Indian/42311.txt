qmcIsZjLpxd0V4RekSozmA Everything about this place makes me want to go back for another meal. I am originally from South India and found this restaurant during my recent trip to Edinburgh and immediately went in after looking at their menu. 

I had the Mysore Masala Dosa which is, hands down, the best I've had outside of India. I also had filter coffee with my meal which was pretty good as well. 

The best way to judge if I really liked an Indian restaurant abroad is asking myself if I would visit this place if it were in India. I think with Tanjore the answer to that is a resounding yes.
