a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g This is probably the worst restaurant in the area. I am visiting it intermittently since 1998. The pricing is very high for self serve style of restaurant. Since I visit alone I felt this is best choice but worst experience every time. Recently they started adding hot sauce to curries while cooking to attract customers which is very dangerous for health though tastes spicy. This is not traditional style of cooking Indian curries. This is the only Indian restaurant in this area that has self serve to dine in like McDonalds or KFC type of fast food restaurants. Probably that attracts some customers who do not want to pay tips to waiters in other restaurants around. Quality is very low. I just bought one small Bhendi and aloo fry at almost their closing time of 9:55 PM, they charged $6/- plus 13% tax that came to $6.80/-, it looked warm and almost no taste, I took half of it and left remaining half, the early morning I smell it stale and I had to throw away. But surprisingly I see large number of customers, apparently most of them Punjabis or Punjabi Muslims. This restaurant is a enigma, I still could not understand what drives customers to get there. Though management keeps rising rates every year there is no improvement in facilities, same dining area and congested food ordering area. Many times I came out because I could not stand there due to people moving around.You have to stand up in line to order, they give a token and you have to collect food when token number is displayed. It is like taking food like in food rationing communist countries. Due to the 3 factors above it is not worth your price. One vegetarian plate is probably above $12/- for that style of restaurant, you may get better choices, with nice ambience for the same price in the adjacent Indian restaurants.
