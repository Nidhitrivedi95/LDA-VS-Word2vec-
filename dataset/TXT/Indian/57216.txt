XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Got the lamb roti - which was pretty good and a pretty huge portion for the price.

Really not that interesting, but this is the reason I'm writing this review: ORDER THE ROTI SPICY.

When two of us requested that our rotis be 'spicy', the waiter sized us up and then cautioned us that 'spicy' was 'zOMG REALLY SPICY!11!!!one!1!11!" or something to that effect.  I balked but trusted the waiter - so we got the medium and the ladies grabbed milds.

While the medium spice roti was pretty good, neither of us tasted any heat at all.  My Caucasian friend and I felt a bit offended - did we look like a couple of pansies?  So, he ultimately chalked it up to 'white guy spice'.  I'm honestly not used to servers thinking that I can't handle spice.  Just look at my avatar, tell me that's a face that doesn't look like he can eat EVERYTHING...  you can't.

And sure, most of the patrons were non-Indian (read: white), but it's a young Parkdale crowd (read: hipsters), who you would expect to be a bit more adventurous and has a  wider breadth of culinary experience.  You don't really have to 'dumb down' food for this crowd... right?

Less than 10 minutes after the 'spicy' conversation, a young lady walks in with two young gentlemen and are seated to the table behind ours.  As they are perusing the menu, the lady is raving about how much she loves this place and are presumably introducing this place to her gentlemen friends.  Then, she grabs their wrists and with a piercing intensity warns them both, "Oh - and *NEVER* order the spicy - it is really SPICY!11!!!one!1!11!".

So, in short, if you enjoy Indian food or used to food with flavour, go ahead, ignore the waiter and order your food spicy.  If you're the type of person to pour soy sauce on rice or enjoy chicken fingers, heed the waiter's warning.
