XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Edited to five stars because on a four-star review the owner took the time to address my comment that the service was a little slow. Totally not needed, unexpected and appreciated, and shows how seriously this places takes customer service. I wish I lived locally so I could eat here more often! Thanks again.

With so many great reviews, this was the place near my air bnb that I decided to try during my visit to Toronto. 

The momos were spectacular. I am not sure if I have ever had them before--they were a bit like a soup dumpling. I could have eaten plates and plates of them!

Based on the myriad of comments here, I tried the dry chili chicken. Honestly, I wish I had either tried more momos or had something different. It was basically breaded and fried chicken (think general tsaos) in a spicy sauce. The sauce and veggies it was served with (sweet pepper, hot pepper, onion and cilantro) were really tasty, but the dish as a whole didn't quite do it for me. 

The service was friendly and polite, if a little bit slow. 8pm on a Saturday was a pretty busy time to eat there! The ambience and vibe of the place was very nice.
