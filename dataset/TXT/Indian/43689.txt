RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Just got back from trying the lunch buffet at Taste of India, which was pretty good and a definite value.  It is $7.95/person and includes a drink - soda, mango juice or mango lassi.  The buffet has the usual chutneys and raitas, naan, vegetable pakoras, fresh fruit (mostly watermelon), salad, chicken fried rice and plain basmati rice, 3 chicken dishes and 3 veggie dishes.  Today there was tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala and a plain old chicken curry, channa masala, alu palak, and alu green beans.  There were also gulab jamuns.

My favorite was definitely the alu green beans, which disappointingly is not on the menu.  The chickpeas were good, but I thought the alu palak was disappointing.  (I am generally disappointed in palak paneer at restaurants since I have an awesome recipe that I make at home all the time.)  The watermelon chunks were an awesome palate cleanser, and the gulab jamuns were great.  Total for two people came to $17 before tip.

This is a nice little place, and at lunch almost everyone there is Children's Hospital staff.  Parking is a little hard to find since the residential streets are permit only.  But I really like this place and it's definitely worth it.
