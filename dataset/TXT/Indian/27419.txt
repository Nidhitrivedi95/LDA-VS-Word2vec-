IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw We used Indian Cuisine to cater a small family event for 20 people and we were very happy with the service and food from start to end.   They were helpful and courteous and well priced for everything that was ordered.   All our guests enjoyed the food.    They provided complimentary naans and two salads with the order which was a nice surprise for us.  The Rasmalai desert was great.  The food was packaged really well and every dish was clearly labelled.   Nothing leaked or spilled en route.   We were very happy that the food was not greasy or oily which it can be for most Indian food.   The manager called us the next morning to follow up and  ensure that everything was alright and met our expectations.   Give this little place a try - you won't be disappointed.
