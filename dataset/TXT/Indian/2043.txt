_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg We only went to the grocery store. We have never tried Indian food and were not brave enough to try it since we have no clue what anything is. The man at the shop was really nice and even let us try some candy before buying it. Out of the 6 items we bought we only did not like one and that was because it was too spicy and it was pre- packaged   Not hot spicy, just spicy from so many spices. He gave us a menu to for the food, maybe we will come back for the lunch buffet that way we can taste the different dishes they have to offer.
