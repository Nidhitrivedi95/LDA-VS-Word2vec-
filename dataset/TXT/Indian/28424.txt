J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Worst meal ever!

Although, the portion size is quite commendable hence why I rated it with two stars.

However, the food itself was horrible. I ordered for a very spicy lamb vindaloo, rice and naan. The lamb wasn't spicy at all and very tasteless, I had to add salt, rice was extremely sticky but the naan was perfect. 

My delivery came in two hours and a few minutes after I ordered it and it was unnecessarily expensive. And even though I was paying in cash, the delivery man supposedly didn't have my $20 change for me for a meal of $30. I ended up paying $50 for something I didn't even enjoy. Even though when I called I told them I was paying $50 in cash and I'd need a $20 change. 

If not because I was really hungry, I wouldn't have accepted that meal or even paid. 

My whole experience has been horrible, nothing else can go below this, I don't think. Never recommending this place to anyone 

P.S I'm a lover of south Asian cuisine, and I've tried all sorts if not every. But this place, NEVER AGAIN!
