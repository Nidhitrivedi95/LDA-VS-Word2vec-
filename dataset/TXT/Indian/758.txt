-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg Class is what describes this restaurant the best. Food is just so good. Ambience 5 star. Service 5 star. It's pricy but kinda explains the 5 stars. The 4 region option is too good. Just hope they offer best sellers and different dishes from those regions time and again. Overall verdict: Definitely try.
