ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Excellent dinner on Friday night. Great wait staff and food was delicious. Different that India Palace and Ghandi's. More "fusion" maybe? Nice mix of northern and southern Indian cuisine. Reasonably priced. Great location for us locals who like to avoid the strip. Right across from Hard Rock Hotel, on east side of Paradise.
