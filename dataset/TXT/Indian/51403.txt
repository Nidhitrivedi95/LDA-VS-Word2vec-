UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This is the best Indian in LV and rivals some of the best I have eaten in the states and abroad. There are Nepalese dishes-a very rare treat. There are dishes from Mumbai and from the North of India. Besides the variety, the quality is excellent and quite authentic. The staff are friendly and welcoming. The Buffet is the most complete I have ever seen!!!!!! From Coconut Chutney to Goat Vindaloo, I will sample more dishes when I return.
Excellent!!!!'
