ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Had a very satisfying masla dosa here which was the size of the table! Hubbie had the kottu paratha and they made it super spicy and even added an egg per his requests. Service was great for a small joint. Not a fancy place for hosting guests or taking dates but the food will keep you coming back. Place was packed on a Thursday night.
