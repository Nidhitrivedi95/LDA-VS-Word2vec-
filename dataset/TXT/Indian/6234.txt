3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Sometimes we don't act like tourists when we are tourists but like to go where the locals go.  This buffet for lunch was a great deal, and it must really be, because it was full of indians eating there , except for us.  I loved the tandoori chicken which was moist inside and spicy outside.  The garlic naan was delivered to our table piping hot, so I used it to soak up my curry sauce on the curry chicken and the sauce on a remarkable goat  meat dish. They had steamed white rice and biryani, take your choice.  I wish my stomach was bigger. I'm going back again next Vegas trip, also note: clean bathroom and lots of parking.
