ERX_Dz1prKPk_qXtFhUsAA One of my favourite Indian restaurants. The staff are friendly and helpful if you're a first timer they are able to recommend the most "popular" dishes. I have been there numerous times for dinner around 6-8pm. The service was good and the food was great. 

I've tried the Chicken Curry, Mushroom Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Goat Curry and Butter Chicken- all dishes were amazing. The naan was authentic and very good. I would recommend this place to my friends.
