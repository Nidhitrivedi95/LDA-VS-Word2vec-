B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog Wow! I thought this looked really nice from the outside. When I saw the menu and was served a fresh pappadum, I was reassured. BUT, to my surprise, the service, food and management was incredibly poor. Ok, it was Sat. and very crowded, probably the reason we didn't get anything we ordered for 45 minutes...fine. When the food came. 2 main dishes weren't even put into the kitchen and two of us waited another 15 minutes. Ok, if the food was great, I would've let it go but not only was it over salted, under spiced, and un-authentic, the portions were a total joke!! I ended complaining to the manager and sarcastically he said it was our fault because we didn't have reservations...? He also said since I was a big guy, I was asking for larger portions...and we're lucky he let us eat there without reservations. Bottom line, this was truly one of the overall worst meals ever, and I've been to tons of Indian places...this was firstly a Bangladeshi joint hiding behind an Indian disguise, which happens a lot but doesn't show in the food quite like this did. Insulting to the taste buds and added I jury because the prices are up there.
