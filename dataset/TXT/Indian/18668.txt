eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg My visit to Flavors of India was the first Indian buffet I've visited although I've been to other Indian restaurants-just not buffets.  The food was good.  The number of dishes was limited to about six including vegetarian and chicken.  I was disappointed that there was no meat except chicken .... no lamb or goat.  Service was non existent since it is a buffet.  There was a man who delivered water but not happily.  He also brought nan which he put at the farthest end of the table.  No further contact with him and that was fine with me.  The woman seemed to be the binding force that held the restaurant together.
The building was older and in need of remodeling but the establishment did the best it could with indian motif draperies and statues.
There was no price list with the price of the buffet.  I thought $11.00  was a bit on the steep side.  I only had water and I did like the fact that the man brought a small pitcher of water for the table.  
When I got home I yelped Indian Buffets again and found that $8 to 9$ seemed to be the standard price.
Won't make that my "go to" place until I check out other Indian restaurants and have a comparison.  Until then, I won't go back regardless of the number of reviews.
