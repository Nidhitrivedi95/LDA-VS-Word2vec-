oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw This place is strange. I used to really love it - I would always get something tasty and satisfying. Great comfort food. One day I got into an argument with a co-worker. He said the Mad Greek was good sometimes and bad sometimes, tasteless food and such. I defended the Mad Greek to him, saying I went there all the time and it was always good!

So this argument left me craving some Mad Greek, and I went back a few days later. Terrible. Salty Indian food with no flavor. I was stunned. Since then I have experienced the same a few times.

I would definitely give this place a 4 or 5 star rating for my usual experience. It's not the most authentic, but it's delicious and different, and they have Indian and Greek food for an interesting combination. But occasionally, it's terrible and ruins your dinner. So I guess 3 stars.
