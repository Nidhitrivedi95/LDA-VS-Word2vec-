VqJXm1NjJFYTNKtNp-h_DA The curry chicken roti is the best I have ever had. Tender chunks of chicken breast in a mild curry sauce. Ask for medium spice which will give it some major kick. 

Really friendly staff and patrons. The only downside is the location. The tiny parking lot becomes a zoo on Friday and Saturday.  Try a weeknight if you want to get in and out fast.
