However the food quality is subpar, bland/overpriced ($21 per person!), the washrooms were very dirty (toilet paper rolls (which were smeared in feces) were removed from their dispensers and left on top) while fruit flies buzzed around tables and constantly sat on top of the buffet food trays. 

Finally, if you are looking for a colon cleanse this restaurant will do it for you. My colleagues and I (who are all of South Asian descent) had the runs soon after eating here.
