eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw So I went back to Brar Sweets ... seems like food quality and selection has taken bit of hit.  There is some selection but there is a lot of fillers that don't taste really good - the manchurian was nasty.

Brar Sweets is an okay place to go for a general Indian buffet.  The food is alright and the price for the buffet isn't too expensive.  They have lots of selection and all the dishes are veg.

I think this is a great place to try a lot of different indian dishes without paying for each dish - thats why its a buffet.

The service is pretty good, they come around to clear plates fairly quickly.  Downsides of course no butter chicken lol but overall place is okay for a little family gathering or sample various indiah dishs.
