LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg We went on a Wednesday night. It was pretty quiet. This made for a relaxing dinner where we could easily converse. We started out with Tandoori Chicken Wings-great presentation served on a sizzling skillet and very tasty. For entrées, I had Lamb Vindaloo and my partner had Goat Curry. Both entrées were very tasty and filling. We both ordered spicy. They offer you choice of mild, medium or spicy. This is great if you can't handle spicy food. We also got a side of naan - fluffy, soft and delicious - especially dipped in my Vindaloo gravy! Service was great and attentive. We will have to check out the weekend $12 lunch buffet on our next visit.
