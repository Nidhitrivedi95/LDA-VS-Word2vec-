afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w Been looking to try Sri Lanka food for some time. This place came recommended. It is mostly a take out joint. They do have place at the back that functions as full service restaurant but you wouldn't want to take a date there.  Food was pretty good.  I tried the 2 hopper combo with fish curry. This is decently spicy. My wife who is vegetarian tried egg plant curry and did not like it and then tried Aaloo tomato curry and that lousy her a bit disappointed as well. Apparently they have special vegetarian stuff on Fridays.   I cleaned out my food. Just fyi..if you are from india,.hopper is nothing but aapam.
Next time we will try the food cooked in banana leaf.
