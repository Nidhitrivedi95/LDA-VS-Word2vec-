7BIbvCkI7AXQMVC1-DHpCA Our Indian cowkrs like eating here so that should be a good recommendation, which is why you see some long tables setup to handle group lunches (ie. going away party and there's Indian peers joining).  Don't worry, it's both meat and veg offerings.

Being no authority on Indian food, so I won't comment except to say my stomach seems to be thinking about the lunchtime buffet.  There's a slow burn in my stomach still a good hour afterwards from the spiciness of the dishes.
