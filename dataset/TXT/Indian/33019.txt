llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Every year I come to Sedona, and every year I eat multiple meals here because it's delicious and healthy and sooo much better than most Sedona restaurants (most of which which are made for people without any standards apparently).   Next to Elote, I think this is one of the best restaurants in the Sedona area.  You can always get in and it's delicious and healthy, and they don't over-use oil or salt.  Tonight I had the veg combination plate, which has saag paneer, dal, veg kofta, rice and naan (garlic or plain), all for $14.95.  For a decadent and tasty dessert try the gulab jamun - delicious little round donut-like balls soaked in honey/rosewater - just wonderful. Plus they have a short but decent selection of wines (in addition to a full bar).  They also have a little patio - too cold tonight but I've used in the past.  Last visit, I ate here 3 nights out of 5.  I don't know why this place isn't rated higher other than people who don't like Indian food eat here.  In the 20 or so years I've visited regularly I've only found a few good restaurants (I'm from Chicago so standards are high) and this is my second favorite - it's more a labor of love by the owners than a regular restaurant.  The little Thai place nearby is also excellent.
