Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Great food, great service.  Lots to choose from, if you are vegetarian or not.  The waitress was very knowledgeable and gave great advice, especially to my not-spice loving husband.  Atmosphere is a.little cold but the warm naan and great appetizer s will make you feel warmed up for the wonderful flavors to come.  Parking is on the street.
