llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Very very good. Nothing about the food was bad. Ordered the dinner for 2 non-vegan. Medium spicyness was hot but not overwhelming. We had about 4 different waiters/waitresses all were very nice people. The place is right on Monona Dr. but i dont think ppl give it credit and try it out. Inside is simple, colorful and surprisingly roomy. An inviting place. Will have to go again no complaints. Food was out in less than 12 minsPrice was average but the Indian food was amazing here I was surprised.
