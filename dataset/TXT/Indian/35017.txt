Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg We were trying to find a place near our hotel for a quick dinner and we came across this lovely place. Since we love Indian food, we decided to give it a try. The service was good and pretty quick. Our server, Kumar, was friendly and always checked up on us. We ordered garlic naan, rice, chicken tikki masala, yellow dal, and chicken curry and shared it amongst ourselves. I'd say that the tikki masala was the best out of all of them. We ordered all of them spicy and we were all pretty satisfied with the spice level too. The naan was a bit underwhelming though because I've had better, fluffier/fresher elsewhere. However, it was overall a good experience.
