KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ My bias: Indian food is my favorite type of food. My review: Passage to India is a hit! They start you off with papad (thin cracker) and some tasty sauces. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and the paneer tikka masala (paneer is a delicious cheese that makes a great vegetarian option). Free rice with entrees, but garlic naan is a must for any entree! Quick service and reasonable prices. I'll definitely be coming back here.
