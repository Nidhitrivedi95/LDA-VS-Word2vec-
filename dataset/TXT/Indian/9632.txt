8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ I've given this place a few more shots after my first negative experience, and I'll eat (some) of my words... along with my vindaloo... from BCF. 

They are "factory"-like with some of their more *main-stream dishes (butter chicken a bit bland, mutter paneer is a bit too greasy), but I've delved into their goat and eggplant dishes and I must say they also have some authentic and unique things going on. 

Warm cozy atmosphere, and the service has figured out its jive. They are still VERY slow if you get delivery. They also have a take-out window.

*I understand I am a tiny, pale Nova Scotian, but I have loved me enough Indian food in my day to feel I understand the difference between westernized and authentic. I think. Maybe not fully, but I've eaten buckets of it. So, take my judgement for what you will. :)
