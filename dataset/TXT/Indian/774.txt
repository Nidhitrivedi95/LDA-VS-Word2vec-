-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg I wish I could give this restaurant another star, because it's really in a league of it's own. The food is worth every penny. Their sikandari raan and amiri shaan lobster was one of the best and most unexpected dishes I've ever had. All of their menus are listed or updated on their website, I called them ahead to see if they have anything that might interest me more than their already outstanding menu.

The service is just as good as the food. They have impeccable timing and are polite and attentive. The decor is beautiful, I was given a tour of the restaurant which shows their concern for minor things also, i am a fan of this restaurant now as everything is truly amazing . Will highly recommend this place!
