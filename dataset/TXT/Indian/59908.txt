ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg 5 STARS . Excellent Service  It is a very GOOD place, Nicely Decorated. I tried the indian food for the first time and it was very delicious. Service was excellent and the waiter was Awesome with complete knowledge of food and spice levels. Astush (if I spelled it right) was our Server and was Super friendly. He recommended me the Chicken Tikka Masala for Medium Spicy and Lamb Vindaloo for my husband who wanted to eat spicy. Food was great and the Service made our night awesome. I would Recommend this place to everybody I know.
