xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Quick Review:

I have been to this place few times, and the food is decent, it wont blow out of the water but it is clean and good food

So here is list of items that I had tried so far

Jerk chicken = 3/5
Goat Roti =3.5/5 
Curry fish on rice=3/5
Curry Shrimp and daal on Rice =4/5
Chicken stew =4/5
Boneless Chicken Roti=4/5
hope this helps

PS. their hot sauce is really hot so be careful if you have a mild palate 

Thank you for reading
