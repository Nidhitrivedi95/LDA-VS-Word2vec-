x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag Food was previously amazing but quality of food has gone down hill. 

Noodles are dry and lack sauce. The meat in the dish was also only a small amount. 

The price is decent and portions are large but there's so many similar hakka places down the street that I wouldn't recommend this one.
