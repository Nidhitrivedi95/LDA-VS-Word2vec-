S6pZkoM41a2GWbaxR5bYHw Ordered a lunch combo on phone to pick up at a certain time. When I got there to pick up my order, the attendant casually tells me that the combination I ordered was not part of lunch special hence they have nothing for me. I told them that I was willing to pay more and that I needed to pick up something right then because I was running late for a meeting. The attendant said that I would have to wait ~20 minutes for anything. She was rude and didn't try to make up for her mistake. She didn't provide me with any options. 

If she gave me a wrong combo choice on the phone, the least she could do was one of the following:
- Suck it up and give me what I asked for
- Give me what I asked for at a higher price

Instead she just sits there and waits for me to come in to give me this message. I wish I had more time to talk to the manager and tell him how ridiculously his staff behaved. 

Terrible service! No idea how the food is. It was not fun to stay hungry!
