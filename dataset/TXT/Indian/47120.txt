Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I have been to this place several times and I know my Indian food!! This place does a very good job with chicken makhani (which is my favourite on their menu). I've never been disappointed in any new dish on their menu that I have tried. Would recommend it hands down to all Indian food lovers!
