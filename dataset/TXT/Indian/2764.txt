0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w I've been to Mt Everest twice and I left quite happy both times. The service is excellent and the flavours memorable. I went with three other people and ordered the typical butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, garlic naan and a vegetarian dish with spinach, i forget the name. Normally, after eating Indian cuisine, I am usually ready for a nap. After eating here, I still felt quite alive...yet satisfied. There didn't appear to be a layer of oil on the top which I find with some other places. This, I know makes some of the flavour but at Mt Everest, it still tasted fantastic. Medium was the right amount of spice...a bit of a kick but not overwhelming. 
Also like most Indian places, it is always good to get a few different items and share. I will definitely be back soon.
