yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg I've been coming to this restaurant since I was 6 years old, and every time I come the thrill of eating authentic Indian Cuisine is always there. Whenever I come back to AZ from college this place is my first stop. The top notch Naan (I'd say the best in AZ) and Tandoori breads never fails to give off a homey feeling and complement any dish. If you're gonna stop by here, please be sure to try their famous Chicken Tikka Masala, or Shahi Paneer. The creaminess of the sauce in both of these dishes, and the precise spice blend they use, gives it a uniqueness and signature that no other restaurant I've been to can replicate. 
Going beyond food, the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant betrays the professionalism and care that the gregarious owners put into their work. This 18 year establishment has set the bar high for any future Indian cuisine restaurants in the valley (being practically the first in the valley as it is), and no other North Indian restaurant in Phoenix has come close to rivaling this gem of a culinary establishment.
