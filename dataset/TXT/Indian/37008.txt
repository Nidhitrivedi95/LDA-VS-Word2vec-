o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I figured that if my doctor of Indian descent recommended this restaurant that the food would be good.  The food is not good, it is DELICIOUS and freshly made.  Other restaurants will cook frozen chicken to prepare their food, but this is not the case at the Saffron Indian Bistro.  The chicken tikka masala is out of this world and will melt in your mouth as you savor very tender pieces of white meat seasoned perfectly.  The rice is not the standard white rice found in other Indian restaurants.  Instead Saffron Indian Bistro offers a tasty rice expertly seasoned.  The waitress was very friendly and guided me through the menu to make the proper food choice.  The restaurant is kept clean, and the atmosphere is inviting.
