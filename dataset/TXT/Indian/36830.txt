nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ I really enjoy the food at this restaurant. There were only two tables around 6 pm for dinner, the food was served very quickly. We were given two bottles of spring water, instead of glasses ( which was a little strange and not very environmentally friendly)...

My friend and I opted for the pre fixe menu ( $25) : I had crispy calamari for appetizer and pan seared salmon with salad for main ( my friend had half a lobster with brown butter and crab cake) and white chocolate espresso panna cotta to finish:)

Some reviews mentioned the calamari was over salted, which was not the case for us. It was quite balanced with the yogurt sauce. The salmon was cooked to perfection in my opinion, but the arugula salad was not as exciting..:( I thought it needed a lot more dressing) The dessert was great. Each bite tasted luxurious:) 
The portion was huge with each course. Good thing both us were starving!!

The only improvement I wish to see at this place was the lighting ( the white light felt very clinical) and perhaps some decor to make it feels more welcoming.
