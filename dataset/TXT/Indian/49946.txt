u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw Great service!!!! Rating 5* for sure.  It was my first time here and had ordered their grill special.  Really like the potatoes & beef short ribs.  The chicken was good & same with the rice but there are better places around the same block.  Food overall rating 3.5*. The amount of food feeds about 2 people $45.00.

I will however, go back for service.
