ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Yelp always does me right. I decided to go to Origin India because of the reviews, and even though my expectations may have been somewhat inflated, the restaurant rose to the occasion. I had the duck confit, my friend had the tandoori kabobs, and we shared the scallop appetizer. The food was terrific and beautifully presented, and the service was excellent.
