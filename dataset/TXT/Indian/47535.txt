TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I love Indian food and I eat it fairly often but this place has hands down the best chicken makhani. I ordered the basmati rice, the garlic naan, and the chicken makhani and that was well enough food for two people. The flavors of everything was incredible and I'm actually really sad I'm only in Vegas for the weekend because I'd eat here weekly if I could.
