yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Amazing food!!! For appetizers, I have tried the samosa plate and samosa chaat! For entrees, I tried the murgh (chicken) biryani and the boneless chicken tandoori (marinated in yogurt & spices). For dessert, we tried the gulab jamun (pardon the spelling errors). 

Now, why the 3 stars? The prices, and sometimes skimping on ingredients...ufff my chicken tandoori dish is described to come with a bed of onions and green/bell peppers! There were no peppers!!! There were 1-2 pieces that are too small to be noticed! I told the lady and she ended up bringing me a side of green peppers! Ok!

Whatever!!! But you know why that's a problem??? The dish is $15, and it came only with like 6 chicken pieces, all onions (no peppers, originally...see above), and no naan or rice! I spent another $3 on the naan, and I ended up ordering the small dish of yogurt (raita) to make the meal less dry! You know how much that yogurt was?? $4. So I spent $22 on my 6 pieces of chicken meal and the naan and yogurt!!

Gee thanks guys!! You guys could keep that tandoori to yourself! Next time I'll order a biryani for $14 and have enough food for 2-3 meals!! (It comes with complimentary raita too.. Now that's a deal)
