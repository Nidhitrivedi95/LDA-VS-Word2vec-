FfA7BYSEc46Y3lKHOiqn4g What a great new restaurant in the markham main st area!!! Ordered take out this weekend -- butter chicken, vegetarian biryani, triple trouble chicken, and the mixed bread basket. We got delivery and it arrived within 45 mins and it was fresh and piping hot. Would def order again and try the different dishes.
