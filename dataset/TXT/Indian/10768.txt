Most of the Indian place I tried in AZ just tasted salty, always felt short changed.  But this place you can definitely tasted the spices.  Isn't that why we all crave Indian food once in a while?  I appreciate that they take their time to make their dish perfect.

George, the owner has alwyas been a great host! Thank you!
