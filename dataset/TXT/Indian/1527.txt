-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA It's strictly average. I went along with 6 friends based on a friends recommendation. Let me start with the server who forces you to try a drink you don't want to. He gave us a 5 minute monologue on how good this new drink is. It might be the best drink in the world, but the way they try to sell it you is beyond me. I'd rather have the drink do all the talking than the server. 

We ordered Cheese Masala Dosa's which were good. They weren't heavy enough so we ended up ordering Daal, Malai Paneer & some Naan. We all know Malai Paneer is inherently sweet, so we made sure we ask them if they make it differently(spicy) before ordering. The guy gave us a puzzled look saying that it's not at all sweet and will be very spicy. Alas, it was sweet! To be fair them, the cook was kind enough to make it again with extra spices. It was better but again a little sweet. Daal was good and so was the Basil Naan(highly recommended). 

I wouldn't be going back anytime soon. I've tried there lunch buffet as well and wasn't impressed. Oh and I hope they improve their mediocre service & reduce their prices. It took them 15 minutes to take our order.
