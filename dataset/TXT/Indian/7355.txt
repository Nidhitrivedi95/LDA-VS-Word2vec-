5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q I had kashmir thali and chicken biryani here.. thali was ok. As it misses north indian flavors in north indian thali. Chicken biryani is gross, lacks flovour, rice looks red blood color.. it looks gross.

Above all, their service is damn slow. When we visited, it wasnt crowded, only one person is managing checks and serving. We almost waited for 20 mins for pre prepared thali.. pls hire a good cook and few waiters to continue in business
