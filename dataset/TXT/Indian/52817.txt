V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w I was very disappointed with the newest addition to the Indian scene uptown,  mainly because the food lacks flavor which is just not a good look.  The servers were very friendly and allow you to sample what they have before you order.  I sampled a few items that were just ok, so I decided to stick with the tikki masala since this was my first visit.  Perhaps it was me but as I stated before the food simply lacked flavor and how shameful is it to serve store bought naan?
