I2J-eFtxOmm69VrmxR2O7w iv been to this place only once and truthfully speaking i think the food was rubbish. the decor was ok but it my main concern was the service.half the time the staff were speaking another language which my wife felt really uncomfortable with coz it felt like they were talking about us. some of the waiters had a bad odour problem. the rice was sticky and the chicken curry was very runny and quite tasteless.the tables were too close to one another and felt like people were looking at what i was eating. recently went to Indian Flava and it was a breath of fresh air. iv wrote a comment on the Indian Flava page in more detail so check it out...
