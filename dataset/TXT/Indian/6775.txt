4g9DDKepRkxissGgiMntUg Pros
-no line (unlike the 45 minute wait at timmies)
-At the airport so you can think of the delicious food you will get once you go somewhere else


Cons
-out of basic staples like coffee and bacon
-super rude service
-astronomical prices for Indian fusion sandwiches (hot tip , I don't want a Curry sandwich instead of actual breakfast food)
