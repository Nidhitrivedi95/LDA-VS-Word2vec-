LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Gone are the days when these guys were simple and yet focused on delivering the best South Indian food in the country. They started out from a small hole in the wall at a food court. Now, having moved out to a new place and their own restaurant in the last few years, the quality of food has become quite average. The service is pretty awful, even for an Indian restaurant. There is a significant delay in delivering the food and they even hid the burnt piece of food once on our plate and still had the audacity to serve it. I ended up there a couple of times with family and had a very irritating and unpleasant evening both times. Just wanted to smack the servers around their ears for being so stupid, unsmiling and ineffective at their job. The food could have been the saving grace but it wasn't. I am done with this piece of crap place and never going back.
