I arrived at 6:30 to pick up my to go order, and stood waiting at the front desk for almost 10 minutes before even being greeted by someone. The place was mostly empty, with only one table occupied, so it wasn't due to a crowd that initial service was so delayed. While waiting there, I saw a bag of to go food sitting on a nearby table, with food containers inside the bad toppled over sideways. I said to myself, hopefully that's not my food. Sure enough, that was my food. I was finally greeted and got my order and paid (somewhat pricey as well, above average for Indian food in the area).

Now, the actual food - terrible. Not authentic (I'm indian), lacking flavor, and not cooked well at all. I had an order of butter chicken and an order of saag paneer. The spinach in the saag wasn't even blended or cooked all the way, and was bland, lacking any flavor, spice, or salt. Absolutely horrendous. 
The butter chicken was a solid 3/10, but the quantity was horrid (see pictures). The container was 1/3 empty, when it is usually full at other indian restaurants in the area. This is UNACCEPTABLE for a $15 dish. Taste-wise, it could have used a little more salt and a little bit more flavor (just felt like I was eating a creamy bland tomato soup).

Overall, look elsewhere for Indian food. There are far better options out there.
