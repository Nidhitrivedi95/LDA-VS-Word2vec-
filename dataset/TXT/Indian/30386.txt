K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Have been here couple of times and usually I was really happy about the lunch buffet ($10.99) with many dishes available (including Saag Aloo, Matar Paneer, Chana Masala and Butter Chicken) and even more - the dinner.
But this last time the buffet was pretty disappointing. Not sure if it's often like this we were just unlucky. We arrived at 2:00pm (lunch buffet is closing at 2:30pm) and some dishes (including rice and salads) were already (or almost) empty, not re- filled. Only Butter Chicken was re-filled at 2:25pm when we were ready to leave. Some people arrived, put down their jackets, but when they saw the empty buffet dishes, they said "we changed our mind" and left. The manager and waiter did not care about it, did not ask why they are leaving.
Aside from dishes being empty, the food was very oily. For example meat dishes were swimming in oil! It looked non appetizing. I know that most places re-fill their dishes and keep mixing sauces so they at least look better.
And, even the service is not the friendliest here. We really wanted to come back here because we had great dinner dishes here (Saag Paneer and Butter Chicken) but when you order from menu, may be different quality than when you choose buffet). The bottom line - we are not coming back for lunch here.
