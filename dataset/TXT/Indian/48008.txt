TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Excellent food.  I got the Tandoori Chicken with the medium spiciness which was perfect.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and the flavor was really, really mouthwatering good.  I also got the Basmati Rice, which was perfect as well. The cheese naan was worth it as well, very soft and fresh with great flavor.  I love the mint sauce that came along with it and the brown sauce was excellent as well.  I will come back the next time I'm in Vegas for business, I ate a bunch of high-end high-rated food in the resorts while I was here and this is what stood out the most.  I'm partial to this kind of stuff, though, but ultimately I'd love to try many other things on their menu after the awesome flavor and great quality of the food I had here this evening.
