As a vegetarian I just wish some of the tasting menu was not so repetitive, but it didn't impact on our experience there at all.
We took 3 bottles of champagne and they took it away keeping them cold and brought just in a perfect flow! 
Would definitely go again on our next visit to the family in Edinburgh.
Thanks for all this wonderful team!
