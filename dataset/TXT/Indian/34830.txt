Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I think where the rating is right now at 3 1/2 is probably right. I also agree with a lot of other yelpers about getting the best indian buffet for your money. First, I dont expect to be amazed by a buffet, and second, i definitely dont expect to be amazed by a buffet that is so cheap (compared to other buffets on the strip). You get a good variety of indian food (mostly vegetarian) and its around $13. What is the funniest thing about this place is where it is located. It is inside a, what seems to be an abandoned food court type building, and is the only that has been running ever since I first came here 4 years ago. Seriously, I have never seen any other store in this food court open. 
I think if you dont mind eating a little unhealthy indian food that tastes decent you should check this place out. I have had their fresh food here once, and honestly this is one place where their fresh food tastes slightly better than their buffet. Usually, the restaurant's fresh food tastes way better than their buffet, but I guess their food quality doesnt change much between ordering off the menu or the buffet.
