ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw My sis and I came here and we both craving Indian food since we hadn't had it in a while ... the staff is really nice, the place is clean and decor is great. Buuuuut, we left a bit disappointed. I guess this really only applies to the buffet ... which would really have 2 1/2 stars but gave them 3 assuming their regular menu is better. 

We walked in, they seated us and said "we have buffet, help yourself" ... we thought that's all they were offering for lunch, we would have at least liked to see their lunch menu! It wasn't til they offered the menu to someone else that we became curious! haha We picked up a to go menu as we walked out and it sounds a lot better than what we experienced ... 

I guess being from Los Angeles, I've had my fair share of Indian buffets and this one fell short in my book. It was $14.99 and the selection was small. White rice, tandoori chicken, vegetable curry, chicken curry, punjabi curry (not sure what kind of meat it was, it was mushy), fish curry ... a potato soup (which was really salty), fruit salad and plain naan. I guess back home they just have so much more to choose from ... samosas, garlic naan, multiple curries etc. The food was ok ... just lacked variety and used to garlic naan. We ordered a side of samosas, good but would have preferred a thicker crust/wrap - it was more of an eggroll wrapper. 

Next time I'm in town and craving Indian food, I think I'll order off their regular menu or go somewhere else for a buffet.
