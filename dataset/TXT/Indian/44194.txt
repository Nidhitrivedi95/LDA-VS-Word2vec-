RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Love love love this place..some of the best Indian/Pakistani food I've ever had and I'm a huge lover of this ethnic genre! My family and I go there and order almost the whole menu! The nann is the freshest and most delicious I've ever had. Great for leftovers as well! Really cool atmosphere, laid back and the guys that work there are hilarious and very nice!
