ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg This place is SO good. I'm so glad I finally had the opportunity to give them a try! 

Just a quick note: Make a reservation! Don't be like me and think that you can just stroll in on a Tuesday evening and not have a wait. Next time....I'm making reservations.

But the wait was totally worth it!

We started with the samosas. Very good, just the right amount of spicy goodness. We also split an order of garlic naan. My goodness. It's warm and fresh with just the right amount of garlic...perfect for dipping. I loved every single bite. If you go this has to be on your list of items to try! 

No seriously, the naan was so good that we ordered another round. Don't judge. It's just that good! 

For dinner, I ordered the Tikki Masala. This is what dreams are made of folks! It was spot on with flavor and I asked for it "spicy" and it had just the right amount of kick. 

My only gripe is that they are a bit pricey. However, if you can get there for lunch I hear the prices are better and the naan is included! 

Overall, it was an excellent meal. And I'm already looking forward to coming back!
