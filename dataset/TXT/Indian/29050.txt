jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q We ordered paneer kadhai, garlic naan, and chaai. The taste was very authentic. We tried paneer entrees in many Indian restaurants in the US but the  taste was compromised and never authentic.
The staff was very friendly , service was fast and yes, how can I forget the view of Lag Vegas airport with the famous Strip behind it!
