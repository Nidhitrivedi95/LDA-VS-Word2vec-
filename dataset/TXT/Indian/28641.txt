JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg My experience with this place is based on a delivery order from Orderit.ca and upon seeing the executive specials on Yelp, I think next time I will just swing by for a pick-up instead because I think the prices of their delivery services is inflated compared to their dine-in prices.  It also took 1 hour for the delivery to arrive and I was getting worried whether the food would come at all because I placed the order quite late at 10pm.

We ordered the butter chicken, vegetable korma and eggplant dish and a few sides.  I really liked everything, especially the vegetable korma.  The reason for the 3 stars is because my vegetarian friend found a piece of the butter chicken in the eggplant dish and that's a huge no-no.  There should never be meat found in dishes that are deemed vegetarian, that's not cool.  Upon seeing that this place is a buffet, it kind of makes sense that maybe the person spooning the dishes into the take-out containers got a little tired and was careless, but it is still unacceptable.
