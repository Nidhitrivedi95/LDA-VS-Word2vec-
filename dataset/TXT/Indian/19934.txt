FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Amazing indian lunch buffet with really good indian food. All tables will get a basket of naan, there is also a desert bar with good mango ice cream.
Things I ate at the buffet:
·Briyani rice with chicken: delicious! Easily my favorite dish in the whole buffet. It wasn't too spicy either and the chicken in it was mostly red meat, yum.
·Samosa: big and delicious... It's stuffed with potatoes and was so good.
·Saag (creamy spinach): good
·Paneer: not bad. 
·Chicken tikka masala: this was a disappointment. This is one of the staples I always eat at all indian restaurants. I felt like I was eating defrosted pieces of dry Tyson chicken breast that had been cooked in the sauce. It almost tasted too healthy.
Overall, delicious and cheap food in unlimited quantities. Great deal especially for UW students!
