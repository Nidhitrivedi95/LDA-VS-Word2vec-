auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I've been to Taj Palace twice now: Once for dinner and once for their lunch buffet. Both times, I was really happy with the food and service! The restaurant is in a very restaurant heavy strip mall, so you literally have a ton of choices, but let me tell you that Taj Palace is one of the better ones. 

The first time I went was for dinner. I got Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend got Chicken Vindaloo. Both dishes were delicious! So tasty. The servers were friendly and regularly refilled our waters. The second time I went was for the lunch buffet. They have a bunch of options on the buffet, including salads, vegetarian/vegan options, and meat selections (chicken and goat in various forms). The food was delicious, but not as spicy as if you order a dish off the menu. 

I'd definitely recommend going here anytime you're looking for delicious Indian Food!!
