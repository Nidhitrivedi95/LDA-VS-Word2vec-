TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Had the worst customer service experience possible. First of all , there wasnt a server who came to attend us for almost 20 minutes. When we did ask them, they were very rude and told us tht we were lucky enough to even get a seat. This happened eventhough there wasnt any waiting.  At last, when someone did attend to us, they didnt serve us any food for atleast 60 minutes. After which we did complain to the owner who was no better then any of the servers themselves.By the time we received our food, everyone else who had arrived after us were done with the food. We were really dissapointed with the discriminating attitude and rude behaviour of everyone in the restaurant. Even if the food is good , that doesnt explain the bad customer service. We were in vegas for a trip but  they really were the worst people in whole of vegas we have been to. So i advise all tourists, If you dont have  atleast  2 hours to waste   and on top of it listen to the rude attendants, dont even bother being there.

NEVER AGAIN!!!
