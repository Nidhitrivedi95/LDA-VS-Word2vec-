2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA I went inside this place without any expectations just to get something to eat for my wife... But after seeing a bunch of people waiting I decided to orders for me....

Got spicy chicken biriyani & butter chicken .. We both liked the ethnic taste.. I was not out of the world or so.. But best curry I had in last few years .. Quality of the food is great too...
