axGUBM5mgmFZQn85bMTVPA Cafe Nirvana is my favorite Indian restuarant in the area and there are a few around that I would rate as very good. The servers are always helpful and accomodating. My favorite dishes here are Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Shahi Khorma, and Chicken Vindaloo. We've had several different appetizers that are very good as well.   I also like the decor and the overall atmosphere of the place.
