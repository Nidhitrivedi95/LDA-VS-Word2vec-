iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I hate to leave a bad review because I love Indian food, but every time after I eat here I have digestive issues. I think it's too much sodium and processed Ingredients in their food. It taste good but it comes with a high price of bloating. This last time I noticed the taste of high amounts of sodium in the meal. So if they make this correction and I dont have extreme bloating after I would then recommend it.  Less processed ingredients to make it healthier and easier to digest! It's like eating the junk food if Indian restaurants
