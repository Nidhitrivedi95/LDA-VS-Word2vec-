RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg First experience with Indian food. It was definitely an experience - I can't say Indian is my favorite food at this point but it had some great spice. Service was great and very attentive throughout the whole dinner. I'm willing to try it again and maybe I'll find my favorite dish.
