PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Since we were venturing out to Brampton, I thought we should have an authentic-ish experience, and check out Tandoori Flame!

This place is insanely busy. We came on a Sunday at 9pm, and still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table. I wouldn't say its fancy, as it definitely had that buffet feel (hey, it's a buffet!). 

We started the evening with their signature cocktail, which had a clever name I promptly forgot. It was a blended mango / chili drink, and for $7, it was a pretty good value. We then hit up the buffet, and everything was pretty decent! I was a little worried since we were going just an hour before close, but the food tasted fresh and there was a good variety of meat, vegetarian, and rice dishes. 

While the service was a bit lack-luster, I really don't expect so much from a buffet. It didn't even seem like service staff existed - getting water was nearly impossible, and getting the bill took forever too. 

All-in-all, I had a pretty decent first dining experience in Brampton.
