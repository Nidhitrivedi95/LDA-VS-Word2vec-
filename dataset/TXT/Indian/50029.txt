U3Ah385YhvlraXsKcEeZ4g Hubby and I stopped in for a lunch yesterday.  The food was ok but bland bland bland.... his eggs benedict --nothing to it.  Just ok, very bland hollandaise.

I tried the Egyptian style lential/rice/tomato sauce dish.  I would expect some flavour to pop if the food is middle eastern style, instead the tomato sauce was like the tomato sauce found on Cabbage rolls (and to boot, there was cabbage in it.... don't recall cabbage being an ingredient in many Middle Eastern Dishes but anyway...), and it too, was bland.  Season your food, people.

Bonus points for the fresh, crisp salads and house made dressings , we enjoyed those.  If the food was as seasoned as your salad dressings that would help.
