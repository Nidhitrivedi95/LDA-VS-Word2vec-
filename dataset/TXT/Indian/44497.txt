rwuMWGqt7L5l5lDsOYv1dw I'm not very familiar with Indian food, and I realize that this is a very Americanized place, so this review is written with that in mind.

The food here is decent.  It's oily, as others have noted...  very oily...  which is the biggest strike against it.  I prefer the Zyggy rolls over the rice platters, and am going to try the falafel the next time I'm here (I love falafel).

I don't come here regularly, but maybe once every month or two.  I prefer more traditional Indian food, or internationalized/Americanized traditional foods (samosas, tandoori chicken with basmati and/or roti/naan, pullao, etc.), but for the niche this restaurant fills, it's excellent other than the oiliness.

The spiciness...  there's quite a bit of it, as well as of salt, and that I usually get the spiciest that I can.  I'm Chinese, but my father is a Vietnamese-born Chinese, so I'm used to and like to push my limits on spiciness (Koreans have nothing on the Viets!).  It's still tasty, but the food snob in me recommends getting around 6 if you want the best blend of spiciness and taste receptivity.

Delivery from this place is very nice.  =)  It's free, the food is cheap, and it's usually reasonably quick, and the food is still very hot.
