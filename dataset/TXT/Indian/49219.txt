Lots of variety and not cheap dishes, they had two lamb dishes which were excellant. The sauces all had good flavor.  Moderately hot although the lamb vindaloo was hotter. Also excellent tandori chicken and daal. The main dishes were a better bet than the appetizers.  My wife does not tolerate chili heat so she got the chicken tikka masala very very mild and it was great.  Lots of flavor but mild enough for her to eat.  So if you have some one who does not tolerate hot foods this restaurant can accommodate them, a rare thing in Indian restaurants.  We both left stuffed, my wife took home half her dish home although she did have pouri.  the rice pudding at the end was excellent, the raita was also excellent.  The tab for two of us was $27, a real bargain for this quality of food.
