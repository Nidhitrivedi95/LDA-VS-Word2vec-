KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA How do I give half stars? I would really like to give a 4.5. This place is very fast becoming my favourite Pakistani restaurant in mississauga/ Etobicoke /Toronto combined. Their BBQ items are too legit to quit. Easily better than Lahore tikka house, BBQ tonite, and cafe de khan. Their Karhai??? . It is SO bomb diggity. The naans are amazing too! They are thinner than the other restaurants I've tried but still so soft, buttery, and so delicious. 

The place is not the fanciest sit down place but it's clean which is really important for me. My interactions with staff have always been super courteous. True desi style hospitality - they always make you feel welcomed and at home. Keep in mind that they do take a bit of time to get the food out (it really is freshly made, you can tell from the taste) so don't go here if you're super hungry!
