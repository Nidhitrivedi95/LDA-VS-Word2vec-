8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I'm not sure what kind of drugs they're putting in their food but I am seriously addicted. I struggle not to eat there more than once a week. It's not just some of the best Indian/curry around, it's some of the best food of any genre I have found in C-U. I am so thankful my coworkers took me here as I am from Colorado and have been struggling to find good restaurants around the area. Highly recommend the chicken tikka masala with rice and naan. I haven't even ordered it with any spice but I hear good things. Check em out!
