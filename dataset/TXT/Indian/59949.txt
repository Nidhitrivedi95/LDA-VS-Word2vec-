ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Hot fresh and delicious. We ordered meat samosas and meat naan (lamb) and it was so hot and fresh.  The flavor was incredible.  The tamarind sauce was great.  The service was accommodating and friendly and they even made us a special order at lunch time and accommodated all my fathers special requests.  Highly recommend.
