Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ Extra happy about having this place so close to us. Haven't tried going there for lunch but the price seems right that I may be there tomorrow! It's not too spicy - but spicy enough. Bombay chicken is so good! And what made me really happy is that when we ordered take-out, they were very generous. I hope that keeps up. I hate places that make you pay a lot for so little. But this place seems fair for the price.
