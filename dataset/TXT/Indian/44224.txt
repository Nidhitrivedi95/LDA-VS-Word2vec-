RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I love this place the the reason I give it a 4/5 is that over the years the service and food have really taken a hit.  When I first started going here almost eight years ago the food, portion size, and service was amazing.  Now we go and portion size is half.  Prices have gone up. However food taste is still good it's not the same.  Sometimes a hit or miss.  My favourite is the beef ribs.  They never disappoint. The lab chops are flavourful and tasty.  The seekh kabobs are well cooked but on the small side. We eat street style and it's a fun touch.  You basically find your own table and then the server comes  and takes your order.  You also go up and pay with your table number.  This place is huge so they feel this is the best way to handle service.
Over all I love this place and will always go back
