UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Both the lunch buffet and the menu items are amazing.  Everything here is awesome!  I'm a vegetarian, so I appreciate that everything on the buffet line and in the menu is labeled with whether it's vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc., etc. to accommodate all kinds of diets.  You won't regret eating here!
