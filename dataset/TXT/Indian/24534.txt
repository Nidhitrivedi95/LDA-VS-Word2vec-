H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ Great food! Portions are large, you can feed 4 people with $25! However....customer service is terrible! I've legit seen them yell at people and deny service to a pregnant woman before!! There is one woman that works the cash that has a hard RBF.... resting bitch face and doesn't come off welcoming at all. I'm Asian so I've never had a problem however my black friends don't always seem to have the best experience there... just saying
