PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA My husband and I go for the lunch buffet occasionally.   The food is delicious!   I am not savvy when it comes to Indian cuisine,  however,  and this place doesn't really help you learn what you are eating.   I dont know what most things are on the buffet. That being said, I am pretty adventurous and the buffet set up allows you to try a little bit of this and a little bit of that.  They serve goat which has a lot of bones etc. In it.  The meat tastes great, but not a fan of all the bones.

The service is not stellar,  but adequate, and the decor is cheap and old.
