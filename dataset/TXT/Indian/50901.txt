UI4lGUcqc4YyzXJ2Uqe6BQ I brought home a meal from 5 Spices, and was pleased.

Let's get the Hakka thing out of the way.  First of all, I'll say that 5 Spices bills themselves as Indian Chinese cuisine rather than explicitly as Hakka.  And I can't claim to be a Hakka expert even by local standards.  I'd been given to understand that what most people call Hakka is chinese-style dishes with indian-style spices (although Wikipedia points out that the cuisine traditional to the Hakka region is actually something else).  I've had food at The Danforth Dragon, but I didn't find it was radically different from Chinese Food.  

That said, we ate the vegetarian spring rolls and manchurian beef, both of which I was pretty pleased with.  The spices were definitely strong, and tasted more like Indian spices than chinese ones.  The dishes had a fair kick of flavor and spice 'heat'.

We also had the chicken fried noodles, which were more subtle, but still pleasant, and the Veg. Sweet and Sour, which I was less enthused by.  It was still reasonable, but I had a hard time relating the sauce to 'sweet and sour', and the vegetable balls were a little mushy (perhaps by design, but I would have liked them slightly more firm).

The price seemed reasonable ($26 for the above dishes, including rice), the service was friendly.  There was no-one else in the restaurant, although it was a late week-day lunch, so I don't read too much into it.

Basically, I was happy with my meal and would order from them again.
