ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ While going through the city trying to experience Indian food in all it's glory, I was compelled to visit Biryani house. Sure, they are also one of the few good values when taking a trip to Church and Wellesley area for some rainbow-filled fun. It was decent for dinner. A bit like Babur in that they serve 'fanci-fied' Indian food that may be tastier at $4.99 than the $14 items they offer. Ingedients may be fresher, sauces a little more complex, but overall, I prefer the mom and pop Indian restaurants around town. A good deal if your headed to Pride week, though.
