JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw We have been here twice and have been very impressed with the food quality.  This place is better than every place we have been to in Atlanta.  Service is great too.  They have high quality on both North and South Indian dishes--which is a rarity.  My final comment is that "you ask and they deliver!"
