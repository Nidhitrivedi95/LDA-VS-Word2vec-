s6IPjR2nSJqhXcGJ49Ckiw I just signed up for Yelp so I could write a review of this place. It was the worst, absolute worst food I have ever eaten. And usually I don't complain if I'm not cooking. The Mulligutawny soup was a weird white colour and had pink chicken in it. Like chicken korma, it was disgusting. And the pad Thai was complete mush. Over cooked, old, soggy, I was afraid to eat another bite. Don't go to this place. Save your $. This place changes over every 3 months, probably same owner, different type of food every time. No one ever in there, should have been an indication. totally regret eating the few bites I did. I can't warn you enough. Do not eat here.
