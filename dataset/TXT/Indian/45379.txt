At about $10 bucks each, they're not priced to move, but they're totally priced fairly.  You get a good about of food for a fair price.  

If you've followed any of my reviews, you've discovered that price plays a huge part in how I give out my stars.  For me to think, "this isn't a super deal, but my word would I return," that's saying something.

If I was feeling a Roti, there's no other place I would go!
