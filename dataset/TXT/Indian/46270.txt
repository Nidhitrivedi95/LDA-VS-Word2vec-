The place is a small hole in the wall, harder to find right now because of the construction nearby, but if you know where to look you'll find it. I got there on a Monday evening, a lot of people were getting takeout, but my friend and I decided to share a Chicken Korma Roti and sat down. There were 4 tables, somewhat greasy, but generally clean. From my experience i would definitely go for takeout next time to avoid smelling like curry afterwards. Our order was ready in 5 minutes and brought to our table. 

I expected the roti to somewhat be an individually portioned wrap for some reason. But its a HUGE 'romali' roti (as it is called in India) with about 2-3 servings of curry in the middle, folded into a rectangular shape, almost like an envelope for the curry. I found this method of serving a bit ridiculous. It's really hard to eat with a fork and a knife because the proportion of curry to roti isn't quite right, and for the 1st 10 bites, there is WAY too much curry, making it quite salty, but by the time you are halfway into your meal, you discover hidden layers of roti underneath all that curry, and it somewhat evens out. 

The food overall was delicious! (a liiitllee bit salty for my taste but that might be because of the excess curry). I'll be returning here to try some other options, however always with a friend because of the portion sizes.The $13  is pricey for an individual meal that isn't good for leftovers (soggy roti? no thanks). Maybe next time I'll ask if i can have the roti and curry separately, or get the curry with rice, which would fix the problem that makes me take off a star.
