CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ Five years later, I still have to say that this is a fantastic restaurant. 

I ran a Meetup outing here. I got the mini tiffin set, which included ravi kachadi, sambar, idlis and a small masala dosa with potatoes. One person did chicken out out of the South Indian dishes and ordered something Northern instead, but overall, everyone was really happy with their food.

Everything was outstanding and people even talked about bringing family and friends here!
