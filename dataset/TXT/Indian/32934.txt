llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Every Indian restaurant in Madison, at least as far as I know, has some kind of lunch buffet. Some of them are pretty basic, and others have a lot of variety. Swad gets points from me because they're definitely on the high end of the variety scale. 

I randomly ended up here on a business lunch. I hadn't been to an Indian buffet in a while, but I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of variety and quality of the food. I tried to limit myself to one plate but when everyone else in my group went up for seconds, I had my excuse. Definitely plenty of things to try. Only problem was then I went back to work and wanted to take a nap. 

Since then, I've had Indian buffets back on my radar as lunch options and the several others I've been to haven't quite measured up to Swad. I just make sure to have plenty of caffeine afterwards.
