RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w What can I say that hasn't been said in the rest of the reviews? The food here is simply delicious, bursting with endless spices and flavours. Love the biryani, kabob sizzlers, kulfi and of course that butter chicken! The hole in the wall environment works.Toronto needs more places like this. If you haven't been yet, just go now!
