If you don't know much about Indian food, you are going to be confused when you try to order. There are several different menus posted up on the wall and nothing has much of an explanation. Just order random stuff and know that it's going to be tasty.

I'm no Indian food expert, but with all cuisines, you just have throw caution to the wind and try it. Thankfully, I haven't had anything bad here so this place will reward you for your curiosity.

The staff is very friendly and don't forget to try their chai!
