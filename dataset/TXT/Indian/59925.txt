ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg What an amazing surprise this little place is! The food was so good!!

A friend suggesting trying somewhere new, so we agreed on Angara.
The minute I walked in I was met with a smile, and escorted to a cozy little booth.
My friend showed up a few minutes later.

We poured over the menu, and finally decided on...
Mango Curry - ($12.99) Slightly sweet and spicy. This dish had fabulous flavor but overwhelmed with too much "heat". It was perfect.

Chicken Tiki Marsala - ($14.99) This one had a little more heat, but not too spicy at all. It was rich, creamy and flavorful! A great rendition of one of my favorite Indian dishes

Aloo Gobi - ($11.99) Cauliflower and potatoes. This was a nice dish as well. 

Garlic Nan - ($2.99) YUM. You can't go wrong with a great nan!

And a side of Riata - ($3.99) A creamy yogurt and cucumber sauce.

We loved EVERYTHING!!! I can't wait to go back!
