tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g Awesome food. Nicer decor than expected, you'll forget it's in a strip mall. We went for dinner around 8:30p on a Saturday. 

My wife and I split a chicken rogan josh which came with basamati rice, and the portion size was perfect. We were able to choose our spice level on a scale from 1-10. We like it spicy and 6 was plenty. 

We also ordered a double order of garlic naan which was great too, along with a mango lassi (better than my sweet lassi). 

Total bill came to just $28.

They have a lunch buffet (9.95 M-F, 11.95 S-S) which will be fun to try.  The menu is large, and they even have several goat dishes I'm dying to try on the next visit.
