GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Went on a Saturday at 6pm just alone , got seated quickly and staff were very friendly ( surprised at some reviews saying otherwise?) 

Started with Chicken Pakora, this was the only let down of the meal. Some of the chicken especially small pieces were so overlooked and tough it wasn't enjoyable 

Main Lamb Kahari , rice and plain Nan Bread. This was special, nice spice to it but not overwhelming, tasted so fresh and the lamb was cooked perfectly . Nan was also baked to perfection , just a bit crispy . A bit too much rice in relation to the main dish though ( not a complaint, just a preference)

Plan on going again 

Dropped 1 star for the Pakora, everything else was class
