OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Came here on a random saturday night while in Vegas,  and was pleasantly surprised to say the least. The place was about 15 mins from the strip and i'm not quite sure why we made the drive all the way to Urban Turban that night. But definitely glad we did:)  It's dimly lit and was super clean and tidy. 
We arrived for dinner around 8:30pm ,and the place was so dead! The bar and the dining hall were both same and it worried me a little. BUT that meant we got seated right away, and the food came out pretty quickly after ordering . We ordered the Manchow soup , chili basil chicken bites, the Bombay Tapas Platter and  the bottomless Bombay lamb masala curry. The food was seriously amazing!  
The manchow soup was insane, and probably my fav. If you like curry and spicy Indian flavors you just gotta try it. It definitely has a kick, and I mean it'll make you sweat (and I eat spicy food every day). The Chili basil chicken bites were soooo good and those went so quick. The Tapas platter was also really good and included chicken tikka, lamb kabobs, Basil chicken, paneer and 2 kinds of shrimp. It came with naan as well and we both enjoyed it all. The basil chili chicken was so perfect, along with the tandoori shrimp. We got a bottomless Lamb dish as well, and that was just okay. The curry was good, but came with very little meat.They refill the curry but not he meat :(  Thankfully we had plenty of other food, and if we had just ordered the lamb curry this review would be very different. lol  
Overall, we would definitely come back to Urban Turban! The food was delicious and the service was excellent.
