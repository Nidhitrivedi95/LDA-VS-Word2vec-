ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Hooray for a terrific Charlotte Restaurant Week choice! Copper had been on my radar for awhile, so it seemed like an ideal time for me and my mister to check it out. I am not an expert of Indian food by any means, but I do appreciate good atmosphere, service, and menu options. Copper delivered on all accounts. 

The restaurant is in an old house, and each room appeared to have a slightly different theme. Definitely perfect for a date night or a meal with visitors from out of town. We were seated in the red room, and were initially the only ones seated there. Our waiter joked that we wouldn't be alone for long, and he was right. It was definitely packed on a Saturday evening, so reservations would be wise. The service overall was a highlight of our experience, and will definitely bring us back. The waitstaff was very helpful in describing dishes and making recommendations, and our meal was well paced.  I won't go into much detail about the food because it was a specific menu for restaurant week, but I will say everything was delicious, the flavors complex, and at a perfect level of spice.
