tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Went in for lunch the other day, food was good and server was very friendly. However I just placed a phone order and the guy was so rude. Questioning my order, asking why I wanted what I ordered and not something else. He asked when I wanted to pick it up, then told me no after I answered,  he then told me a time that was 45 mins later. Not sure what that was about but I'll see what happens when I go to pick up my order.
