ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Still my favorite Indian place in the Cleveland area.  I almost always get Saag with veggie pakora and garlic naan.  Other items I've tried have always been just as delicious.  They will adjust the spice to your liking from none to a ear steaming.  The service seems to get a little better each time I've been.  You never feel forgotten like I have at other Indian places in town.    The flavors are rich, the colors are vibrant, the portions are generous, the atmosphere is cute,  and they have a nice little patio if that's your bag.  I also really like that they don't have a TV running in the place.
