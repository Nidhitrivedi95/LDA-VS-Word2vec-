ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ I ordered chicken masala, pakora chat and aloo chat for delivery. The food came a half hour sooner than expected, so how come both chats felt like they had just been scooped out of a vat in the fridge and never heated up? They both looked old and one of them smelled old.

I decided to eat the chicken masala first since it was the only thing warm, and it was so bland, and unappealing that I decided I had to heat up the other 2 dishes to try and make up for it. Both of these dishes were extremely unappealing as well. I sadly had to throw most of it away. I always order indian food requesting a low spice number, but that has never accounted for loss of taste like this. I didn't even know you could go wrong with chicken marsala! I can easily say this is the worst indian food I have ever eaten.
