2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg So we got a Groupon to try an India restaurant Mayuri Palace that was under new ownership. We started off with an appetizer the vegetable samosa.  They were very good.  It was a basically a vegetable empanada with a tamarind sauce and a green chili puree as a sauce for dipping, great flavor and all around a good dish. For our entree's we ordered the lamb seekh kabob. I was very disappointed with this dish the lamb was very dry and the amount of actual ground lamb you received for a $14 entrée was small. We also got the Mayuri special chicken.  Again very disappointed the sauce had so much cracked black pepper and was so over seasoned you could not even taste the chicken or other vegetables in the dish.  I have worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years and I am fully convinced that we were just eating the leftovers from their lunch buffet.  The reason I say this is because the lamb was so dry it seemed like it was just reheated after it's first cooking and the sauce for the chicken was so reduced it was salty, as thick as plaster and over seasoned it had to be just simmering away on the buffet and then just reheated for dinner.  I have had wonderful Tandoori chicken from this pace as well as masala curry but this trip was a huge disappointment.  The one thing that saved dinner was the wonderful company from my girlfriend
