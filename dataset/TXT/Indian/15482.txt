csDrjCYpINQtnIu7xA9oqw I think this place is new here in HoMa, because I never heard of it before.
But I'm so happy I found out about its existence, because we finally have some great Indian food here and on top of that: They deliver!

We ordered:
Soupe Dahl
Samosa aux legume
Jal'Frezi (agneau)
Poulet a la mangue
Bindi Bhajee
Shahi Paneer
Naan & Riz Pilau

Everything was tasty, but the mango chicken, dahl soup and okra (bindi bhajee) were my personal favourites, oh and the naan, the naan was super duper tasty too.

I hope they stay this amazing, we really needed a place like this. 
They're not super cheap, but the food was worth it imho.
I will order from this place again in the future, for sure.
