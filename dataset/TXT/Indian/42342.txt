qMw7mFHAjgG7qN82aXmeZg I hit a an Oil Well! 
I tried the vegetarian fare at this place and was sorely disappointed. They use so much oil in their curries I could open a retail store selling extracted oil. Other sore points: their quantities are very small for what they charge. And the food flavor is extremely plain fare. I will not recommend not return.
