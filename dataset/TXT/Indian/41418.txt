Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I soooo didn't want to eat here but was kind of peer pressured into it. I was really afraid of what I would get at a Wisconsin Indian restaurant next to a hotel. I was happy to be proven wrong. This was one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to. There were awards all over the walls that showed just how awesome everyone else thinks Maharaja is as well. I split a samosa, the chicken 65, an order of keema nan and lamb moghlai with the BF. The appetizers were all good but not worth finishing. What was amazing was the keema nan and the lamb. I mean they were out of this world delicious. The lamb could have been a little spicier but that was our fault since we were being little chickens and didn't say to make it spicy. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who finds themselves in Madison and searching for something exciting and delicious to eat.
