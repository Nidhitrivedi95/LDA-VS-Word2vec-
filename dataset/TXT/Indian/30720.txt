kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A I mostly eat North Indian but this place is just amazing. Great dosas and great lunch buffet.

I usually end up here at least twice a week. Although it's a South Indian restaurant, the channa masala and batura are better than any North Indian place I've been too. Prices are the icing on the cake!
