82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Delicious options, fresh and tasty food. Large range of options for vegetarians and a couple of vegan options as well. It was on the pricier side but definitely worth it as it was a lovely atmosphere and overall a great experience! The naan with paneer cheese was fresh and delicious, and the 4 sauces/chutneys they brought in were great tasting. We shared different options such as the beef korma, aloo gobi and veggie curry and everything was great with a good range of spiciness.
