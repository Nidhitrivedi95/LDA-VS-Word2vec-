GyHJAwBQ58L3ORBLm0G-hg I went for lunch buffet recently and I did not have such a good experience. The restaurant was clean but hardly there were anyone. We did not get good customer service too. We are vegetarians and the food was ok. There was just one appetizer and it was quite salty. There were many deserts but I just liked one.  The rotis, curry and rice was great. But  overall the experience was just ok.
