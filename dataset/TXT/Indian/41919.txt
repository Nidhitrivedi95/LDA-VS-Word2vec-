qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA I will probably never go to the Red Room ever again. 

FOOD
Although the food is cheap, it tasted awful.  Check pic to see what I ate. There are so many other cheap restaurants that serve good food. This place is lucky that U of T is nearby.

STAFF
The wait staff were slow and unresponsive.  
They hinted us to get out of the restaurant way too many times by
1. Asking if there was anything else we needed and before we could answer walked away
2. turning off the lights above us.
This would be ok if they were closing or were really busy but alas, they were not.

BILL
We specifically asked them for separate bills at the beginning the waiter said it could be arranged at the bar at the end of the meal. And then the bar told us, no they cannot split the bill (my ass they can't). Eventually they did after we made a stink about it. And they only take cash. I bet they're sure claiming all the revenue they generate for tax purposes...not.

RED ROOM MATH
Also, they rounded down my change to the nearest dollar and expected us not to notice and keep that change plus whatever tip we gave them. I absolutely hate that. I think it is really rude.

I am giving this place a 2 b/c I saw on the menu cheap drinks and I heard they were decent. Otherwise, this place would get a 1 star rating.
