9A-y0TWBKqqP5vsn_CwI3g Went to this place after it was highly recommended by a few friends. Loved that there is an entrance from the underground parking lot. The decor of the restaurant was minimal and maybe a little dated but the place was very clean. When my daughter exclaimed she needed to go to the bathroom I was a little apprehensive since I've read reviews that they were not sanitary but when we walked in, again dated decor but the bathrooms were spotless. We came in knowing that the food would take sometime. We ordered the Samosas and they were very good. My husband ordered the chicken curry and I ordered the chicken tikka masala. Both were good portions and delicious, and the rice as well. I ordered the mango lissa which was very good. We also ordered the garlic naan. That was the only thing that wasn't that great, or very garlicky. The waiter spoke English and German and was very courteous.
