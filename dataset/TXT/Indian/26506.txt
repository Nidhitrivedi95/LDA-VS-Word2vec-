ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg The Good - 
Location, close to downtown and the only better Indian restaurants in the area. 
Building, They've converted a colonial style bungalow into this restaurant. Nice looking from the outside but very dim lightning inside. 
Parking, ample free parking available on the road and around the place. 

The Bad -
Food, pretty ordinary stuff, you'd get better Indian food if you can drive down around Matthews area. Only the mango lassi saved the day. Naan were hard and rice not well cooked. 
Service, slower than the usual Indian restaurants. 
Meal size, on one hand they're charging you premium prices but one entree is only good for one person, funny isn't it. This isn't an American or continental entree after all. 

The Ugly -

Too many tables in such less space. I felt horribly claustrophobic inside especially with the lights being so dim. The noise levels inside were intolerable. HUGE LET DOWN FOR PAYING PREMIUM FINE DINING CHARGES AND FINDING SUCH A CRAMPED PLACE. 

Verdict - 
You're short of options when in downtown and lookin for Indian food so this is the only place to go, rest other restaurants in the area have pathetic feedback. Not that I'd advice you to not visit this place, but keep your expectations low and wallet full of cash.
