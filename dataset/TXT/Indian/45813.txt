SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ This is a hidden gem in the Cultural District! We brought a bottle of wine from the Market Square Grocery. This restaurant is BYOB with no corkage fee! We ordered the Malai Kofta and the Palak Paneer. The Kofta in particular was a deliciously balanced blend of spice, cheese, and veggies.

Subtract one star for: The a/c is fairly weak, and there were a few little flies. Both of which perhaps are part of the authentic Indian atmosphere :-P

After walking past the crowded, noisy venues of Market Square and Sixth Street it was nice to find an affordable, tasty venue for a quiet dinner date after enjoying comedy at Arcade. Methinks this place could stand to be a little bit LESS quiet though. Check it out next time you are downtown!
