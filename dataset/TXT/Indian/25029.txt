H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ So I went there for lunch today, I think they have a new owner now.  The food was good but it can be better. The nun was good. As got desert, the rice pudding was wonderful. 
I tried this place 2 months ago, the food was much better, the new cook is not as good as the previous one.
