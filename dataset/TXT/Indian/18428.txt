eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw We came in to our parents "favourite" restaurant expecting the same usual taste but left with a rather bad taste. The food just wasn't the same. My parents noticed right away and were turned off. The flavours, textures and abundance of spices were just off. The service of the Dosa and anything behind the counter was slow and we had to ask several times for assistance. Everything from the buffet line up to desserts has changed for the worst. They even took out the chocolate fountain. 
Definitely new chefs and management/owners that are cutting corners and trying to make another dime. So sad to see one of the most popular places in GTA fizzle out.
