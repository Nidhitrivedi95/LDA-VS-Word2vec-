m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Finally got to try Kohinoor for the first time, and I'm hooked!  I love Sitara but don't always like hiking over to Urbana, and Kohinoor has pretty much the same menu.  The staff was super friendly and always made sure our water glasses were full.  The restaurant is clean.  We've gotten used to waiting a while to get our food at Sitara, but I feel like we got everything pretty quickly at Kohinoor.  We may have just beaten the dinner rush though.  Anyway, we had the samosa and aloo tikki appetizers (both great, and I especially liked the orange sauce that came with it).  I had my usual shrimp curry and it was fantastic.  The curry sauce has just the right balance of sweet and savory spices.  My entree came with rice and I also ordered some cheese naan on the side.  The naan was so pillowy and cheesy.  I can't wait to come back!
