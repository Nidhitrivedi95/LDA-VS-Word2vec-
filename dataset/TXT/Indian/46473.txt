SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A I should've known this meal was hopeless when our waiter brought my dining companion non-alcoholic beer instead of the real thing.  Thankfully he did not make this mistake with the wine however it still puzzles me as to why he brought the bottle to the table for inspection but did not think to also bring an implement for opening it. 

The chicken tikka masala was almost passable but the assorted appetizers we ordered were pretty woeful. A tiny little plate of dried up little bites, almost indiscernible in flavor from one to the next.

Suffice it to say, India Oven is not worth putting on your list of "must dine at" spots in Las Vegas!
