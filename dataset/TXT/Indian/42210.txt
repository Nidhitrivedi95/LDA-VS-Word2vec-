qkmi4fccR60HhX1QBDMZpg We were looking for Indian for dinner tonight and were so glad that we stumbled upon this place. We had the Mo Mo chicken appetizer, spicy pappadom, and pickel tray, all delicious choices to start. My husband had the lamb leg, which was absolutely divine and so tender. I had the chicken biryani, which was also wonderful. We had the date and ginger naan along with our meals. All in all, we couldn't rate this place higher. Our waiter/manager/owner was also very nice. Eat here!
