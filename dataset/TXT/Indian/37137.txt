o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Late night "I want something different" meal per my girlfriend.

Food was OK, the menu is all a'la carte. The ambiance is modern decor. Ordered the samosa as an appetizer and it was fabulous and cheap ($2). My girlfriend ordered the chicken tikka masala (as always when trying a new Indian restaurant) and our waitress courteously inquired how spicy she wanted it. I was surprised the receipt actually reads "spice level: mild". However, I ordered lamb vindaloo and ended up with chicken vindaloo instead and not nearly as spicy as requested. I attribute this to the fact that the co-owner's daughter, aged 2, was acting up inside the restaurant which made it difficult for her to take down our order correctly. Cute kid, but this is not the place to be an evening day care.

Close enough to get an ethnic cuisine fix if necessary, but not wildly impressed.
