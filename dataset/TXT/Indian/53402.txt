VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg My mom and I have come in for lunches a few times, always seem to land on Wednesdays....and every time we have been pleased, and very thankful this was a good Indian lunch option close to home, but we had to let you know about our last time there...
We know what restaurant owner expectations are for servers,cooks ,bartenders, food runners,etc...and this one we thought the owner should know... A pleasant american girl was our server, but where it went unpleasant was her descriptions of the food... 
We usually get a veggie dish and a chicken dish, we never heard of what these particular dishes were on this lunch special day, so we asked her to described it..
1st thing she said is, the veggie dish was just peas,carrots,and looked like vomit, she claim to only like all the chicken dishes they  are all good...
My mom and I couldn't believe she was calling the chefs food vomit, that's actually all we could think of, we got our dishes,(1 chicken,1 veggie ) and although it didn't taste bad, our hunger was turned off, and we no longer could eat, so my mom and I basically paid $25 for our chai . We needed the check ,couldnt  find her so i come to find her texting on her phone...what a pet peeve to have that kind of employee, phone usage shouldn't be in the public's eye...but maybe its a more laid back environment, but we weren't getting proper service. So needless to say, we did not enjoy that time at all and felt like we wasted our money that day.
