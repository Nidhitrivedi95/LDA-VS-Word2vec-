Not to mention that items on the buffet are changed constantly with exception of some signature dishes. The flavor remains consistent and always tasty every time I visit.  There is not much ambiance beside Indian music being played but the reason to go there is the food. Possibly the best Indian restaurant in NE Ohio. Recommendation: Chicken Masala, Aloo Gobi, Lamb Curry.
