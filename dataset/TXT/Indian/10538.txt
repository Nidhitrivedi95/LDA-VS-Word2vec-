However, I am happy to note that Britannia Spice is the exception to the stereotype. The food here is really good: flavorful, fresh, and not compromised for Western palates. I also love that dishes can be ordered in both side-dish and entree portions, which lets individual diners have some variety if dining alone or in a group that's not eating family-style (shared dishes). 

My partner and I especially liked the Mushroom Bhajee and Mughlai Vegetables. Service was a little formal and stiff for my tastes, but the servers are very kind and try extra hard to ensure a nice dining experience. I would have liked to see more exotic offerings for dessert (not being able to finish off an Indian meal without gulab jamun for dessert is practically heresy!), but outside of that, our dinner at Britannia Spice was practically perfect.
