F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw I am a regular at eddies Hakka Chinese but recently I have been visiting a new Chinese restaurant, Hakka Ren. The food here is scrumptious, especially the sweet and sour chicken. The helpings are bounteous and the pricing is good too. The service is pleasant and the food is halal. All in all the restaurant is a great place to go with family on Sunday night dinners and I highly recommend it. Very clean place and great service also.
