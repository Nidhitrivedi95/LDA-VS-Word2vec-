x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA Good little restaurant on Jean Talon - they have decent service and do all the staples nicely. 

Warning - if you order for pickup, the little bastards won't make it until you actually physically show up, forcing you to wait 45 minutes for your food. I guess too many people have called to order and then never shown up, so beware.
