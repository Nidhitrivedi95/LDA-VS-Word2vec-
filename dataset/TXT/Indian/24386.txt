h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ I went to this place for lunch buffet mainly because of the hype in and around the area.  But it wasn't up to the expectations and lot costlier for such type of buffet. Oily curries, minimal varieties in the buffet, not that great ambience. It's okay to try here but definitely not worth the money.
