cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w Really enjoyed this place, the food was great.  We had a number of appetizers and shared some mains (came with a group of 7) and particularly enjoyed the Lotus root dish.  The ambiance was more casual than I was expecting but the service was quick and friendly.  I particularly enjoyed the welcome drink :)
