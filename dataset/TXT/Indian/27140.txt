Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Great location, patio dining, and AMAZING food! Every bite was bursting with flavor and it was a special treat as a vegetarian to have so many menu options. My meat-loving husband not only was enjoying his meat-filled platter, but couldn't keep his hands off my veggie dishes. Can't wait to try this restaurant again.
