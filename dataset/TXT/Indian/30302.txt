K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I'm not usually a huge Southern Indian food fan (I prefer the Northern fare), but my mum has taken me to pretty much every Indian restaurant in the greater Phoenix area and she wanted to try this one, so my brother and I tagged along (who says no to free Indian food? Who?). Food was awesome! Mum started off with the Mulligatawny soup, which was very spicy but really good, and my brother and I just ordered an extra side of bread (we always go with traditional garlic naan and we ordered an aloo peas paratha as well, which was very good). Mum had a dosai, which she is really fond of, for the life of me I cannot remember what my brother ordered, and I had the aloo mutter, which was fantastic. Our waiter was very nice and very helpful - a little too helpful, as he asked about the spice level we'd like (I said very low, as I know how spicy some places can get) and when Mum said an 8 out of 10 he replied, "No, for you, a 3." He was mostly joking but she was insisting she wanted it very hot and he kept trying to navigate her down. He probably saw her as a delusional white woman who would start crying the second she started eating and realized how hot it really was, but lived in India and ate nothing but Indian food in London in college, so she (unlike my pathetic palette) can handle some CRAZY spicy food, and he eventually gave up trying to change her mind. We had a really great dinner, and it was nice to see that they actually have a lot of Indian customers, which usually points to some authentic and delicious food. Will definitely be back, this place changed my mind about Southern Indian cuisine!
