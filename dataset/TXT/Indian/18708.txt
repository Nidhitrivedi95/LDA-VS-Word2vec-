eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg I had the lunch buffet today. All the food was hot and fresh. 

Not a huge variety, but everything was up to scratch. The paneer spinach here is extra good. And I liked the meatballs too, kind of a sweet and sour taste. The dessert gulab juman balls were hot. They tasted fine, but I like them better cold or room temp. But all said, an enjoyable visit. Buffet costs $10 with ice water and free naan.
