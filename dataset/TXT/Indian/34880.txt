Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg My boyfriend and I tried this place late in the afternoon and it was pretty empty. The buffet was stocked and refreshed while we ate and we had good service being seated and at the table. I found the food flavorful and enjoyed everything I tried (which was a little of everything!). The restaurant was romantic and we were able to have some great conversation. I would love to come back here.
