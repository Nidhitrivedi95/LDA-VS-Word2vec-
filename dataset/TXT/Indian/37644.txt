oBW7pGHtp_sDMa7cMKJl0g Best rice pudding in the entire world of existence. (And, the ONLY rice pudding I have ever tried that was worth buying in a restaurant).

They don't deliver to far enough locations. There should be an option to pay a delivery fee that would make it worthwhile for the restaurant to travel a farther distance for delivery.
