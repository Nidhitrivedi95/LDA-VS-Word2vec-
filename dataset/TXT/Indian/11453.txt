AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw Been to OM Many times.  Very happy with the quality.  Food is very tasty.  Have dined in several times with good service and have done takeout a few times. Garlic naan is delish.  Lamb vindaloo is nice and tender.  Butter chicken is great.  And the vegetable pakoras are about the best I've ever had.  If I had to give one critique it would be that the portion sizes could be a little bigger. 

Overall, visit this place.
