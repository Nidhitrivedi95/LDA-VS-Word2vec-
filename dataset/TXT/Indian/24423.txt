h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ I went here with my family and a friend. None of us knew that much about Indian food or what to order so we asked our waitress to order us 1 chicken item, 1 lamb, 1 vegetarian, and 1 appetiser. We had no idea what to expect but every single item they brought was amazing! Incredibly authentic, friendly staff, and they even were playing Bollywood movies! Overall wonderful food and experience! Highly recommend the lamb vindaloo and chicken tikka masala.
