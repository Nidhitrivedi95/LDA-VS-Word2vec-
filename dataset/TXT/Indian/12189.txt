auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Nice lunch buffet! Service was okay, food was very authentic, and the garlic naan was incredible. Good location near a lot of everything if someone in your group does not want Indian food...it was crowded even at 2pm, but I got sat right away. Well worth the value. The samosas are some of the best I have had!
