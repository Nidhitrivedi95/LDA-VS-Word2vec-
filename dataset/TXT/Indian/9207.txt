86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ I have walked past this place a few times since I work close by, a friend and I decided we would give the place a try. Atmosphere is quite nice when you walk in, the dinning area larger than expected. They also have a few TVs around the room playing the game, which is nice if you're a hockey fan like I am.

The food was amazing!! I'm usually quite picky about my indian food and a lot of places don't seem to get it right, but this place had great food! We ordered the lamb sliders after reading the all the good reviews about it and it did not disappoint! It was delicious lamb meat wrapped up in a naan, makes me hungry just thinking about it! We also got the butter chicken poutine, which was alright, but I probably wouldn't order it again since there were so many better things on the menu. Also got the grilled jumbo shrimp special which was $1 each with the purchase of a drink. Man those were some good shrimp! The spices on them were quite delicious, something I would definitely go back for.

We also ordered the chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala with naans and the seekh kebobs, all of them exceeded our expectations. In the end our bill was quite reasonable for all the food we ordered. The service was a bit slow at first, but got better throughout our meal.

I really liked this place and would definitely recommend it! I will be back soon!
