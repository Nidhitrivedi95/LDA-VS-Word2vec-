uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w Awesome food with amazing variety of indian cuisine. It feels jus like havin lunch in a nice dhaba in India! A humble suggestion for non indian patrons...kindly try to opt more for vegetarian options to have a more savory experience. Don't miss on the Chaat samosa and gulab jamuns here!
