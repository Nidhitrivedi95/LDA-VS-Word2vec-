Food = 4
Service = 3

I'll rate a 4 to give the benefit of the doubt. The Indian food was pretty good. I was satisfied but it isn't the best I've had. 

I'll just lay it out there that I'm totally fine being the closed minded American eating Chicken Tikka Masala, and they did that pretty well with it. Service could have been a little quicker though. 

Also very reasonably priced which helped the rating.
