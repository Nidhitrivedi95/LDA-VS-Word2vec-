Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Been to this place probably about 5 times for dinner. I don't like buffet as much so I can't say much about it. You can order from the menu at lunch also, if you prefer that over the buffet. Their service is really good. The food is good also. My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Massala and the Vegetable Korma, along with Naan. It's one of the best Indian food restaurants I've tried around the valley, probably the best out of 4 I've tried.
