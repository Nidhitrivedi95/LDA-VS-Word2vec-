llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Tried Swad's lunch buffet yesterday and I was not disappointed! Best Indian food on the east side with a great variety of dishes. I also loved how fresh the naan was when they brought it to the table. I think their Indian dishes (chicken tikka masala, veggie korma, daal makhani) is better than their Indo-Chinese (sesame chicken) because the Indian dishes tasted more fresh. Wonderful and attentive service! Only reason I give it 4 stars is because some of the buffet food was cold at 12:30pm.
