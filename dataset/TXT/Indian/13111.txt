As the earlier reviews said, the buffet should be avoided, but this is true of mostly all buffets.  There is simply no comparison between mass-market food sitting on steam tables and the dinner dishes prepared to order.

It's a definite "must stop in" if you're on your way through or live in the west valley and you have a craving for Indian food.
