Walk in and you will see nicly set tables with table cloths and cloth napkins. There is a buffet with plates behind. This makes it a bit confusing as to which end to start at.

I started with some pakoa and mint chutney. The pakoa was the low point of my meal as it was oddly hard as if it were fried twice.

Moving on the the food at least the veg items. There was a Palak dish which had great spice as well as some cabbage dish that was miss labeled  and full of great flavor and textures I went back for more. The chana masala was also quite good spiked with many fresh veggies in sauce. 

I am a big fan of their naan bread, it tasted as if it was made in a fire tandori, it really complemented the meal.

If you are in this area of town give it a try.
