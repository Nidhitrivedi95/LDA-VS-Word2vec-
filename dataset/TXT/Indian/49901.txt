U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg I live in Mimico and have driven by Maurya every day since it opened and didn't think too much about it until I heard they were affiliated to Gandhi (which I frequent often for takeout on my way home from work).  I decided to try it out and WOW!  the quality and freshness of the food is top notch.  I called in and ordered the butter chicken (medium - which had a kick so if you don't like any heat get mild) and a samosa with raita, everything was perfect and tasted exactly like Gandhi's rotis!! i'm so excited it's down the street from my home - I can get fresh Roti anytime.

I'm really looking forward to trying other Rotis from Maurya, i'm sure they will all taste as good as the butter chicken.

Unfortunately that location hasn't had a lot of success with restaurants, so I hope Maurya lasts as it's a great addition to the area.

Enjoy!
Also, the portions are huge...really good for sharing or taking leftovers for lunch.
