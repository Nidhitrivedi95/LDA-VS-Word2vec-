TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I have been to India five times and love Indian food. This place is fantastic!  The menu has several things that are not usually on the menu ( vada, dosa, goat dishes and ground chicken).  We started off with papadum served with three fragrant dipping sauces- coriander chutney, chili chutney and  tamarind. I was already sold. Each one was flavorful and pungent. We then moved on to an all vegetarian meal. The Dahi vada ( lentil cake with yogurt and tamarind )were to die for- moist, with a thin aromatic sauce. They are often dry with a heavy sauce not here !  We also has Malai Kofta, which was also delicious, aloo tikka with channa, and Bindi Masala (okra). I cannot say enough good things. We were three people and we had a lot of leftovers to take home 
Our waiter was Garry and he was all smiles and so appreciative that we liked the food. I can't wait to go back!
