gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Read the reviews and wanted to give this place a try. Bonus this restaurant is on restaurant.com. Located in a seedy area of town but very welcoming inside. First thing we ordered was the lamb Samosa and was disappointed. Way salty. But the garlic naan and chicken tandoori was yummy.  Learned something new though... One of my favs 'butter chicken' is called chicken makhani.
