-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Such a great place for Indian food!! Very casual, the restaurant is fairly large. The service was great. The best part of this place though is the food. I had the Malai Kofta (I'm 100% sure I spelled that incorrectly) and OMG! So yummy. I really have no complaints at all. I would highly recommend this place for some good Indian grub!
