auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Seven days a week, 11-3, Taj Palace has a lunch buffet for $9.99.  Located in the the shopping center on Eastern and Richmar, this new Indian restaurant is rich in decor and cuisine. The hand painted tapestry style wall mural, lantern style light fixtures, and open lighting gives a bright look that most Indian places lack. The service was the best I have had in a long time. As we sat ourselves, the waiter came over to ask what kind of naan we would like and filled our water glasses. Throughout the meal, our dirty plates never stayed on the table for more than 5 minutes, if even that long. Water glasses were promptly refilled at the half way mark as well. 

The food was consistent. I found that I did not hate anything, but the tandoori chicken was dry. The garlic naan is amazing. When brought out, it was piping hot and topped with a copious amount of garlic. The line had two different kinds of rice; basmati and a vegetable biryani. They also had somosas that were tasty. The saag (spinach) here was delicious, but did not have the paneer (handmade cheese). The other non-meat dish I really liked was the veggies in the yellow curry. For those who love their meat, do not fret, because Taj Palace offer some dishes for the carnivores as well. The chicken tikka masala was creamy and possessed a deep, rich flavor. The goat curry was tender and not gamey.
Do not forget to get a bowl of the kheer (rice pudding) before leaving. Taj Palace's version is not too sweet and has cashews for a nice crunch. It was the perfect end to a great meal.
