DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg I've been here a few times before. It's the best Indian food in the Richmond hill area. 

This time we ordered the tandoori platter and chicken Bryianni. With 2 veggie samosas to start. 

The samosas were good, filled with potatoes and peas and tasted very fresh. 

The tandoori platter was filled with meat and salad. The salad was old brown iceberg lettuce, with big chunks of raw onion, not impressed with that! 

The chicken Bryianni is my fav and it's amazing! Get it every time! Medium heat is enough for me. 

Service wasn't great, was waiting for water for a long time. Decor doesn't make sense and is not very welcoming. 

Overall, good food, bad service!
