The dinner options are excellent, if a bit on the pricier side for the students they typically attract (the fact that it's usually full of students anyway is a testament to the quality and consistency).  Sauces are creamy and flavorful, while chunks of meat are tender and sizable.

The one caveat: during lunch, you can only get the buffet (no individual ordering)--and on weekdays, the buffet is a little below average at best.  Avoid lunches Monday through Friday and you'll do just fine.
