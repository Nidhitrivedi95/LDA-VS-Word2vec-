3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ So far a good Indian restaurant in the area. Have tried different places around  for a proper indian food, was never satisfied. This is new in the area and has become my goto restaurant. Buffet has more varieties for veg. Their alacarte is better than buffet. Quantity is  more for the curries. Hopefully they'll keep the same quality coming days.
