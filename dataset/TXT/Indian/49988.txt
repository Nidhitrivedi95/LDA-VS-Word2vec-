U3Ah385YhvlraXsKcEeZ4g Can someone explain what the big deal is? The service was nice but the back room might be the most depressing environ since the bar scene from Magnolia with William H Macy. Seriously, all I could think of when eating my bland quiche was "I need braces!" 

Maybe I'm missing something?
