j3YSK-IgpNabCIzWEl7CaA I love this place!!! The thali/meal combos are excellent value for money. As I was living alone in Charlotte, this place became a big savior for my meals! The choice of vegetables is good everyday. 
However, I did not like some of chat items and dosa was also not one of my favorites.
