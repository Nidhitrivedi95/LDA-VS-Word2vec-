iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA We stopped in when they first opened near PV Mall, just east on Cactus Rd. It was kind of hidden in that strip mall, so if you blinked you could miss it. It does face south to Cactus and  is on the north side of the street w/ good signage.
Always follow your nose when looking for Indian food. It's pretty much unmatched when it comes to the senses, both olfactory and taste. We had a rushed lunch and ordered a side of samosas These were larger and golden brown and just right when it comes to crispy than most other places offer up. The dips of tamarind sauce and mint chutney were perfect and complimented them for that heightened duo of perfection.
The Chicken tikka masala and basmati rice was simply superb as was the lamb curry. Too bad they didn't serve masala dosa at the time. I'm not sure if they added that to the menu but it's a hallmark of South Indian food which probably is why they didn't offer it. This restaurant serves primarily North Indian cuisine as far as I know, but it's really authentic and we enjoyed the whole ambience and experience. Good hosts and the chef came out to chat (chaat) w/ us wanting to know how we liked everything. We gave him the thumbs up which he obviously liked. I never hold back on suggestions if asked, and he did and listened carefully!
Yes I recommend it to anyone who relishes Indian fare and to newbies as well. Not too spicy!
That seems to be an issue with people not familiar with Indian cuisine.
Enjoy!
