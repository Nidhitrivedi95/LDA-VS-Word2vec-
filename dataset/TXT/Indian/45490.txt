ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw My favorite Indian restaurant in the city! Everything is so fresh. My husband is a huge fan of the lunch buffet. I ordered the chicken korma (spice: 3) and my husband ordered chicken rogan josh (spice: 5). The food can get very spicy. My dish was about at spicy as mild buffalo wings. We ordered garlic naan and samosas to round out our meal. The naan was fragrant and the garlic was fresh. It was an easy way to cool my palate. I will definitely go back. However, I probably won't order delivery. It took long than expected and the texture of the naan changed due to condensation.
