We ordered meal/dinner for two which came out to be $40.00 but it was totally worth it as the food was enough to for 5 people. We had to take the leftovers home. Mr. Alam served us. The restaurant was very quiet and hence we could have a good chat with him. He was very warm and told us a lot of good things about the city. They deliver food uptown too...
