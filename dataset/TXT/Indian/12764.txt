B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Best place for desi food in the Madison area I've tried so far. Delicious, flavorful food and generous portions. The ambiance is chic and modern and the staff is really friendly.

We ordered the vegetarian appetizer platter, chicken kabob and spinach paneer. The samosa wasn't excessively spicy and the pakoras were delicious. The spinach had a nice garlicky flavor and the chicken was super tender. Sadly the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night. More folks should check this place out so it will stick around! :-)
