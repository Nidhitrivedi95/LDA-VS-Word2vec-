fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Great value for your $$$$. Not much of an ambiance but still a nice place to have a satisfying meal. Food is not too spicy, which can be a positive or a negative depending on your taste. However there should be something for everyone, kids, vegetarians and carnivores alike.
Wished the fresh naan flowed a little more consistently.
