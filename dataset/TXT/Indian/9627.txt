8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ Went there on Saturday with friends. Nice small place. Very nice decor. Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. One of the best Indian restaurant I've ever been to. The food was full of flavour and very satisfying. The butter chicken was delicious. The seafood vindaloo and the Goan fish curry was one of the best Indian meals I've ever had. It was absolutely perfect. The portions were very generous. I took home leftovers and enjoy it for dinner today. Soo delicious. I want to order it again.
