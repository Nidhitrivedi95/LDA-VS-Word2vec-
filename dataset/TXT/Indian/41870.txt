QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Quite possibly the best of all the Indian buffets , in Pittsburgh ...
The current owners took over from the original owners who in my opinion kind of mis-managed the place when it first opened ... it was too formal, too posh ..
The new owners have toned all that formality down and made it approchable and fun with nice colorful decor and etc.
The Saturday buffet is extra special with more dishes put on the buffet ...
The tandoori chicken is among the best i've ever had .  The chicken chettinai (not sure the spelling) is amazing .
***pro-tip - go on Saturday. Most variety of dishes and food seems to always be a couple clicks better than the rest of the week...***
