ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Sooooooo good!  Lunch buffet was awesome.  There were a few different meat dishes, vegetable samosa, etched, etc..  The flavor of everything was great with just the right kick.  I really really enjoyed the chicken tiki marsala.  Oh and after 3 plates I was even asked if I would like a box to go.  Wow, great service!  ...but I declined having already stuffed myself.  Do yourself a favor and go there...now!
