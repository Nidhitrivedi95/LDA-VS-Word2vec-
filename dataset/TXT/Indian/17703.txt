e2jGy1NTv4mOms4wquE_lg I only tried indian food here and usually get it as take out. I never had anything bad to say about the food nor the service. They forgot an order of samosa one time and rushed back with extra ones as compensation. It's not the best indian food in town but I really enjoy it everytime and would come back again and again.
