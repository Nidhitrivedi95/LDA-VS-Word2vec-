tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA First off let me say that I dont get the chance to eat Indian food as often as I would like. . . and that is because we don't have any good Indian restaurants in the central phx area. So when I ended up in the East valley today I had to check this place out due to all the good reviews!!! 

I was skeptical and on edge that this might not be the experience that I was hoping for...maybe too spicy ...or old food under heat lamps...or bad service...NOT THE CASE!! THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! 

India Oven is 10 out of 10 for me. 

Service: 10 
A smile and a greet as we entered with the wonderful aroma of the buffet made it easy...I was in the right place. Our waiter was very professional and personable. He made our first experience Great as he told us about the chef and his 40 yrs of around the world cooking from Europe to India to the USA. I couldn't wait to go taste his cooking. They also have a Full bar in a classy environment. Great place to take a client for lunch or date for dinner. Quick side note: India Oven is not that big and I'm sure once the word gets out...expect a wait. Great 42" LCD on the Wall , so we got to watch the College game. 

Buffet: 10 

Let me just say at first glance .... I was Lost and my mouth was watering... it all smelled so good and everything and I mean everything was FRESH. The Chicken Curry, Lamb Curry, Chicken Marsala all were Fantastic! We were told by the staff the buffet always changes for lunch and every dinner service. I cant wait to try other dishes from this place. It was all soo good .... you will want to keep going up til you explode. They also bring Indian bread and a Sizzling plate of chicken and Lamb to your table that also was amazing. 

Price: 10 

At $9.95 you simply can not beat it. 

I just wish this place was close to the house. I would def be a frequent customer. I would also be gaining a few pounds. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. I can seriously say I dont think you can go wrong.
