afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w First time trying Sri Lankan cuisine and was really impressed. Tried the hopper combo, chicken buriyani and chicken curry. There is no lack of flavour and you get so much food. I would've ordered less if I knew that hoppers are not good for leftovers - best to eat them fresh. Will definitely visit again
