YNut5B1o3FDtcdzwf9F_bw Expensive. Not punctual. I ordered over the phone for pickup. They hung up before I was able to ask for my total. They said 20 min, I showed up 25 min later and they still asked for 10 more minutes.
$32 dollars later I ended up with 1 piece of naan, 1 chicken kabob without the stick, 1 shrimp kabob without the stick. Nothing else. It was not disgusting but surely not worth the $32 bucks. I feel like I was slapped in the face.
