xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg This is a fairly new restaurant on West Sahara. Anybody remember Malibu Chan's? This is the same space in the shopping center on the SEC of Cimarron and Sahara. It is quite good. The owner, William is working diligently on making it the "go to spot" for Indian food in Vegas. So far, he is succeeding. He definitely get's an "A" for effort and I look forward to seeing him again tomorrow. Yes, it's that good. Trust me, I know...
