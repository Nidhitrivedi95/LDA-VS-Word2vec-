GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Surprisingly good Indian food in the middle of the desert!  We went with a group and while the service was a tad slow for an empty restaurant, the portions and flavors did not disappoint.  The location is a bit hidden in a strip mall, but don't let that deter you.  I personally enjoyed the variety of the naan they offered and will be back.
