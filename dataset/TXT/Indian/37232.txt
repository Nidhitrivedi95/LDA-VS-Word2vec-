o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ Came here today on a walk home from the rock climbing gym. After spending hours at work, it was great to get something warm a hearty into me. Went with my go-to, Sag Paneer, and was warned about the spice. I usually go with medium for my "spice level" but the cashier warned me a medium would be really hot (an 8/10 vs the mild 5/10). I stuck to my gut and went medium. It was hot, but not as hot as she hyped it up to be. It was still delicious, and I'm sure I'll be back at some point. (But maybe getting the HOT option, haha).
