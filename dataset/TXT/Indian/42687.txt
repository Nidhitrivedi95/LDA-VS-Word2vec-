RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Blue Taj used to be our number one choice for Indian food but recently we have experienced a drastic decline in the service.  

The crew have a sense of entitlement that permeates across all the staff. 

It's a pity that success seems to have gotten to their head.  The food is still good but the service is patchy and uppity.  

It's time Charlotte got a strong competitive player in the Indian fine dining space.
