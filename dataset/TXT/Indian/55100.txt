Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw This is one of the first places I tried Indian food in Phoenix.It's a nice restaurant with good ambience and great service.The manager and wait staff are friendly and they always throw in some Naan/bread with take out which is sweet.

The food however I would say is just average, some of the things I have tried are the chicken Biriyani (basmati rice cooked with chicken herbs and spices) served with raita (yogurt with onions,tomatoes and cucumber) $10.95
Keema Naan (bread stuffed with minced lamb) $3.95
Goat Curry (Goat cooked with herbs and spices) $10.95
Karahi Chicken (chicken cooked with bell peppers onions and freshly ground spices) $10.95
Tandoori Chicken (chicken marinated in yogurt cooked over charcoal) $9.95

They are located very close to the university and also offer discounts for ASU students.

Cheers!
