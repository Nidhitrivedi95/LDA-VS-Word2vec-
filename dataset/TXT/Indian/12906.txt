b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw I ordered the Hakka noodles as a pick up order. When I got home to my surprise they looked pretty mushy. I tasted them and both the shrimp and noodles were over cooked. The dish also taste very bland. I tried to salvage it by adding some Indian spices that I had in my cabinet but I wound up tossing then entire dish. Very disappointing. I'll stick with the original India garden down the road.
