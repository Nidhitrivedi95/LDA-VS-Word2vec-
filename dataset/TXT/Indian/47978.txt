TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw The best Indian food in Las Vegas!  We finally got a chance to try India Palace, and it did not disappoint!  For appetizers we had the veggie samosas and the onion kulcha.  The samosas were fantastic, the onion kulcha very good but I would probably try something else next time. We had chicken tikka masala and matar mushroom for entrees, both were scrumptious.  
   The food was on the spicy side in general, which we love.  Funniest part of the evening was after we'd been munching on the papadums with various sauces, one of the sauces was extremely spicy, and we told the waitress/hostess we'd like to have our entrees just as spicy.  She looked at us and said "You're white, right??"  I almost fell off my chair!  Apparently most Caucasians don't request their food spicy, all the better for us.   
     Everything was reasonably priced and evocative of the fantastic Indian restaurant we'd left behind when we moved here from New Jersey.  This is THE best Indian in Vegas, hands down.
