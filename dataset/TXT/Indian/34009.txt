m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw I came here with my friend. I had the chicken curry, and it was just okay. The naan was spectacular. However, the service was not very good. My friend was brought the wrong drink, and then the waiter didn't come back for a long time. He was inattentive and not very friendly. I probably won't go back. I think Ambar India has better food and better service.
