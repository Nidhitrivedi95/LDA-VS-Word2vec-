KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw This place was so good, we went back twice in one week! 

Ordered: 
Cheeseburger samosa, butter chicken mac and cheese, Punjabi cheeseburger, butter chicken fries, chaat fries, tandoori BLT, fried chicken sandwich and rasmalai samosa.

Everything tasted like really good but we did find the tandoori bacon to be a bit too salty. We also tried the dosa samosa as our order got mixed up and they let us keep both. It was really good.

Our favourite was the Punjabi cheeseburger, hands down. I also really liked the rasmalai samosa. 

My only wish was for the butter chicken mac and cheese to have been a side dish. It's really rich and was too much as an entree.
