a7ChC96ZIKh8xY7ugDPktQ My experience with Veda was purely take-out, so cannot comment on the dining experience. Overall it was very good indian food and most importantly HEALTHY. Being Indian myself, I enjoy my mom's home cooked meals, and for the most part they are healthy. But I tend to avoid Indian restaurants because the meals can be so HEAVY. (especially Indian buffets, they had a great *Epic Meals episode using Indian buffet food...)

Here is the rundown:

1. Service: excellent take-out service. Our food was delivered warm and on-time. They did provide us with some cutlery and napkins. Everything was individually wrapped and minimal spillage occurred during the delivery process.

2. Food: Great taste! To be honest I didnt even know it was healthy indian food' until someone in my group passed the menu over to me. Prior to that I kept eating away, wondering why I wasn't getting that heavy 'oh I ate too much and now I need a nap' feeling. To summarize our food choices we had basmati rice (fluffy and soft), naan (the only part of the meal I didnt love, they were a bit rubbery), butter chicken/curry chicken/chickpea curry/mixed vegetable curry -all really tasty. The flavours were distinct, but not overpowering. The spice level was moderate, you could comfortably enjoy your meal without needing a yogurt dish or large glass of water beside your plate.

This is a great healthy option! I would recommend the take-out service for work functions/larger groups. With the vegetarian options and low-spiceyness level, Veda Indian take-out is a crowd pleaser.

*For those unaware Epic Meals is a crazy you-tube show where they made giant calorie-laden meals (ie. 'Epic Meals') that makes Supersize me look like a diet movie....
