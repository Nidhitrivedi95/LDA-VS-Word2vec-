xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw This place gets 5 stars for the SERVICE! My mom and I rushed to get this place by 7pm, since the restaurant closes exactly at that time. We arrived at 7pm, and the door was locked. We knocked until the person at the cash registered allowed us to come in. 

Surprisingly, all of the credit card transactions and the cash register closes exactly at 7pm. Must be a systems thing. The store worker said that the dinner would be on the house. NO WAY!! He was so generous letting us order past the closing time. We definitely paid $15 in cash for our order.

The food was pretty tasty!! I wish we could have eaten the fry bread fresh, but we had to rush to the airport. 

We ordered:
+ Green chili taco- with lettuce, chunks of beef, and cheese. Pretty good meaty flavor, and a bit messy to eat. I probably used 10 napkins.

+ Vegetarian taco- with refried pinto beans, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. I couldn't taste the beans as the sour cream masked the flavor.

+ Honey bread dessert- Basically a flat fry bread and you pour the honey. Simple concept, but the bread was delicious!

The fry bread is so light and a HUGE size. I had enough carbs for the night.

Definitely get to this restaurant before it closes at 7pm!!!
