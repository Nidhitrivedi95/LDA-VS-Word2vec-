c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg A group of us went to this restaurant on the weekend to take advantage of their "pay-once-eat-twice" anniversary promo. We could smell the delicious food as we drove up, even though our windows were closed. Conversely, despite the mouth-watering aromas that greeted us, we didn't actually smell like cooking when we got home, so their ventilation must be really good. Our server was a really nice genuine guy. For 6 people it ended up being about $30/person (a la carte) so it was a little pricey compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to. But the decor is nice, they play all the popular Tamil music and the food was all very yummy. I would recommend this restaurant if you're jonesing for some authentic Chetinnad cuisine :)
