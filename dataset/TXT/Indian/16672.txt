DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Popped in here to pick up some naan and rice to pad out an Indian dinner with some friends. First, they don't do naan, but they have a whole-wheat thing that's a lot like it. Paneer pakora looks delicious: order it. 

They tell us it'll be 10 minutes, wait 15 and then ask about an ETA; they say 10 more minutes because they're waiting in the bread, but the pakora is done so it's sitting under a hot light in the back, yum. 15 minutes later it's actually done. 

Long story short, waited half an hour for rice and two orders of bread. Also, the bread was kind of not good. Good paneer pakora though. 

Wouldn't recommend. Try Delhi Palace.
