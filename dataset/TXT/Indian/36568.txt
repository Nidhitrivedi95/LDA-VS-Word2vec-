NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg The selection is decent and the food is really very good. They make the naan right there and the entire kitchen is behind a glass; so I love the transparency, no pun. 

Seating is really interesting and cool. They have 4 top tables but the main dinning area consist of two really long custom made, natural wood tables. This facilities family style dining, even with strangers.

For the food is is pretty authentic except the heat has been dialed WAY back. I would like to kick it up a notch but the authentic taste is pretty much in-tact and it is wonderful.


Summary This beautiful little spot is clean, bright and vibrant. The food is really good and the atmosphere is bright, clean and inviting. I would relate this as a direct parallel as being the Indian version of Chipotle.
