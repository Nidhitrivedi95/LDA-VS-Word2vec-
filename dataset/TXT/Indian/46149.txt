sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ The work lunch crowd often orders from Gandhi's and we love it. Lamb is my usual order. The massive rotis are served in a tin dish and keep me stuffed through supper. I'm very wary of ordering above mild. The one time I tried medium I was sweating buckets and in pain. But I am a bit of a weakling in that department.

Update: Moved to a new office across downtown, but we still find our way back. Gandhi's is awesome.
