food was good.  i ordrred the lobster ravioli and my bf ordered the seafòod risotto.
to be honest it was good not exceptional but fkavourful and the portions were grand.  the bill was but pricey with a tea and beer but all in all a decent experience.  decor had a vintage feel...hard to describe.  but its a cozy and good date place as it is quiet and therefore potentially romantic.
