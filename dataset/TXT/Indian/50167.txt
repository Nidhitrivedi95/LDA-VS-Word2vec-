uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA My fiance and I decided to try this restaurant about 3 weeks ago for the first time. The interior is nice and cozy and the lady that owns the restaurant is very friendly and welcoming. I had high expectations and felt I had eaten enough Indian food growing up in India to be able to judge this place. I ordered the boneless chicken biryani while my fiance ordered paneer tikka masala and garlic naan and an order of chicken lollipops for appetizers. I loved my biryani and thought it was fairly authentic tasting. The naan was fresh and tasty, the paneer tikka masala was good. The chicken lollipop came with the traditional Indo-Chinese sichuan sauce which was delicious and spicy.

The second time I came here with a few friends, I ordered their veggie fried rice and chicken manchurian combo. The chicken manchurian was not really close to what I ate in India but equally delicious in its own way. The sauce reminded me of a sweetish sriracha and the chicken was wonderfully crisp. I personally would have preferred less pepper and whole peppercorns in the fried rice and ended up just eating the chicken manchurian by itself. At the end of dinner, the really nice owner came and filled our glasses (which she was very prompt about) with what tasted like coconut water. It was sweet and refreshing and a great way to end the meal. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant if you like Indian food.
