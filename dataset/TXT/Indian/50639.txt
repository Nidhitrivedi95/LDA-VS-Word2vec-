UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Went here with a friend for a long overdue girls dinner on a weeknight. 

She was craving Indian food so I did a search on Yelp and decided to go back here (I had been once, years ago and enjoyed the food). I was excited for the chance to have Indian food as I truly love it.

We both opted for the platter options - my friend chose goat curry and I opted for the mutter paneer (normally my fave Indian dish). The platters came with naan, rice, aloo gobi, daal, and rice pudding. I found the savoury dishes to be mostly flavourless and really greasy which was pretty disappointing. Naan was decent. The rice pudding had an odd taste to it so I only had a spoonful.

While the service was good and I enjoyed my visit with my friend, I would not go out of my way to return.
