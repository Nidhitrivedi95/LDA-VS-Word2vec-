cu1CvIzOyf-R91pT92NShw First off I'd like to point out that the food at this restaurant is AMAZING! Great job by the chefs who really keep this place up and running. Great food. Takes you back to Chennai where I'm originally from whether it comes to the food, the ambience or the music. This place knocks it out of the park when it comes to the things I've mentioned in this paragraph.

Let's get to why I'm giving it a "2" star rating.
Having said all the good things above, the management and service at this place really really really really really really sucks.
The managers don't really care about the service or the customers who keep this place up and running. The attitude of one particular male bearded manager was so awful that we considered leaving the place several times. His attitude towards us was despicable and when we complained, this manager had the audacity to undermine our concerns and raise his voice. We still stayed there because it was really late and all other places were pretty busy. 
Walking into the place we were not seated properly nor were we given a timeline as to when we would be seated. We had to take matters into our own hands to find extra chairs for our table. We got our table thanks to a couple of women who were considerate enough to move themselves to a 2 person table instead of the 4 person table they were originally occupying. 

Again, if there's a way someone can read this and take some action against the poor service would be great! But then again, the food was to die for.

Your's truly,

A customer who loved the food, hated the service.
