-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE AUDITED BY HEALTH  DEPARTMENT! DISGUSTING!!

Although the food is not too bad. This place is disgusting. They don't even care how dirty it is. I don't even wanna know how the food is prepared behind closed doors. Saw a clean spoon fall on the dirty floor and a waiter picks it up and chucks it back along with all the other "clean" utensils. I will never come here ever again. Service is not very welcoming either. Floors were dirty and stinky. When they wipe the tables they let everything fall on the floor. 
I would like someone from health department to audit this place. I guarantee they will not meet the standard qualifications and will be shut down immediately!
