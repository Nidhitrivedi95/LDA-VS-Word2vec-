2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw Had tiffin chicken, curry shrimp (chef's special), and spinach corn green sauce/curry (forgot the name) paired with garlic naan. 

The chicken and shrimp are slightly salty for me (I kind of have a lighter taste preference), however, pairs perfectly with the naan. The spinach corn sauce tasted really good, just the right level of flavour overall. 

The naan is perfect, much order! We will come back to visit next time in town for sure. 

Also ordered the grilled pineapple, never tried it before, but pretty good as well. Sweet juicy pineapple blended well with the grilling sauce, which is slightly spicy. 

Overall review is 8/10!
