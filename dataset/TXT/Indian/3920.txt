0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I will seriously recommend this place to everyone. It is one of the good place to eat India food. Best is the owner of this place who takes care of everyone with full warmth.
Definitely try papdi chaat & lassi which is a part of buffet. I definitely say these two items are worth the price of the whole buffet and rest of things look complimentary.
The ambience & outlook is simple but who cares about that we want good food and thats what you will get once you go to this place.
There is no harm for trying it once and don't forget to order papdi chaat and sweet mango lassi.
