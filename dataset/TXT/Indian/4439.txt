1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g Absolutely fantastic!!!  Just got take out for the first time and I am blown away. I make my own potstickers and I'm sad to say their Momo's are better than mine. Best thing I had was the Sadako Chicken which had deep flavor and the perfect creeper burn but I would try anything they were cooking up! The atmosphere is awkward but bring a bunch of friends and make it your own....or just get take out!.
