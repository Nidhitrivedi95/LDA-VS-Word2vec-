-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ A pleasant surprise.

Great "kwality" for the price.

Good family atmosphere ... even a good place to have marsala tea, chat and watch the latest Bollywood on a big screen. 

Servers were very good and patient at explaining the menu and food options.

Love the gift boxes that Kwality uses to pack your sweets - something I would have expected in Swizterland, Japan or Korea but not here.
