wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Good location and very helpful staff. The owner is super involved and checks in on all guests. Very good food! Had tikka masala-highly recommend. Creamy and great taste! The beryani was also very good.  Chicken tenders for kids was a very large portion and fresh! Naans are fantastic.
