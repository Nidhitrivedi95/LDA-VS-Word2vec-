I can't quite put my finger on why, but it feels more like I am sitting in an office rather than a restaurant, not that the decor is not pleasant. Perhaps it is the lack of smoking oily food smells emanating from their kitchen, or maybe the unhurried calm way the servers handle themselves, ... their prices are good. I went there during summerlicious a few months ago and had a steak with a spicy sauce on rice that came with appetizer and dessert. Yeah, that's right, indian restaurant and I had a baseball steak...  Kulfi is an indian ice cream - very creamy vanilla pistachio with cardamom - beautiful in form and taste - was served with gulkand, a sweet preserve made with rose petals and sugar, both of which were new to me and it was fantastic! I hated the steak when I tasted it in the restaurant, but that kulfi and gulkand was totally unforgettable - alone worth the visit. The kulfi was made by the restaurant, not purchased from a store... First thing I did when I got home was look for a recipe for kulfi on the internet. As my training since birth forbade me to discard or waste food, I wrapped my steak to go and had it the next day on toasted swiss rye. Not bad.
