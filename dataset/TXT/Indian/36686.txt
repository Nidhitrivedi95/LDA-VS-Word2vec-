NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Stopped by for lunch at Choolah. I've been eagerly awaiting its arrival on the Eastside all summer long. It did not disappoint. The interiors are refreshing. Service was impeccable. Our order was ready in less than 5 mins. Mango lassi left me longing for more. I had a plate (chicken, naan, tikka masala). Chicken was fantastic, grilled tandoori style. Plain Naan was fresh although slightly devoid of the crispness. Also shared the samosa chaat. Samosa chaat was just OK, definitely have had much better at other places, lacks the zest n tanginess. 

I will return again to sample the whole menu and this is great value for $.



Bottom line: Indian Food, Chipotle Style. Great value.
