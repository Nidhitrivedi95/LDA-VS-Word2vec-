2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Take out only.  Bring cash or use Canadian debit/credit card.  I've been looking for a place that sells all sorts of Indian eats!  This place has it all.  Samosa, roti, naan, curry, biryani all the fun snacks sold from vendor cards to small setups in Mauritius and India!  I was in heaven picking and chosing.  I was a little taken that they didn't have a spicy sauce offering for the roti and their green chili was a little weak on heat.  I think I bought enough for a family of 4 and paid under $20.  Amazing.  4 stars only because of it being take-out only and this deal with not taking out of country credit cards.
