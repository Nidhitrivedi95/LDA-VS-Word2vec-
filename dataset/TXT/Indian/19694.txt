flEnFkUtW5YVowWbenXsSg Gotta love the influx of kabab places downtown. Pamier Kabab, the Afghanistan kabob house further south on Spadina has them, but Sizzler looked good for lunch so I stopped in. There is plenty of room for seating but the stark white walls looks like more effort could be taken to make the place look more enticing. That doesn't matter if the food is good and it was. The lunch specials all looked good. A return visit could help me decide if all their food is basically the same or if they show some culinary skills with a menu steeped in tradition. Check this place out for lunch, I'd like to hear some other reviews of their fare. Something tells me they are holding back somewhat, have potential, and if you know what to order, they could step up and become remarkable.
