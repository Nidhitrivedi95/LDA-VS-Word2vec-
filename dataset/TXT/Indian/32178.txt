LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Excellent! We tried it based on the nearby Yelp search and such a treat! This is our new favorite Indian spot. 

Great service, 3 different waiters taking care of the dining room. Very prompt to bring crispy naan and sauces when we arrived. 

We started with the crispy potato cakes - pakoras - and raita, delicious. Then things got even better... Chicken tikka masala and vegetable vindaloo with garlic naan. 

Everything was amazing. We had 4 different sauces to dip in and the flavors were great. We like super spicy so we requested their hot sauce and it did not disappoint. 

If you like great Indian, look no further!
