pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Whenever I go there, it's packed with Indian people so it must be good, right?  I dunno.  I've only been there for the lunch buffet and I find the food to be a bit stale and looking like large-scale food production.  If you're looking for an Indian buffet, I would recommmend Mintt.
