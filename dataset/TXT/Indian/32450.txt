The has the right amount of heat and the chicken and veggies are oh so tender. They have a wide variety of choices: burgers, fries, hummus, shawarma, goat and lamb dishes to name a few. The desserts are delicious too! The baklava is one of my favorites! The staff is always friendly and helpful. 

The market has a wide variety of Mediterranean groceries and the butcher shop has halal meat choices, it's so fresh!
