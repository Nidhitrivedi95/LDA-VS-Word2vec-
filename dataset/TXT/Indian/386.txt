-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g My friend and I came here on a whim. It was pretty empty, though we did arrive a little late, and overall has a diner feel. The service is really awesome though; we were greeted right away and sat in a cozy booth. My friend did notice that the ceiling fan caused the lights above to have a strobe effect, but upon request, they turned off the fans. The food is great. I've never been much into Indian food, so when I asked for recommendations, they suggested the Chicken Tikka Masala. Now I keep thinking about going back to have it again! We also shared a garlic naan, which is also really good. Highly recommend this place!
