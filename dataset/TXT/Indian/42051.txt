QEN53zi2iJAAl3ceR7O68Q Really bad service. Extremely rude staff.  Ordered 2 halwa puri, 1 bun kabab and 1 roll. Took 25 mins for halwa puri another 10 for bun kabab and the roll never came. Reminded many times and the answer the staff gave was we will get our food when we do.  Got tired and asked for refund for the roll because did not look I was going to get it got real attitude and rude behavior plus nasty comments from the cashier. Would not recommend this resturant to anyone. Real bad service, food and it is by far one of the worst experiences I have had in a resturant in my life.
