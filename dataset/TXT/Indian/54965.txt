wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw I have been to this restaurant four times in the one month that it has been open. The food is delicious, prices are extremely reasonable and  the portions are pretty good. The owners have stopped to chat with us each time we have been there, the decor is unique and has a humor to it. Some of my favourite items are Gosht doubleroti (the winner each time), Koki, keema pau, Sharmaji Ka Chaat and Amrtitsari Kulcha  are some of the things that I have tried and loved. Hemant, the owner, is still in the process of finalizing the menu and hence the menu might change slightly each time you go there. Also, given that it is a new place, there are some hiccupss in the service but nothing that isn't expected from a new venture. I am very glad that we finally have a restaurant in the city that offers great sindhi food. I am definitely a frequent customer.
