emNQ1jxMev2NzIcP2wdfgg I came here on the recommendation of a few friends who had been and hey, when does one turn down the chance to try out african/indian cusine? This restaurant was a bit of trek for me being a little out in east york but it was worth it to try something different. 

Simba's grill is based on tanzanian/kenyan cooking which is a fusion of indian and traditional african grill cooking. There are curries and there are mixed grills that feature meat as the star. This place is bit of hole in the wall, not fancy at all but the service is friendly. Note that the meals can take awhile to prepare, usually 20-25 minutes tops so come with a patient mind as everything is prepared to order and the cooking is done by an elderly couple.

Now the food, the samosa's are tasty here the meat samosa's are nicely spiced and come in a lighter pastry than usual samosa's sorta like filo pastry. The casava fries were extremely addictive, sweet cruncy sticks of starch. And the bbq ribs here were amazing for dry ribs. Crunchy, crisp and the sauce or rub on them tasted fantastic. They have an interesting selection of fruity african/middle eastern soft drinks on hand as well to wash everything down. And there are daily specials for meat, curries and samosas-everthing under $10. 

A good place to try tanzanian/kenyan cooking, only shame is that it's quite far.
