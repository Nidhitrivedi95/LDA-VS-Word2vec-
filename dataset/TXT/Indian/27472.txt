IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA After reading all the good reviews here, I decided to try it. There is a vast selection of curries and you can see the chefs in the back preparing them. I must say the taste lived up to the reputation. I liked the fact that they don't used too much artificial colourings and the different curries taste and look different. If there is one suggestion I would make is for them to use less oil. It's by no means bad, but could be better.
