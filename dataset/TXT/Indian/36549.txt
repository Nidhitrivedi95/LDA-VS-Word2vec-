NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Yes! I was in town and decided to check out this place. The decor was really nice and modern with a touch industrial. The space was really clean and airy.

We ordered the lamb plate, chicken plate, samosa chadd, truffles and mango lassis. Mango lassis waere amazeballs.... Creamy, a touch of sourness from the yogurt and mango-i. Totally recommended, get it and you won't be disappointed.  Food was also very good, albeit not as spiced as the usual indian food, and yes, my friend's samosa chadd was better (coz she's awesome) but theirs were decent . Lastly the chocolate truffles gives enough sweetness to roundup the meal. 

Prices were totally reasonable for the amount of items we get. When the food arrived, we thought that it was not that much... But oh were we wrong.... The portions filled us up for sure. 

Overall, we had a pretty awesome experience. Cool atmosphere, clean space, great customer service and awesome food. We will be back to Choolah!!!!!
