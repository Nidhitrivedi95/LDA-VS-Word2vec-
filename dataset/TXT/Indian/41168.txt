PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ We did a family dinner buffet on a friday night.  wasn't too busy, so we got a table quickly.  The service was reasonable, but could have been a bit better.

The food selection was good and they seemed to keep the trays refreshed..  i tried some of the chicken appetizers and though they were ok, a bit dry (the tandoori and haryali).  Overall the food was good but not that flavourful.

I like that the selection was great.  from chaat papri and gol guppa to veg and non veg dishes and some pizza/spring rolls for the less adventurous.  the salad and fruit bar were also well stocked and desserts werent bad.

Comments:
- chicken was dry
- semia was not sweet enough
- gulab jamun was too sweet
- nimbu pani (salty)was very sour

- selection was great
- overall food tast was ok
- some items were really good like he chaat papri

also, was a little pricey at $21/adult ($20 for seniors).  Kids are cheap - junior was $10 and child was $2..  but it still added up.  I don't know if it was worth the cost...  But there aren't that many indian buffets so what can you do.

I still prefer a-la-carte but its not a terrible choice.
