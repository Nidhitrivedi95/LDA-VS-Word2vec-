DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew My my my my my my show look good to me!! Somebody pinch me......I thought I had  arrived in the afterlife. This place is PURE Nirvana!! Absolutely love  love love this spot! The decor, the ambiance, the service....oh and the FOOD!! Where do I start?? Went alone for lunch and had the saag aloo, the chana  masala, the vegan roti and  rice. .... and STILL spent less than $20 w tax! The food was very mild to "no hot" spices just like I liked it. I could actually taste the freshness and the flavors and not struggle to do so. Amazing hands down! It's tucked away in an unlikely shopping center so be sure to keep your eyes open when trying to find it. But honey chile  get you some of this....every table around me is complementing the food. Of course, I'm coming back to make sure it ain't a one time fluke lol. Great romantic spot too....bring your boo thing on date night!! And  thank me later ha ha ha!
