2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw The best samosa place in Scarborough. It's only $1 for 5! So it's perfect for a potluck, I would spend $5 and be done with it. 

I love the green and pink coloured sweets. (I have no idea what they're called) It is only $5 for a pound, a pound being 9 pieces. 

The samosa is great in terms of flavour and consistency. The spice is present but it doesn't over power the potato. The crust on the samosa is perfectly crumbly and crunchy. I personality prefer to dip them in ketchup, but eating them plain is fine as well. 

This place is great for a snack and for a meal. Worth the trip, or a visit if you're in the area. Super affordable and incredible taste.
