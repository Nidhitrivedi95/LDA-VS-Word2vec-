86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ Came here for an opening party and loved all the food. It's in the old space of Bombay Behl and I personally welcome this place over the BB. The restaurant is a chain with previous locations in miss and thornhill. The concept originates from dubai with another store in uganda. 

Got to try various dishes like vindaloo lamb sliders, tikka paneer, chicken lollipops, etc. I only have compliments about their food. Their drinks were excellent too - their bombay mojito is genius - paan leaves instead of mint leaves. So smart!

I will definitely be coming back here again (and maybe again) and will post a review when i go in as an actual guest.
