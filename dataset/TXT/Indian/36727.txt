NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Just checked out the new Choolaah's on Chagrin. Loved it.  Really liked the menu options, atmosphere was great and staff was so friendly and helpful. (It was obvious we were amateurs) 
Highly recommend the salmon plate with naan and tikka masala!!! 
YUMMY. 

Best fast and casual experience !!!! 
Yep,  beer and wine are also beverage options :)
