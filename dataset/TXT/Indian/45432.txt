SaAtDmMKN_B5-8d-n5X86w I really, really want to like this place. I understand theyre a small new business. But there used to be a Chinese food here prior that flourished without a problem with only 1 cook. 

I called ahead and ordered the vegetable biriyani. Gobi 65. And Chicken Tikka Masala this evening. 

The guy came off as a bit rude it seemed. Because I asked him to repeat himself a few times. And I asked for the Chicken Tikka Masala as it is displayed on their menu, but he didnt know what I was talking about. But I enjoy the food so I continued. He took my order and told me itll be ready in 15 minutes. No worries. Instead it took him 30 and he lied to my face.

After he made my chicken masala and veggie biriyani, he told me they dont have gobi 65. Okayy. 

I get home after paying. And open the biriyani. There's cauliflower in it. Really guy?

I get it when things are stressful, but this place is kinda off to a rough start. They don't display their correct hours anywhere but on their FB page. And they have it plastered on the front of the restaurant that they deliver when they don't. 

I'm not sure who the guy was that was working tonight, but they should really have at least 3 people working everyday. One to cook. One to take orders and a back up. So I'm trying not to put the blame on him, but don't tell me you don't have an item, when ultimately you just don't want to make it. 

I want to keep coming here because the food is really good, but if this keeps up I dont see this place lasting when Saffron is down the road. Atleast my Chicken tikka masala was, and the veggie biriyani were really tasty. I wouldnt know about the Gobi 65... :(
