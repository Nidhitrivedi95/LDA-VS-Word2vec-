The chicken curry is outstanding and some of the most tender curry chicken I've ever eaten. The vegetable (chickpea) curry was just as delicious. A huge plate of curry over rice for £5 is pretty amazing. They have an buffet portion after 5 pm, but I found a single portion to be adequate. The only letdown was the lamb curry, which wasn't nearly as tender.
