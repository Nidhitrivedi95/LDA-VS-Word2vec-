fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw My girlfriend and I had been planning on going to an Indian restaurant nearby this establishment, though after finding out it was closed we walked a short distance and decided to try this place. It was just opening up for dinner, so the service getting the food was a little slow, though all other aspects of the service was immaculate. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was terrific. The prices for some menu items were a little high, though well worth it (in my opinion).  If you're in the mood for Indian food I suggest this place highly.
