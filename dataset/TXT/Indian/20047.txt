FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q For dinner, the food was pretty tasty and the service was quick. I pretty much enjoyed everything, the only bummer is the food isn't particularly spicy. I ordered my dish hot and well... it was mild at best. Still pretty good, but if you have a spicy food itch like I do look elsewhere. There's a lot of vegetarian options, which is pretty cool too.

The buffet is pretty good too, they have a pretty wide selection of things. Definitely one of the better Indian food buffets I've been to since moving away from NY.
