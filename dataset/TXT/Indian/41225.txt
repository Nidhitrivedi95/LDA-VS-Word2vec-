PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ The king of Indian restaurants. My girlfriend and I enjoy their lunch buffet.  The first time I tried the food here was with my cousin from the US, and they were quite flattered.

The masala dosas taste wonderful with the chutneys. Most of the food are based on north Indian menu, even then, the non-veg section doesn't miss a beat.
The dessert table is quite big too.
