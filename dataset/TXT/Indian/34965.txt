Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Ok so I havn't yelped in a while, but this place is just that good and should be way more busy for how good the food is. Do people who go to vegas not like indian food? Seriously, if you get tired if crappy overpriced food on the strip try here.  I have eaten at the best inian places in sf(amber, indian oven, etc) and tamba is right up there with them - in Vegas!  My goodness, what a pleasant surprise. I just pounded the butter chicken, the chicken was like tender like duck confit and the sauce was perfect flavor and not too creamy. The rice is fluffy and my nan was perfect for dipping. I am stuffed, will be back for more!
