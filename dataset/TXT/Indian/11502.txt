ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Best biriyani I've had in Toronto...and I've tried many! Overall excellent food and reasonable prices. Must haves - hyderabadi dum biriyani, gobi manchurian, mango lassi, kulfi . Dosas are good too. Love the waiters who are friendly and knowledgeable in terms of giving food recommendations. This has become a weekly spot for us. Oh and I much prefer it to the neighbouring Banjara.
