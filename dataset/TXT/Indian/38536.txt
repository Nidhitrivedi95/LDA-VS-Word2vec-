The atmosphere was chill, not a lot of people digging in yet.  I think a happy hour could help bring some business.

We tried the chicken biryani, which had a really rad presentation and great aromatic bite.  We also shared the chicken tikka masala.  The food overall was great.  We tried a paan shot, too.  It was like a baby melted milkshake with a really nice flavor that I can't even describe.

Props to the bartender for being very hospitable and attentive.  

The pricing could ultimately sway my vote here, so if they step up the happy hour game for those that work in the area...this place will be hoppin'!
