TElfyEowMFTPR1gAwMLcNQ There seems to be a problem with everything in this restaurant, including the people who serve.

We first ordered Alu tikki.. We were given 2 pieces in a plate.. but no fork or spoon or knief to eat.. not even individual plates.. we had to call the waiter for each piece of cutlery, again and again.

Then we ordered, Mix veg curry.. and when we got it, all it had was peas and carrot. I told the chef that there seems to have been a mistake in order. But he had the audacity to tell me that this is how mix veg curry is prepared in that hotel.. 

Forget the food, they dont even have the courtesy to treat people nicely. I never want to set foot into this place again!!
