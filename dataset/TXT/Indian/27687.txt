Iq4NUW8He1gUWQMV-Fj20g Well, that didn't take long. 

I've only been in the neighbourhood a few months, yet since I moved in this site has been home to Indus Tavern, which closed to make way for the oddly named Darsano Grill, and now Cloves The Spice. I hope Cloves The Spice does better, many because I hope they open a take-out joint and call it Cloves the Hoof.
