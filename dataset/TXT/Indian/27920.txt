IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA I went here right off the train I was starving after work. I ordered their Pita pizza because their vegetarian selection was a joke. It was terrible and the marinara tasted like ketchup. Their cheese I'm certain was of the string variety. I also didn't enjoy the old cook judgmental watching as I ate, he probably owns the place and thinks he's amazing.
