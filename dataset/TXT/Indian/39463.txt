OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA Ok when it comes to hakka, there are essentially two choices:

Federick's or Lin.

There is the tangerine too but it doesn't compare.

And when it comes to hakka, ppl usually compare by chicken pakora's. 

Federick's has the better pakora's, but Lin Garden is my top choice.

Portions are huge, food is dirt cheap.
Less oily than Federick's, but it shouldn't really matter when you're doing the dirty and eating Hakka.

Why i like Lin better is because:

a) it was my first indochinese experience
b) i like their deep fried shrimp better than any other place
c) their hakka chow mein is better
d) the lady who owns the store is my entertainment. She speaks chinese, swahili, hindi, urdu, some german. and she's a joker.

Now the reality check - this is not gourmet. This is plain and simple you getting dirty.
The service is shit.
Some dishes are flourescent in colour.
It's often packed. 

But accept it for what it is, and then you can see the good. Don't eat there, get takeout. 

When you're depressed, don't eat a tub of icecream like some ppl do - load up on oily meats and noodles. The portions are so big that you will be sitting in front of the tele, wallowing in your self pity in a 5 hour eat, break, eat ordeal.

and then you'll remember your encounter with the funny multilingual chinese women and you will go to bed with a smile. the end.
