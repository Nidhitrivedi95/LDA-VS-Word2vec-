4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Food is OK, sauces are a bit watery, meat dishes without much meat. Lots of variety, nice interior decor. Service is indifferent, prices on the website differ from actual prices, manager doesn't even apologise, points to sign on the wall with new prices ... bait and switch. Not returning.
