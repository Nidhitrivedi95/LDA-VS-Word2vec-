A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ My girlfriend and I got violent food poisoning here on Feb 17, 2017 (started within 6-8 hours of eating dinner). I think it has to do with the large size of the food trays, since the restaurant isn't huge, there isn't enough turnover. The meat dishes probably sit there lukewarm all day. The selection was good, and the food taste was ok for an Indian buffet, but nothing special. Price was good. Unfortunately I can't go back here again after that.
