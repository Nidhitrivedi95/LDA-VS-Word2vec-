82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA We went for the lunch buffet.  Overall, it's a reasonable price at $14.95, but the food is nothing special and generally short on the spice.  The tandoori chicken was dry.  The butter chicken was pretty good but the sauce was a bit too sweet for our tastes.  Out of the three meat dishes, the curry beef was the best - could have used more curry flavor but the beef was pretty tender.  The curry mushroom and peas was good.  All the desserts were pretty good although the honey doughnut was too sweet.
I'm also taking a star off for the service.  The waiters were good at timely removing used plates, but we had to ask for our drinks to be refilled.  When we paid the bill with large bills, the waiter did not return our change and presumed that the entire change was tip.  This was a huge no-no in my book.
