Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I have ordered takeout from everest numerous times and I love the taste of their food.
It kind of unfair of me to give them one star, but that's what you do when you find a piece of plastic in your food.
Update: The management called me and apologised after reading this review. Also offered a discount for the next order. Adding another two stars for the prompt response.
