YywWkWX235ZurTWSLqNPog I work int he plaza right beside this place....the service is a little slow during lunch hours but other than its good indian food for the right price and a good filling lunch.. food has always been on point....I have tried their choley bhaturay and vege thali...Price wise its a much better bang for your buck than any other fast food chain like subway and pizzanova......if you enjoy indian food its a place to check out...
