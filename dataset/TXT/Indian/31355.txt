KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Came in because they had some great reviews. Though the menu was a bit interesting then what I'd usually go for, it definitely didn't disappoint!  My friend got the Punjab Cheese Burger and I got the Ricks Fried Chicken combos -- tho I can't speak for the burger, the RFC was amazing. I was disappointed when I was getting close to finishing. Rick and his family were also super welcoming and friendly, giving us samples of some of the items -- the butter chicken and mac (and just the butter chicken) was also extremely tasty. Highly recommend and would definitely swing back again if I'm back in the Toronto area.
