rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ The food itself is a hit and miss! Loved the appetizers especially the corn tikis. The butter chicken we ordered had too much garlic. The strange part is, the mains don't come with either rice or naan and they need to be ordered separate. Never experienced that before. I think they should add a side of naan or rice since the prices are on the higher side. $20 for a butter without takes. Overall a decent experience. The prices are high and the food is decent at best.
