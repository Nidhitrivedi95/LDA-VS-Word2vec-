Tla8mDMUAnpB7QcWAf7c5g Let me get the positive out of the way first. Really delicious food and extremely authentic taste.

BUT:

Took us an hour to get the food when there were only 2 other tables occupied
Plates and cutlery were dirty. I mean unwashed.
I returned my unclean plate before lunch arrived...after all we had a hour to kill....and then had to ask for it to be replaced when lunch eventually arrived!
My daughter ordered Naan and it come stone cold...maybe they cooked this first?!
each additional order of appams took 15 minutes to arrive and I know how long it takes to make one.
Then the chef came to our table and we did take the time to tell him that he was doing a great job but that he might be out of one if the restaurant continue to be managed the way it was.
The final cut...he sent us an additional serving of appams...And then when we got the cheque they had charged us for it!!!
They have parking space for one car, but given our experience today, I guess that is more than adequate!

A pity, all of this, given that the food is outstanding.

I am inherently optimistic, but I do not give this particular Maro
