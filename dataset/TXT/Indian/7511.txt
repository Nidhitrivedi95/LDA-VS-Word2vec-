5VOqWjRXUPc7b1A_NSI9mQ I first gave this place a 5 star and then took 1 off and i will tell explain why later. 

Pros - awesome awesome awesome food. Great price. Great portions. You will not be disappointed at all. The service is good. Make sure you try the chili-chicken. I don't know how they make it so good. Its really juicy and flavorful. If you can seriously handle spice then try their hot sauce. Its really different! 

Cons - It looks very dull and unappealing. They could do with some renovations but its not really necessary. 

Why did i give it 4 stars instead of 5?  They have changed the way they make their "Hakka noodles". Every Indian knows how Hakka noodles "smells" and tastes like. Its has a smokey smell and taste. This was the 1 place where i found the same flavor and scent but last time when i ate here the noodles tasted different. The smokey-ness is not there any more. I HOPE they go back to the previous method of cooking...:S
