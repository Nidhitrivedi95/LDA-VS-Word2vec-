Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ Would give 0 stars of it was an option. Whoever said this place was good obviously doesn't even know authentic hakka food. I was looking for a good place to try out near home and I found this place on the app, judging by the reviews I thought it would be good. I ordered pickup and bought chilli chicken, noodles, vegetables, chicken wings & beef and chicken fry rice. Almost 70 dollars for just that. Expensive as hell! When I tried the food.. wasnt good the fry rice was hard like stale rice , the chilli chicken which i was much excited to try was such a disappointment lack of seasoning , doesn't even taste like chilli chicken to be honest and they dump the chicken in a batter and fry it before cooking it into the sauce so your basically eating fried dough instead of chicken... nice way to cheap out on the meats. Definitely won't go back here again ! Horrible and expensive.

 If you want the best hakka food in all of Scarborough I suggest going to Fredricks by Bellamy & ellesmere they've been there for years and no 1 can compare to their authentic hakka.
