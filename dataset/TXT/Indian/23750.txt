gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We got the mt. Everest thali and the lamb biryani. It is the best. We will come back for sure. Try the pickled vegetables. The service is amazing and two adults and two kids = these two entrees = fully satisfied. Glasses always full. Please do yourself and come here. Ask for Prakash! He will take care of your family.
