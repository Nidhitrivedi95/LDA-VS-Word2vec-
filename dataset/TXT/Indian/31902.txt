kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Does Trendy = Healthy? Well here it seems to. While this is one of the few trendy Americanaized Indian restaurant in town.

The big star here for me is the menu. Vegiteran dishes and Vegan ones are all marked on the menu.In addition many menu items can have the protein of choice including tofu and or veggies. And a choice of starch, rice, brown rice or egg noodles. 

We had two build you own combos, Curry with mixed veggies and tofu over noodles $11.95 +$1 for tofu. The curry was a bit bland and the noodles to me were not the best match, but if it were truly healthy I would be ok with the flavor. The other dish was a spinach dish, with mixed veggies and brown rice. I really enjoyed this dis. $11.95

As with Thai food you get to pick you heat level so anyone can eat here.

For flavors it was 3 stars the veggie options made it 4. However I did miss the Bollywood music I usually hear with my Indian food.
