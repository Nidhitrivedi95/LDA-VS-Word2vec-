aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q Hands down, some of the best food I've ever eaten. Period. Go. They have it all: veg, meat. Vindaloo, tikka, saag paneer. Homemade naan they roll out and cook right in front of you. The proprietors are incredibly warm. Had chicken curry and cabbage&peas yesterday. Came back today for more. Amazing.
