jG46RAFm2kWshUIZ4HoJtg Excited I remembered that this place opened soon, I stopped in for Indian 'fast-food'.  I ordered Chole with 1/2 rice portion, 1/2 naan.  The gentleman who took my order forgot to give me my change and after I told him, he gave me my dollar back in dimes. I waited approx. 15 minutes for my 'fast-food'.  The Chole was OK, the rice was rice and the naan was great.  Like the first reviewer, I didn't think the value was that great.  I'm no pig but even I could've had more.  When I go back I'll have to get the big plate (full serving of rice & whole piece of naan) but then we're talking $9+.  A bit much for fast-food.  I will go back, though.  They just opened and I don't want a food option like this to go away without a chance.
