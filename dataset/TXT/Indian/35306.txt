mUk-0jToBuzk4KaDXp-uew Lunch buffet review:

Being the closest Indian restaurant to my house, I decided to check it out the other day. During the week, they run a $11.99 lunch buffet special which has just about everything you can ever imagine out on the line including: chicken tandoori, goat curry, samosas and a lot of other tasty stuff that I do not remember the name of. 

Overall, if your in the area and hungry for Indian food, it's definitely worth a stop, especially if they are running a lunch buffet special. You may not come back, but at least you can say you tried it!
