C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Here I have had a type of fusion cuisine I never thought I'd see: Italian and Indian.  And man of man is this place a good idea.  Pizzas on Naan breads.  "Scrolls," their version of Roti, but filled with things out of an Italian pantry.  This is one of those types of cuisine where I find myself really surprised that I hadn't heard about it sooner.  Moreover, I'm surprised every restaurant ever isn't an Italian/Indian fusion.

In regards to price, I'd have to say that this place is a bit pricey, but for anyone interested in trying out something new, or just generally interested in eating good food, I'd say the price is worth it.  Certainly not an "every night" kind of place, but it's the perfect excuse to invent yourself a special occasion, just to come.

Line-ups around the dinner hours are pretty much guaranteed, especially if you want a seat on the patio in the warmer months.  If you want to eat here, be sure to plan ahead.
