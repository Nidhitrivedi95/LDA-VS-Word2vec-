Ambience and location are amazing. Service was well. Small place. Small Staff.

Now to the important part. The food. After a week off travelling; I was craving some Indian food- mostly Biryani. I work in Markham- so I find a lot of biryani there but they tend to be Sri lankan style and I wanted more of an Indian flavour. I saw the pictures and reviews and was sold.

It was definitely a unique experience taste-wise. The food is not overwhelmingly spicy but there seems to be some fusion integrated into it in order to get a more indian flavor. The presentation of the Biryani was amazing- the taste was great as well.

The beef vindaloo was not thick and oily. It was more so a paste like gravy. Heavily induced in turmeric so that you can taste the sourness after. 

Overall- I can see the popularity of this place as the flavours are a bit toned down with the spiciness.However I LIKE SPICY. So for the price. $19 for biryani. $14 for Beef vindaloo,. I could have got a lot more flavour elsewhere.

It was worth the try- good setting and service. Flavour was new to the palette. However it did not match mine when it comes to Indian food. I think they are trying to cater to those who are not used to overwhelming spiciness that comes hand in hand with Indian dishes.

So they have a niche market.
