AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ Attractive bar and comfortable ambiance are among the top characteristics of this place.  Service can use a bit of help as we'd been sat waiting for dishes to be cleared and the opportunity to ask for another drink for extreme periods.  For the food offering - there is far better for the price.  Good attempt but nothing attractive about a $19 entree of beef vindaloo.  Highly touted julab jamon cheesecake was a huge disappointment comprising of a regular slice of cheesecake with several julab jamon halves surrounding it.  Pet peeve of mine - don't hover around when you bring the bill.  On review the next morning I only then realized that the bill had already included a service charge, unexpected as this was a dinner for two persons.
