Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w We have been here for more than couple times, usually it's not too busy. But for the last time it was super busy. I usually find the food takes a lot longer than expected. Momos are good and hot sauce is tasty too. Everything we order was vegetarian and no complain about the taste except for jhol momos. We were extremely disappointed with the taste. It seemed like it was cooked in yellow hot sauce they usually serve on side with other momos. Servers are nice but can be a little blunt sometime.
