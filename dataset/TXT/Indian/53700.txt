ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA The buffet is $9.99 + tax. I love Indian food so I decided to try this place out! It was pretty good. The reason I am giving them 4 starts is because there wasn't a huge variety of food. The customer service was just ok, nothing overly amazing. The only complain I have is that the Naan bread was not baked/cooked all the way. I was able to pull parts of the bread apart just like melted cheese. All in all this was an ok restaurant. The food was ok as well as the customer service. Nothing horribly bad, nothing amazing.
