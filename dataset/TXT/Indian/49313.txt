tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I have had Indian food in cities more well-known for diverse cultural cuisines than Mesa/Phoenix, and let's just say that India Oven will hold its own anywhere else.

I've usually come for the lunch buffet and this is as good as any other, if not better. I especially like that they offer saag for lunch, which is something I don't always see. In addition, they have an excellent paneer offering and chana masala. I also like their pakora. The thing that would make the experience even more awesome is if they put out some samosas, but I guess that might be asking too much. Naan bread is excellent, and to top it all off, you are welcome to serve yourself some mango lassi!

Service has been pleasant. I'm not even from Arizona but if I'm ever in town, I wouldn't hesitate to come back here.
