HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw Faley's is a solid, small spot for great Hakka food. We came here for dinner on a weekday and the place was packed.  

We ordered vegetarian fried rice, chicken fried rice, Hakka chow mein, Manchurian beef, special garlic chicken, chili paneer for five guys and we were all stuffed. There was still enough to take home even! It came out to $12 total per person, which is a bargain for that much food.

I am Hakka myself and enjoyed the food thoroughly. Faley's food has a very homestyle taste to it which is a great thing. Their fried rice is not oily at all, and overall their hakka food, in general, is not as oily or salty as many other places. This is a huge positive as this tends to be a common complaint of many Hakka restaurants. Ironically some comments here have indicated the food as flavourless. I don't find that the case. The faley's special garlic chicken was the best dish of the night, you can't go wrong with garlic! The chow mein was also tasty and full of 'toppings' which included shrimp, beef, and chicken. The ratio of noodles to toppings is quite impressive, they don't skimp out on ingredients here.

Service is good, I can tell the owners care and will make sure you have a good experience here. They will talk to guests and make you feel welcome.
