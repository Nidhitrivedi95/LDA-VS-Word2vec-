ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w Restaurant has a variety of Italian, Indian and pub style food. Sat on the patio, enjoyed their lunch special that included a choice of any appetizer, any large sized salad and one two topping pizza, $30. This option is pretty good for two people as it suggests. I wouldn't recommend getting the wings (they come with fries btw) they are too small and here's no meat on them! They are dry wings and they do not come tossed. The honey garlic sauce is in a small packet, doesn't make for a good experience. The salad comes on a flat plate (should be in a shareable bowl). The pizza is the highlight of this entire experiment as it is a oven wood baked experience. I would highly recommend the pizzas. I got the tandoori and sun-dried tomato toppings, a delicious combination. They have a variety of beers on tap And the patio is dog friendly and a wonderful setting. I would only come back for the pizza. 4/5
