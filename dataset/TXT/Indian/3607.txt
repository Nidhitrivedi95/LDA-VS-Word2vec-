0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ My wife and I ordered the crispy eggplant, beef fried rice and the sweet and spicy chicken. Overall we paid around 40 dollars for 2 people with left over fried rice (they give you a free huge bowl of white rice along with your dishes). The crispy eggplant was good. It had a black bean sauce kind of taste but the eggplant was simply breaded (same batter as chicken balls) and fried. The sweet and spicy chicken was perfect in terms of sweetness, though it was a little dry. Beef fried rice is like the fried rice you get at any other "Canadian Chinese" restaurant: not too much beef and the rice was a little too dry for my taste.
The service was good and fast. The place was full when we went in but everyone have gotten their food. We ordered and got our food probably within 8-10 minutes.

I didn't really understand what Haka Chinese food was I guess. I was hoping for more traditional Chinese food so that's why I gave a 3/5 for the food not being too similar. If you enjoy this kind of food then you will probably like this place. If you crave more traditional Chinese food, there are a bunch of places around the Btrust supermarket (Right across the street).
