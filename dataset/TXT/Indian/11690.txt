Anvs3S2S4rYbAzzUKIVg7w Love the doubles, roti, goat, and aloo pie so much. I love their pholourie that comes with tamarind sauce. The sauce is made perfectly. I usually get takeout and the service is very fast, maybe 3-5 minutes wait, sometimes less. The people there are friendly. After years, I haven't been disappointed with the food.
