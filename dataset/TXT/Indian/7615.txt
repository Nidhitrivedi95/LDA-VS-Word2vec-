5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ My sister, mom and I shared the vegetable biryani and a selected of naan stuffed with cheeses, peppers and other savories. It was simply delicious. Steaming hot, perfectly seasoned and huge portions. 

The owner noticed it was my birthday (I opened 2 cards after we ordered) and be brought a tiny pistachio ice cream with a candle -- and played happy birthday thru the sound system! Fun!
