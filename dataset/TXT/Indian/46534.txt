sUGlSS0AF2xPYFEjvKJbSA The too long didn't read version of this review is "I miss Maharajah". That's not the reason for 2 stars, but it's still true. 

We went for the lunch buffet because we're just wild about Indian food. The place didn't really have a large amount of people, and we got there shortly after open (11:30 am). You'd assume the food would be fresh, but you'd be wrong. Everything I got off the buffet was lukewarm at best. The fried things were soggy and greasy. The flavor was ok, but you can get better pretty much anywhere in Madison. The buffet is also very small. They also do not serve naan to the table, it's in a hopper so it's sad and limp not crispy and awesome.

I think outside of the food the thing that bugged me the most was that I did not feel welcome at all. The two guys who were serving us talked only to my husband and one actually walked away as I started talking to him. He asked how things were, listened to my husband and walked away while I was talking. When I went up to pay, it was basically the same thing. Looked and talked to my husband even though I was paying. 

I don't need to return here.
