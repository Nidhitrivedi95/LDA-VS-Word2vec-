-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Came back here for a dinner with my sweetie and like always, I was so impressed with the food. Yes, the atmosphere sucks, and yes, the plastic dishes are worn and tacky, but the food is right on point.

I had matar paneer, one of my favorite Indian dishes, and the paneer had a wonderful toothsome texture and slightly tangy taste. It was the best I've had anywhere. We ordered poori, a deep-fried whole grain bread, and they were airy, light, crispy, with just the right amount of decadent richness.

My mango lassi was perfect--not too sweet, but full of yummy mango flavor. It was a perfect accompaniment to the spicy meal. My husband had the baingan bartha and said it was the best he's ever tasted.

There's a reason Pittsburghers make this trek again and again!
