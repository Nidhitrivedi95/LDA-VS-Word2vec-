OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA Ok to be fair I've been here 3 times and I always found their servings are large portions and Manchurian noodles (orange color) to be good but things that I can't stand hence the low rating:
1. Service - damn right poor enough for people not to come back here 
2. Smell - there is a bad odor coming from some of the food which doesn't really help increase one's appetite
3. Taste - I ordered the hot and sour soup once and it was I'm sorry to say terrible (I thought it was expired) 
Net, I wouldn't recommend this place to others although it's one of the few Chinese Hakka places that serve Halal food in the area
