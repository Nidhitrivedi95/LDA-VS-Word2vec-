RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg OM lives up to its yelp reputation! What a great restaurant! The interior if the restaurant is clean, well-designed, and modern. I will say it does not have the "cozy" feel of many other Indian restaurants. Our server, John, was extremely attentive and apologetic because they were quite busy that evening. They clearly did a huge takeout/delivery business which we could see from the line-up of orders along the bar. I mentioned that I was trying to stay away from dairy, and John grabbed their menu which had gluten and dairy call outs on it. It was very helpful in my ordering decision. The food was delicious and they had a great wine deal going where it was $4/glass for house wine. I loved OM and will definitely be back, maybe next time I'll try their delivery option!
