F9_g9plM0EUc_pi_zs_MCg Pretty good, and at an affordable price.

Stopped in for lunch here with a friend, after I had told him that I missed my mother's home-cooked Indian food. I'm a Bangali, so it's often harder to find food that tastes closer to what we eat as a family. I have to say, this place hit pretty close to what I was expecting, which was a nice change,

The lunch menu had three different options for the starter and the main each, and at 7.50 for the meal, it was pretty decently priced. (The portions were just the right amount of food to fill us up but not weigh us down too much to walk back homewards.) The food was tasty and clearly not the typical generic Indian food you can get around here, so good points in my books, definitely. 

Not a five-star review just because the menu options given for the lunch meal were a bit limited and kinda similar to one another in my opinion, but I guess what can a cute little place like this do on a weekday afternoon without ending up with a ton of waste?

I definitely want to stop in for dinner some time soon to try out more of their selection. I've looked at their menu online, and it looks like a fantastic variety, with plenty of Bangali food to remind me of home.
