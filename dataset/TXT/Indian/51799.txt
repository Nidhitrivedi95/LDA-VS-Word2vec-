UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Went here tonight on a friends suggestion. I though they had a very good selection and the food was great. I ordered the Tandoori chicken and some chicken Masala both great. Nice atmosphere however I felt the cleanliness was a issue, menus were dirty and bench had rips in it. Plus i felt like they were a little pushy to get us to order maybe because they are so Busy. Overall a great restaurant.  Would definitely come back.
