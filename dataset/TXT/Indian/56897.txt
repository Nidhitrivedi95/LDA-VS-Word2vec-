xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Who cares if the interior ain't pretty? The food here is to die for and the staff is so sweet. I talked to the lady at the counter for 10 minutes about thrift stores in the area and my food came out pretty quick. Its a huge portion for the amount, so just order 1 taco if that's what you're getting (you can even share..I'm not joking its a TON of food). I got the refried beans, definitely going to try the chorizo next time.
