Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Everything about this restaurant is meticulously planned with the customer experience in mind. From the murals on the wall to the staff and servers, every bit of the place made me feel cared for and entertained. The owner is also always present and willing to talk with you about your experience. The food is flavorful and consistently delicious and I've never had a bad meal here. This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix and I'm sure you'll love it too.
