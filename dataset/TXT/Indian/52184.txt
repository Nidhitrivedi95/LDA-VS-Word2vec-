UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I went here to meet up some friends for late lunch and surprisingly, there was still a wait at 1:45pm. They have an iPad by the door so you can put your name down and the number of people in your party. I waited 10 minutes which isn't bad.

We came here for the lunch buffet since I've been hearing good things. Our naan took a rather long time but at least they gave us unlimited garlic naan. 

There's another Indian restaurant a few miles away from here that also has a lunch buffet but that place turned me off when they kept giving me excuses as to why they can't give me garlic naan (i.e. "We ran out of garlic" when there's a supermarket right behind them). This place is in a better location and looks nicer and cleaner. The service is better too. For less than $15 for a buffet, you can't go wrong.

I liked that there's a good variety of dishes for their lunch buffet: tikka masala, palak paneer, tofu, veggies, spicy chicken, curry and other savory dishes. Their gulab jamun was just right - hot, sweet and cheesy balls. Yum! The food was excellent. Hooray for huge chunks of chicken! The sauces were spot on. There was this mystery dish that we all tried without reading the label - was it cheese or was it tofu? It was the texture of cubed mozzarella without the stomach ache-inducing property of cheese on somebody who's lactose intolerant. So, it probably was tofu.

I'll definitely come back again and again.
