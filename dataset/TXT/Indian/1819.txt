-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw This is delicious and affordable Indian food. It's so affordable I almost want to offer more. Something so delicious seems like it should cost more, somehow! There is sometimes a lineup and there arent many places to sit but it's well worth the wait. It's no secret that this place is great so plan ahead!
