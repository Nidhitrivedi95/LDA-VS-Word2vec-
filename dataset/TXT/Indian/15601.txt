cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w Been wanting to come here since I first heard about it. I was surprised to have it listed as a $$$$ restaurant, I don't think it is (edit 4/25: looks like this may have been updated). I could see how if you opted for the Prix fix menu, but ordering a la carte I found just as good.

So we had to try the baigan fries (eggplant fritters), that was really good and bigger than expected. What was even better though is the Lasooni cauliflower (sauced up cauliflower). Imagine sweet and sour chicken saucing up the cauliflower. It was the star I felt.

Then we had the butter chicken, now we read somewhere this is the best butter chicken in the city. I'd have to eat side by side or on multiple days to tell, but I can say it did taste very good. Had an interesting tang to it.

Also had the grilled okra sindhi kadhi,  a different take and flavor profile, I think it takes a couple tastes to appreciate it.

One thing I'd say it's if I knew the size of the appetizers, we'd only order one. Two was a bit excessive, even though the server's say it's not enough.

A few wishes
- thali for dinner, and not just veggie
- smaller appetizer portions with smaller prices
- let me know more often that tip IS included. NOTE to everyone, tip is included though you would not have guessed when credit machine asks you for tip

With all that said, food tasted great and subject was attentive.
