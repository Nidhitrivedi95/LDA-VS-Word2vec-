s6IPjR2nSJqhXcGJ49Ckiw Our experience of this new restaurant in the Roncey neighbourhood was disappointing.  The food and service was mediocre. We had to sit ourselves down and wait for 20 minutes even though the place was empty before being served.  We eat a lot of Thai and Indian food and the dishes we ordered were either bland or oddly overspiced, including the mango salad. I really hope the business makes the changes needed to be successful.
