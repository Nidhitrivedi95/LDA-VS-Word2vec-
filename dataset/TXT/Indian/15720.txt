CvOxwAhmwwy3sQRKYVAjGg Booked the party room for 50 people; and was shocked to see the state of the room.   It was dark and shabby.  Terrible ambiance, tasteless food, and poor service.  Before booking the place, I  was promised kabab for appetizer but never got it; and mutton Karhai as one of the menu items, but both were missing.  The mutton item was all bones and few pieces of hard inedible meat; the chicken Tikka was under cooked with blood oozing.  I was promised fruit as one of the desert that too was missing. The only items that were good was the Nan and dal.  I will not be going back.
