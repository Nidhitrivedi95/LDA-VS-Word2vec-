KCxdy3cm7H0jXnDhhPvBYw I came here for lunch with my boyfriend around 1 pm. There was no line and the wait for our food was about 15 minutes. Most of the items on their menu have a small size ($4.50) and a large one ($5.50), and you choose a spice level from 1 to 10. I ordered the chicken biryani (spice level 1) and my boyfriend got the matar paneer (spice level 3), both small size. They didn't have mango lassi.

I wasn't very impressed by the food. The rice in the chicken biryani was very very red, and the dish didn't have very much flavor aside from the coconut. The matar paneer was a little sweet for my taste. Also, the portion size was a little small for me--I probably need the large size for a filling lunch. 

However, the price is low, so I'm planning to go back to try some other dishes. Hopefully I'll find something more to my taste.
