gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA Came to this place on wimp as we wanted to eat Indian while we were on the strip. This isn't a sit down place its located inside the fashion mall next to zara in the food court. We ordered papdi chaat, chole bhatura, thali and mysore masala dosa. Chole bhatura was decent so was the thali but Mysore masala dosa wasn't cooked properly or even crispy but the sambar was good. Papdi chaat was ok since the papdi wasn't big enough it felt more like they had fried tortillas and cut it into small pieces. It wasn't bad for LV and decent if you just want to grab and go. It was a little pricey so I would recommend going to a traditional Indian place as it would be cheaper to get buffet than ordering 5 different dishes.
