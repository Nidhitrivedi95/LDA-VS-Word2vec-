KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Ugh, do not go here. 

Apparently, this place used to be amazing. 

Used to.

The food we ordered was flavourless, watery and not greasy at all.
The portions were tiny.

The restuarant was empty as hell, at 7 on a saturday. 

We had :

Chili Chicken - barely any spice. Watery. The gravy was beige. CHILI CHICKEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE BLACK OR DARK BROWN. WTF.

Bombay Chicken (starter) - Deep fried chicken with mad breading, and doused in a sweet sauce. My friend said it tasted like Jalebi.
eww.

Fried Rice - passable.

Beef Chow Mein - not at all what I expected. A cripy basket of noodles with beef + veg on top.


Ugh, go to Eddie's instead please.
