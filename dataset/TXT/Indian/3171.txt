0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg Moved from Austin just a month ago and I've already been to this place 4 times. I am on a venture to try all of their food. 

First time I tried the chicken biriyani and paani puri - did the same again - i didn't have much expectations on the biriyani, but they excelled. Chicken 65 was pretty good, and the Chicken soup and Chole Bhature as well.

Second edit
By now, I tried all their soups, chole bhatura, dosa, idly, medu vada, and ... Hayward 5000.. 
Nonetheless, the customer service comprehension... I'm sure I'm revisiting here with further updates ..
