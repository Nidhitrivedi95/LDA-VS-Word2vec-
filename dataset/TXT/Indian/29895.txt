jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I was giving this restaurant another chance because my visit was horrible. Now let me explain to you why I will never be going back there again. First, we ordered the vegetable puff pastry. It was obviously reheated as the top and bottom were very burnt and dark, while the filling was cold. Next, we ordered the chili chicken. There was absolutely NO flavor- like literally tasted like nothing- and the chicken had a gooey and extra chewy texture; no one touched the order. The only semi decent thing there was the french fries. Plus, this place is super over priced! Left $40 less and dissapointed.
