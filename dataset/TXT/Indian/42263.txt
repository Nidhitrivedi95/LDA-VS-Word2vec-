Qlebt777MOvHmu7p7QiM_Q AYCE Indian buffet in Woodbridge...how exciting! Based on the recommendation of a friend, 4 of us ventured down expecting to be "wowed". I was anything but.   

Decent vegetarian dishes, pretty awful meat dishes.

We visited Bhojan on a Friday night at 7:15. When we walked in it was fairly quiet (perhaps 3 other tables). By the time we left, the place was packed and hopping.

While the vegetarian dishes were amazing (Channa, biryani rice, eggplant, etc) the meat dishes fell way short of other Indian restaurants. The butter chicken was very fatty and the sauce was lacking the full flavours this dish is known for. The Tandorri chicken was just as bad...very fatty pieces with little to no meat on them. One person in our group had the curried goat and said is was excellent, but I can't confirm this myself as I don't like goat. Pekoras were dry and had no flavour at all, the chicken samosas were just as bad. 

Their naan bread is perhaps the worst I've ever had while dining out. It was more like pita and I found it gummy (it looked and tasted store bought). Huge disappointment, as I love to dip naan in the sauces of some of the dishes.....but I didn't here.

Dessert selection was limited to cantaloupe, pineapple, ice cream (that looked disgusting) and a few traditional Indian sweets.

Our Waiter was attentive and all the staff we encountered were friendly.

Dinner for 4, including 2 pops and tax came to $53. 

Would I go back? If in the area I might, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
