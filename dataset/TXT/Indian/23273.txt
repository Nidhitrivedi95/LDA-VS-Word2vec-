gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Good buffet.Liked the pakora,Naan,Paneer curry(ordered ala carte).Carrot Halwa was top class,Rice Kheer was better than average.Very reasonable price and kids were charged only half price.Would visit this place again and again when in Vegas. Need to try their ala carte menu next time.
