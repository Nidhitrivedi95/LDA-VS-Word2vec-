x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ I wasn't raised in the Eastern Hemisphere so i don't know what true indo-chinese food is supposed to taste like since I have no comparison. However, the stars is mainly for service. The food itself was ok at best. It was more like my mom making the brown people version of ramen noodles. The lamb the noodles came was pretty good, but it doesn't belong in noodles. The place has a hipstery feel to it which isn't big. I mainly went to eat and i wasn't impressed. Usualy give food places 5 star reviews unless the service was bad or if the food just wasn't as good as i thought it would be.
