GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw When we are in the mood for some North Indian style MEAT we head to Tandoori Times.

I've eaten at both Tandoori Times locations and both are delicious. My only complaints are that some of the dishes are a little heavy on the oil but that can be typical for some Indian places - especially those that are more Pakistani in nature and they do not offer much of a vegetarian selection.

We taken family and friends to this restaurant, some of which have never had Indian food, with great success. The food is generic enough for the American palette but still delicious for those of us that huff spices in our spare time.

I've yet to try their Chaat on the weekends but I'm dying to do so!
