3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg alright so this is clearly a family run joint which is why we felt bad and stayed and why i also feel kind of bad writing this but ... at the end of the day its about customer experience as well as food so ..here we go . i found this place on yelp and based on the good reviews i convinced my bf to come here (he wanted to go somewhere else that he already knew was good). i should have listened. I HATE WHEN HES RIGHT. 

K ANYWAYS we called ahead to make sure a table was available. we walk in on friday night., there 2 little kids running around. 2 tables full of dirty dishes. one couple sitting and eating and one guy waiting for his take out. after about 5 min of awkwardly waiting for someone to come out. when the lady did come out she told us to sit at a table that had her kids snow boats/games thrown in front of it. this kind of unacceptable in my books, its a friday night and if you want business you should be making sure the front of your restaurant is clean even if your kids are running around. 

the food. we got fish pakoras which were way too greasy because they fried it in oil that wasnt hot enough. i like the taste it was just way too greasy

butter chicken i really liked, naan was good, goat biryani was also good. 

i wont be back because although the food was okay the first experience of the restaurant was terrible.
