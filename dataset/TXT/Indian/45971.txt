sLEIfWO9OEmVkIJ99oVP2w I went to Bar Be Que Hut last weekend with some friends and had a great experience.  

The decor is nothing to write home about but if you care more about decor and less about food, this is not your type of Saturday night date restaurant.  

Now, if you want a culinary experience, that is authentic, Bar Be Que Hut is worth the drive to little India.  Between the four of us we had seven dishes, two lamb (chops and madras), two chicken (tika masala vindaloo), two veg and then the guys ordered a third chicken dish.  The lamb chops were well seasoned and tasty.  Aloo gobi, you can't go wrong.   The chicken dishes were all very flavourful.  My only complaint is that some of the dishes were not temperature hot.  
Reasonably priced.  Would absolutely go back to Bar Be Que Hut for dinner. As we were leaving, the place was getting packed for the nightly entertainment!
