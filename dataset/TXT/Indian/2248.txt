_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA We stopped by 259 Host after a film at the Bell Lightbox (just a few minutes' walk away) for a friend's birthday. Even though we sat down just an hour before closing, we were treated very well - the host was attentive and friendly, giving us a little background on the Host restaurants and the style of their dishes ("Everything is handcrafted - even the spices are all ground in house!"). The service was very prompt - our glasses were never empty and no table crumb went unbrushed.

The food was presented quite beautifully, with fresh (tasty!) garnishes and delicious sauces for the croquettes, kebabs, and crab cakes. They whipped up an off-menu salty lassi for the birthday boy.

We shared four mains among four people, plus a huge basket of fresh, garlicky naan. The portions were perfect; the lamb tender and uniquely spiced, the tenderloin extremely flavorful sitting atop a pool of some of the best red curry I've ever tasted. The chicken and panir cheese tikka were also balanced and delicious.

We will definitely be back - the service was fantastic and the food memorable - the fresh ingredients really shone through. I'd really like to try their less traditional dishes, like the jackfruit masala to get a better sense of the creativity of the chef.

The prices were lower than I was expecting - the main dishes were all around $15.

I'm still sore about the disappearance of Chakra at Yonge and Eglinton last year, but this could be our new go-to Indian spot downtown.
