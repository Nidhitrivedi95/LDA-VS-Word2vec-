3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Place is big a no one dining at 9:30pm on a Friday night. 

I did order a butter chicken, but I'm really not sure the meat was chicken, very bad, sauce was ok, but the meat I really don't think is chicken. Of course asking will not tell you the true....

As the restaurant is really empty, they maybe try to cut the cost on the food, and it's scary to think what you have on your plate....

I was eating the rice and the server pass his arm in front of my face to catch an empty plate on the other side of the table, because it was late and he want to go home.

Unfortunately it's a no go restaurant in Vegas. You find better.

I will call the city health department and have this place checked.
