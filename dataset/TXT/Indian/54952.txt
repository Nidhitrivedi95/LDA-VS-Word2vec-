wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw Been there first last Friday and was so impressed with the food, our group of 5, returned again on Sunday. This is as close you get to sindhi food and Indian street food done like in Bombay. We had sharmaji ka chaat, gosht dabalroti (lamb and bread in sindhi), saibhaji (authentically and as close as my grandmom would have made it), keema pau(as made by Iranian restaurants in Bombay). I think the authenticity maybe lost by people from other parts of India or who are not familiar with sindhi food, but this one gets a 5 star from me. They are still trying to iron out some teething issues it seems, like long waits etc but the food triumphed all that for us!
