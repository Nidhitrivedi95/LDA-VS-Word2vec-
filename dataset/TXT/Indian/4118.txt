1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA *PUBIC HAIR FOUND in food* I'm usually very satisfied with my samosas from here. This is all I've ever ordered. Granted the line up is chaotic and they never have the amount I want, I always leave happy having one even!

Recently I got a dozen which comes with sauce and chutney. The green chutney sauce had a giant PUBIC hair when I got to the bottom of the container. I'll refrain from disparaging comments but you can imagine my disgust and outrage. Never again!!!!!!!
