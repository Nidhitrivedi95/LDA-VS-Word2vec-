_b8IGG_tsArBIMwlCVsWCQ This place just keeps me coming back.

I've visited with my sister-in-law, and a ton of girlfriends & we always have a nice time! The restaurant itself could use a little pick me up esthetically, but overall my taste buds were satisfied. Harry was our server and he made sure to top up our water often. The naan bread was fresh and hot, I think it was homemade?! The palak paneer was delicious (& not too spicy for my virgin Indian taste buds). It was a touch pricier than I was expecting to pay but that won't hold me from coming back. I plan to try more off their menu. 

TIP - cash only.

Since writing this review, I've had plenty of good experiences here. Harry never ceases to amaze us. Always sampling new sauces and different appetizers. He also leaves cooked rice out for the birds which is a sweet touch for the animal lovers... although I'm sure I'll get a bit of negative backlash regarding rice and birds.

Yummo.
