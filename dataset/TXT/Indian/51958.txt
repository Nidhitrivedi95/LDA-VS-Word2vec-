Was anything wrong? Not really. 
Was anything great? Yes, fresh naan of your choice. But now do we go to Indian restaurants for the naan alone? No. 
They have a lot of vegan choices on the buffet, which I certainly wasn't there for. I enjoyed their version of chicken tikka masala. It was lighter, had chunks of tomato in it. I didn't feel super guilty eating it. My husband did not like it as much as the creamier versions. I enjoyed the chicken chili, nice and spicy. First time I ever had chicken chili at an Indian restaurant. 
The restaurant was clean, with newer furniture. 
So anyhow, we will not be back. There are at least two other Indian restaurants in Vegas that my husband and I prefer. 
Check it out if you feel like it, if you don't, no loss.
