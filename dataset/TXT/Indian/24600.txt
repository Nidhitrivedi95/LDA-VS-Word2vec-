H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw This place has the worst customer service. The staff are rude and unwilling to accommodate. We found hair in our food and this was dealt with in an extremely unprofessional manner. The staff accused of it being our own hair...

The food is subpar as well. I will not be returning to this horrendous place. I can't believe they are part of the winterlicious line up...save your money and go somewhere else! See other reviews about hair and insects in the food, it seems this is a recurring problem with this place. Disgusting.
