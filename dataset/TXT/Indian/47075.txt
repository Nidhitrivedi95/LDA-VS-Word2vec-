Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I went here several months ago and forgot to review it. I distinctly remember 3 things:
1) The food was extremely dry and flavorless.
2) At the time, we were the only ones in the restaurant, and the waitress disappeared into the back for so long that eventually I had to go in the bathroom to fill up my water glass.
3) The bathrooms were disgusting, and the rest of the restaurant wasn't much more welcoming. 
I am on the hunt for a great Indian restaurant.
