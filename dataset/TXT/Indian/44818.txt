S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA The place is loc in the middle of a shady strip mall.  We got there and it LOOKS elegant from the inside, but dont be fooled.  The waiter took forever to take our order and took forever to bring us our food, - so Poor service.

The food was so bland and non tasty.  I ordered the meat Thali and it wasnt good at all.  Might as well have starved.  and on top of that it was crazy expensive.  like 15-18 dollar per plate.  I dont wanna pay that much and get nothing back in return.

Im Indian - take it from me - this place SUCKS.
