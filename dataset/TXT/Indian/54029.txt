VqNqJeYvNSv8lkH2EAnLAQ Pleasantly surprised with this little quiet place. Very basic decor but the food was delicious. They respected my lack of taste for food that is too spicy. Food came fast and waitress was very nice. Will definitely return and/or order! The paneer and naan bread was to die for!
