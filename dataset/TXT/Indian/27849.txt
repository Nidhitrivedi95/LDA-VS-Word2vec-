iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w Ancila's is truly a hidden gem. Eating here is like having a personal chef making you some of the best Indian food. Please note though that if you don't make a reservation you will end up waiting. This is because the food is cooked fresh.  Ancila came out and talked with us for a few minutes to get a feeling of our likes and dislikes and then proceeded to cook up a spectacular dinner.  We didn't have a reservation but no one minded the wait. The food is definitely worth it!
