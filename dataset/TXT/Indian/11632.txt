ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ We were the first customer on the day of Christmas eve.. But the service was quick. We ordered spicy chai, Idly vada combo and chilly cheese masala dosa and dahi puri.. Everything was nice. I do recommend. The size of the dosa is too big. Spicy chai is best for getting rid from a headache.
