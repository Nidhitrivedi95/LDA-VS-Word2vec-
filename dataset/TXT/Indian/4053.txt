Debu has moved to the Crown and Tiger Pub on College St. (near Bathurst)!!

We stumbled on Debu's Kitchen by accident thanks to some dear friends of ours who like cheap ($10) pitchers!!!

Debu's food was outstanding. We chose the jackfruit koftas (fried vegetable balls simmered in a creamy sauce) which we've never seen before and had to try. They were amazing. The koftas were tender and the sauce was fragrant, complex and rich and not oily or heavy. We devoured the koftas with some amazing fresh, flaky whole wheat parathas. Mmmmm! We fought over who would get the leftovers the next day! 

This could very well be the best Indian food in the GTA! We're planning a second visit very soon!
