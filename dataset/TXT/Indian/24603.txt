H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw We went to Marigold Bistro for the first time last weekend and we really enjoyed it. The restaurant is quite small, which I like, and the decor was modern. It was a Friday night so it did get busy and I would recommend making a reservation if you're going on a weekend night. We ordered one of the specials, beef tenderloin with a yummy green sauce (not sure what it was exactly... looked like of like a mint pesto yoghurt or something) and the butter chicken with garlic naan and saffron rice. All very delicious!! The butter chicken especially, really good flavours, and the naan was baked perfectly, and the saffron in the rice was special. The service was attentive but still gave us enough space to enjoy our conversation. Who we think is the owner came over and checked on us which was unexpected but very nice, and I think that is always a good sign of someone who cares about their customers and the quality of the experience. I believe he made a point of going to all of the patrons at some point during their meal or afterwards. We will certainly be going back when we next are in the mood for Indian food! The menu isn't overly large but I think that quality over quantity is probably a good tactic and they seem to have specials to change things up for the regulars.
