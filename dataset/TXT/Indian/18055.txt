ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ My boyfriend and I order out from a People's at least once a week. It is a literal 2 minute drive from our apartment so we are all about this place. We've noticed that it can take a little while to get served/food to arrive at the table if you dine in (assuming because of how busy their take out service is) so we tend to opt for take out. I am a vegetarian but my boyfriend is not, so People's is a great choice because of all the options for both of us. I have dreams about their vegetable shai korma, but have had nothing bad to say about any of their food. Spice levels are true to the number you pick and won't arrive unexpectedly hot. People's is a great choice for casual Indian food when you are craving something flavorful and authentic in a short amount of time.
