auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Ate dinner here last night with the family. Prepare to smell spices as soon as you walk in! Excellent food! We had the curry goat and chicken tikka masala. Both were really good. Rice comes separate, but it is very nicely done. For dessert we shared the mango ice cream. It had really awesome flavor, not like any ice cream I've tasted before. Ambiance is pleasant. They've got some pretty good decor. The best part is the Indian pop they play and the accompanying music video. I wish I understood what they were saying as it looked spectacular. Definitely didn't feel pushed out after we were done. They let us chill for a bit afterward. FYI bathroom (single use) was clean and pleasant smelling. That's important! 

I will be going back for the lunch buffet..,it's got everything and I want to try it all...:) recommend the garlic naan with the green parsley sauce!
