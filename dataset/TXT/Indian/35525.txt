MWcN6qLWTfRJqLySxwJNqQ I went here late, around 8pm on a Sunday. It was crowded! The lamb was gone, awww but oh my the kabobs are fantastic. Moist!! Flavorful!! I ordered 3 different combos for take out. Chicken Makhani, Chicken Tikka, Kabob & chicken plate. The red slaw as well as the yogurt sauce accompaniments  were nice. All came with rice. For Makhani it's all about the sauce with bread to dip(for me). You meat eaters may find the chicken was a little sparse although very tasty. Add 3 extra naan, Mango Lassi (delicious), Carrot Halwa (taste very much like the filling of a sweet potato pie), a $46. price tag that fed 5. 

God Willing I'll be back for the lamb, ras malai, more kabobs and saag(spinach)w/ paneer.
