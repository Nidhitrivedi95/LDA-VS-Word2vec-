JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Almost 6 months since my last review and I'm still a fan of Aroma's lunch buffet. The service has been consistently friendly the years I've been coming and the food is still great. This time I tried what I believe is a carrot based dessert that was quite delicious, but not TOO sweet. I also enjoyed my usual favorites: fruit, butter chicken,  a veggie rice Biriyani ( I may be saying this incorrectly), and more. If you , like me, never grew up eating Indian food, give it a try during a buffet so you can sample new things, but not waste. I've really grown to love Indian cuisine's take on the vegetables and meats I already love.
