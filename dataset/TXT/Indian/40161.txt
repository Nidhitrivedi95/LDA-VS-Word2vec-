PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg Let's be clear on this: The Mosque Kitchen is not a restaurant, it's a food court. That's totally fine, of course, I don't mind that at all. The bare and simple style of the place is part of the reason it can be as cheap as it is.

So it's pretty cheap. And that's lovely. For the price you pay here, you get a decent amount of food and a warmish place to sit during the day. It's a shame the food is so-so.

I've only had the "Green curry with mixed vegetables" so far, and it was pretty sad. Some curry sauce with peas and carrots splashed onto a huge bed of bland rice. I had mine with garlic bread (eh. It was fine) but I should definitely have had the "extra vegetable topping" addon instead, because the rice-to-veg ratio was pretty dismal.

The taste of the curry itself was fine, but the lack of any diversity of texture and taste in the veg that came in it meant that I left feeling full but not satisfied.

The price is what keeps Mosque Kitchen up there at the three, as it's difficult to beat that price, but it's such a cheap experience in every other aspect as well that I can't honestly recommend it. It was fine, but if you can afford to go elsewhere, I'd suggest you do.
