LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw We ate Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala. This place is known for their Indian style plate-lunch; meaning 2 or 3 entrees and 1 side. Comes all on one plate. They also offer a small selection of larger single serving entrees which come in 8/16 oz sizes: and, they divide the menu between non-vegetarian and vegetarian. We decided to order a large (16oz) of each dish and 1 side of Naan and 1 side of Pulau. The food was fantastic. I've eaten at a few restaurants across the world and this definitely stacks up. The server seemed very confused that we weren't getting the plate meal and kept warning that it was a lot if food, as this is a new restaurant I'm sure that will wear off as more people order of the other menus. We're definitely going back!
