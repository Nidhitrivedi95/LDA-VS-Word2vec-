1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g I was so incredibly impressed with this place! I can't wait to go back and try more.

It's a little nondescript on the outside and I might have had trouble finding it if I wasn't with a friend who had been there before. It's not the fanciest place in the world and it's on the second level of the building, so you have to walk up a large flight of stairs that does NOT feel like its leading to a restaurant. The layout and decor might be difficult or intimidating for some people, but I promise it's worth it! Get up those stairs.

The menu seemed to be a mix of American-Chinese, Nepalese and Indian food. We started with the chicken momos, which were dumplings served with a very spicy dipping sauce. My friend and I both ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein while our other friend ordered a spicy curry pork dish. I can say hands down it was the best Lo Mein I've ever had in my life. The portions are huge and I'm embarrassed to admit that I still ate the whole thing. I couldn't help myself. Everyone loved their meals and we all cleaned our (very large) plates.

We chatted with the owner, asking for menu recommendations and he was very friendly! I'll definitely be going back here soon!
