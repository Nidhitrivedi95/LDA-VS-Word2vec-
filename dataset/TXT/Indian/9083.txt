82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA I heard lots about this place and finally got my chance to try it out. Food was excellent and the reason for the 4 stars as I found the service was not 5 star. Nan was excellent, butter chicken, lamb etc...all superb. But I hate driving down town and it took ages to find anything becuase I have a SUV. lucky for me I have a friend with a building near by. 
My fave is still on Jarry in Parkex. Just as good half the price with personal service. But If I am in the area I would go back.
