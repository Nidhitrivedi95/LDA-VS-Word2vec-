As other posters here have mentioned, they have a vegetarian thali and meat thali for around $ 9.00 and you get either all vegetarian choices or 2 meat + 1 vegetarian option. Comes with Naan/rice/papadam bread. 

I love their butter chicken and chicken curry but the last few times it was a bit lacking in flavour. I think it's just not as consistent, but that being said, I am rarely disappointed. Great place for take out and if you aren't looking for a thali special, their menu actually has some great options as well. I love their chana samosa!
