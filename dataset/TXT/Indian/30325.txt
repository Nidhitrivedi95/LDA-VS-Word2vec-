Delicious vegetarian Indian food at a decent price only a quarter mile away from my house???

I can't believe this place has been around for a few months and I never noticed it! Almost perfect, a 4.5 star rating which I will round up because I think it may be the best Indian food in the Phoenix area.

The atmosphere is nothing special. Clean and simple. 

Service was good. Attentive and informative. Owner came and talked with us during our meal to welcome us to his restaurant.

We had the palak paneer, one of the crepe things (forgot what its called) filled with potatoes and cheese, and garlic naan.

Everything was delicious and bursting with flavor! Even my carnivore husband was smitten. Our eyes were practically rolling to the backs of our heads. 

My only very minor complaints... serving size of the naan could be a little bigger. They only had one combination dinner but it didn't have a curry in the choices. And being the alcoholic vegetarian I am, I really wish they had a liquor license so I could wash down all this delicious food with a Taj Mahal. 

Otherwise, excellent. I don't know what the bad reviewers were thinking...

Can't wait to try their lunch buffet!
