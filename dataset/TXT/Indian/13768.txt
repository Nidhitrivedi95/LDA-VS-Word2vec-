BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ The food was quite good and the menu had a nice variety.  I leaned more toward the Nepalese choices because it's easy enough to find Indian fare around the city, but Nepalese cuisine is more rare.  Really good.  I guess my main concern is with the slow service.  We ordered drinks (nothing fancy--just a Coke and bottle of beer) and had to wait more than 15 minutes.  And we were the only customers.  Half way through the meal we ordered a single, second drink and more than 10 minutes had passed before I had to get up and remind the wait staff.  Frustrating.  I can understand slower service if the place is really busy, but not when the place has only one table to attend to.
