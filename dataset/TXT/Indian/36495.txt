They have a really cool hand washing machine. But if you have loose rings, be careful not to let them slip into the machine.

I got the Chicken BBQ with white basmati rice, naan, and Tikka Masala dipping sauce that you can also pour over your rice.

It was very tasty overall. The Naan was oiled and sprinkled with salt and cilantro or parsley. Chicken was good, nothing too special.

I also got the Mango Lassi as I usually do at all Indian restaurants. This one had pretty good mango flavor but was a little on the thick side and pre-made and sitting in the fridge so it's not freshly blended. It was good but can't say it was the best.
