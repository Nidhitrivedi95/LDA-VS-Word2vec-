You're not going to get exquisite gourmet, but you will get honest food made fresh (at least every time i've been there). In fact, i'd take some of their dishes over some of the so called "gourmet" Indian restaurants in Toronto. 

They are reasonably priced, and their portion sizes are impressive. My large Kothu Roti was enough to feed at least two people. The owner/staff is also very friendly, and is helpful in explaining the dishes if you're not too familiar with Indian cuisine.
