It was a little more spicy this time and we said we wanted it at a 3 to 4 with a 10 being the hottest. Would hate to see what a 10 would be. I know this is subjective, but just be prepared. Also, the Bistro was filled with Indians with only one other Caucasian couple -- I think that is huge compliment to how good and authentic the food is. I highly suggest the Bistro.
