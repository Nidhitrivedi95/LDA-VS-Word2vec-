HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A This review is for the vegetarian buffet on a Sunday night, priced a little on the high side at $14.25 per person. The polished inside of the restaurant certainly is worth the price though, if the atmosphere is something very important for your meal. Definitely seems like a good place for a more upscale (but still casual) date or business meeting. (That's assuming you can find this place, on the ground floor of an office building without much exterior signage.) The food is decent, but appeared to have been sitting on the buffet trays for a while, understandable given that it was a slow night. For those more particular on tastes, ordering off the menu may be wiser when the place is relatively empty late at night... There were about eight hot dishes on the buffet, plus salad and two soups and fruit and dessert. Popular dishes including chickpeas, lentils, and spinach can fill one's stomach quite quickly!
