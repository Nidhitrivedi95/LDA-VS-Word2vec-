33yClygMVQZb5y9WgOCHLA this review is all about the sunday buffet. in the course of writing this review i'm certain that i will convince myself to go tomorrow.

zam zam is family run, and it's completely wonderful. they only do buffet on sundays so as not to have to serve, you know, buffet food. i think it's $16 but that represents a clear economic win for anyone who eats even one plate.

the dining area of the restaurant is dated and a little shabby, but it feels like home. a few other reviewers have mentioned what a family atmosphere you feel here - i'm with you. great vibes. 

the food is just killer. i've seen my brother eat 10 pieces of their grilled chicken tikka. my mouth is watering as i'm typing this sentence. beef nihari on point. fresh hot naan until you canaan't. i can't believe you get to eat as much as you want at this place!!! what a time to be alive

4 stars since i can only go on sundays because i'm spoiled by the buffet portions
