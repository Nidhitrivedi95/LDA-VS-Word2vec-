TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw The vegetarian dishes was okay. I did enjoy the cabbage dish and I believe it is called Kutu. Anyway, it was fresh and tasty. The vegetables was cooked perfectly right. Not too soggy and still had a fresh crisp at each bite. 

I didn't eat as much, but I was extremely full right away. I wonder if the myth about buffets is true. You know, the myth of putting something in all of the food that makes you full fast so you don't eat as much and waste any food? Well,  my stomach seems to think that the buffet myth applies to India Palace. It feels like I ate a whole roast pig. I just feel awkwardly bloated and full from eating a few vegetarian dishes. 

I am not sure if I would come back, considering that the lunch buffet is $11.99. The waiter also had poor listening skills.  The bill was 
$25.84.  My friend had $20 Cash and I had a card. We told the waiter to bring back $5 in change and put the rest on the card.  Simple enough right? 

He put $20 into the bill and charged $5.84 on the card! Ay yay yay!!
