V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w YUM!  I was here for the first time yesterday.  It is located at the Wells Fargo 3 building right on 2nd street next to the former Ono's.  

They cleaned up the place a bit - the former tenant of this location was famous for his unhygienic ways and sour attitude.  The FIRST thing I asked upon entering was if the new owner was affiliated with the previous one and the nice man said no!  Phew!!

This is a takeout Indian spot - they have several different dishes to choose from (I think they are only open for lunch?  I am not sure....).  

I had the Chicken Tikka Masala yesterday and it was mild - perfect for this inexperienced Indian-Food-Loving palette.  The beautiful rice was plentiful and the nice chef also gave us free tastes of anything we wanted to try.  

The nan was the only letdown.  It seemed prepackaged, as in not freshly made.  But the rest of the food and yogurt sauce was delicious.  I got my food plus a bottle of water for $7 bucks.

Can't wait to get back here!  So glad it is convenient for us uptown workers!!!  :-D
