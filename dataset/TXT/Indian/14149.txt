BZ_j2EpBANxiNA1cBr-b6Q The people working there were so nice, I feel badly giving it only 3 stars - but the wine was undrinkable (gewurztraminer) and our vegetarian dishes were not the best I've had.  We ordered the aubergines, which were differently prepared than I've eaten before but pretty good, and the lentils that had the consistency of split pea soup & lacked flavor.

I almost fell out of my chair at how expensive our meal was, but I'm not from around here & am not accustomed to UK prices yet. 

I appreciated that they were open late, otherwise we would have gone hungry!
