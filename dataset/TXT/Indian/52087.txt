UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I would recommend Taj palace instead. Taj is cheaper not as crowded, food is better, and samosas are included. The one time I went to Mint for the lunch buffet the food trays were mostly empty, the tandoori chicken was all gone, and I had to wait uber long for my Naans at which point I wasn't even hungry anymore. This place is cramped and gets pretty loud and crowded during the lunch buffet hours so don't expect peace and quiet as you enjoy your food. The only good thing is its located in a convenient location near the strip.
