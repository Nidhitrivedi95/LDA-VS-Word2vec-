B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ Three starts are only for the food. They lost 2 stars due to poor customer service . The place wasn't super busy but the service was awfully slow. When we asked a question to the server about a certain dish , she simply she she has no idea. Anyways , I'll always come back here if I'm in Cleveland since this is the only indo chinese place around but I hope the service is better next time.
