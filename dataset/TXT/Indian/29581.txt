jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg LOOOOVE this place!! This was a spur of the moment stop, having seen their Grand Opening banner (while out errand running)! We lucked out with a Saturday lunch buffet and OH MY!!! What a buffet!!! I've never been to a more plentiful-in-selection buffet! Every dish was fantastic! I had to refill TWICE, it was just THAT GOOD!! There were two buffet bars (with offerings on EACH SIDE), along with two soups and two specialty beverages. The dining room was open and airy and service was superb!
