-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g I came here for an early lunch with a friend, and boy was I surprised. Fellow Yelpers, you did me well. They have a lunch buffet that lasts until 2:30, and they even offered us champagne or mimosas included in the buffet price. A little early for alcohol, I declined; though a very nice touch. 

Their lunch buffet is very thorough for Indian cuisine. Although I'm not the Indian food expert, I know they had dishes like tandoori chicken, samosas, a few different curries, lamb and plenty of other options including fresh fruit and if I can remember correctly a salad. They also have spiced rice available and garlic naan that is served hot to your table. Make sure to ask for the naan though, as it is made to order versus being out at the buffet. 

My favorite of their items was one of the yellow curries, the samosas, and the spiced rice. Their tandoori chicken was also really good, but I feel like I've had better at similar mom and pop Indian restaurants. 

The service was stellar. You could tell that the gentleman serving us really did care about the/his business. And that's what really goes far in the restaurant industry. I will most definitely return for unlimited Indian food at around $11 or so a plate.
