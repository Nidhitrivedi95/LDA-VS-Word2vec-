B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Great northern Indian food. Outstanding take out and dine in many options. Authentic and homestyle Indian food like mom would make! Highly recommend the chicken tikka and paneer tikka as well as any of their tandoori dishes and appetizers are good also. Wide variety of meat chicken vegetarian options for all courses.
