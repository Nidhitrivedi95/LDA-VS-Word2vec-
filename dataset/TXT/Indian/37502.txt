OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A had Sunday dinner with friends. make sure you reserve, its a tiny restaurant with bunch of Indian food fans.

tons of choice in menu with good explanation, Thali (taste-all plate) good deal, careful service as if we were their family member, dark mysterious atmosphere, and of course, delicious food!

my lamb yogurt curry was soooo good. definitely going back soon, to try that extremely low table with sitting down on the floor next time?:)
