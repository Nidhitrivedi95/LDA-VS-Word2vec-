svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w Great for many important reasons - most noteabley authenticity and price.  

For well under $20 you can get a full dinner and an entire day's worth of samoas, vidai's, mango balls, spinach rolls ect.

Owners are incredibly kind and helpful in this family run establishment.  Many dishes heavily spiced. 

There is great value and great authentic interesting food here.  Its not fancy but is such a refreshing change to the butter chicken/channa marsala type-places that are everywhere.
