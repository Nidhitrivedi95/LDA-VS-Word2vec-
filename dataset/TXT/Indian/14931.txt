cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg It took me 90 minutes to travel one way on driving/TTC to have lunch buffet ($11.99) at Kathmandu! And it better worth it! And yes I have a good filling spicy lunch that put a smile in my face! 

The buffet selections may not be huge.. don't expect to be at a Chinese buffet or a Japanese AYCE when there are 50 items for you to pick from. Here we are talking about quality not quantities. 

All the food were all tasty, spicy and fresh... Yes spicy enough that I don't need any hot sauce and so delicious that I start having bits of food on my face and everywhere... Sorry for my friend that was eating with me, I hope I did not splash some of the sauce in his face! 

Lunch Buffet only serves from Monday to Saturday, so for me it will be another painful TTC trip if I want to come down again! But I am IN if my friend says let's do it!
