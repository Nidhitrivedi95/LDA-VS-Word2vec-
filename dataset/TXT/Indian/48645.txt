tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg We won't going back to even though the food and service were very good and decor was pleasant. Why? The music they played. Children's voices singing in English "I am a child of Allah. I'm so glad I'm a Muslim. I'm glad I'm not an infidel, Infidels go hell.." Seriously. I'm fairly open minded and tolerant, I've dined in restaurants with images of Hindu gods, Sikk gurus, Buddha, "Allah" written in Arabic script (and even a restuaurant that has statues from 3 different religions in it including the Virgin Mary) - this is all fine. However, being called an infidel and told I'm going to hell crosses the line for me. You don't insult your customers like this. This hellbound infidel will take her infidel dollars to establishments that don't tell me I'm going to hell.
