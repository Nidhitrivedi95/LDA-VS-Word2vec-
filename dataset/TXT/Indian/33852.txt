LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng My new go-to for delectable Indian food.  My favorites were the curry chicken and the appetizer that had avocado in it.  The naan was outstanding as well.  My only suggestion would be for the wait staff to not to forget to put their customer service smiles on before they clock in.
