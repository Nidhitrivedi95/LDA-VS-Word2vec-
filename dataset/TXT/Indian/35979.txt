nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ My family seems to love this place. We end up there a couple of times a year to celebrate various family birthdays. Our most recent visit was a few weeks ago on a busy Saturday night. 

It has changed in a very pleasant way in the last few years with many upgrades to the main restaurant area. I will say that their buffet area could be better spaced or laid out to allow for a better traffic flow. I understand getting more bodies in means more dollars, but there is something to be said for customer comfort. I think their entrance area could use a bit of rejigging as well, simply because dine in, take out and sweet customers are all paying there. It always ends up in confusion. 

The food is very good though. For my dad, who was actually born in India, it is the most authentic in terms of the flavour of their curries. He loads up on anything goat or lamb based.
For the rest of us, we are big fans of the fresh naan and dosa. I could go there and only eat those two things. As long as I could have the carrot halva for dessert. It is so sweet, buttery and decadent in terms of its flavour. I'm trying to cut back on sweets but I could not resist a bowl of that delicious orange mess. 

Service is spotty at best. Mostly staffed by moody looking teenagers and young adults. I mean, just bring me my naan, whats with the attitude?
