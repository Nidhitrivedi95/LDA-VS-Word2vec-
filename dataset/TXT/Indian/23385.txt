gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Honestly this is the best Indian food I've had aside from homemade! This was the first restaurant I went to on moving to Vegas. Service was so wonderful. We went in for dinner although they do have a lunch buffet which I definitely plan on going to. We had the owner as our host who recommended their 4-course (I think) special. Came with papadums, chicken appetizers, a sampler selection of entrees, and pistachio ice cream. After talking with the owner and getting to know him he let us try the rice pudding which was absolutely wonderful too. The place was almost packed within 30 minutes of opening, and for good reason!
