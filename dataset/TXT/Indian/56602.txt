xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg Decent Indian buffet but could be improved. On the positive side, the server was super friendly. The dishes are spicier than at most Indian restaurants which tend to water things down for us Americans. I really liked their version of chanamasala. Good flavor for most of the curries. 

Things to improve on:
- Buffet items not kept hot enough.
- The rice used is of poor quality, short or broken grains and dry. Really missed fluffy hot basmati rice.
- No Indian desserts. No kheer or gulabjamen.

We gave it a try as it is close by but would rather drive further to get a better overall experience in Indian buffet.
