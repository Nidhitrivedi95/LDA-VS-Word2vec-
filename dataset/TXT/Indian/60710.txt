zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q 2.4 Stars. I love Afghan Food and was really looking forward to eating here. Maybe I got the wrong thing. Got the lamb kabab with rice and salad. Really disappointed in the lack of flavor. The portion was large enough but ended up being 6 pieces of meat and about 2 lbs of rice. I'll give it another chance at some point, hard to find Afghan food in AZ.
