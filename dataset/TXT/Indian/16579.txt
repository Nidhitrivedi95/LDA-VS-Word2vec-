We've frequently driven by but never stopped.  One day we decided to visit for lunch.  The space is small but cozy.  Service was efficient.  I had the channa masala with naan.  The channa came in a deceptively small looking copper pot which actually held a lot of food.  It was nicely flavoured and the medium spice level was just right.  The naan was fresh from the oven, huge and thankfully grease free.  

Mr leny had the meat thali which he said was delicious and very filling.  

There seemed to be a good selection of veg and non-veg options at fair prices.  We will be definitely be back to try other menu items.
