hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Northwest Durango Location- iloved it. It is a bit pricey for take out- but I went in there with zero expectations. I had no idea what to order, and just told the gentleman that I was ordering for my husband and I, what did he recommend. He gave me the chicken masala and a lamb dish. Medium heat. Holy chow were they delish. So with that being said, I would go back again.
