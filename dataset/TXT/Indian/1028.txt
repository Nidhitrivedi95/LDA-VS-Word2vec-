-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw Worst service ever. Owner thinks that he gives free food. His attitude is like he is  a master chef. I ordered biryani from them and ask them to make less spicy 3 times.  He totally ignored it and gave me shitty stuff. I have to feed that to old parents so they can enjoy but bawarchi just ruined it. Not recommended it all..
