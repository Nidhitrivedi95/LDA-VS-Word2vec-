DxbdfvNYPCyiLJDDPJK3Tg At first I wanted delivery but once they told me that I needed a min order of $30 I was like hmmm let me think about this. I had already picked what I wanted and read the yelp reviews which usually doesn't lead me wrong so I did it I went out to the place. Glad I did. 
The place itself is nothing to write home about. Like other post says they have plastic ones like you would use at a party. Lots of table can't really get a theme.
Other than that the food was great ... flavorful. I had the Manchuria chicken with gravy and the fish and black bean sauce. Soo good and they give u lots and lots of food. This meal could feed a family of 4. I took most of it home. I could not believe how much meat there was. Can't wait to have my left overs.
