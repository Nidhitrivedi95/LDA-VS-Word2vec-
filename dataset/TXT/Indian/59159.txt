yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug This place is not that great. We came here thinking the food will be as good as the Riviera location but it wasn't and actually made some people in our group sick. We came in for their lunch buffet on a Sunday expecting the same quality food as their other S. Vegas blvd restaurant. The goat curry was good and thats about the only thing I liked from here. The rest of the curries were mediocre and just tasted like the cooks just werent on their A game that day. I dont know if i would try them again. I think next time i'll just go to the India Masala in the Riviera.
