If you are considering eating here and its a toss up between here and somewhere else in the area, GO HERE. I was curious about this place and after trying it for the first time today I can honestly say that I cannot wait to go back and try more things! My mom and I ordered a few meatless dishes and we did not for a second miss the meat. Everything was SO flavorful! Service and atmosphere were also on point. 

Only reason I am giving it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the no tipping policy. The server explained why their system is fair and while I understand the system and acknowledge that it is technically fair, I myself am a server and so I would have liked to have been able to leave extra if I wanted to. 

Apart from that though, excellent restaurant. I am excited to bring my boyfriend...and just about everyone else I know who appreciates good food. Don't sleep on this place. It's absolutely worth it.
