Vu_BoGOSL70odzqCBr_vIg Yes, service could be better but this is legit Indian street food. I had samosa chaat, pav bhaji and dahi badha. Everything tasted delicious.

It was $19 tax in, which is not bad at all. I would recommend! 

Come on guys, it's been open for 6 months and I think we can cut them some slack for service. This is definitely a family run business!
