KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Trinity restaurant in a random quiet Plaza in Mississauga, just on the edge of Brampton.

I got there just before 1 p.m. on a quiet Saturday but within another 30 minutes the place was packed.  I have the loaded fries. It was incredible. Very tasty. My friend who doesn't like to try different in you Foods had the punjab burger and she really enjoyed it.

They had 90's hip hop and R&B playing which was super cool.

The food was pretty reasonably priced for what it is.  

The cheesecake Samosa was not that great. Maybe if it had more cheesecake in it and if it was sweeter.

Unfortunately the meat is not halal.... *sad face.  Maybe that will change one day.
