2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw It's really busy here. The line-up order/pay process is awful. People mainly come here for the samosas and sweets. 

It is a "restaurant," but it's food is alright and somewhat cold. I have not tried their sweets.

The samosas, however, are pretty good for the PRICE. Warm, reasonably sized and packed well with food. A bit oily. At five samosas for $1, it is very good. For the samosas themselves, I would give four stars, possibly five. The price may be influencing my taste buds.
