8KS7wFnRxtCS_B-TD5WLSg I would have to say that the inside was very nice and the service was good as well. 

The food was pretty poor, Chicken Tikka was ok, Seehk Kabab dry as a damn bone, Vindaloo was not spicy Fish Masala was good. 

I was rather surprised by the quality of the food as i have heard good things about Bombay Bhel. 

Oh well.
