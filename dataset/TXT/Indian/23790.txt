gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Wow!! We come down to Vegas from LA atleast once a year, and I'm surprised how did we miss this place all this while!!

The Food - Quality is beyond expectations, we called for a great meal ranging from paneer chili to yellow daal.  Each dish was flavorful and enticing for our taste buds, if you have the urge for something spicy and zestful the chicken chili is a must have!! 

The Service - Prakash, the owner/Manager does a wonderful job from greeting you when you enter to making sure the food arrives before your stomach growls for the second time! The other staff was on point too!!! 

Definitely a must visit!
