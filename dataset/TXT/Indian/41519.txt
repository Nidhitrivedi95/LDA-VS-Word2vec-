Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Woe is me, what took me so long to discover this place? And to think, all the times that I've craved Indian food, Maharaja was just a short drive away...

My friend and I ordered the chicken tikka masala (mild), the fish curry (medium), and the regular naan. Our entrees came with a side of rice and a complementary flatbread appetizer served with tamarind sauce and two types of chutney (onion and cilantro). While the portions are small, the food is very filling - probably on account of all the carbs! :P

As for our dishes, the chicken was a little tough, but otherwise well-seasoned. I really enjoyed the creamy tomato base, and I was glad that I ordered it mild instead of medium because the medium fish curry was REALLY spicy. I was a huge fan of the battered catfish cooked in a garlic/ginger sauce, but I could only take so much heat. :( 

Service was impeccable. Our water glasses were always filled quickly and plates were cleared off the table as soon as we were done with them. The staff continually circulated by to see how we were enjoying the meal and seemed genuinely interested in any feedback we had about our dining experience.

Just an FYI, the online menu is a little outdated. I wanted to order the chana masala but it wasn't an option on the restaurant menu. Fortunately, you really can't go wrong with any of the curries or masalas! Give 'em a try! :)
