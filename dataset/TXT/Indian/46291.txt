This time I decided to give the butter chicken roti a try on the medium spicy setting as on the last outing the medium spicy was enjoyable but paired with the volcanic roti temperature was almost too much for me to handle. Perhaps I'm a sucker for punishment.  

The roti arrived in the same tin container with the same plastic cutlery and I tore into it with the same ravenous zeal.  This time however I was even more underwhelmed.  The butter chicken was just okay.  Although the chicken was sufficiently moist the butter sauce was not very buttery.  As well there was a large quantity of potato in the mix.  From my experience butter chicken usually consists of chicken cubes and butter sauce.  That's what I've grown accustom to and like.  This recipe is clearly a cost-cutting measure and really detracts from the butter chicken appeal.

The roti itself did not fair well during it's trip from the store to the table.  The top was fine but the bottom absorbed a lot of moisture and got quite soggy.  It was a bit off-putting but overall the roti still tasted quite nice.  Another unanticipated side effect of the 30 minute journey was that the temperature reduced considerably so it didn't burn my mouth this time.  However, the medium spicy was not of the same level as last by a significant margin.  Perhaps curry is more spicy than butter chicken but I would have expected it to be at least in the same ballpark.  

So the search continues for the perfect roti.  Next stop, based on Kat F.'s review, is Mother India.
