LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA It's gone down one star and let me tell you why. 

1. I wanted to order a uthapam , wanted to replace the mozzarella cheese with paneer (Indian cottage cheese), the server said no, after literally arguing with him for 5 minutes, he said it will be $4 extra. 

Not for something extra, just a replacement. He could have said it in the beginning, I would have gladly paid for it. 

Service had gone down a lot. 

2. They charge you for extra chutney which is not very common in south Indian restaurants. Even after charging. 50 cents the portion of chutney we got was ridiculous. It was may be one tablespoon. 

Will go there again but if the service remains the same then I might just stop.
