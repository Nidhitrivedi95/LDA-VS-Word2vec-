v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug I love the variety of Northern and Southern Indian food here and while you might question the quality of the range that they offer...so do I. I'm still wondering if I like it. 

The Chicken Tikka Masala was a bit dry which offered a small dish of some floating chicken cubes.  I was expecting a larger portion for the price that was attached to it, but it failed to match my expectations. Too demanding? I think not. 

Once I saw that they had dosas I knew I had to have one. I got the Kheema Dosa and expected something very different than what came. It was rolled in this long tube that didn't even fit on the plate where only the middle part of the tube of dosa was filled. I don't know how long it sat in it's own grease but it was a while, the whole bottom of the dosa was soaked.  Still, it was a dosa, so I ate it. 

I would still go here though, for the dosas. FOR THE DOSAS.
