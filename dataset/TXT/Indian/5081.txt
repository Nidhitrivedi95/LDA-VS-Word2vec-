2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw Love the decor and the homely feel to the place. My mother was in the mood for some Indian food and had been eyeing this place the past few weeks as we drive down Queen Street on our way to work daily, and this place always catches our eyes due to the interesting name. 

We walked in and the place was phenomenally empty. Due to that, we were hesitant but the woman working there made us feel welcome and seated us, presenting the menu promptly. While I found the portions to be rather small for what they are priced at, the food was still very delicious. The emptiness and silence however made it uncomfortable for us to freely talk about our day and personal matters, as one can freely do in more busier - louder - atmospheres without feeling judged or eavesdropped on alas, that was probably our own fault for deciding to come on a weekday and that too, in the afternoon. 

Overall, cute place and lovely staff. Would I return? Probably, on a more busier note. :)
