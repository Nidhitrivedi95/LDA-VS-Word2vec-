cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg Came here for a birthday dinner with a party of 14. Took up almost half the restaurant. Despite our huge number of people, the wait staff (3 of them) were very attentive and helpful. Wait for food was quite normal.

My friend and I split the 'feast' for one, as we were told it was quite a lot of food for one person. It included Naan, rice (which we declined for more Naan), Tandoori Chicken, Kebab, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Prawn, and a choice of Curry. Plus dessert!

The Kebab was okay, the 2 chickens were quite dry though. The goat curry we ordered was good though. Very rich! Price wise, all the entrees are approx 12-14. Our feast was 21 bucks though.
