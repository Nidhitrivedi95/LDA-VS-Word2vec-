J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Service : ok (one waiter was very helpful, polite and responsive, other waiter had to be reminder couple of times)

Place : ok (nothing too fancy, fairly good ambiance, A/C working overtime - most people wearing jackets)

Prices : ok (around $25 per pers. with a beer)

Food : Below average (meet was too dry, butter chicken was probably the most indifferent I have tried, veggies the same, best thing were the appetizers)

Overall: if you are hungry and passing by, why not, drop in. If you think of making reservation better try something else. We had left overs and did not bother to take them home. (I could only comment on the a la carte menu)
