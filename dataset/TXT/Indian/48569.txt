TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA Among the best Pakistani food in town!! Their Barbeque and Curries both are delicious and especially they are famous for their Milky Nans.

We went as a group of 12 and ordered Chicken Karahi, Nihari, Beef Seekh Kababs, Reshmi (Chicken) Kababs, Gola Kababs, Biryani and Naans. We wanted the Chapli Kababs but there weren't any available. 

It's self serve and they give you papers with the limited menu printed on it, there aren't much varieties but that kinda limits you the best. 

The food was delicious and does have the Authentic Pakistani Taste especially the Karahi and Nihari. The Biryani was good but not great! As for the Barbeque, that was great as well. The Naans were the best, one could have them just by themselves! (However if you do take out, the Naans won't be the same, that freshness will be lost)

One drawback is the quantity, it is less and hence you end up ordering more which then adds to the cost. For a group of 12+ children, the amount was pretty high. 
Also that the seating is limited and the area is small !

All in All Great Food and Experience !
