wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw We decided to try an Indian place in Scottsdale and where pleasantly surprised. The service here was a little long, but when we got the did we understood why. They put love and skill into making the food here. The food here is fresh and aromatic. Our waiter was also really nice.
They've only been here a month and I hope they maintain the quality of their food as they grow their business.
