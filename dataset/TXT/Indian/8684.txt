7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA When it comes to Indian food, I definitely eat with my eyes first because I like everything, I don't know the names of the dishes, and I can't just choose one dish so I also prefer buffets.

I was actually on my way to explore another restaurant when I came upon Aroma and decided to try it. As I walked up the stairs, the smell of the food opened my appetite and I was anxious to dig in.

Their lunch buffet (13.99) wasn't very big but they had most of the popular dishes. The butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, tandoori chicken, beef rogan josh, curry goat, they were all good. As tasty as it was, I could only manage to have two plates before I was stuffed. Good food.

My big disappointment, however, was dessert. Their ice cream freezer was only half full, with four tubs, and they were all practically empty. I didn't see any fruits either so I skipped dessert.

Other than the lack of desserts, it wasn't a bad overall experience. Good food, good service.
