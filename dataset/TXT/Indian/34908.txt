Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Not a friendly reception , You have to prepay . When you ask  how many items in the buffet , the answer is "Lots of items" with a eye on the credit card.  You don't even know what you are paying for. The food tastes like its been cooked a long time before.

Not a good selection of the buffet menu.
