So after the initial price shock we decided to go for it and I must say the food is excellent. The butter chicken was amazing, the Aloo ghobi was great and even the dessert - eton mess was outstanding (it should be for $9 LOL) 
The service was very good too. 
Bottom line, if price is not a factor and you want a good, delicious Indian food, pukka is definitely the place.
