tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I had always wanted to try real Indian food and thought I would give this place a try because of all the great reviews and I am glad I did. Now, I don't really know what good Indian food is, but I know that this place has good food. I enjoyed the different meat dishes, but really fell in love with the various vegetarian dishes. Also, the garlic naan was hot and delicious as was the tangy tandori chicken that they served to our table.  

As we were dining, a lady (possibly owner?) checked up on us multiple times and even walked me over to the buffet to explain the dishes to me. I am definitely a fan of this place because for one, the food is delicious and two, they have great customer service.
