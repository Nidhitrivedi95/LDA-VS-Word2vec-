XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Had the saag paneer roti. HUGE and not too bad tasting...just wish it had more obvious Indian spices. Sort of lacking those quintessential flavors for me. The potatoes inside it were bland so every time I got a bite with one in it, it sort of ruined it for me. 
The server was lovely though and the place was quiet and rather peaceful to sit and eat in. I'll definitely give it a try again and order something else.
