It was okay... and cheaper than other places at $9.99. But I think I would pay the extra few dollars and go a block over to Mint in a heart beat. Yes the buffet takes up length wise over half the restaurant, but what I didn't care for about this place was that it lacked variety - you have the standard Tandoori chicken, Tikka Masala etc.  But maybe it was a busy day before I got there giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I had to fish around in the sauce to find pieces of chicken and not only in the tikki masala but any dish which contained sauce and meat. Don't get me wrong I love sauce, but I like to find that there is ample meat to accompany my sauce. 

Also, there was something about the ambience that felt cold - maybe it was the poor acoustics which made it feel very big and open but not in a good way or the just the set up but somehow the dining room was not overly inviting. Although, that in itself is not something that would normally concern me - hey if the food is superb I'll eat it sitting on a street corner (as used to be the case with Viva Las Arapas before they moved). Nonetheless, I thought it is something that should be noted. 

Service was average, nothing outstanding. We did request garlic naan and they brought it. My friend asked for lemon wedges for water, they forgot, had to ask again and then they brought a plate of lime wedges from the salad bar.. maybe they don't have lemons? 

On the upside I got a free Mango Lassi which was tasty with Yelp check in - so thank you Delhi Indian Cuisine for that treat. So overall I wish them good luck and I hope that they make it as I do with all restaurants that are not chains but unfortunately I am going to stay loyal to Mint for lunch buffet, and Mt. Everest as a second choice.
