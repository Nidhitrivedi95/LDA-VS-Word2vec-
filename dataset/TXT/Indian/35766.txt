nAnpTnodDchSl9H0f6R2pw We were drawn into this cozy unpretentious restaurant quite accidentally.
We were out for a walk one evening and an incredible fragrance peaked our interest 
and our appetite,
We were surprised and pleased to discover that the food both in quality and taste didn't disappoint.
It was fresh and unique and the best Indian  food that we've tasted in a very very long time.

The attention to detail was exemplary. Our server was warm helpful and enthusiastic.

I don't usually write reviews but I want to let others know about Bhoja so that it doesn't remain a secret.
Do yourself a favour and give it a try.
