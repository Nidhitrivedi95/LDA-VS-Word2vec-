c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg Not worth the buffet for 13.99. The buffet refills took so long that we did not eat most of the items. The cook was catering to the people who order off the menu and the buffet was refilled at the end. It took for ever to get even the water. Would avoide buffet. May be food is food if you order off the menu!
