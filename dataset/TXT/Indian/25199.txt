HF-fLG3QaNepY151QKDNLA this place was horrible. the food was oily, the service sucked, the lights are dim in this place..the place was dirty. Trying to order our food was a task..they couldn't understand the word CURRY. My friend and I ordered same thing and I was charge more. The food ended up in the garbage. Think twice before going in this rate infested place.
