ro-4-3USXvGKnp07BrxSKg Menu is grossly misleading. More than half of the items listed in menu aren't available most of the times. The so called special biriyani seems to be too special. It is never available. Even simplest snack items are not available most of the times. There's no point looking at the menu online or at the restaurant to order. I'd rather have people saying what's available like in the old times.
