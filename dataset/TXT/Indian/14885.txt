cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA No, never again. We came on a Groupon coupon with a reservation on a Sunday night. The heating was obviously broken and four little heaters struggled to keep themselves warm.

Agonizingly slow service. One appetizer, one main dish and a prepared dessert took OVER two hours. The single waitress, nice as she was, allowed no walk-ins at all. Everyone without a reservation was asked to "come back another night" even though less than 1/3 of the tables were occupied. She must have know about their poor service - and said, 

"This is quite normal for us, I am used to being stressed."

The food may have been good, but that pleasure was totally negated by the total slowness of service in the ice cold restaurant. (TWO HOURS) One couple didn't stay for the main dish, they left after about one hour.  We should have left earlier too.

The whole place screamed inattention. Broken and wiggly tables and chairs. Loose tape around the windy street front door, no paper of any kind in the men's bathroom and an abject lack of ventilation in the bathroom area. 

Yuck.
