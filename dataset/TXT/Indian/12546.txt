AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw Funny enough i always went out to the west end to grab samosas or way back around Gerard/Coxwell.

Who would have known that the best samosas were so close to me. Brought them as an appetizer to a barbeque in the east end and everybody went nuts over them.

Checked out a couple more flavors while i waited and they have some pretty tasty choices on their 10 flavors list

Having Samosas so good so close though can be a bad thing like they say "Once on the lips Twice on the lips" or in my case Belly! LOL

It's always great to find those hidden Jems and this one is worth checking out
