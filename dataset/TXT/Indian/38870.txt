OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I've tried many Indian restos in Arizona, this was the first in Nevada and it beat them all. Its so good that it feels pure Indian especially the Garlic Naan and Butter Chicken, heaven. The buffet is the best with a variety of options including traditional Indian-style Okra and delicious Tandoori Chicken. Also tasty and hot Gulab Jamuns seal the deal at the end. The restaurant usually has offers on Yelp. Make sure you starve before you visit this place so you can eat as much Indian goodness as you can with a very affordable buffet.
