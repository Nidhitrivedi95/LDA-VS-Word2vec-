kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g I loved the idea of choosing from a variety of Indian sauces to create your own dish with meat and veggies of your choice! We had lamb, chick peas, and broccoli in the korma sauce on top of basmati rice and washed it down with iced Indian tea. Yum! The only disappointment was the gajar ka halwa, which isn't the same without ghee.
