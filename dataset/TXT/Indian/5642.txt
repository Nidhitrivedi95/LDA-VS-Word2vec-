3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg We HIGHLY recommend Indian Hero which we have been buying from consistently for 2 years. Everything is home made so allow time as it's worth it! We order ahead so we can run in to pick up. Family run business with excellent, friendly service. My husband loves Indian food so for his birthday party I ordered butter chicken, jasmine rice and garlic naan and it was a huge hit. When the family knows we are having Indian Hero, they all show up! You can choose your level of spice. Garlic Naan - order more than you think you need as it goes fast... We will not order from anyone else.
