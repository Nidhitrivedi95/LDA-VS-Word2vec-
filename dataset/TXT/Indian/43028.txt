rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA La Sani Grill is a good place for lunch. Yes lunch specials from $3.99 includes a bottle water or a can of pop!!

I like the way it is set up. Kind of like a mix of food court and sit down restaurant but no tips is neccessary. Just to to the counter and place your offer and they will have the food deliver to your table. 

The Butter Chicken and Naan/side salad ($6.99) tasted great! The Naan bread is made freshly and still hot, tender and full of texture and flavour. It tasted so good to be dip in and eat with the Butter Chicken sauce. The chicken breast has been marinated first then grilled, (I can tasted the smokey flavour) and cooked in makhni sauce and garnished with white butter, fresh cream and fenugreek leaves. The chicken is really tender and the sauce is not spicy when I was eating it. But I can feel it is burning in my stomach afterwards!

The great thing about eating here is all the food are serve on real plate and cutley... not foam plate or plastic forks/knives!

There are over 13 choices for lunch specials, I will definitely be back to try out others on the menu!

They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac.
