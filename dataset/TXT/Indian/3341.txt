0IBYsSMQ9WY605m0yidgYA I endured a Buffet Lunch at the Club India on Lothian Rd. Edinburgh. the food was pathetic, most eateries use the lunch as an inviting picture of what could be had if you go for dinner, but Club India destroy this conception. With two meat and two veg mains, nothing else, some Naan bread for 50p a tiny round.


 Service was adequate and decor not to shabby, but these are to be expected as this is fairly new.


 I fully understand why they have put up there prices, as no one goes.


 Lesson learned.
