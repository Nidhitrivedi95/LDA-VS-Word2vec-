VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg This place is alright. But the food is really inconsistent. Some times the Chicken Tikka Masala is really good, sometimes it's kinda meh. Sometimes there are lots of onions and pepper in it, sometimes not. Sometimes the Butter Chicken tastes kind of metallic and the tomato flavor is overpowering, sometimes it's alright. I have to really be craving Indian in order to play the taste roulette game here. 

It's also a bit pricey because none of the dishes come with rice. So you really have to order two different things to eat one meal.
