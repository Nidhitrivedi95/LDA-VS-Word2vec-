_H2Q4Y4aosi-svXyfZIaIw Over-priced and over hyped. The owner's wife is rude. They are charging ya 8 dollars plus tax for a damn falooda. 8 dollars for the plate of Dahi bhalla.  On top of that, they have all semi-nude DESI songs or award shows on the TV 24/7 which at times very inappropriate when you are sitting with the family. The place is very dirty and dingy. They rip you off. I don't recommend this place.
