Uyw1pJ03kt-I1B_tkA3aFg Had the Aloo Gobi. It was very good. The coriander really sets it off nicely. The veggies were just a little on the soggy side but I did have about a 15 minute drive home. I am a vegetarian and there was a piece of chicken in the meal despite the fact it is a vegetarian dish. It was easy to see and not eat. Not the biggest deal. I am looking forward to going back but will mention the meat restriction explicitly next time.
