9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w Bombay Bhel is one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Mississauga.  When I used to live there, I would go and order from there all the time! Their bhel puri is my favorite.  Their veggie biryani is okay.  I also discovered my love for muttar paneer (the green pea and cottage cheese curry) here.  The staff are always welcoming.  The places is clean, has a cool feel to it, with low lighting and Hindi music playing softly in the background.  I can't wait to come back here to munch on  some good old naan!!
