iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw REALLY wanted to love this place and add it to my list of regulars because it's so close to where I lived but maybe not. 

Desi Burrito has a very similar concept to Chipotle but with an Indian twist to it! You have the option of picking either a burrito or a bowl then would would select your type of rice, protein, and sauce. 

I went with a chicken chilli burrito with a side of vegetable samosa and masala fries! The burrito is basically chicken curry + rice wrapped in a tortilla. I was sad to see my burrito to fall apart after taking a bite because the tortilla ripped. As much as I love messy burritos, I'd rather not have my food explode in front me. (If that was the case, I would have ordered a bowl instead). Taste-wise, it was oooOoookay. Personally, I thought it was lacking flavor. The vegetable samosa, on the other hand, was amazing!! The two sauces (one sweet and one spicy) were great additions to it that made it more enjoyable. I ended up using the sauces to add flavor to my burrito. The fries were very pungent but strangely addictive! The portions were great, I basically had enough leftovers for another meal. 

You can either dine by their blimp-styled truck or you can order through the drive-thru. My friend and I were considering eating there but considering the 100+ weather in Vegas during the summer, we decided to take it to go. But any other time, this spot would be a cute place to eat with plenty of photo opps with their very bright, bold exterior design. 

HUGE shout-out to them for offering vegetarian and gluten-free options! It's always nice to see places with those options. Will be back, probably just for the samosas (':
