CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A I went here because of good reviews, but the food is recycled, it was bearly warm, so I would say it was the buffet leftovers. Because of that I would have expected athe portions to be more generous at least to justify the 12.00 a plate and 2.50 for naan, I tell you they are very stingy even w white rice. Thats probably why only three tables were filled on a Friday night, I thought these people were buisness smart, DONT THEY KNOW AMERICANS LOVE BIG PORTIONS, they eat big portions, but I guess some people are stingy and their wallet is more important.
