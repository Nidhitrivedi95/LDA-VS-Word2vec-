jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg Went to the best new (4mo)Indian resturant last night. Incredible menu and if you are Vegan or vegatarian they have a HUGE selection.  Spicy, flavorful and well presented. Mom and Pop shop, young couple. I have been to many Indian resturants and the food here was one of the best. I think they have buffet style at lunch . The prices  are very reasonable. We need to support a fine restuant like this, the previous Indian resturant in the same spot did not make it but the food was not as good. I give this 5 stars.
 Haldi Masala 7475 mineral  point rd  next to Pier one on mineral point rd. Go and enjoy. We took our grandson for his 21st birthday and he loved it. Authentic is the best word for it. The only negative is trying to figure out what to order there are so many wonderful things. We will have to go back. No choice.
