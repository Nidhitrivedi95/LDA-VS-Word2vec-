yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I ate here for lunch today, but ordered a dinner entree and I couldn't be happier.  I've been to a lot of the valley's indian joints, and I can unequivocally state that this is the best indian food I have ever eaten.  The dishes are inspired and, most importantly, delicious.  I had a spicy green chile naan and lamb cooked with spinach and flavored with freshly ground ginger, garlic and spices.  My buddy had a spicy chicken dish marinated with exotic spices and combined with vinegary potatoes.  There was an ice cream desert that we didn't have room for but sounded awesome: Dhaba ice cream made with a unique blend of milk, almonds, pistachio, cardamom and saffron.

The atmosphere is great too, nice seating area, copper plates & cups.  Large wooden tables.  I felt like royalty.  Also, the plethora of beautiful Indian women is a powerful digestif.
