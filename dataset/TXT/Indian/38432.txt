What really made this place a standout was the courteous service and how well I was received by Mr. Bhushan, one of the managing owners.  I came in a little after 10pm one night because I had gotten out of a late work group meeting, was hungry, and the mood struck me while I was passing by on Paradise.  I asked if it was too late to place an order and if it would have to be carry-out.  Mr. Bhushan overheard and intervened.  He came over and told me that if I wanted to place an order and dine-in, he would make sure the kitchen got it out quickly and that I was more than welcome to stay, especially since the restaurant still had to be closed up properly and prepared for the next day anyhow.  

I didn't feel rushed at all, and the food came out quickly with no sacrifice to the quality of the dishes.  While I was eating, he even checked up on my and made sure everything came out to my liking and thanked me for stopping by.  This level of courtesy and service makes this establishment stand out very much, and I'm telling you I eat at Indian restaurants several times a month.
