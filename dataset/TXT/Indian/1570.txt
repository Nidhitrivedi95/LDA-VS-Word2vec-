-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Ok, After a long time I did visit Chutneys and here is my observation.

1. This review is only for A-la-carte menu (dinner). - Quality seems to have improved definitely. Not sure about their buffet

2. Anjani is definitely customer centric. All the indian restaurants need to take a leaf out of his book on how to treat customers. He didnt know that I was the guy who left a 1 star review, but in general he was courteous with all the guests including our table.

3. The paneer butter masala was a tad sweet, the other vegetable korma (in a spinach sauce) was rich with cashews mixed in.

4. The 4 star review is mostly for Anajani's customer service and a visible improvement in the quality of service.

If you can hold up to this level of service and up your ante in buffet, you will return to your glory.
