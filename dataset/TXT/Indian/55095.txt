Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Got introduced to Indian food here back in 1998. Have sicne become quite an afficianado on it.

The ownership has clearly changed hands here. Its run by mostly kids now and its not very authentic tasting Indian at all. The buffet is now one of the worst Indian Buffets in town.

If you want a quality indian food experience, try Kebab Palace, The Dhaba or India Gate.
