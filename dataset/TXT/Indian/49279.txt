tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA First time last night at the Indian Oven after searching high and low for some good Indian that rivals what I get in England when I travel there.  I like this place a lot!  It lacks a lot of the dark tablecloth and somewhat dreary feel you get in many of the places in town.  The restaurant appears clean and the service is exceptional.  We had a steady flow of nan which was cooked perfectly and had great texture.  I got a Taj Mahal beer which was served with a deeply frosted mug.  When ice cold this is an exceptional beer as is the slightly lighter bodied Kingfisher.  

The buffet is great and offers dishes divided between meat-based and vegetarian which is cool if you are not familiar with the dishes.  They had a lamb vindaloo that had great flavor but lacked some of the heat I am used to with vindaloo dishes.  I did hear the table next to me comment on how spicy it was so perhaps this is just my tastes and preference.  

All of the dishes I had were excellent.  The basmati rice was served out of a rice cooker which seemed a little off considering everything else was is long pans.  The lamb was a little dry perhaps because it was slightly over cooked?  All of the chicken dishes were exceptional as we're the veggie.  I also ordered a side of papadum which are great if you have kids.  They did not serve it with the traditional spicy chutney I am used to though but they did nail the green cilantro based sauce.

I few of my pet peeves that this place passed on was perfectly filtered Arizona water.  No chemical or hard water flavors so they must have a good RO system.  The other was that when the bill was delivered they kept filling waters and asked us if they could get us anything until we left which again speaks to their high level of service.  

The wait staff were dressed neatly and groomed to the extent that I wondered how I could get my facial hair so tight.

A great night and experience and I look forward to my next visit.
