Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I have been coming here for more than a year now. These guys are awesome. The lunch buffet is great although the same thing gets repeated everyday. Dinner items are great. I don't have a good tolerance for spicy food but they ensure their food tastes great without making it spicy. Value for money. Good service. Healthy options include vegetarian food. Most of all, has a great staff.
