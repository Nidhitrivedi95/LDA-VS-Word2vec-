ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I hate giving out 5 stars, but this place deserves it.  I recently took my family here and we all enjoyed our food immensely.  I got the dinner special.  For under 20 bucks it comes with a soft drink,  choice of appetizer, choice of curry Biryani and choice of dessert.  Can't beat that.  The vegetable samosa's were on point.  Best I've had.  The Biryani was also tasty.  I got the fried cheese balls for dessert.  They were done well also.  This place is popular.  On a Sunday night there were several parties of 10+ people.  The service staff did an OK job pacing the meal, though it took longer to get our bill then I would have liked.  The only negative, my family (not me) got the special Indian spiced tea.  It came with milk.  Not advertised but OK.  It came with loose tea leaves in it,  OK.  Not a huge big deal,  BUT the milk used had been scalded and caused a funky film on the cup and it just didn't taste right per my family.  Oh well, I'm rounding up...4.5 stars....  I'll be back.  They are a little too far for takeout, but I'll definitely keep them in mind when I want a good Indian restaurant north of the city.
