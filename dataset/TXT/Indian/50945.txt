uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw Visited there for the first time as recommended by my friend just for paratha roll..paratha roll can b compare with shawarma of middle east. Price ,quantity and meat with salad n sauces shawarma is richer n cheaper than paratha roll..but in 9$+ for a roll seems lil higher..will go back soon to try there speciality...beryani...then will update the stars..for final time..2 stars for cleaness
