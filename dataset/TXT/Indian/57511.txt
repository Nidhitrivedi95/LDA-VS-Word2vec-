yD2jmBrBPbLJ2yN3lQQHjw My family often goes to Wang's Kitchen.  They have a good variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. I am vegetarian and generally order the same dishes every time:

Vegetarian Wonton soup - always a nice start

Crispy green vegetables - tossed with green chili and tangy soya sauce, a really great appetizer.  Spice rating: more on the mild side

Stuffed eggplant - battered and stuffed with mashed potatoes, tossed in spicy Hunan sauce.  Spice rating: Caution!

We tried a new dish afternoon: Spicy Basil Mushroom - quite tasty and not too spicy

For those who really enjoy spicy food, I would highly recommend 

Their fried ice cream desert drizzled with honey and cashews is also great way too cool off from the heat.
