82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Please, No!  I must first start by saying that I did see a few bad reviews and I should have taken heed. Indian cuisine is normally layered with flavours, however you will not find that at Le Taj. We went for Sunday buffet "just in case" and I'm glad we did not order from the menu. Two buffets and 2 drafts came out to be 55.00. ???? There is absolutely NO flavour in their food.  I'm not talking about hot/spicy I'm talking about the normal spices you find in all authentic Indian dishes. If you want spicy do not even WISH that you will receive anything remotely close, even if you ask for an addition. Their suggestion is a carrot/oil mix which has no spice and has the distinction of canola oil. No lime pickle, or methi on the menu. Everything from the buffet was cold. Even though we only had a few bights we had indigestion for hours afterwards. Don't go if you like flavour or authentic Indian cuisine.
