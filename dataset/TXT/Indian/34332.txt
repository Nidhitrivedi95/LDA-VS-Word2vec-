MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ This place opened up about 2 months ago and checked it out last week for dinner.  First impressions:

 - Enticing aroma of spices from the kitchen
-  Clean but not much done in terms of atmosphere or decor:  a few key touches could spruce up the place.  Also, some music would help to set a relaxing setting
-  Old and really old customer base
-  Friendly service
- Tandoori dishes were well prepared including Tikka Masala and the chutneys
- Prices are high and naan is extra

Overall good place to go for Indian food in N. Scottsdale
