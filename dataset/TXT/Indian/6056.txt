3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA It's simply my favorite. This is a great, authentic, and clean food buffet. It's the only buffet I'll eat , 'cause I'm picky that way. Always pleasant, always clean, always good , and I'm almost always the only white guy in the place...that tells me a little sumpin about the authenticity and quality of the food:)
