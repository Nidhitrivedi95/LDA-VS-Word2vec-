TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA We went during Thanksgiving weekend and realized they only had a buffet for $14-15/person. 

The dosas were brought fresh to your table. Dosas were made from chickpea and rice flour (i.e. not authentic). But all restaurants here use this method rather than actually soaking "washed urad dhal" and rice and then grinding them and allowing it to ferment (have a bit of a sour flavour which I love). 

Sambar was warm but the idlis and vardas and other dishes were cold. Sambar tasted okay. 

Three types of chutneys as well as lemon pickle. 
I liked the hoppers dish.
