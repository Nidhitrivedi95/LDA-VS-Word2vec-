JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I love Indian food, so my expectations were very high. I have to say that this restaurant exceeded them. The food was incredible. The service was stellar. Our water glasses never got close to empty. The wait staff was patient with our questions and extremely kind and friendly. I had the butter chicken and loved it. We stared with vegetable samosas, also wonderful. We will absolutely be back!
