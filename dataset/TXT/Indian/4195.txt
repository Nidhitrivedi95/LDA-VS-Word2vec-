1iKMxBsTsPSoEzYUf1AijA Flavourful chicken biryani at the best price. It's really just perfect and resonates more  closely to Bangladeshi biryani. The biryani is not full of masala like sindh biryani (Pakistani, the type you find at Sana/Student Tasty). It does not violate extreme levels of spicy (Punjabi biryani you find at Bombay Mahal). It might be slightly dry but they provide raita to compensate. Best part is the onion garnish. The ingredients are fresh. I haven't visited the place, I mostly order delivery which is seamless. For maximum impact, start eating while the food is still piping hot. I've already become a regular and shifted my loyalty from student tasty Haha. You'll definitely like this place if you appreciate authentic desi food.
