CAtB6aAbuC2fbh47vlKzmw This restaurant is in no way an upscale one. However, the prices are good and the food is delicious! It is a great place to go if you or your friends are vegetarian since it is 100% vegetarian and has tons of vegan options. The samosas are so cheap and are delicious and the sauce it comes with is the best. 
The restaurant is not the nicest place in the world but the owners are very nice and welcoming. I have eaten there and taken out food many times and am always wowed. Very recommended.
