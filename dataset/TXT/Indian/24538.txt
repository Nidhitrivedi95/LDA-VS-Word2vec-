H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ Delicious food and fast service every time, and at a reasonable price. One thing I loved was that I was able to get the chicken fried rice made with less oil, and it was amazing. I'm definitely going to try asking for less oil when ordering all my dishes next time.

I have also catered a small party at home with food from Spicy Dragon twice and it was a great experience - highly recommend
