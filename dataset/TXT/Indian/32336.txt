LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Don't go here for the ambiance. Go for the delicious, cheap and plentiful food options. I would recommend the chicken shawarma w/ the french fries!! I think they double fry their fries...they are amazing, and I am usually not a french fry person. I also got the chicken tikka masala meal which was just okay. They use huge chunks of white meat and the sauce is poured over the rice, so it was on the dry side. Very large portion for around $8. The grape leaves were meh, probably some of the least favorite I have tried. Their galub jamun was super overdone.
