Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I am a sucker for buffets... Indian buffets take it to a whole nother level.  I have been here before for a "work" trip.  Last visit, I was probably hungrier than this past one, but I digress!  

Maharaja had all the Indian bites that I crave - sag paneer, chicken masala, samosas mmmmmmm....  They also had some pieces I was not familiar with - chicken 65?  OK!  And since when is General Tsao's chicken considered Indian?  Whatever, I'll eat it =)  All dishes were pretty good, but since we were there towards the end of the buffet, the chicken dishes were a little on the dry side.

The desserts however, were enough to keep me coming back for more - literally.  Pistachio ice cream?  Mango ice cream?  Pudding-type thing?  Sweet donut hole? DONE! Definitely would want to go back here when in the area.
