Rk82QHtWp268GM93qWj3dQ Good food but bad customer service. Went on Jan 1st after reading good reviews here. Called ahead of time to make sure they'd be open as I was bringing a group and they even took my reservation. Got there and found the place closed! Not cool. Waited a bit as there were others waiting in the parking lot too, and they finally opened, half hour after my reservation! But once we were in the buffet lunch was pretty good. I stuck with the vegetarian, which was excellent. Others members of my group who had the non veg were disappointed; the tandoori looked like it was from the night before and the masala chicken had about 3 pieces in a vat of curry sauce (literally, I saw it for myself!). Also, there wasnt enough staff; it took forever to get out naan, chai, coffee. But once the place opened, it quickly filled up with what seemed like repeat customers...so  at least they seem to have a good enough track record to to keep people coming back!
