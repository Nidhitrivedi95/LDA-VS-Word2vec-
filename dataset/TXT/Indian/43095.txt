RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg The chicken, prepared halal, was incredibly moist and tender in the butter chicken... most Indian places overcook their meat in my experience. This was AMAZING.  I've never had butter chicken this good. Lots of southern Indian styles to choose from on the menu, too, which is a nice contrast to the usual North Indian styles everywhere else. Don't let the "fusion" title fool you; the Indian dishes are classic. I think fusion refers to the fact that they have a few non-Indian dishes available too; a great choice for that one friend who doesn't like Indian food, since they had a few other non-Indian options like Chinese or even a hamburger. They also have a bar area. Definitely going back the next time I'm in Madison! Service was on pointe.
