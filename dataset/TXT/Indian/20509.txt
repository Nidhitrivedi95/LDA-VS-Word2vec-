fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw Excellent food quality.  Authentic Indian food.  A place, I'd recommend any day for a great Indian Meal.  The Garlic naan and Daal Makhani were simply awesome.  The waiter also offer us a complimentary Mango Lassi as they were running out of Sweet Lassi.  The Sweet Lassi is great too.  

I was skeptical at first about the quality of food.  But the ambience, the taste and the overall experience was better than most Indian restaurants in the city. I'll definitely recommend this place and come back soon.
