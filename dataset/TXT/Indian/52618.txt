uxpCyMp4R10WRjqr9JsaPA I fell of my chair when I saw the words good service and nice decor mentioned in the reviews!!  Did I go to the same place I wonder?? 
The guy looked like we disturbed him when we arrived, told us half of the things we wanted to order were not available (hmm.. Why are they on the menu?..). Gave us the wrong dish after a long wait and then did not even bother to fill my glass of water. Run before you eat at this place. There was a reason why it was almost empty!!!
