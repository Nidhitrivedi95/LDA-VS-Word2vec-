3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw I live in the neighborhood and have tried out most Indian restaurants on this street. My husband and I purchased a lunch groupon and Kama was kind enough to accept our lunch groupon for a dinner deal minus the alcoholic drinks (that were part of the dinner groupon). While the price of the lunch deal was great! ($17) for two, when we went for dinner, we were charged extra for using the lunch groupon as a dinner groupon. When I spoke to the Manager on the phone, he never mentioned this to me and said "you're more than welcome to use this groupon but you won't get the alcoholic drinks." We agreed and were disappointed to have to pay any additional charge once we got there. I would have appreciated if he mentioned this additional charge rather than just slapping it on us. Other than that the food was fine. 

As for the  food, I was happy with the buffet. Nice variety of two kinds of lambs, a rare thing to see Ras malai (dessert) on the buffet which I was absolutely happy with, great garlic naans and butter chicken, not so great papri chaat. The Lamb masala was excellent. Good service and great ambiance! I would say this a great place for big groups:-)
