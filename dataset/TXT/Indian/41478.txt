Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Do not hesitate, this is where you want to eat lunch. Just go there. Trust me. I am an Indian food fanatic, and this place is one of my favorite restaurants of all time! We were just visiting Madison for the weekend, but Maharaja lunch buffet is one of the many reasons I will be returning to this great city! At first I was disappointed that the buffet did not feature saag paneer (my favorite) but let me tell you, everything was amazing. I am kind of glad there was no saag paneer because I ended up trying a lot of dishes I had not tried before. There was not one single thing that was not delicious. Everything was spiced perfectly, just the right amount of kick. There was a desert soup - coconut pistachio - that was amazing. As a vegetarian, and a lover of scrumptious foods, this place was a delight. It is about 10-15 minutes from downtown if I remember correctly.
