Gj3EI0cqh1ZpC86sDHtf7w Great food and plenty of it. The quality is excellent and the service is prompt and efficient. The restaurant when we visited was very busy but we were seated without pre-booking with only a short wait. Situated over the road from the local Premier Inn who recommended this restaurant. Thoroughly recommended.
