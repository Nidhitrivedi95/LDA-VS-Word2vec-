rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA It is the best chicken biryani I ever tasted, so, five stars for that. Spices are right and the smell is not that strong.
Portion is good for 2 people but I can eat it all by myself (thats how delicious it is).

Butter chicken is good too - I get it once in a while. It is good with chicken biryani!

As for the location - parking is free so you can dine in. Interior is good.
