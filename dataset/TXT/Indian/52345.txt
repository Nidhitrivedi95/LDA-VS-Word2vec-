uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA I've only ever eaten the samosas here - it's $2 for 4 pieces.  
They're actually huuuuuge.  I love the vegetable and mutton here.  The spices are so overwhelming - none of your gross, soggy, barely-tasting like anything kinda puffs. 

If you're coming here for the samosas - you have to be a little direct as there's usually 5 to 10 people milling around - you just go up to the counter (left side - where the samosas are) & order.  As everybody else is waiting for food on the right side.
