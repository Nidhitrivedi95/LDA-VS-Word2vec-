Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Excellent food and friendly good service. Dinner there with a friend last month was amazing! We had the appetizer sampler platter, divine! We loved every item and even though we were full, ordered more just to keep tasting the delicious flavors. Lamb was my favorite but everything was so good. This afternoon I carried out Indian pizza, the ultimate comfort food on this windy cold day. Perfect! It's so great to have a good INDIAN place here in the downtown neighborhood!
