02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ We went to Indian Delhi Palace this weekend for their lunch buffet and were pretty dissapointed.  I would like to go back and try something off the menu, but I've had a better Indian buffet in Tempe.  The selection of food was quite limited and we had to wait forever for service.  The only saving grace was that the food we did have was pretty good.  The chicken tikka masala was really salty on the second trip to the buffet.  Strange almost like they dumped a cup of salt in.  

I've heard this a great place so I'm probably going to give it one more try.  The best part of the lunch buffet was the price: $8.99 per person.
