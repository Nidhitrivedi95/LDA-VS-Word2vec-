eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Small buffet with some OK dishes. I thought the chick peas were cooked well and flavored nicely. The chicken curry was spicy but executed poorly. The rice in the buffet line was old. The fresh naan was nice but we were ready to leave by the time they brought it to our table, which made the meal all the more sad. Not coming back.
