P4h8kgy_48oE9vCHJc4BCQ This business strictly caters towards individuals that follow the muslim religion as they strictly serve halal meat - I went in and asked for non-halal options and they rudely said no and to go somewhere else.

If they wanted to cater to ppl of all faiths/beliefs they should serve both halal and non-halal options.

They obviously dont want the non-halal meat eating demographic.
