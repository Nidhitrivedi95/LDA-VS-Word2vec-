UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw I usually go here couple of times a month.  Food is generally okay, some times all dishes are chicken no goat, which is disappointing.  I also find tandoori chicken cold when I am there at 11am, food should be hot.  Last time I was there I heard a manager yell to the employee from kitchen for not taking dosa on time, it really made that employee feel bad. This is no way to treat your employees.  When it's time to pay, they have difficult time to ring your order, seems like they have terrible order system, please throw away that high tech looking white register, it confuses your employees.  Your buffet prices are high, at least one item should be goat or lamb.
