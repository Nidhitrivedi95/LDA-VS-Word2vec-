c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Ordered off just-eat for pickup

I walked in and was not greeted by the first two people I saw, in fact I was completely ignored until a third guy came out and gave me my order 

The food - greasy!!! I understand that I am not paying very much but damn, this was low quality and very little meat 

It was edible other than grease and fatty cuts of beef 

Naan bread was the highlight 

The paneer dish was so watery it's like they didn't use and cream or yogurt , just water 

All the dishes were watery except the butter chicken which was nice but has 6 chunks of chicken floating in it 

Luckily I had left over BBQ meat I cut up and added to the dishes 

I only came here because all the good Indian places didn't open till 5 

I do not think I'd return here
