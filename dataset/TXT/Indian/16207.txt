De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA Very good, slightly pricey. I got an assortment of things a platter over one big meal as I wanted to branch out in my food selection but also some favorites.
Not many people in the restaurant over dinner or much work put into the overall atmosphere. I took the food home with me although if I wasn't alone I would have ate there too.
My food was fresh and tasty. Not the best but not bad. I would eat here again.
