lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw Just had lunch at this recently opened venue, having given it a few months to get established and work their kinks out.
The location is nice, bright, and clean. Authentic use of stainless steel plates and cups adds to its ambience.
The food is a variety of so-called Bombay street food and depending on your taste buds there is variety to please many. I happened to order the Salli  chicken with a side of the gunpowder fries while opting out for their Indian style drinks. 
The food arrived at my table quickly and hot. The fries were lukewarm and lacked any flavour. Where was this gunpowder that I expected? I must've got an old batch because I had the tiny bits of fries you get when u reach the bottom of the bag. Very disappointing.
The Salli chicken was hot and rather soupy in texture lacking flavour other than a strong tomatoe base. While it was a fair serving I felt it lacked a fair amount of chicken pieces given that it was dark meat. The roti was a different twist but was rather thick and lacked flavour.
I saw the two owners milling about behind the counter but they failed to engage their customers. Service is key to getting me back. Had they asked I would've shared my feedback but alas, a missed opportunity for them.
Would I be back? No, not the flavorful Indian taste I'm accustomed to. Too many other options exist including Nandos right next door if you have the need to have spice.
