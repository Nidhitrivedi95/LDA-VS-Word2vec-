o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Finally made it for dinner.  No buffet that night.

Had a nice chat with the waiter.  We both like bindi, which is a sauteed okra dish.  He frankly told us that when okra is out-of-season that they use frozen.  We decided to await springtime to come back for that one.  His candor truly impressed us.

We ordered the yellow lentils (they were our of black lentils) and set the spice level at 3 of 5.  The lentils blew our socks off.  We added rice as that cut into the spice and then gently tried our 3 level madras chicken.  That dish was fine, spicy but not killer spicy.  Our conclusion is that the lentils were more of a 4 or 5, so ask if this happens to you.

We were told that they would exchange the item if the spice was our-of-bounds.  Nice.

We were the only "gringos" in the restaurant until we were leaving and another non-Indian couple entered.  This is an authentic place that draws ethnic customers...many families.

We noticed that the menu emphasized vegetarian "Southern Indian" dishes.  Yes, there were offerings of seafood & chicken, but the thrust was vegetarian, so vegans...delight here!

Also, they have more than the standard "naan" bread.  They have "kulcha" breads which are stuffed naan.  Our onion kulcha was well dotted with onion, but it just appeared to be just part of the dough looking like a regular naan with onions.  Thought it would be puffier with the onion "stuffed" inside a folded or rolled naan.  Just so you know.

Good place, great buffet where you can try it all, but also a nice dinner option.
