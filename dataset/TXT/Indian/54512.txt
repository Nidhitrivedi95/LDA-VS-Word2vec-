w1cL1J0PML_1R8U_cEK5aw We gave a chance to this Indian place in Inverness. I need to say that the best part of the dinner was the service. The waiter was very nice and he served the food very professionally. We tried a couple of dishes. One was a kind of curry with lemon leaves that was great. The lamb was very soft and the sauce very tasty. However, the chicken "Chasni" was just so-so (not good, considering that it was in the "House specialties" section on the menu). Average prices (not cheap, not expensive).
