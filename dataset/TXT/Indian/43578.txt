rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Definitely one of the best indian restaurants (in terms of food only) across the US. Every dish I have ordered here has been top notch. The biryani is the only dish I wouldn't really recommend but everything else on the menu is definitely worth trying. Cons are that the service and kitchen is very mismanaged, so wait times can be horrible at times, but the food is worth the wait.
