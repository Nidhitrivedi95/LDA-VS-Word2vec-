YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw Was here for lunch on a Sunday and they had a buffet going on. The ambience was pretty standard with full wall mirrors on one side, that give you a feeling of depth and size. The place was reasonably crowded and I noticed several folks walk in even as we were having our lunch. The food itself was fairly substandard....the only highlight being the gobi manchurian (which was right on spot) and the yellow dal that was on the buffet. The pani puri seemed totally off (something was totally amiss here); the vegetable biriyani barely hit the mark; the mushroom curry was only namesake - one had to fish for a piece of mushroom in a sea of soya nuggets; the mango lassi that was served on the table wasn't upto it; and then I kept some hopes for the mango mousse that was on the dessert section - only to be let down. The mango mousse turned out to be a much thicker and sweeter version of the mango lassi. Cannot say anything about the non-vegetarian dishes on the buffet, but the veg section was a let down.
