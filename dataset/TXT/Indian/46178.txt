sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Order: Butter Chicken Roti

My friend and I were researching places to eat during my stay in Toronto, and having nothing but raving reviews on Yelp, we made sure to pencil in this destination.  And in short, this place is well deserving of the compliments it receives.  And although this place really doesn't need another 5-Star review, I would walk away feeling like a bad person if I didn't give it to them otherwise. 

This place is a hole in the wall to the max.  There's a total seating for like 12 people.  And yet this place constantly has a queue for it's delicious rotis.  If you've had roti before, you should check this place out.  It may just change your life.  Portions are perfect, but you can be adventurous and split orders with friends for the best experience.  A friend had  banana lassi and said it was really good too.  Don't let the looks of the place or the long lines dissuade you.  A little goes a long way, and that definitely holds true for this treasure on Queens.

[Pros]
- a-mazing, authentic, flavorful roti
- cheap cheap cheap

[Cons]
- hole-in-the-wall: so not the best place for a relaxing sit-down dinner
