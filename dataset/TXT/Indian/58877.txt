YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA This is probably the worst place to visit . The customer service was awful.. They do not have decency to talk to customers and answers questions .. We were visiting Toronto on a family trip and happen to go to this restaurant for dinner.. I ordered a beer (King fisher) and the server said they were out of it .. After 5 mins I saw him taking the same beer for different customers .. I asked him about it .. He didn't bother to answer but when I pestered him .. He said that's the last ones he had .. I was pissed, I didn't order food  but kids ended up eating since they were hungry. It wasn't great ..
