ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw This place was good but fell short of excellent.  We ordered saag with chickpeas, and it was very good, but it was very heavy on the ghee, giving it an overly buttery taste and a heavy quality.  We also had daal, and it was notably too salty.  We also ordered garlic naan, which was very good, but not the best garlic naan I had had.

The cilantro chutney / sauce brought out at the beginning was some of the best I've had anywhere though--it was diabolically spicy and very fresh tasting.

Service was very good.

To their credit, when you order something spicy here, you get real kick--this place hasn't been Americanized.  My main complaints though hold--too much ghee and too much salt are hard-to-forgive complaints about the food.

In some cities I'd be tempted to give four stars...but this is Cleveland, which has the best and cheapest restaurants of any metro area I've ever visited in the U.S.  And, the prices here are typical for Indian restaurants in America--which again, sets them at 2 or more dollars more per entree than a number of outstanding restaurants across Cleveland.  The bar in town here is set very high, and measured relative to other local restaurants, this is only a 3-star establishment.

Paying more attention to the balance of their dishes, using less salt and ghee, would have easily broken this place into the four star zone--and combining this with slightly lower prices (even shaving off $1 per entry) could perhaps have given them a run at five.
