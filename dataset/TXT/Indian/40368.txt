pns5NH--mhuCC1vK-xbYsA My wife's favorite kind of food is Indian food. So we frequent many a nan - curry - saag purveying establishment. Biryani stands out among them. It is the same tasty Indian food but all of the flavors are more intense and it's got a wide selection. It is more fresh, spicy, creamy, and sweet than the normal fair. Also the meat is cooked to perfection, the chicken korma will melt in your mouth and the tandoori falls off the bone. There are also fish dishes, which not all Indian restaurants have.  Don't miss the lunch buffet 11:30AM-3PM Lunch Buffet Friday-Sunday or the incredibly down to earth friendly staff.  They already have the food and service, my only knock against this place is the interior is pretty shabby, with more focus on ambiance and atmosphere Biryani would offer the perfect Indian dining experience.
