8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Tucked away on Race Street, the food is always good here. I typically go for some sort of lamb, a tikka masala, palaak paneer, naan and roti. It's better to go with more people so you can share & try more entrees. This is also a good place for vegetarian fare since there are so many options. Each entrée runs around $15. Service is friendly. When I crave Indian cuisine, this place satiates.
