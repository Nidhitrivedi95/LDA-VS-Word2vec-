1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g For food preparation, presentation 3 stars..service 3 stars...the interior is a 1 star...since the front door could use a good cleaning and the entry floor a little sticky.  The price for the food earns 3.5 stars and the amount of food generous. We were a larger group and were accommodated well. I would return if in the neighborhood.
