DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg I used their  online ordering system that you can order pickups with 10% off.
  We ordered a medium butter chicken, mild chicken tikka masala and a veggie samosa. I placed the order online and in a minute they informed me through email that they were preparing my order and it would be ready in about 40 mins. I arrived about 30 mins after and my order was ready to pick up.  The samosa came in a brown paper bad with a big tub of dip.  The chicken tikka masala and butter chicken came in two black tubs sealed like a frozen dinner, so I didn't have to worry about spilling it. 

Both the medium butter chicken and mild chicken tikka masala weren't spicy at all so next time we'll order hot.  The samosa was smaller than what we expected and the sauce was ok.  The other food was tasty and the online ordering system was pretty easy to use.
Overall not a bad place to try and I didn't have any issues using the ordering system.
