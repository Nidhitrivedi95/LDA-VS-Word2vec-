j3YSK-IgpNabCIzWEl7CaA Solid 4 stars... at first I thought this place was just a store/market for indian food and ingredients, but it actually has a cafe inside. Went here for lunch the other week and it was delicious.  They have tons of combos - if you don't know how to order, they recommend dishes and explain what's in the food.  Everything I had was delicious.  Chicken Curry, Chicpea and Naan bread.  The combo I got came we a soup... and 2 dessert pastries (one was spicy and sweet and the other was a cool down for all the spice)....   Great over all and the place is kept very clean.
