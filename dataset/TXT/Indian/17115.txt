DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Simply phenomenal! The flavor in every dish we tried was simply delicious. Elmer, our server, was attentive, kind, prompt and very helpful. My husband doesn't really liked Indian food, but he loved and raved about the Chicken Tikka. I recommend this location to everyone looking to enjoy a night out. The ambiance was a very enjoyable one. Yum!
