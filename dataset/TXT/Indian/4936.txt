2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw One of my favourite Indian spots in Missisauga! 

Food:
I highly recommend the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala. I tried the Palak Paneer but wasn't a fan. The two people I was with loved it though so it's just my personal preference for tomato based sauces over spinach. I was in a group of three. We ordered the three dishes I mentioned above and four orders of garlic and plain naan. We only finished half of what we ordered but it made for great leftovers the next day! Portions may not look large at first but it's very generous. Pricing is also good.

Service:
In the beginning we had to wait a bit for our server to come back to take our orders. After that it was great service. Our glasses of water were refilled every 15 min. Staff is very friendly.

Loved it! Nice decor and great lighting. I could see what I was eating so that's always a plus. There is lots of seating. It's great for families, groups, and even dates. We went at 6pm on a Sunday and it wasn't busy. But when we were leaving at 8pm, the place was full. I'd say that's a pretty good sign!
