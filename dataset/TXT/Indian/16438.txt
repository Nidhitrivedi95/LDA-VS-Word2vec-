dJfiXs0BwwkGKl0sXC3dzw We have visited this restaurant many times. We love the non veg menu. We started with chicken chittinad on our first visit and loved it. They made it so good with regional taste and smell. Apart from chettinad they have very good goat curry. It's spicy but tasty. I specially like fish pulusu. It's so different from what I had tried before with fish. Sambar is good most times but average a few times. Channa masala is good in veg menu.

Ok ambience. Basic setup. Good service. Good authentic regional taste I would say. Recommended for South Indian dishes.
