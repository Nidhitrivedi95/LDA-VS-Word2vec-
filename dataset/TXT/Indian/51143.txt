uqPHO-o4stxGXLdxP3WNig Our group of four planned to eat at Udupi before going to a show at Cassidy Theater last Saturday, and were surprised to find it under new management and renamed Dakshin. Not much changed inside and only two tables occupied.
Sat at a booth at 6:35, had our orders placed by 6:40 (naan for four, three Chicken Tikka Masala and one Butter Chicken). Sat and waited until 7:10 when two orders of Chicken Tikka Masala were brought to the table. After five minutes we decided to share the orders while waiting for the rest. At 7:25 the Naan was brought out with two orders of Butter Chicken. There was no time to have the order corrected before our 8pm show, so we just continued sharing out what had been served. The entrees were very good but half of the Naan was only partially cooked and doughy.
It's a shame that the service has so dreadfully eroded with new management. We likely won't be coming back...
