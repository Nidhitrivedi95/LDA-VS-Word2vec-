FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw It is very hard to find Indian restaurants that carry southern India options so I'm a fan of Swagat for that alone. Their dosa's are huge and filling for two meals, especially with an app. My husband ordered goat, and quickly remembered why he does not order goat out, typically very boney and fatty, which was the case for Swagat. All in all, we will be back for more dosa!
