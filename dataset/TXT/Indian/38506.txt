OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I'll start by saying that I've never been a huge fan of Indian cuisine. being a foodie, however, I love trying new places and I am usually open to try absolutely anything more than a few times. one of my friends and I came to try this place last night because she was in the mood for something new and I had no preferences. we were seated immediately and was greeted very politely by a young man who gave us options with seating. a young lady greeted us thereafter and offered us drinks. both of us admitted not knowing much about Indian cuisine and asked the male server to send us some of his popular dishes from the kitchen. we wanted to trust the chef and see how good the food was. everything they sent us was absolutely amazing and flavorful. 

we had two chicken tapas that I didn't know anything about. both were delicious and the chicken was prepared beautifully tender and juicy. the lamb dish that was sent after with naan bread was amazing as well. overall, the apps, entrees, and dessert choices from the server and chef were 10/10. service was more than friendly which made us feel welcomed and appreciated & food quality was delicious and beautifully presented. we will definitely be back
