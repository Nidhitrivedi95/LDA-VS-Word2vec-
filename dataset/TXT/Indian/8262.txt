7LNuQqjcjAn0bBlGHIiQzQ My favourite Indian restaurant!! The butter chicken at this place is the BEST in the city. If Indian foods were low in calories, I'd come here every other day for the lunch buffet. The selection is great and tastes amazing, but I always end up eating the butter chicken and naan only.
