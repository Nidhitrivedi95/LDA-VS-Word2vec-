GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Fantastic little Indian food restaurant. Don't be discouraged by the strip mall location or the abundant use of paper cutlery and styrofoam. What it lacks in pomp, it makes up for in flavor.

I ordered Palak Paneer with white rice and it tasted like heaven, especially paired with my friend's Paneer Butter Masala. The samosas are also a must, paired with savory and sweet sauces from the chutney bar.

All in all, four stars. I would be happy to recommend this place to friends.
