iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw The samosas are DELICIOUS! I'm usually not a fan of samosas but these are soooo goooood!! Giving this place 3 stars because, it looks pretty dirty outside. I understand it is outside but they can do a little more to make the place look more appealing, as well as the customer service.
