NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw Coming from an Indian person, this place is amazing!! We went in about forty minutes before closing on a Friday night. The service was friendly and attentive. We got the chicken tikka, lamb biriyani, malai kofta, and garlic naan. Everything was spiced perfectly, and the naans were made in front of us. They were soft, pillowy, and had just the right amount of chew. It's slightly more expensive than your average Indian restaurant, but it's delicious. We'll definitely be back.
