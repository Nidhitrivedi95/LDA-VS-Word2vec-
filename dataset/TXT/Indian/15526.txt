cu1CvIzOyf-R91pT92NShw Trivia: Why Indians eat with using all five fingers instead of the silver?

A: In order to enjoy the meal using all the five senses that is best obtained by the nerve endings of one's fingers :) 

 i did exactly that and forgot for a moment that i was actually not in India ! Finally i found a south Indian restaurant so authentic that actually serve authentic regional spicy food ! Well, Chettinad is a way of cuisine in Tamilnadu (South of India) where the food is relatively spicier and meats, seafood are one of their specialties. Also one of the special cooking methods of this region is that they finish off the meats by tempering with mustard seeds on top. In India , the mustard seeds are not usually tempered for meats but only for the preparation of vegetable curries. 

Do look for white board special as it would be the best they can make that day. we ordered the whole fish fry and believe it or not but this dish was a repeat on demand of ours and friend's 3yr old. It was a hit!
For the main course we ordered some fish curry, goat curry and some naans. The goat curry was ok but fish curry was spicy and the best . It is certainly no comparison to any Modified-Indian cuisines in B-lo. 
My cute friend who is originally from West of India says that she wouldn't trade anything for a huge Dosa (crispy thin lentil crepes served with coconut chutney & spicy sambar). Usually this is a breakfast thing for southerners so it would be like eating ham & eggs at a Steakhouse for dinner! But it was that good! 

Servers are true natives who will guide you well and nothing Americanized or genetically modified about the place or food !!! Can travel 2 hours again to eat here. They have another location in Toronto too.
