VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg We missed the Indian restaurants in the San Francisco area and after the second time I saw this restaurant on Check Please we decided to give it a try. I was not disappointed. We were seated immediately (a good thing because there is a display of "bling" just as you enter and I have trouble resisting jewelry).  Everyone in our party liked the food and this was amazing since we brought two teenagers who only seem to eat pizza. The bread (naan) was terrific and was perfect to sop up the sauces that came with our meals. Chicken Korma has always been a favorite and is usually what I order as a comparison the first time I try a new Indian restaurant. It was plentiful and delicious with a sauce so good I wanted to lick the dish but decided to set a good example for the kids. Not sure if the males in our group liked the food or the belly dancer more but I heard no complaints about either. We'll be back.
