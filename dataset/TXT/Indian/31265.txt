KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Went here last night for dinner with my friends. 
We ordered a variation of foods. 
Punjabi burger - was really good flavour. However it fell apart due to the overly soft bun. The bun needs to be changed to something that will accommodate such a juicy burger. It has tons of flavour.  And I could especially taste the mint. But really didn't not like the bun.
Butter chicken fries was amazing.  The butter chicken was really fresh.
Paneer naanwich - although I did not taste it. My friend said it was really good. 
Butter chicken mac n cheese - the taste was phenomenal but the macaroni pasta was way too over cooked.
