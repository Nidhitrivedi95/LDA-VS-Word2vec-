NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Love the business model. The atmosphere of this place is super modern, clean, and welcoming. Its a very high tech place, even has a hand washing station where you just put your hands into a machine for 12 seconds and it washes them! You can see everything in the kitchen through a glass wall. 

The lady at the register gave me a tour of the menu since it was my first time, and she was very accommodating to my gluten allergy. I had the lamb meatballs and they were good, the sauces had great flavor. I was very impressed with the service and atmosphere more than the food. But the food was still crazy good. I definitely recommend anyone to try this place out.
