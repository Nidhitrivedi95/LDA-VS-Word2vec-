Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A We were in the area, so decided to visit our fav. Indian restaurant. We were shocked to find that where it once stood is now vacant!!! On our way out of the shopping center we noticed a Jaipur Junction sign on a building in the adjacent shopping center. 

The new location is dark & sparsely decorated. I guess they moved in, added the old benched from the old location, a table in the middle, and the old buffet and that is it. Couldn't they at least hang one picture on the wall? Storage space must be at a minimum because boxes were stacked in plain sight. My wife decided to get the buffet. I have an aversion to buffets, because of hygiene and lack of sanitizer available at most places I visit. My wife and daughter enjoyed their meal. I ordered a fish kabob. When it came out, I asked the owner when they had moved. He said very little and did not seem very chatty that day. Back to the fish... Must not have been my day. During this visit the fish was very dry. Almost jerky like. Was not an overcooking issue. More like freshness. Will avoid next time.

Bathrooms were cleaner in the new restaurant and there are two! One little closing remark. One the way back to my seat, I peered in the kitchen window and observed the cook placing samosas that he was frying in a large pan that was resting on a trash can. Yes... it was a trash can. I kid you not. 

Anyhow, the bill came to $38 and my wife and kids were happy. I will give them some time and visit again when I am in the area. Hopefully they work on the "little" details.
