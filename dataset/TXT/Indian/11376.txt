afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w Sri lankan food is like indian food in high def. Flavors are deliciously overwhelming, portions are shockingly excessive and the price was dirt cheap! 

As I've said before I'm having a full on love affair with indian cuisine, be it east west or island, I just can't seem to get enough. Now I'm not sure if it is because they do vegetarian so well, or if it is the intoxicating layers of flavor. 

A few true Canadians and Susan ventured to the Hopper Hut. With a gleam in our eyes and an adventurous palate we perused the menu with high expectations. Let's just say for me anyways, thank goodness for the pictures! As a new indian eater some of the commonly known terms were lost on me. So I stuck out my tongue and tasted our waiters' recommendation. 

I had the seafood lampries, basically a few curried dishes with fish potatoes and rice. The massive paper pouch held a cacophony of flavours, some I loved to taste, and some I'd love never to taste again. But fantastic overall!

We each nibbled on the others' platters and found that we could barely make a dent in the sheer amount of food. A subtle hint from the waiter would have been helpful, but we each left full and fired up. Literally fired up, the food was HOT!

So if you go to this delightful little place, come with an empty stomach an adventurous palate and make sure you try a hopper. Great company doesn't hurt either. 

The only reason dropped a star was because towards the end of our meal the owners lit some sort overpowering incense and I had to literally run from the building due to a powerful allergic reaction. . I'm still sporting the hives to prove it. 

Bottom line...sri lankan is my newest crush!
