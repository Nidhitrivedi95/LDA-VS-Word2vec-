While I have only eaten here several times (and ordered typical dishes - chicken korma, biryani, saag, jalfrezie), each time was a pleasant experience. The food is loaded with flavor and portions are fairly generous. As other yelpers have commented, make sure you get the naan bread - it is absolutely fantastic. 

The dinner menu differs from its lunch menu in that serving sizes are slightly greater, as is the price. Waiter service is also provided so tipping is common practice as well. Prices in general can be a tad on the expensive side, so I generally only eat here occasionally.
