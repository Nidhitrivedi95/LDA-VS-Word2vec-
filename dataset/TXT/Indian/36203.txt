NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ Here in Edinburgh on vacation and enjoying the local fare, we decided to try Gurkha to get something with more spice. We weren't disappointed. Had a few starters which were very nice. The entrees were Lamb Khutta and Tandoori Chicken. Both were wonderful! The lamb was spicy and the serving was very generous. Service was very good as well. Highly recommend this restaurant.
