ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ My boyfriend and I ate here last week. The experience from the start wasn't great. We were seated and no explanation was given as to the menus left on the table. There was a giant menu that had no more than a dozen or so items and a bunch of alcoholic beverages. We were confused and disappointed as we could really only identify one or two items. The waitress (who is also the hostess) dropped off additional menus. We were relieved until we saw the prices!  YIKES! A bit more than we anticipated based on my previous interpretation of the number of money signs. Next we waited. And waited. And waited. It took over 15 minutes to get our drinks and an order. When we reminded the waitress, she seemed offended, as if it was our fault she forgot! Then, to top it off, we find out the two dishes we ordered, were EXACTLY the SAME! Why couldnt someone explain this before we ordered? One was just "spicier". The twin dishes were good, but I was a little peeved that I just spent close to $30 for two of the same dish! 
I probably won't go back. It's not that the food wasn't good, but I didn't feel that we got good service, and I paid way to much to not be treated well. And in regards to money spent, it wasn't so much price per dish, which I now realize I was misinformed on, but it was the quantity we got for the price. I would definitely not ever come here with a bigger group.
