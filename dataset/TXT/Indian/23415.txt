gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is by far the best Indian lunch buffet I ever had in Vegas.  The service was amazing and restaurant itself it clean and quiet.  Most Indian restaurants' lunch buffet are dishes from days ago.   At Mt Everest I could really taste the flavor of different spices they use and the meat dishes were tender but not too soft.  The curry dishes were just perfect, enough sweetness but also taste the kick of other spices they use.  
I truly believe this place roast their own spices and grind it up themselves also.
