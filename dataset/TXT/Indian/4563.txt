2-Y-kNEbrP_m1U9Hc2xH7A The previously named Bismillah is now reopened under a new name, owner and chef. Although the exterior and interior decor might still look the same as before (for folks who may have visited Bismillah) and might not be to everyone's taste, the food is lightyears ahead of its predecessor and is finger-licking good! 

Been here a couple of times and I must say I haven't been disappointed so far. One of the best mutton karahi (spiced goat meat seared on a wok) I've had in the US. The butter chicken is well-spiced, not too creamy, not too spicy and the beef seekh kebabs with a buttery naan do pack a punch. Vegetarians should try the Lahori Chhole / chaana. 

All in all SKH serves good mughlai food at affordable prices in an unpretentious setting.. 

It's a force to be reckoned with!
