jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ Friendly customer service, and GREAT food! Authentic Indian food and the taste was delicious. My girlfriend and I are both Vegan, and their menu is very accommodating. We enjoyed the Namaste sampler platter and the house specialty and both were amazing. Nice serving size for price as well. We also enjoyed a few of their deserts and had to order some to go! We will definitely be back for more! Thank you Namaste Veg Kitchen.
