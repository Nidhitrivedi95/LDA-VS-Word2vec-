2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Environment: small take out restaurant with a few tables inside (very bare bones). You can smell the restaurant from quite a distance away. 

Service: decent as far as a take out place is concerned. The person taking orders is frequently on the phone so you have to be patient. This is not fast food so if you just drop in expect a wait. They do deliver with $30 minimum. 

Food: pretty good but nothing mind blowing. Big proportions at less than $10. Spicy and cooked fresh. Vegetarian friendly.  

Tip: the medium is actually quite spicy. They do not take credit cards but they do accept debit. Order in advance.
