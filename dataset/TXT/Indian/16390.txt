was average.  The food was delivered in waves. Naan was delivered to the table at the end of the meal.  Their menu selections were adequate.

Their prices....
were okay.  The prices seemed to be in-line with the quality of their food.

Their service...
was slow and steady; food was delivered in a disjointed manner.  The server would not accept an Entertainment Book offer stating, "the 'owner' told me to not accept this offer."  Their denial of a offer to get you in their restaurant was obviously a scam.  The server also made a point to leave a cash tip when we were paying for the meal.  That was a classy touch to end the Taj experience.

Overall....
their food was average, their prices were average, their service was average and their denial to accept their offer was shady.  The overall experience gets one star because I can't select zero stars.
