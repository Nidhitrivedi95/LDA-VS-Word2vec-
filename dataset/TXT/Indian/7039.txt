They've got a variety of items on their menu for kids and for those who don't prefer Indian dishes. Other items include a number of pastas, pizza, salads, chaat, fruits, ice cream, and lots and lots of Indian food. Overall, the restaurant was clean, the service was quick, and the ambiance was casual and relaxed.
