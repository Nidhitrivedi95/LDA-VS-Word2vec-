auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Had such a great time at Taj Palace!! Our server Vick was a pleasant mixture of  cute and charming. We were first timers at Indian food, and Vick took the time to explain the dishes. An extra detail not gone unnoticed!!!!!!!!  The food was delicious, so flavorful! All in all, it was a wonderful first experience and we can't wait to go back!
