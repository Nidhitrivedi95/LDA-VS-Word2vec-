7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA I came here for a very late lunch with my boyfriend after checking out the Hot & Spicy festival over at Harbourfront Centre. Being at the Hot & Spicy festival really put us in the mood for Indian cuisine. We originally wanted to come to this place because of the their buffet lunch. But by the time we got to the restaurant we had missed the buffet lunch time and they were doing their dinner service. We ordered two dishes, a side order of rice and two side orders of their rotis. I have to say, their rotis were very good. I probably can just eat that we my meal without rice. The food I thought was very good and flavorful. The menu prices, I thought, were average. However, the service, in my opinion, was okay. But, I believe it was due to not having enough servers because the servers were all very busy. But, the servers were still very friendly and professional. I would definitely come back for more.
