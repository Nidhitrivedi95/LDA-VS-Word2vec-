FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA This is is best dosa place in the area. We also visited on their unlimited dosa night.. I ordered almost all types of dosa..service was quick.
I liked there madras special coffee which is really good. 
This restaurant is just next to the Persis biryani. So those who are vegetarians can go to madras cafe.
