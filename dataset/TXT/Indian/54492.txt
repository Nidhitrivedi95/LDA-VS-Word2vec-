W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg I've been trying out all of the Indian restaurants in Madison and the surrounding areas and stopped in for the lunch buffet at Minerva after reading the other reviews on this site. I was extremely disappointed. I arrived around 1:30-- the lunch buffet goes until 2:30-- and everything I tried was cold and looked picked-over. There was just a small amount of each of the vegetarian dishes left so I tried a little bit of all of them. The food tasted fine, but I've definitely had much better Indian food. I was hoping they might bring out some more food that would be hot, but the only food they brought out while I was there was rice. I will not be returning.
