C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Kalendar has a charming little patio that we were able to take advantage of during dinner on a Wednesday night. 

"Scroll 6" was a crepe filled with sliced roast beef, portobellos, and asiago. I forgot about the 'horseradish mayo' until someone asked about it, and even then I couldn't taste it :(

One friend ordered "Scroll 7", with the curry filling, which she described as too overpowering to taste any of our other dishes, and another ordered one of the pizzas, which she thought could have benefited from actual tomato sauce vs tomato slices.

Overall, the portion sizes were filling, the price point was decent, and service was pleasant, but...pizza on dahl-puri crust? crespelles using roti? Pshh, if that's all you're doing to be Italian/Indian fusion..step up yo game, SON
