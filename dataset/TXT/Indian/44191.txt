RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w My wife took me here for my birthday, I always wanted to check it out.  The food was amazing, I would definitely recommend the beef short ribs as well as the kebabs.  One of my fave restaurants in the city! Great food on picnic benches and paper plates, makes no sense, but totally amazing!
