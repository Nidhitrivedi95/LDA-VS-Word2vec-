It's rare to find a place that is quick, vegan, and delicious - all for a very fair price! If you're unfamiliar with Indian food terms, the menu might seem a little daunting. I got the tofu and veggies BBQ with the yellow lentil masala and wheat naan. I ordered my boyfriend (who is not vegan and maybe has had Indian food once in his life) the veggie croquettes with chana masala and naan. He loved it and ate the whole meal! I would've finished mine, but you get a TON of food when you build a BBQ meal. The leftovers were still just as fantastic the following day. I can't wait to go back to try more menu options!!
