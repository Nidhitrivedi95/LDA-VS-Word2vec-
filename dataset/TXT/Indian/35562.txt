MWffCS7UkTUj9yDMy4jaLA Here for lunch on a chilly Wednesday.  The decor and seating is very nice, and the waiters were very attentive. Not bad at all.

The food variety is only slightly less than India's Taste, by a couple of items. Naan is not as soft and fluffy as their's either. It was crispy and thin here.  The mutton and chicken is much more tender and the flavours are not bad.  However, I prefer the flavouring of the vegetarian options at India's taste more.

You have your usual items: Butter chicken, rogan josh, saag murgh, saag paneer, chili paneer, okra, etc.  Samosas need real work. Small, oily, and not crisp.  They have soups, but I think it is for the one who don't enjoy India food: cream of mushroom, and tomato soup. Salad bar is reasonable, as is the chaat. But there is a lack of fruits. The curries are quite mild, but still flavourful. And the food is hot and fresh.

Dessert was not bad.  Kheer was a bit thick, but delicious. I like the rasmalai here much better than at India's taste.  It was sweet, and not excessively so. The texture was soft, fluffy, and not as tough as at the other restaurant.  Gulab Jamun was what I expected, and since I love these three desserts, I have zero complaints.

The pricing is 11.99 for lunch (used to be 9.99). For the price, seating, atmosphere, is reasonable. But food, I prefer India's Taste for selection and flavour.  Though I must say, I really enjoyed the saag and chili paneer here.
