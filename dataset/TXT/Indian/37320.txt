o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg We've had takeout from here before and it was good. But this was maybe the worst Indian buffet I've ever had. Mostly meat. Flavors were off. Some of it obviously sat for a while (we got there at 1:15). Wait staff is rude... Our "waitress" had ear buds in. They didn't even ask if we wanted anything other than the buffet. I'm guessing most of the good reviews for this place are unrelated to the buffet. Leave a wide berth.

Update: as we were leaving, another member of the staff was rude. 1 star now and won't get takeout again.
