-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw If you're on a budget and happen to be downtown, this is the spot to go to. ­For $10 tax included, you get a large platter that's enough to share for two (trust me, it's more than enough because the food is really filling).

The location is at Guy Concordia, conveniently close to the metro.  The standout dish is the curry lamb...like where else can you get lamb for $10? You can even get a mimosa for only $1! 

However, the room is a bit small, resembles an unkempt fast food restaurant. The naan bread can be a bit greasy, but still good. 

My bottom line opinion is to definitely treat yourself on a cold winter day if you're downtown.  I've officially found my go-to Indian food spot.
