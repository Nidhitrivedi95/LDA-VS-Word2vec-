auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ GREAT food. TERRIBLE service.
The only reason for a 2 star vs. 1 star rating is the quality of the food.

My experience was a series of questions as follows.
Seated. Only question the server asked "You ready to order?" 
After not being asked if we'd like something to drink. "Can I please have a soda and place my offer?"
"Can I please have a refill?"
"Can we have a few boxes?"
"Can we have a bag for the boxes?"
"Can we have the bill?"

We literally had to ask for anything and everything we wanted while there were only 6 tables seated, so not busy at all.
I watched the servers joking around and staring at all of us while they should have been working. 
Oh and did I add that this was on a Saturday night? The busiest night, so if service was like this then imagine any other night?!

The only reason I'd go back is for the garlic naan and Paneer Tikka Masala.
If you've got time to kill waiting for everything, check them out.
