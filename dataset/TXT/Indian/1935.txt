-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ We had a family coming in from Vegas and wanted a good indian restaurant so we decided to go to Kwality since it was closer to the airport, about 5-10mins away. So once our family arrived we decided to grab their chaat papri which is crunchy chips with chutney yogurt and chickpeas, it was devoured quickly. Then we grabbed their chana bhatura which is "their thing" and grabbed 4 taali's ( you choose any 3 veggie with your choice of traditional indian dessert) it comes with rice and small salad. You order your naan bread or roti on the side. Also, we grabbed butterchicken on the side. Everything was exceptional and we were all so full with leftovers. The atmosphere is friendly and spacious. Need a good indian food place, check this place out in Brampton.
