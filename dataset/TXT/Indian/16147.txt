Dd1w7xR7Xs3bthwusgy33Q My wife and I needed out Indian fix so Lotus Deli was chosen. We tried the Paneer Butter Masala, Dahi Puri, and Bhatura. The Paneer Butter Masala deliciously creamy and flavorful (spicy too!). The Paneer was fresh and it went well with Roti and Bhatura we had. The Bhatura itself had a great fry and wasn't oily at all (another great sign!). Lastly, the Dahi Puri was probably my favorite, as they were filled to the brim with delicious yogurt/potatoes and a great sauce. While the Dahi Puri was very filling, it still gave you a lasting feeling of freshness when you finished.

Overall, will definitely be returning to try out some more Indian food goodness.
