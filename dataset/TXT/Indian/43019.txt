rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA La Sani Grill has some very decent lunch specials. I ordered the Reshmi Kabob with 2 skewers of meat, salad and choice of either rice or naan. Food is flavourful, but I expected a slightly bigger portion for $8.49

Dining room is very well done though, romantic setting for couples. I'd hand em four stars, but three for the portion. Still a very good restaurant.
