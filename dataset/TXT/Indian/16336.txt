DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA We had never tried Indian food before.  Since we were new to vegan eating, we found this place through YELP.  The service was excellent.  We had Roti w/olive oil and garlic which was awesome.  For the entrees we had the eggplant w/potatoes, tomatoes and onions as well as the veggie kafta which were good as well.  We went mild but probably could have done medium spice.  Highly recommend.
