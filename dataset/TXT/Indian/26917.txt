iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Our first experience with  Indian food and it was Awesome. The server was knowledgeable and the ambiance was appropriate. The food was flavorful and the depth of the textures makes me wish I could have spent all day eating there. This is a fantastic experience and I will not only return, but I will be sure to bring others too!
