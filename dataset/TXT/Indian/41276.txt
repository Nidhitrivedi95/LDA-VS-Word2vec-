PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ I started recently Loving Indian food! But couldn't find the place to say I want to come here often.. until I stepped into Tandoori Flame. This place is Amazing! The flavors are Amazing, I just love almost Everything literally and they cook it fresh and the dessert is even Amazing! I live about Less then 10 minute drive from this place and I have to go to this restaurant at least once or 2-3 times a month here. Yeah, its that good! If you like Indian food and want a variety of other food. Come here! The one in Mississauga location is delicious as well.. I prefer the Mississauga location because of the atmosphere/ambiance but Both are good! I find the chefs at the Missisauga location a bit better but again both of them are good lol.
