h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA Over rated on Yelp. Mediocre at best. Naan served hot but dry.  I love the aromatic spices used in Indian food but here the hot spices prevail making all the dishes taste the same. Mushroom mattar and vindoo chicken were good. Chicken masala sauce too thin. Saag Paneer below average. 

Overall there's much better in the valley. Unfortunately the best one closed last year.
