Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I did a takeout from this place and ordered the chicken saagh (rice included) and onion kulcha via the phone.  The order was ready when I arrived.
The chicken was moist and the dish wasn't spicy per my request.  The entree was delicious.  The onion kulcha was very salty (I think they accidentally put the salt twice) but the chicken was fantastic.  I'd have given them a four-star for a quick service and food taste.  But due to the onion kulcha being very salty I'm dropping a star.
