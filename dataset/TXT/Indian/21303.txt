GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Good price, good portions and good flavor. You know it can be wrong if a lot of indians go have dinner there. Go wild and order things you haven't tried (forget the names that ring a bell).

I can't remember the names of what we ordered, but it was really tasty. Now they have a larger place with more tables.
