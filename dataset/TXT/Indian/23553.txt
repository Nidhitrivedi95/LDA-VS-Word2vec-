gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Had a great experience here! Not really a fan of Indian food but this place changed my mind. Loved the recommended chicken tiki marsala and korma. Also their rice pudding was fantastic. In addition the staff is very welcoming and helpful. Overall 5 stars! I will definitely come back again!
