h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw I am not much of a Yelp reviewer but after my experience here I had no choice but to write a review and let the public know about the food being served here.

I have been going to Prince of India since my freshmen years ago and I had nothing but postive experiences for years but today may be my last day after what I found in my takeout buffet box.

I ordered the buffet for takeout and as I was enjoying my lunch at home I found a MOSTLY EATEN SOGGY, CHEWED UP, NAAN in my chicken...Nope, not my own naan that I got because I had two FULL pieces of naan that I had previously already finished. I immediately stopped eating and just threw the rest away as my appetitie was now gone.

Now how does a chewed up, eaten naan get into FRESHLY COOKED FOOD that is brought out often for the buffet? Well either someone was trying to sabotage the business which is highly unlikely because just why would someone do that or like other shady buffet restaurants, they REUSE FOOD brought back to the kitchen. 

There is absolutely NO REASON why leftover food brought back into the kitchen should go ANYWHERE NEAR freshly cooked food unless it is done on purpose. I am sorry but there is simply NO EXCUSE for this type of behavior.
