OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Ordered food using the Bite Squad app at 6:30 PM only to receive it at 8 PM. Driver says he was waiting for the food for more than 30 mins. Ordered pao bhaji, naan, veg kathi roll, veg fried rice and chicken parda biryani. None of the dishes were exceptional - we were able to eat it because we were extremely hungry, wudn't suggest anyone to eat there.
