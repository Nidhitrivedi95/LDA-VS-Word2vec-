FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw We have been there a few times. The restaurant is very nice and clean. The staff are super friendly and are very helpful at making suggestions. Last order we tried the naan and it was sub-par. The butter chicken, vindaloo and other entrees are very tasty.  A little pricey but would definitely make this an Indian staple for the area!
