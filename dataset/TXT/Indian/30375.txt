K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Came here today for lunch buffet after seeing the good Yelp ratings.  Was disappointed it wasn't as good as expected.  Paneer was a bit tough and dry, tandori chicken was boiled and then baked, sauce was very rich so fills you up quickly.  It's more pricey than other Indian buffets with better food and selection.
