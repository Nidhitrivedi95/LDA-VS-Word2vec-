Rk82QHtWp268GM93qWj3dQ At lunch they have a really good buffet and for those who like it spicy this is it!.  I have ordered off the menu also and have been really pleased.  One of the ways I judge a restaurant for authenticity is to look around and see how many of the customers are from the ethnic group the restaurant represents and this one is always crowded with Indians.
