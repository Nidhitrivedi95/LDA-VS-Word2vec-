NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg We must have driven my Choolaah a million times before we stopped in. We usually eat at Bowl of Pho when we hit the east side. Boy was I happy Bowl of Pho was closed on Tuesdays because we went in to try Choolaah! First thoughts was...someone put a lot of work into this place. I love how you can see right into the kitchen and prep area.

We grabbed a menu but had no idea what we wanted so we just walked up to the register. We must have looked confused because the gentleman with glasses asked if it was our first time. He called to the kitchen for some samples. Smart move, dude! We tasted them and YUM! So we ended up ordering what he suggested. We ordered Veggie Masala & Chicken Biryani. 

the colors were amazing, The smell was awesome. The taste was out of this world! I suggest grabbing a spoon. So much easier to eat this yummy food with. We ended up going back a week later to try the chicken Tikka Masala and a side of Veggie Masala. 

Choolaah is a must stop if you are heading to the east side of Cleveland.
