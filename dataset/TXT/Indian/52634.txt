uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Came here with two friends who are avid Indian food lovers. We each picked a dish and shared - spinach paneer, lamb saag and black lentil daal. We also got chicken biryani as a side, papadum and naan (my friends have no gluten concerns). We started with vegetable pakoras, which were good flavour wise, however, seemed to be more dough than vegetables. The main dishes were all very different. The spinach paneer seem to be very bland, especially in comparison to the lamb saag and daal. We all enjoyed the chicken biryani. My friends said the naan was good and the papadum was good too. Service was quick and attentive. Overall, good dining experience. 
I'm not sure I'll be racing back though. I think there are equally as good or potentially better Indian restaurant options in the city I need to check out.
