7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ I wasn't super impressed with this experience since Aroma just blew me away a few weeks ago. 

I ordered a Goan breeze to start, was pretty good. It was like a strong piña colada. We started off with gobi manchurian and were sadly disappointed. Gobi manchurian is supposed to have this crunchy texture. It's almost like you shouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and orange chicken which was just lacking here. 

The we ordered the malai kofta and goat pepper fry. The malai kofta had 4 small, round dumplings and the sweetness of the dish overpowered the spice. On the other hand, the goat dish was so spicy it couldn't be finished. We also ordered the chicken biriyani. It had good flavors but was also lacking in heat. 

The waiters didn't check on us once nor asked the desired spice levels of our dishes. This is experience was ok but not amazing.
