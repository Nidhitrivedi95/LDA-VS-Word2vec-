DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew By far the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to, the flavors were so vibrant and fine tuned, the vegetarian samosa trio is to die for. I am so happy to have found this place, best restaurant in the west, nothing compares, by the way finish it up with a nice spicy Thai tea, wow! I can't wait to come back.
