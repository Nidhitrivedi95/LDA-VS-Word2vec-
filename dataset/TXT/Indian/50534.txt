UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Love this place! I've been here a couple of times and the food is delicious. You also pay less compared to the other Indian restaurants in Toronto. I have tried the chicken pakoras, cauliflowers pakoras, meat platters (thali) with chicken korma, beef rogan josh. I like the naan as it is a bit thinner and not too heavy - perfect for my liking. Try this place - you won't be disappointed!
