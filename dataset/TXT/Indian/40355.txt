pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA In one of my reviews I had made earlier, I had mentioned that this place was expensive for the quantity they served. I went for the breakfast buffet today, and I only paid 10.99$, which is cheaper than other places I've been to. The quality of food at other places (for buffet) is not that great. Whereas over here, every dosa served was crisp and fresh with that lovely ghee taste. 

They had a good variety at the buffet table. They had Idly, Channa, Dosa, Chicken gravy, Coffee, Rasam, Sambar and so on. All the basic dishes from South India.

I would definitely come back to this place. Everything was good, from the quality of food to the pricing.

Unfortunately, I couldn't click pictures this time since I didn't really have time. The breakfast buffet closes at 12 pm and I reached there at 11:35 am. I just went straight to stuffing my face with food. So, sorry about that. 

They served coffee for breakfast as well, which was an added bonus. No place serves coffee or tea as part of their buffet menu.
