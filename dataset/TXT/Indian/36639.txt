NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg A friend picked up carry out for a group. I had the paneer tikka masala. It was delicious! Everyone was raving about the meals they were eating from salads to traditional. 

Sounds like a fun place to take kids with the hand sanitizer fountain of some sort. I haven't seen it but heard about it. 

Will be checking it out in person soon.
