PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Back again. I have to say, I think the food has only gotten better. The baklava still bites, however. Still. Who goes to a Indian restaurant for baklava. The tandoori chicken is nicely spiced. Loads of stuff your typical whitey diner accustomed to naan and butter chicken won't recognize. Went Wednesday night to celebrate my second real job in show business and the fact this time I didn't almost lose a finger schlepping a 6' unicycle. Ten fingers. Still got 'em. You're free to count them next Elite Event. Really. I insist. The place was quite packed. Might be some pre-Christmas celebrations. Do Indian people celebrate Christmas? What do I know? 

Only down side is you have to ask about three times to get your bill. On the way out we saw some other patrons complaining they were waiting a long time to get their bill. Actually, they looked like they had given up waiting and were just about to walk out (a thought that had occurred to me after 20 minutes of waiting) but at the last minute their conscience got to them and they decided maybe to give it one last try by asking the hostess.

So. Budget about 20-30 minutes to get your bill. Probably best to ask for it at the start of your meal and gently explain last time you were here you had to wait a long time so could you get the process rolling now? Remember, it's buffet so not like they can spit in your food.
