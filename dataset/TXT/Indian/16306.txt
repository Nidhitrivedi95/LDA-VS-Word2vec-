DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA Still on my list for dinner!  However, not the best lunch decision. Yes, the food is still good, but they have only 5 or so lunch specials. They feature one curry and rice for around $6.95. If you aren't really in the mood for one of those 5 items, you will be getting a dinner entree with dinner pricing. For lunch, I can't help it, I love my Indian buffet or at least a nice, cheap thali. The thali here is $14 for lunch, and in my thrifty mind, I am thinking a $7 thali is what sounds lunchable. So if you're going to go, I think it is better as a dinner spot. Date night!
