zzCsh8Rx40ZXcyDrzFnfOQ We went there last weekend for a lunch buffet. The food is delicious and is home quality; however, there are not many options. They had 4 curries and tandoori chicken, a very basic salad (just lettuce and carrots), naan and very basic indian dessert. All in all, it is very basic Indian food. Nothing special. Good for casual weekday lunch.
