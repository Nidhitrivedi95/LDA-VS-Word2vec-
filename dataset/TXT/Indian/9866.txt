9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw My sister in law stopped eating meat during her pregnancy. So I thought what the hell? Indian food is the only option for me to have a decent meal without meat. The vegetarian combo they serve is very authentic and service was great . Just wish the place was a bit cheaper. But over all I keep coming back every now and then. Never tried the lunch buffet. Worth a visit
