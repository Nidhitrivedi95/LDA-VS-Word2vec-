dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q Went to the Indian Hut for dinner. Was greeted nicely . The selection is few. You have the staples such as butter chicken, goat curry, tandoori chicken. For veg you have chickpeas,eggplant, mixed vegetable , rice. A few appetizers. The food is so so.  Nothing special. The price is high and the tip which they suggest is aggressive. 
I have been to countless buffets all over GTA and this is  quite forgetable. Then again it is downtown Toronto and getting a decent priced Indian buffet is probably out of question.
And also the people who are fascinated by the food and are giving it 5 stars, have you been to other Indian buffets or is your choice limited to downtown only because you are missing out then.
