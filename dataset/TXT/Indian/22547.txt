gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg We tried Ruchi for lunch today.  We're vegan and love Indian food.  This lunch buffet was so freaking good!!  There was so much that we were able to eat.  The options were varied and delicious and the staff was super accommodating.  We also got the pleasure of meeting and chatting with Raj while there.  He's a good dude serving good food.  It's a little out of the way for us but we all agreed we'd happily travel the distance to visit again and check out more of the menu.  

P.S.  The water was delicious!  No skunky, dirty line tap water here.  Only the good stuff!
