kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I did take out from here a few nights ago. Ok, so I called in the order, veggie samosa, chicken tikka masala and plain naan.  I went with the medium high heat for the chicken because I couldn't get an answer from the guy on the phone as to what "Indian heat" was. Anyways, I found the flavors right on from what I remembered about my last Indian food experience. It's been a while. Nice heat with the chicken and a nice amount of food too. A little pricey but overall a good experience. Next time I'm going for the "Indian heat" option!
