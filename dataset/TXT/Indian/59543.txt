ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ So we are here at Curry Bowl that used to be Mirchi and that used to be Bay Laaf. Well, this change in name and ownership how this place sucks. It took us 15 minutes to get a menu and 30 min for a drink. We are now waiting for our food for 40 min. Even if you nothing better to do, just don't come here.
