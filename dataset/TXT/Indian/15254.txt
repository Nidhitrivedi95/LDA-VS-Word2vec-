CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA Called in a take out order. They made me something for me that was not on the menu. Warm greeting. The food was sealed really well it would not spill in my car. Everything was awesome and this is coming from someone who grew up on this food in the UK. Rice was fluffy, tender chicken. Great Nan bread and good popadums. Great portions, so have lunch for tomorrow. Will go back soon. Highly recommend.
