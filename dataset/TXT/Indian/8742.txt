7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA I came here because, as usual, there was an hour long take out line at Khao San Road. Needless to say, my spirits were low and my expectations were high. Fortunately, I got a whiff of this Aroma, and walked upstairs to see what it was all about. 

Right off the bat, I could tell I made the right choice. The staff were friendly and set me up with a spot despite the fact that I was taking my food to go. I ordered the lamb korma and some samosas, the latter of which I decided to eat on the spot - and even though they were so hot that they literally burned the skin off the inside of my mouth, I couldn't stop eating them. Arguably the best samosas I've had in the past 17 months. The crispiness, the filling, the sauces. I could eat nothing but these for the rest of my life and I could die happy. I'd probably die early, but at least it would be with a smile on my face. 

I brought the lamb korma back to my hotel and it was everything you could ever want in a dish. Creamy, flavourful and with HUGE pieces of lamb. They definitely don't skimp on ingredients here, which in and of itself merits a 5-star review. 

So anyway, now I'm in a food coma, just listening to the jazz station the the previous guest forgot to turn off. Or maybe the hotel turns it on before guests get to their rooms. I dunno and it doesn't matter. The point is, go eat here. You'll love it.
