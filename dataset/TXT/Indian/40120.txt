PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw Namaste is one of my two favourite places to eat as someone with Coeliac in Edinburgh. The delicious food is enough to get them to 4 stars alone, but the fact that they use gram (chickpea) flour means I can eat their poppadoms and their pakora! That definitely takes them up to the 5 star range for me.

I have come here dozens of times and I have never had a gluten reaction. They are my tried-and-true, my go-to place.  I love Namaste!
