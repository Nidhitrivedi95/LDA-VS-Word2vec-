HY5IM3dzUgO8yNgi9c0DIw I tried their buffet lunch and surprisingly was very good. Their buffet lunch starts at 11:30am and ends at 3:30pm. There are not many choices for the buffet but the quality is good. Monday to Friday price is 8.99 and weekends is two dollar more. The taste of the butter chicken is very good. They are lacking vegetable curry and if they had it I think the buffet would be even better. I would definitely come back here for lunch.
