TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw This is not the best Indian food in Vegas, I'm disappointed to say. 

The Buffet has not changed since folks last reviewedin fact it was the same lineup, the service was poor, I asked the waiter for Garam Masala rice, basic White Basmati with hot spices, but he could not make it happen.

My family had never been to an Indian place and they loved it, could not stop talking about finally eating the lamb, got to love the Holidays.

Final review:
Basic Indian Buffet, 10 per person is an expensive lunch in this town, could be done a lot better, One Star
