nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ I've finally had the opportunity to come check out this restaurant!  3 course prix fixe dinner for $25 is not very common, so how good can it be?  

Appetizers: Chicken lollipops and quail.  Both were very tasty, presented nicely, and garnished with lots of fresh fruits.  They each had a unique flavour from the seasonings used.  

Mains: Liver and pork chop.  The portions were huge.  I really enjoyed the giant, double cut pork chop.  The mains were accompanied with big servings of vegetables which is fantastic.  Don't you hate it when you just get a few strands of something and nothing else?  Here, there's a little bit of everything.  Fancy carrot, green beans, white asparagus, yellow peppers, beet, and broccoli.  However, I did notice that the panko crust on the liver was a tad oily and was ever so slightly burnt.  I didn't send it back because we were just too hungry.  The liver though, was nice and tender, I hate it when liver is overcooked.  

Desserts:  Lindt chocolate ice cream and mango panna cotta.  The ice cream was bordering a soft serve texture.  I was really stuffed at this point but I still ate the panna cotta too.  

Lovely people who cook everything to order.  You might have to wait a bit, but it's worth it.  The variety of fruits and vegetables was truly impressive.
