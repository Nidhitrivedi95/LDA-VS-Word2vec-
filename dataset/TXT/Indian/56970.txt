xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I love traditional native American fry bread and this place does a great job as well.  I ordered the green chilli stew and loved the spicy flavor could not stop eating it and loved dipping the fry bread in the chilli.  My wife ordered the Pozole and loved it, again great natural authentic southwest flavors whats not to love.  The only negatives are non food issues in my opinion.  Limited drink selection, and close far too early for a downtown Saturday night in my opinion (9pm)!
