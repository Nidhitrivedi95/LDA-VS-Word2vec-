GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg I know that indian and pakistani food is hot, but why can't restaurants learn to tone it down a bit.  I can tolerate some heat, but if a medium is too hot for me to eat, that is bad.  If you like hot food you probably will like the food.  Quality and flavor were otherwise good.  The portions were generous.  My wife got chicken tikka marsala, extra mild, she could not eat it but it was fine for me - good flavor.  Samosas were good, nice cardamom and cumin flavor.

No ambiance. now this normally does not bother me, in fact my idea of a good ethnic restaurant is great food and no ambiance.  However, minimal or no air conditioning would have made eating there unpleasant.  Try take out.
