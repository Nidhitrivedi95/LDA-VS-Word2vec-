NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ I dined here two days in a row when I came to Edinburgh. The waiter, the guy who usually serves the front (no hat and who says "yeah" many times), was super kind and attentive. I ordered biryani 2 days in a row because it was THAT good. It may be a bit expensive to dine here but it was worth the money.

Note to management: DON'T CHOP A HUNDRED ONIONS DOWNSTAIRS NEAR THE BATHROOM WHEN THERE IS A FULL HOUSE! Diners, myself included, had very irritated eyes and it ruined the experience a bit. One girl was even crying. So, I would appreciate it if you would cut onions before you open the restaurant, or when the restaurant isn't jam packed. Thank you.
