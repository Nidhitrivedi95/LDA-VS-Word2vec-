bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug I love their chilli chicken, however my body disagrees with that oppinion. The food is decent the prices are good, the service is quick and poliet, they check up on you without smothering you, the atmosphere is nice but far from prenencious. 

All in all a decent place to to go get hacka chinese (or however you spell it). I'm not blown away by anything in particular but you know. I recomend it
