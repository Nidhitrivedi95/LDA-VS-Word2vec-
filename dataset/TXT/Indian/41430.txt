Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Still looking to be blown away by some subcontinental food in Madison but it has yet to happen. Someone needs to sack up and bring some heat to the table, I feel like I'm back in England with all this bland tikka masala.

I've been here for the lunch buffet and it is pretty standard. The panak paneer, naan, and channa daal are probably the highlights. Steer clear of the fish completely and any of the fried food unless you are there at opening time
