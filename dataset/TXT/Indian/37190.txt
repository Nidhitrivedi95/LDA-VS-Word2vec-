o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ Tried a little bit of their Lamb and Chicken Vindaloo and Shrimp Tikka Masala Roti,
The Vindaloo's were great. The flavor of the curry was awesome. 
We had order a spice level 3 and although i can handle really spicy foods, this had my mouth on fire. I would highly recommend go with spice level 2 or lower and work your way up.
But definitely also try their Masala Fries.
2 thumbs up, but be very careful of their spices. Can't wait to try them again.
