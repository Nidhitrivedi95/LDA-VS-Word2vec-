ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I had the pleasure of dining at this establishment Saturday night (01/29/2010) for the Queen's Feast Restaurant Week. For my first visit I loved the ambience, the service and all 3 courses of the meal presented. I had heard wonderful things about this restaurant and the lived up to each one of them plus more. The flavors were awesome for the moderately priced food with upscale taste. The menu for restaurant week was a special menu, but I say ask for the cocktail called a Narada, hopefully the bartender will make it for you. Great place and I'll be back! :)
