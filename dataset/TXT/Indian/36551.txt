NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I have come to make Choolaah a normal stop on the way home. The food is amazing, the environment is very low stress, the design is beautiful, and the staff are awesome! 

Every time I come here, it's busy, but the staff are well versed in what they do and are able to efficiently and accurately deliver a great dining experience!

At this restaurant, you will encounter a counter service style ordering experience. The menu is very uncomplicated, yet gives you a great variety of options to pick from. The restaurant is properly staffed to handle any amount of "rush" that they may get during the day. I have never had to wait more than 8 minutes for my food to be prepped and released to me. Expect a very casual dining experience. I would consider pricing to be consistent with Chipotle. 

The only qualm that I would have with this place is the parking lot, mainly getting in and out. I can't fault the restaurant for that, however, as Chagrin Blvd. is a nightmare in civil engineering to begin with, so I didn't account for that in the star rating.
