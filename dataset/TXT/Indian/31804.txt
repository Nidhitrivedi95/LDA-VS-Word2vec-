kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g My friend Tina T. invited me to join her for a Wine and Henna event that they host Thursday nights during the summer. For $10 you get your 1st glass of wine and a henna design. While here we also sampled from their Happy Hour menu. I have to say I was absolutely impressed with the Tofu app and the garlic naan. We also tried a chickpea ceviche, the chicken tika and the tandoori wings. Again of all those the tofu was my favorite. 

The lady doing the henna designs was amazingly detailed. Very traditional henna designs with a paste that turned a very beautiful dark burgundy brown. 

While it is not your "traditional" indian cuisine, all the wonderful flavors are present. The last thing I want to eat when it is 120 deg out is heavy Saags or cream laden indian dishes. The dishes here are light and flavorful. 

I look forward to going back to another Wine and Henna event and would not hesitate stopping in for a bite to eat if in the area.
