LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw I love Indian food and the only indian restaurant I knew of was Taj Palace around the corner. We have been going to island sushi for poke but decided to try out OM Restaurant next door. Prices are awesome. Customer service was awesome. Was very satisfied with all the food. We loved the chicken biriyani and the tandori chicken. They are a must try. Will be coming back soon!!!
