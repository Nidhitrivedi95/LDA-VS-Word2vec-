I'm not at all happy with the fact that the dishes do not come with rice or nan... all you get is a bowl of whatever is described in the menu.  They are already on the pricey side and you don't even get a complete dish... No one is going to eat a spicy saucy dish without rice and/or bread.  They know this, and sell them separately to make it seem as if the place isn't as expensive as it is.

I had the dahl chicken (lentil chicken) which was described on the menu to be a "healthy dish."  However, it was positively swimming in oil, which I did not appreciate.  The flavor was good.

Also, the nan came to the table so greased up that I had to send it back for a fresh and plain nan.  Then it was very good.

A friend had the lamb bhuna, and there were a couple of really tough pieces in there.  The flavor was good/average.

The chicken tandoori was really good and flavorful.  

What I do like is that when food is ready, the cook rings a bell so that the waiters know to come pick it up so that it isn't cold when brought to the table.
