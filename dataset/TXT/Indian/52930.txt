However I've ordered for the table three times now and because not everyone can deal with Indian heat I order it to be as low in heat as possible and they have constantly ignored my request. To add to that I've ordered take out twice and they forgot an item both times. The last time was my the final straw. I called the restaurant and a man told me he didn't believe me and insisted I take a picture of my order before he would refund the money for the item he forgot. He also refused to bring the missing item to me. Poor service. Taste of India in Bloomfield/Lawerenceville is ten times better in every way.
