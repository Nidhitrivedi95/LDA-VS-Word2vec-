_n5gPknmF6_WBrFngFb21w Excellent food. We ordered the Simhapuri Mutton and Chicken fried rice. Both were excellent. Was thoroughly impressed with how well cooked and juicy the mutton was. Being a food connoisseur, I am always on the lookout for good mutton (goat) curries. This preparation has ensured that we'll be going back to try other items out. The ambiance was good and the entire team was very warm and welcoming. Hopefully, they maintain their quality in the long run unlike many other Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area which lost their initial sheen after getting a good Customer base...
