jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Love this place. My girlfriend and I will always do the "where should we eat..." back and forth trying to think of a place we are both craving. One of us will suggest Lazeez and it's not long before we start placing our order. We always end up getting Lazeez. It's so perfect! We probably eat there on a weekly basis.

She always gets the aloo gobhi and I always get chicken vindaloo, can't recommend those enough. Great gyros as well! Staff is always helpful and friendly when I call in.
