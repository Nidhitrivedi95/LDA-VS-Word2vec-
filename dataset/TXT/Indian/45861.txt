SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg We were staying in Vegas and called in advance to see if they were still going to be open when we arrived. Our $20 cab ride over was horrible enough, but when we got there, the sign said OPEN and we walked inside before their closing time. The owner told us he had sent everyone home and there was no way to accomodate us. They decided to close early regardless of the fact that they told us to still come in. Horrible treatment, leaving us still hungry and having to pay another $20 to return to our hotel. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!! The owner had no compassion or willingness to rectify the situation, and basically shut the door on us.
