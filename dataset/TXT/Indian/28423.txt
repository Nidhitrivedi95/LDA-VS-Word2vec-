1. The Chicken Tikka served was RAW. The inside was beyond pink. I'm shocked it was served it was so clearly undercooked.

2. The water glass on our table was broken and sharp 
3. Half my plate was dirty from the previous meal
4. Asked and waited repeatedly for wine. You'd think after the above incidents we'd never be without beverages...

Concerned this place lacks quality control. I'm scared what would be found in the kitchen.
