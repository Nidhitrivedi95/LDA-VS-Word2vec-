gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is the first time I had the REAL delicious Indian food in the US and surprised to find the spot in Vegas. We were starving and the last thing we wanted was good food and this place totally served it !! We were warmly welcomed by the owner Prakash. Keep up the good quality of the food and service :)
