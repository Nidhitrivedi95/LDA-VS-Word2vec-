JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Just concluded a very nice dinner with friends at Aroma.
The services was outstanding, the naan was nice, thin and crisp and the chicken meat was flawlessly white and good.

The service was outstanding and all prices were very reasonable - approx $10.99 for most entrees.

I can highly recommend this restaurant!!
Keep it up.
