UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg had the pala paneer and chicken..something.
really very good.
the palak dish was on the milder side of spices, but they made it at a good level spice- they let you choose.  i chose hot, as opposed to the hottest choice, "very hot"
it was spicy enough to be tasty but not too spicy to overpower the flavour.
the chicken was VERY good.
I suggest you eat the meat dishes here..the spices seem to pack more punch.

just shy of a five star place, for me.
