PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ We ordered the butter chicken. Creamy and rich and one of those things with a deceiving name. Butter chicken contains no butter, like the chickpea, where it is neither chick nor pea, but unlike Chop Suey, chopped and busting with suey.


Lamb Korma. Not gamey at all as the yogurt marinade probably cuts most of it out even though the bone is still in.


Chicken Jalfraizi. Really really fragrant and a bit tangy. The chicken was a bit dry as I can imagine white meat was used, but would have probably tasted a lot better had they used dark meat.
