abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg Everything tasted fantastic! We did a Chef's tasting menu for $45/pp and weren't sure what to expect. But every dish we had was delicious. I'm not a big fan of coconut, but the flavour was never overpowering. And each dish had a good balance of heat. The cocktails were good too. The chicken 685 was my favourite & a must-try. 

Service was great! The server also asked us which dishes on the menu we wanted to try most and he made sure that we got it. The only downside was that we were given 1 ice cream to share among 3 girls for dessert...A bigger portion or individual desserts, would have been better. 

Would definitely return!
