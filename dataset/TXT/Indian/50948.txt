uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw I hope and wish the owner/management is reading this review!!I'm sorry you all are running a very bad show!Poor management, chaotic ordering and beyond dirty bathroom!!!You are giving this legendary name and a very bad image!!

So on a Saturday night me and my husband walk in to try their food..order is chaotically taken by two different ladies who really had no knowledge about their own menu!I ordered a deal 5 with Malia tikkah and she said we don't keep that?!?!I literally had to to show her the hand menu in order to for her to place my order!Second we ordered a haleem combo!!

While I was waiting for the food I used their restrooms which were dirty/filthy beyond disgust!Thankfully I just went in them to wash my hand pre-food! :-/


Our number was soon called and we went up to collect the food.Even dine-ins are given in togo packing with disposable plates to eat.There was again confusion and the staff literally began to feel the food from the bags to verify if it was our order?!!It all seemed quite chaotic and badly run!!

Tables were dirty and we had to call the lady to clean it up for us!For me that just breaks the deal!!

The Malia tikkah tasted pretty good but the paratha was pretty average!!The haleem lacked flavor and salt!!I wasn't quite excited with the flavoring of the food!Their zardas and firni are pretty good!I have tried their biryani before at a friends place and wasn't quite impressed!!Its got too much of masala in it where as the actual Student locations in Karachi don't put so much masala on their biryanis, I have had student biryani at least 20/30 times in Karachi so I know what I'm talking about!!!

Lastly owners on a Saturday night pls keep adults behind the counters and not high school going kids!!This place has potential but lots needs to be corrected and workerd upon!!
