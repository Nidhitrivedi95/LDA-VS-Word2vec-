JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I have traveled across the country & Indian food is always one of my favorite cuisines to try. Ever since I have had the food (buffet & a la carte) from Aroma, I have fallen in love with the place. It is absolutely very authentic in its flavor, it always makes me feel as I'm eating my moms specialty dishes.
