Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Tis delicious. They've made an awkward space work. Their chicken 65 is more flavorful and much bigger than Maharani's. I also enjoy their chicken malai more. Chicken Tikka Masala is also delicious but Maharani wins in this category. The gulab jamun is more eggy flavor here and the mango ice cream is not as creamy. 

It's great but not as great as Maharani.
