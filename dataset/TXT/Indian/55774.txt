X46mymnTc04uhlXPqmq7qw The worst biryani I have ever had! A few months ago after hearing some reviews from people I know stating that this is the best South Indian biryani, I drove to Scarborough from Etobicoke to try this place. I lived in South India so I know my South Indian food. This was the WORST biryani I have ever had. I have never made biryani but I am pretty sure that I can make better biryani. It was so bland. I will never go back.
