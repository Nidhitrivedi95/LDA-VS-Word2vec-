LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw so, first things first:
1. i'm a visitor from the west coast but lived on the east coast pretty mch all my life so I do know what good Indian food should taste like, unlike the crap we get on the west coast
2. we had the buffet sunday night
3. we'd only had nasty airport food since the morning
Now, even though you'd think ..airport food...maybe thats why she's appreciating this a whole lot....to the contrary...that may be a factor, but not the factor..
food was awesome, not too greasy, and very flavor ful, also surprizingly had chaat, my fav panipuri. I'm not sure where the "45 item" came in? i didn't see that many...we had:
-panipuri
-some salad, and the most awesome red colored onion chutney 
-naan
-basmati rice
-gobi aloo
-bhindi masala
-butter chicken
-chili paneer
-dosa
-idli
-sambar
all of it was d-e-l-i-s-h..very authentic and very very good...great service, great food, great price...wknd dinner buffet for 2 for 26 including tax?? damn you can't beat that..  then again i'm used to paying 19.95 per person fora dinner buffet u stand in wait for 45 mins, and end up having to eat south indians trying to cook north indian food..and fudging up every dish..
ok enough venting - eat here, its good.
