OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g WORST place to celebrate Diwali. They posted a photo on Facebook about a delicious Diwali dinner buffet. They had 5 items. This is not a buffet. One of the items was simply sliced onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. There are so many great Diwali dished they are missing, and the food that they made for the buffet was not very good. Some of the food was even cold. Being that I have been to India during Diwali before, I have a great idea of what Diwali is like and what the food/street food is like. This was a poor attempt to give an impression of Diwali street foods. During Diwali, there are a lot of sweet foods eaten. This restaurant did not even provide a single gulab jamun. No sweet foods at all. That is the least they could have done. There were other customers at the restaurant who were also excited to try the buffet and were shocked to see the terrible variety. This is not a "mouth watering buffet" as described, and it is not fair to call such, a buffet. Due to the poor selection of Diwali food, I would NEVER go back to the restaurant. I had high expectations seeing a vast amount of great reviews. If you are going to make a "miniature selection of foods", please do not label it as a dinner buffet as that is a misleading term, and I left to go and eat a REAL DINNER, afterwards. Also, if you are going to serve very few items, please atleast do it well. They did not even serve the basics, such as basmati rice or naan. They were also OUT OF mango chutney, another basic item. Mt. Everest buffet, Origin India, and Taj Palace are way better. I hope this place has good food on a normal day? Extremely disappointed.
