3BJhHBe9xEKe8jaIDd8SWg Tibet Cafe serves a great mango smoothie. No milk, just mango and ice run through the blender to create a smooth and sweet treat for a cheap price. Great customer service, and unique (if not incoherent) interior design. The door is easily missed if patrons are sitting out front for a smoke.
