o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ I'm so happy that living nearby this roti restaurant!

It was few months ago that I started to eat butter chicken roti at college St location. I ordered butter chicken with mild-medium flavour.(3 types of spicy level) 

Compared to other roti restaurant, this one has definitely more chunks of chicken breast. It sure makes your roti enough big and heavy! Yummy

This location is new, Just opened last month, With same nice and comfortable atmosphere, very friendly cashier and same amazing, creamy, flavourful taste.
