t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I ordered the chicken samosas, Mattar paneer (my fav) and a mango lassi for take out. To be honest, all three items were pretty tasteless. I usually go to another Indian restaurant off paradise but decided to give Saffron a try due to positive reviews. I couldn't even finish my entree but it had no taste-the only thing I could taste was the spiciness. I order the same items from the place I usually go and I'm never disappointed. Saffron was $5 more expensive and the food was bland. I will say that the employees were friendly.
