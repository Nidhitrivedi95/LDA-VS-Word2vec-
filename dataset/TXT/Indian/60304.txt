ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I got the chicken chettinad and it was awesome. I ordered spicy and the spice level was great, most places don't get the spice right in my opinion, they always go to light, Passage to India got it right! The fish fry was great, my boyfriend got the tandoori chicken and lived it! They just made repeat coustomers of us tonight!
