iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw I saw this place and just had to stop. It is literally shaped like a burrito! Boy am I glad I did, one of the best if not #1 best burrito I have ever had and that's saying something considering I live in Arizona. I recommend getting it spicy and with a side of masala fries(I wasn't sure what masala was but its the seasoning and its delicious). No kidding this might be the best damn burrito in Vegas!
