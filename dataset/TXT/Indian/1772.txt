-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw If you are looking for quite less expensive Indian meal in the middle of downtown, then this is it. Food tastes ok to be frank. 
But I will give thumbs up for the service it is quick. 
I have been there 4-5 times now, non-veg thali is on my hit list there. 
Tried Chana Bhatura once, did not like the chana and bhatura was also ok.
