KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA We were visiting Toronto in August and I found this restaurant from web searches. Their Karahi is amazing and also their kebabs I would give their food 5 out of 5. It is a must visit restaurant when you are in Toronto. It is not a fancy sit down place and it's a bit small but reasonably clean given the area it is located in.
