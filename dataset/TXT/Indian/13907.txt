bU6mVZSuO5EpvfUay87e8g Just been here tonight for the first time. I'd bought a voucher from Groupon and, after hearing mixed reviews about Groupon itself, this was my first time trying a voucher so i was a bit wary. I booked this afternoon and made sure I told them I had a voucher and where it was from. There was no hassle and my table was booked for 8pm.


 When we showed up however it was clear that there had been some mistake and whoever had taken the booking either hadn't understood me or had forgotten to write it down. There was no hassle though and after a very short wait we were seated with apologies for delay and the terms of the voucher explained.


 After a popadum plate, samosa and pakora starter, korma and passanda main with rice and two naan, all of which were delicious and took some time in choosing from the extensive menu, we were too stuffed for pudding and settled for a mocktail which finished the meal off nicely :o)


 It's bring your own bottle without a corkage fee, which is great, because some places are ridiculously expensive just for the use of a corkscrew! The waiting staff were really good, always on hand and if they couldn't answer a question sent someone over who could. The place is clean and well organised, has a nice feel and an open kitchen, which I love because you feel they have nothing to hide.


 I'm definitely going back.
