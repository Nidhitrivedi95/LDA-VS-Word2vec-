2nsMgH0zh8hK4Bu55fYxlA My wife and I ate here for the first time yesterday. We came here on the recommendation of a coworker (thanks Roshan). The food was awesome.  The staff was very polite and genuine. She and my wife struck up a conversation about pants my wife was wearing. :)  

Anyway, we each got soup, Hot Sour for me and Egg Drop for my wife. A big bowl of soup arrives shortly after and both were excellent They came with some of those fried wonton strips too. For my meal I ordered the Manchurian Steak (the menu says chicken, but you can substitute steak for $1.00).  I ordered it extra spicy. Sandi got the Teriyaki Steak. Her comments were that the veggies were hot and crisp, and the flavor very good. Everything was also cut a bit smaller than expected, and pleasantly so. 

The Manchurian Steak was really nice.  The spice for me could have been kicked up a few more notches, but I really like hot and spicy foods. It's only a matter of a few more visits before they learn me. The meals also came with a choice of white or fried rice.  We both took the fried rice and it was nicely done as well. 

So over all we give them 5 stars and more of our business!  Thank you Tang Lin for a really nice meal.
