zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Named after the mountain pass that cuts through Afghanistan and Pakistan, we find Khyber Halal right here in Phoenix.... Another amazingly delicious mom and pop type restaurant.  The Phoenix Supper Club UYE visited Khyber Halal in January.  I was out of town on business, but I stopped in last month to sample a few things and I was very pleased with the offerings.  


The most moist and tenderly seasoned  lamb!   Practically melts in your mouth.   Large portion.   Get the kabob with rice and order a specialty naan on the side. 

Fluffy tender rice with a strong cumin flavor laced in every bite.  I don't usually eat much rice, but the house rice was a delicious treat.. The Lamb came with a Cucumber tomato onion and cilantro mixed salad. 

I also ordered the Garlic naan.  nom nom nom.... The bread was perfectly tender with a lite crunch and bursting with the flavors of roasted and fresh garlic.

Deliciously spiced beef.   Reminds me more if a Jamaican beef patty,  spicier and more flavorful.   The chicken samosa is just as yummy,  but lacks the bold flavors of the beef.   Rather spicy for most Americans.

BTW: Halal means "permitted by law" in Arabic.  Halal food follows the laws for dietary needs described in the Islamic faith... humane slaughter of animals, no pork or pork by products, no animals without external ears and so forth.
