RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Pros: Excellent Food, Friendly Server

Cons: Overall experience - we waited 15 minutes to be greeted by our server, everything was extremely slow in coming out, tables around us had: 1 dish sent back, 1 glass of water spilled on a patron (didn't see the actual server on scene until 10 minutes after the fact), and everyone complaining about the speed.
