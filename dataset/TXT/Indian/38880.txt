OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I decided I will try exactly the same dish Bhel Puri in several Vegas Indian restaurants over a period of 2 weeks. Urban Turban has been my third restaurant and the Bhel Puri here is so much better than the other two that I decided I must let the world know about it. I am Indian and a foodie, as well as a gourmet cook and I can say that the Bhel at UT is just great. Firstly the portion is huge for the price - a complete meal by itself and simply delicious and authentic. It needed to be a little spicier, so I requested them to chop some green chillies for me to garnish the Bhel with. The service was as cheerful as the ambiance with the autorikshaw. Before the Bhel came an ample serving of papad with VEGAN mint chutney which was a pleasant surprise to a dairy allergic person like me. The African American waiter gave me a high five saying he was dairy allergic too and was pleased that he could cater to my needs. All in all, UT matched my preference for a fun place with good and tasty food served with panache. I look forward to another visit soon when I intend to try out the vada pav or anything else vegan on the menu.
