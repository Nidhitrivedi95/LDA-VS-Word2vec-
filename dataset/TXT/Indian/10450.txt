The food was good but pricey, 

Something you never really see at an Indian restaurant is single portions. Usually you order a few subjies and naans for the table and you share everything. But in this case everything was a single portion. They've designed it that one person orders one subji and one bread item. 

It was an interesting concept, but we still ended up sharing amongst the 5 of us. 

service was also good, we didn't eve duo eating too long but if you arrive right in the middle of the after movie crowd, you'll definitely have to wait longer.
