5KsvP10z9InBcI6hhqjjKg My wife and I have a personal connection with this place.  For in 2008 it was here that it was the first time we had Indian food as well as it being the first time we went to Montreal. It was only later on that I realised we also had middle eastern food at this place.  I went back again in 2013 to relive the ambiance and be reminded of younger years of dating.  Now back to the food.  The food was delicious.  The chicken tiki Marsala was delicious and the chicken briyani was spectacular.  My wife loved the sweets as she has quite the sweet tooth. It being a buffet I got to try most dishes. I enjoyed almost every dish that was mild to medium spicy as my palate could not handle the spiciest dish.  Will definitely come back here again the next time we visit Montreal.
