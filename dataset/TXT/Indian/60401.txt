ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Great spot for Indian lunch buffet in University City area of Charlotte, NC. Reasonably priced and friendly service. The decor is family/friendly/cozy. You can't eat here for less than $10 and eat well. They may even offer student discounts. My favorite dishes here are Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Makhani.
