RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg The Blue Taj has been excellent. I have gone to this restaurant several times and is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. The service is wonderful. The waiters and hosts are cordial and treat you very well. They help you to make a decision based on what you would like if you're indecisive and will make adjustments to the food/type of meat/level of spiciness as needed. They usually make good recommendations for new things to try and accompanying wine as well. The food is always delicious. The portion sizes are respectable when it comes to your meal. A little small with the appetizers. But the food is consistently flavorful and filling. We usually get some version of chunks of chicken in the various delicious sauces (i.e. Chicken tikka masala), garlic naan, rice and a nice white wine. Between the food and the calm atmosphere it always helps to soothe my day. The service is fast and attentive. I love it! I definitely recommend it if you like Indian food.
