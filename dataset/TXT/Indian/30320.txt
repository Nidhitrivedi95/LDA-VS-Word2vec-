K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g What's not to like about scrumptious vegetarian Indian food?  A well-stocked and clean buffet and an Indian to White-boy ratio of about 10:1.  I eat here about once every two weeks.  I like the food so much that I always eat too much and feel the post Indian food bloat afterwards.  Maybe it's the chilies, maybe it's the carbs, I don't care just be forewarned about exercising some self restraint and only go back the buffet twice at most.
