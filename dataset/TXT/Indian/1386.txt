-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Go to Udipi if you are looking for authentic.  If you are looking for Vegan.  If you are looking for flavor.  Udipi is off the beaten path, but it's definitely worth finding and experiencing.  The Thali a lot of variety, really quite wonderful.  It's a great introduction to the restaurant.  I think the plain and simple decor only adds to the experience.  Note that the restaurant is closed Tuesdays.
