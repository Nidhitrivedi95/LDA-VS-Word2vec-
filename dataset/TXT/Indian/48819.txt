The sister restaurant Savoring India is much better, but this place was pretty solid. We came on Sunday for a lunch buffet. I usually avoid buffets, but after an amazing buffet experience at Savoring India, I wanted to try Flavor of India. The service was quick and friendly. The food was good however extremely limited compared to Savoring India's buffet.

I loved the eggplant pakora dish with fried chickpeas. The dosa was also crispy and delicious. The food was spicyyy which I LOVE. The price was right too ($10 for a lunch buffet). Compared to NYC where I live, the prices on the regular menu don't seem too bad but maybe it's steep compared to other places in PGH. My boyfriend was disappointed that there were no lamb dishes at the buffet which Savoring India had at theirs.

I'll be back for sure to try other things on the menu.
