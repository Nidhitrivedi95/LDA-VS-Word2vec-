H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw Marigold: Delivery for two people worked out as $48, just mains, poppadoms and naan. A tiny bit pricey I thought...until it arrived and i realized that that one main+rice would EASILY fill two people. In fact, I ate half of mine and I feel physically ill. So much food. At least it means a good hearty lunch tomorrow! 

The butter chicken dish was v heavy on the tomatoes and a little sweet for my taste, but the lamb rogan josh was near perfect. Some fresh tomatoes in there would have made it even better, over purely sauce but it tasted fantastic and the meat was juicy and tender. The garlic naan was thin and light too. It's the first Indian I've tried in midtown and I was pleasantly surprised as I'd heard good Indian is hard to find anywhere south of the suburbs. It wasn't quite perfect but I'm full and I'm happy!
