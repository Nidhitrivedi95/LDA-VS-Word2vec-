Most other cuisines can be eaten casually but for me, with Indian food, I like to appreciate each bite - making a nice basmati island and surrounding it with a little helping from each dish and following it up with the naan sweep.  And repeat.  It's even better when the dishware is pretty.  Come to think of it this is probably why I don't really enjoy Indian buffet. 

Things I enjoyed at Savera:
 - the perfectly crisp and fresh naan.  The plain is fabulous and the garlic and cheese flavours can stand alone they are so tasty.
- the fluffy basmati.  It seems silly to comment on something as fundamental as the rice but it was so good!
- the fact that you can customize the heat! Medium is just right for me.

On the first visit we tried the staples of veggie pakora, butter chicken, mattar paneer and lamb saag.  All good!  Second visit was with four instead of two adults so we were able to add chicken pakoras (skip it, they are just chicken fingers), eggplant dish (very good, sorry name escapes me), and chicken tikka (not my thing but others enjoyed it).  I have still to try the sizzling plate tandoori since my powers of persuasion seemed to be at an all time low during that second visit.

I feel that the prices are reasonable for the experience.  Both times we ended up at around $25/person for food.   Service is good.
