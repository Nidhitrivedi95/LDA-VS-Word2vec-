gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Another lunch favorite!  I've been several times for lunch, and always eat at the buffet.  The food is delicious; there's various traditional options, including basmati rice, samosas, chicken dishes (e.g., chicken tikka), dal makhani, and other vegetarian dishes.  There's also fruit.  The buffet actually has a good variety of food.  

My absolute favorite is the sweet rice, which is orange colored and has peanuts (or cashews?) in it.  I have a sweet tooth and love rice, so this is the best of both worlds for me.  I'm not a huge meat eater, but am not vegetarian either so I end up loading up on the sweet rice.    

My runner-up favorite (or actually maybe tied) is the naan.  Whoa nelly, the naan is ALWAYS warm and soft.  We always get a basket that has plain naan and naan with garlic.  The garlic naan is super good.  Although I'm sure it's a huge faux pas, I love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet (for the fruit) and putting just a little on the naan.  That's my dirty little secret at Mt. Everest.

Overall, it's a great place to have lunch.  It's generally busy or at least half way full.  I think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths.  Oh! And another plus -- they usually have a Bollywood movie playing on a flat screen tv above the buffet.  The sound is not on or is low, but it's fun to watch nevertheless!
