rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA I was there at La Sani with a friend post lunch and the restaurant was pretty much empty at that time. Ordered BBQ chicken wings, Veg Pulao & Kadai Paneer. The lady at the counter took our order and before I went and sat I asked for water and with a smile she said yes. 15 minutes later it the water never came and I asked her again to which she threw an attitude (Rude stare) that I felt was completely unnecessary. Then she got the food with the same rude stare. She forgot my pop and we had to go ask her again. 

Talking about the food "IT WAS EXCEPTIONAL" no doubts! 10/10 straight. 

La Sani has to understand the way their employees talk and treat their customers are also important. I request them to work on that. I'll NOT VISIT them again, service to me is more important than food. 

My Ratings 
Food - 10/10 
Service - 3/10 
Ambience - 5/10 
Overall experience - 7/10 

Cheers,
