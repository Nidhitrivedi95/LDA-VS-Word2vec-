 Went there for our Valentines meal, and my husband and I were horrified. Waited 25 minutes for drinks. My lemonade tasted like the syrup lines had run out, so sent it back. Seems they just poured me a new one, and asked if the second was ok. Still not... They said they'd sort it. They didn't. I didn't have a drink my whole time there. Dinner eventually arrived... and aside from only about 4 or 5 pieces of meat per curry... it was tasty... We then sat, and waited, and sat and waited to ask someone for the bill. I then got up and asked a waiter... He said 'Ok, right away' - 10 minutes later, we were still waiting to pay. We then both got up to ask for the bill at the bar... and they asked us to sat in the bar area and wait. By the time I left... I was so sick of waiting for anything... and still dying of thirst...


 I would strongly encourage no one to return. It ruined my and my husband first Valentine's meal married...


 The surrounding tables from us, we could also hear them complaining. But obviously can't speak for them.
