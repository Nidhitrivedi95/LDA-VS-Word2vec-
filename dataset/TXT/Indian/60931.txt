zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I am a semi-regular visitor. In other reviews, I have noticed lots of complaints regarding customer service, but in my opinion there isn't a significant difference between the service in this place and elsewhere. Courteous and quick enough for me.

The food is good if you order it spicy. Their Baingan Bhartha especially is quite delicious. The other items on the menu are also in general tasty and well-prepared (though I wouldn't recommend the Dal Tadka, it isn't what you are used to if you are Indian.)

Overall I'm giving this place 4 stars out of 5 because of two reasons:

1) They serve rice with every dish and do not allow for substitutions. To be fair, this appears to be the general practice in all Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I've been to; this is remarkably pointless and inauthentic. It makes absolutely no sense to serve rice with a majority of the dishes on the menu, especially the dry dishes. This is the biggest reason I do not go there more frequently, and I almost gave a 3 star rating because of this. If you work at Yuva India and you are reading this, I sincerely suggest that you allow your customers to replace the rice with some basic butter naan. If that is too expensive for you, at least include an option to upgrade the rice to naan for a small price.

2) In my opinion the price is a little too high. The food here is quite good, but there are other Indian places that serve equally good food at a lower price. (Nearby Tamarind comes to mind).
