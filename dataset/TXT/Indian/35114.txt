MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw Ambiance is very nice. Service is a little slow. We ordered missi roti which was very dry. The food is not very hot, all of our dishes were warm to cold. The stuffed onions (pic attached) The naan sizes are very cute, you get two per order but enough to be filling. I don't think it's value for money at all.
