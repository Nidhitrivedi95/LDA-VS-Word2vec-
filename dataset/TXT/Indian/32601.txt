LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This is my favourite restaurant in town and I am a frequent visitor. My favourite dosa is spring Kara dosa with cheese although  I have tried almost everything on their menu. Service has improved over the years. Little expensive than other dosa joints but the food quality justifies their price.
