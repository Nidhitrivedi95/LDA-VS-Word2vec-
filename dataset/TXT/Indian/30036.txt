JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Aroma is probably o e of the best Indian cuisine establishments that I have visited.

1)
The bathrooms were clean.

2) 
The service was quite good. There was never an empty cup and anything we needed was brought right away. This is a nice relaxing place. 

3)
We ordered Masala Dosa. It was quite yummy. it was the first time that I have eaten a Dosa and I will make sure that I will in the future. The garlic sauce and tomato sauce were our favourite.

4)
Egg Sum Biryani~ This was loaded in spices. it was not overpowering or overtly spicy. this was not my favorite of the dishes, but I would certainly eat this again.

5) 
Chicken Chettinad ~ This came in medium and hot. I had the medium and was quite pleased. it was flavorful and quite delicious with naan bread. 

Other notes :
It has an easy parking lot.
