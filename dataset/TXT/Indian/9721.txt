92g7A0sCbb7VklNyoJphew I just went there for the lunch buffet.

The selection is severely limited and there isn't much meat in any of the dishes. The waiter was absent most of the time and I had to specifically ask for naan otherwise they don't even make it.

I've had way better Indian food elsewhere and wouldn't recommend anybody going to this place.
