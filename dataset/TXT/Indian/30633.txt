KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA There's no disputing that the food from this place is great. Everything I've tried on the menu has been excellent and I've had everything from veggie pakoras to chicken tikka to paneer palak. All delicious.

Unfortunately the management has decided to stop serving my area via Just Eat and I won't be giving them my business in any form anymore. Not only that but they haven't communicated this properly to Just Eat so they still show up and charges have to be reversed after the fact. Frustrating.

Regardless, if you are interested in some good Indian I would still give my recommendation.
