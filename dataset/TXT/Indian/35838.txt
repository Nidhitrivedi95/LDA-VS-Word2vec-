nLTThR88xzfrnEkRTAKLSA I myself had take-out so I can't really comment on the cleanliness of the table clothes, but I can tell you that the naan was certainly not the best in town. I'd have to say the naan was probably the weakest part of the meal and was slightly burnt.

The rest of the food was fine, but on par with most other Indian take-out. I'd order again, but mostly for the convenience.
