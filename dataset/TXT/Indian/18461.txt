Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ Amazing service, above average food. Boyfriend and I didn't feel like cooking on a Sunday night, and since we were feeling adventurous, we settled on Tich. 

The restaurant is small, with minimalist but welcoming decor. Our server was extremely helpful. We told him it was our first visit, and he proceeded to walk us through the highlights of the menu. I ordered off the prix fixe menu, while boyfriend opted for just a main with rice and naan. 

The food was good, but didn't blow me away. The chicken tikka app was so-so. For mains,  I had the lamb shank and boyfriend had the Madras chicken curry. The sauces were very rich and delicious. However, while both the chicken and lamb were tender, they were quite bland, with little of the spiciness and flavors from the sauces penetrating into the meat. The kulfi dessert was excellent. 

Will likely return!
