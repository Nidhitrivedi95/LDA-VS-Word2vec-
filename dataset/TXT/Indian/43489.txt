ROUjTKM6H56_hJqIDKrjnw We went today for the $10 buffet lunch (offered seven days a week) which was great value for the price. There were about 15 different food options to choose from including dessert. The naan, goat and tandoori chicken were particularly good. 

Everything tasted awesome while we were having it, but shortly thereafter I found myself extremely parched. I have a MSG sensitivity and extreme thirst after eating typically signals to me that MSG was added. This was confirmed the next morning when I woke up with a massive headache. 

Our server was very attentive and the restaurant had a nice ambiance with the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street, but they really need to can the MSG.
