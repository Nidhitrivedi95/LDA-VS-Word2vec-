PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q I went here once on a date (date's choice, not mine) for dinner during a weeknight.  I believe I ordered one of the chicken dishes, and don't remember much about it, except that it was kind of greasy and flavorless.  What I do remember, however, was the lack of cleanliness in the place, which was noticeable.  The place was dark and dirty, to the point that I'm uncomfortable seeing in an eating establishment.  I also recall service being pretty inattentive, and the owner yelling at an employee.  This experience was enough for me; I won't be returning.  There are better Indian options a few blocks away on N. Craig.

EDIT: As of 7/19, they are permanently closed due to repeated egregious health dept. violations--specifically, due to a recurring roach infestation.
