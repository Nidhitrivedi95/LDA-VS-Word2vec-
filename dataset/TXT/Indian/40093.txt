pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I came here for the first time as part of a group. The buffet had a decent selection and the food tasted pretty good. However, I felt a bit sick and my stomach felt like it was going to explode. It merely could have been because I over ate, but I've been to plenty an Indian buffet where I've stuffed myself with no regrets. While the food wasn't bad, it didn't stick out as being significantly better than other places I've tried. While the service was decent, my first experience here wasn't the best. That said, I would be willing to try again and next time I'll either eat slower or not as much.
