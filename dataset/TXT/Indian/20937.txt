GaymsFE7jVr9PtLwYRYiAA In Edinburgh dropping my son off at university and discovered Shezan across the street from our hotel (Marriott Glasshouse-Autograph). Food was amazing: I had the tandoori mixed grill and my son the chilly chicken. Both were spiced just right and brought me back to some of the best restaurants in Mumbai. Ordered garlic naan to accompany, and ultimately to eat with! Thoroughly enjoyed it so much I decided against the silverware and went traditional. The crowd was light and came later so service was attentive and personalized. Such a good experience we've already decided to return again during our trip.
