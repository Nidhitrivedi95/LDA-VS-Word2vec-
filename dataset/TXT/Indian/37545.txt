OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Ate here while in town for work with 5 colleagues. This place was CRAZY busy the whole time we were there, I am so glad we had reservations!  The service was spotty - hectic, forgetful and sort of harried, but they were friendly, apologetic and efficient too. The food was outstanding. We shared all our items with each other and I was simultaneously happy with what I ordered and also wishing I had what everyone else had. Weirdly at the end of the meal the server said we could not get desert as they needed the table to seat someone else for dinner, and splitting the check threw them off big time. But, even with all that, it was a fun experience, and I'd go back.
