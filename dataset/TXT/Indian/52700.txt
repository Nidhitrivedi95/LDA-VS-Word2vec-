Uyw1pJ03kt-I1B_tkA3aFg While the food on the other tables looked good, my experience was different. 45 minutes in an empty restaurant to get a lamb kabab. While the meat was well seasoned, it was very over cooked and required a dipping sauce (ordered extra) to get it down. The naan, when it eventually arrived half way through the meal, was tasty. 

If it wasn't for the poor service, slow delivery, modest portions, bad cooking and over inflated prices, it could be a nice place. I hope I just had a rare bad experience. But from now on I'll just to back to Pita Kabab Grill.
