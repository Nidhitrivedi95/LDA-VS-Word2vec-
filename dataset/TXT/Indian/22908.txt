gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Every time im off work and wanna eat a delicious large meal at a decent price I come here. Best indian lunch buffet with the best selections. Their dinner menu is still good but a lil om the pricey side so I come for lunch...and its all you can eat! How can you beat that? 

Recommend it to everyone when family and friends come to town.
