-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA So disappointing. Wednesday night at 5:30pm, so management can't blame customers for coming in late. Sad because the food is amazing, but we literally just waited almost an hour for food. The place was empty beside one other table (who were eating when we got there). Our server never said anything until after the food finally came. When we mentioned it had taken a long time, he said there was a new chef and then walked away. Dropped our checks and boxes-no apology, no thank you. We won't be back, which is unfortunate as we really thought the food was great and we live close by.
