Our food was probably the best Indian food we have had, which is saying a lot since my husband and I eat Indian pretty regularly. I had the butter chicken, as I am not a fan of spicy Indian and it was fantastic. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. We also ordered the garlic naan, which had just the right amount of garlic flavor and the pakora sampler which was again the best I have had. My husband ordered the chicken vindaloo and he loved it.
