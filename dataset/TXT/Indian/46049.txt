SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg Tried Bhelwala for the first time last night. First, the staff was very helpful and even offered tastes. As others have pointed out they seem to be modeled after Chipotle which is a good idea. I do like Indian food and was excited to try this. I was a little disappointed in the taste as it lacked the Indian spice I am used to with other Indian restaurants. I think I is good for Americans who want to try something different but not too spicy. I will probably come back and give it another try but will not rush in.
