OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I went there again to see if anything changed,and to my surprise it went ''Worst''.
The cooks are Chinese from mainland China,not Hakka Chinese(from India).
The fried rice;cooked it at home - taste the same.
Chili Chicken; leaves a bitter aftertaste in your mouth;also can be cooked @ home.
2008 was my first time at Lin Garden; Chili Chicken was juicy and tender,had a authentic ''hakka flavor'' -no bitterness-not just chunks of dried chicken breast .
Somewhere between 2010-2012 the ''hakka'' cook must have left Lin Garden.
My advice, to you is: If you are very hungry and don't want to cook at home;save time and money and you don't care about the taste of the food- Go eat @ Lin Garden.
