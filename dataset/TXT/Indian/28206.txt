IyrwvRwiwsKCiiKoxbHeFA Honestly guys plz save your money. drive a bit out of your way and try to avoid the frustration. ok service, terrible food. got nihari form there which tasted noting like nihari. naans tasted really bad. biryani wasn't any different. I had an upset stomach after eating their food. to the owners of the restaurant: plz look out for your customers and plz pay very close attention to the quality of your food. it needs a ton of work......... sincerely, never coming back :). Officially the worsT desi food I have ever tasted.
