ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA This establishment is amazing and first class. Starting with the pleasant scent that greets you once entered along with friendly staff that aims to serve. The menu is very organized into meat and veggie groups and allows to easily find that new favorite dish of yours. The chicken tikka masala was outstanding. The rich blend of flavor and heat allowed for perfect pleasure to my palette. The chai was simply good, just like my dad made it at home growing up. Overall great value at decent prices. Check it out. I'll be back.
