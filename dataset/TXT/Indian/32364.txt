LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw During the holidays stopped by the Salem's Market to buy a few items and some meat from the butcher area.  Very helpful staff at the butcher counter.
We also stopped in the Grill for a quick meal.  Most others have already covered the essentials...ie;  cafeteria style, give you a number and they will bring it to you or you get up and get it when you number is called...someone was cleaning the tables and trying to keep up with the number of customers but it was busy.  I had the Kufta sandwich and fries.  The Kufta was very tasty and as others have said, the fries are really good.  For dessert had a pistachio mamaol that was delicious. If you looking for Gyros, Sharamas, fresh baked items Mediterranean sweets this a good place for a meal or taking home.
