The hubby ordered the chicken J (don't remember how to spell the rest of it; and I ordered something that wasn't even on the menu, but they were more than happy to make it for me. They had a shrimp korma, but I wanted chicken instead. We both had our meals a spicy #5 out of 10. It was goooooood. It was spicy enough for me and I love things spicy. Also, if you check into Yelp while dining, you get a 10% discount. 

Check it out!
