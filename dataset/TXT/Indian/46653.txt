SxuD7iY8QO88PNbSdNmNKg I went to their Wednesday buffet - Dosa buffet so this review is totally based on that. 

On paper the concept of unlimited dosas sounded great so i told all my friends about it. 

All dosas we tried were below average. Cook needs to go back to India and eat these dosas in some good restaurants to know how things are done. 

If you think this review is harsh please check the pictures I uploaded so that you can judge them. 

Paneer burji dosa - It had little bit of shredded paneer inside regular dosa. It was awful but still better than other dosas mentioned below. 

Chinese dosa - this was big joke. it had extremely tiny amount of something stir fried inside it. I couldn't tell what it was. Dear cook please go to any chowpaty and taste Chinese dosa we get on streets of India.

Chaat dosa was disgraceful. Cook had sprinkled small amount of mdh chaat masala inside. I could barely taste it. Why did you even put it on menu?

Chocolate dosa - cook had poured chocolate syrup- probably hershey's syrup all over it to call it chocolate dosa. 

They probably made cost effective version of these flavors for buffet but the plan failed miserably. 

Rest of the buffet hardly had anything. Idly, vada were good but Sambar and chutney were below average.
