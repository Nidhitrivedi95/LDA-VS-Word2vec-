tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I took my 16 month old son here this weekend while my husband and daughter were seeing a movie together. No one in my family likes ethnic food (and I am Persian!) so its important to me to expose my son to as many types of foods possible while hes still young and open. 

I took him in for the buffet at 5:00 pm on the dot. I wanted to get in early since it is a busy night for restuarants and I didnt know how well he would behave. I got a plate with a little bit of everything on it, as well as a small plastic salad plate (empty) for him to eat off of. In the meantime we got our bread and the wait staff was very helpful making sure I had what I needed for him. They brought a spoon and paper napkins to the table and had taken away the second fork before I had even returned from the buffet. I was impressed.

He played around with the food at first, but really got going towards the end. He really liked the Basmati rice and the lentil stew (I can never remember the names). After that, he decided he really loved the rice with chicken and veggies. He ate and ate and ate. The waiter (owner, maybe?) seemed really happy that he was digging the food. Towards the end, I got my son some watermelon and had to go back to the buffet about 5 times for another piece. I dont like to be wasteful, so we only grabbed a slice at a time.

All in all, the food was great! I am sorry to say, but Arizona has some of the worst Indian food around. I am glad that there is a place I can go to around here, now. The buffet is AWESOME and is so inexpensive. I fully expected to be charged at least for an adult and a child at the buffet (my son eats a lot), but I was pleasantly surprised when I got my bill for $10. It almost made me feel guilty!

I definitely recommend.
