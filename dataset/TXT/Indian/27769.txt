iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw Stumbled on this restaurant, and it turned out to be one of the best Indian restaurants that we've been to in the city! Although the restaurant is on the pricier end of the spectrum, the food we had was delicious, especially the monk fish and scallops. Both were cooked perfectly and the sauces that came with the dishes were great to dip my bread in. I liked the decor of the restaurant as well, particularly the exposed brick wall on one side.
