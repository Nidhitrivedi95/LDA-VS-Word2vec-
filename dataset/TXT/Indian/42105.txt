Qfn9qbWKPsfkFZDQzw7kCQ Yeah. terrible service. atrocious decor. but dang. the food is pretty good. a cool thing is that the last time i dined here, they gave us extra naan on the house. sweet. 

if you decide to visit this location, expect slow service. and yeah, the teenage waitress has a little bit of attitude. but the food is still good!
