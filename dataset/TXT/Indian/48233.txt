ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA So I came here for lunch with a friend the other day and I have to say I was sorely disappointed!! The buffet was sad!! Seriously they had a tikka masala that looked like a random watery chicken curry. In fact all of their options were watery!! I'm not sure what happened as the first time I came it was a solid 3 1/2 stars now the only thing making me give it 2 stars is it was cheap and the samosas with tamarind sauce was good. The waitstaff seems really off as well. They didn't seem to want to be there that day. All in all I highly doubt I will ever come back, I came out of convenience and well totally wasn't worth it!! Watery curry and unidentifiable selections are a clear sign to stay away!!!
