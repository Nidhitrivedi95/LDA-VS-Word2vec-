llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I've been to several Indian restaurants before, but India Palace exceeded my expectations. The chicken tikka and aloo gobhi were rich in flavor, and complimented beautifully by the garlic naan. The staff was very friendly and helpful in answering my questions. Jatinder, presumably one of the owners, was extremely welcoming and accommodating. My sister and I had a great experience, I would highly recommend India Palace for anyone looking for a good hole in the wall restaurant.
