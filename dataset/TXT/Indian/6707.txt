49taxSIx7Gwdjnr10QrnUw Having lived in NYC and  London for a number of years - you become used to "curry houses" having a certain taste and this place is the closest I have found to what I remember from those places.

Portions are good sized and the food is always great.  The food is so good here we get 2 of each meal so that we have leftovers and a mountain of naans.

Service here is awesome and the owner and his wife always make us feel at home.  

This is my "go to" indian place.  In 4 years - have never been disappointed in eating there or getting takeout.
