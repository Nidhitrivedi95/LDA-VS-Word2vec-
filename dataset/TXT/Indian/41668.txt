Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g if you guys think this is good hakka, y'all need to pay a visit to the East side.

Lemme start with The GOOD:

Their service is pretty good and prompt, the food came relatively quick.
Mango Lassi was delicious and different than any other Mango Lassi I have had.


The Bad
Food. We had Crispy beef, chilli chicken and Garlic Chicken Fried Rice.
We asked to make the mains spicier than normal and they said sure.
When the food came, crispy beef was alright but not something i would wanna have again.
Chilli chicken was bad, i don't know if they made it too salty because they wanted to make it spicier or if that is how it is made. The Fried Rice was ok as well, again, nothing special here.
