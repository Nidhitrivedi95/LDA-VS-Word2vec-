ScNo2XA1ZhsXjYiPVo-7oA I love the shish! 
This is the only restaurant my friends and I will go to for Indian food. 
We've been going here for years. We always order off the menu instead of the buffet. Don't get me wrong. The buffet is good. But the best tasting and spiciest foods are on their menu. 
Tikka lababdar and the kadhai are my favs!
