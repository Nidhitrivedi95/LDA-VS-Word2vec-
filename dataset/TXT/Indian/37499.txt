OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A After living in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and NJ where the quality of food is very good due to competition, we have pretty high standards when it comes to food. And being Indian, I know good Indian food.  

We were lured in by the amazing pictures on the website. We then discovered that this is THE BEST Indian restaurant we have ever eaten at! One word: FLAVORFUL!

We came in for Sat dinner and ordered the tandoori fish, chole batura, and chicken tikka appetizer. The Tandoori fish and chicken tikka were cooked to perfection and was delicious! The chole tasted so fresh and clean. The batura was phenomenal and unlike any I have ever had. 

This place was so good we came back the next day. We ordered the chicken pakora, madras chicken, paneer naan, and CHOLE BATURA AGAIN!!!! The madras chicken was phenomenal and perfect for spice lovers!!!

Overall, highly recommend this place. Food does take a little bit of time, but then again, perfection can't be rushed! So just be prepared. Wish there was a place as good as this in NJ/NYC. 

***they do have a restaurant in Oakland CA***
