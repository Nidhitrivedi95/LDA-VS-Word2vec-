PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q The wife, a friend, and I got take out at Indian garden tonight. We ordered Lamb Rogan Josh, Vindaloo, and Saag. 

We got home and tried to unpack the curries. We need about 5 or 6 paper towels to even get to the curry. Everything was covered in oil. We finally got the curries and all of them were about 50% oil. 

I ordered my curry a 9 on the spice level but what I got was some lamb chunks in oil with no heat at all.

The naan was ok and the mango lassi wasn't bad but the rest was a monstrosity.

Thanks Indian Garden for the bubble gut. I feel bad for my bathroom later.
