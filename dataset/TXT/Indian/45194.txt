S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA This is the best Indian food in the valley!!!!! The service is AMAZING, they take the time to explain dishes to you, recommend dishes by things you like, greet you upon entering and Thank you when you leave!!! The restaurant is very clean, the bathrooms were the cleanest I have ever been in. The whole staff is friendly, they definitely have my business for life!!!!!!
