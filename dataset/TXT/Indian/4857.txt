Nevertheless, my flatmate and I thought we'd give it a try. There was nothing massively different between it and any other indian restaurant you'll find in Edinburgh - all the usual suspects are on the menu and they're all under a tenner. But what was good about this place (apart from the fact that it's just across the street from the Holyrood 9A for a beer afterwards) was that they lso had a load of more random curry dishes on the menu too, like the Mohonwala which comes with mango pulp, coconut, almond, cream and fresh cheese.

The annoying thing though, is that depending on what meat you get your curry with it almost doubles in price - for even the most basic curry made with King Prawn will cost you £9.95, whilst the veggies among you will only have to pay a fiver for the same dish. Also, although they do have all these other less-known curries that I was mentioning before, they're all twice the price too.

I'm a penny-pinching student, which is why I'm whingeing so much. If you're not, you'd probably like this place as the service is great and the food is tasty. They also do carry-out/delivery too, so if you can't even be bothered to leave your sofa you can still get in on the action.
