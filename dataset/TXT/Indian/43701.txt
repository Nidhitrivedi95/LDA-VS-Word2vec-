While I didn't find Taste of India to be amazingly awesome, its currently in the running for my favorite Indian option in Pittsburgh. Service was fairly attentive, the naan was hot & crispy, and the chicken tikka was really tasty. 
A surprise: the veggie samosas have just a bit of spice-- unexpected and fun! Parking can be a challenge due to the location (directly across the street from Children's Hospital), but there are lots of meters around (and parking is free after 6pm).
