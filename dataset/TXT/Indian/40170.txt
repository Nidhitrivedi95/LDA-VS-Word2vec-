PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg Do I really feel this place needs another 5 star review?  No I do not.  

Do I think that there's anything I can say that hasn't already been said?  No I do not.  Chaise-lounge monkey-fist.  I stand corrected.

Ok, so this probably isn't news by now, but listen: THEY GIVE YOU A LOT OF FOOD FOR NOT A LOT OF CASHMONEY. You've heard that before, right?

£3 will get you Tarka Dal (lentils) and Rice. 2 Sheesh Kebabs and Rice or a few other options that escape me right now.  I have likely been there about 5 or 6 times by now, because you can't beat the price, and you can't beat the portions.
