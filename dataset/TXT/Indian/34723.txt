Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg The most horrible indian food I have eaten after coming to US. Being in Las vegas does not mean that you can charge your customers a fortune for crappy food. The food tasted like the ones served in hospitals with no spices , no aroma and no flavor. Everything was just boiled and served. There are plenty of other options in vegas for indian food, please skip this useless place.
