cY70RdP5w6gxRhY-wZ681A Place interior could be better it looks like a typical market restaurant in India. Lady who served the food was super friendly but talkative, she assured me that the food was made fresh to order. I bought the butter chicken special and waited for at least 25 mins. One thing that's good about this place is that the kitchen is open so that you could see how they make the food (no microwave). I paid around 10 bucks for naan, butter chicken, and rice. The quantity was ALOT! I took it back home and really enjoyed the food! Thats why my rating is 3 out of 5, only because of the food. They should really change the interior to be more attractive. I think it was well worth the wait.
