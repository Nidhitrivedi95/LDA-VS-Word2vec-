5v_nv9JgJtWHLPw8grPn-w I was a little disappointed with Michael's. I came just before noon on a Sunday and there was indeed a line of about 4 people in front of me. It seemed that the oxtail here truly is the most popular dish as 3 of the four in front of me ordered it. Since I'd be feeding four, I ordered a large oxtail ($14) and a large jerk chicken ($9). My "large" oxtail came in a larger container than the people who had ordered smalls before me. It had more rice n' peas but I was given the same amount of oxtail as the small orders. It became evident that she was almost out of oxtail and wanted to reserve the last few for one more order. Not cool, but I decided against saying anything.

The flavour of everything was ok. The oxtail was mild in spice and had a subtle curry flavour. The jerk was cold, mild in spice and just mediocre.

I will not be back as I have another Caribbean spot down the street which I prefer much more.
