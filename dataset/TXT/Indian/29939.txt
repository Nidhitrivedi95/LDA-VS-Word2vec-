jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Just ok Indian food. This is a half Indian/half Med place so you shouldnt expect much. Got the samosas, chicken tikka masala, and chili paneer. Chicken samosas were tasty especially with the sweet red sauce, they reminded me a little of chicken nuggets. Chicken tikka was disappointing. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but the actual sauce was nothing special. Paneer was cut in really tiny cubes and had more sauce than actual cheese. Overall a bit expensive for being average Indian food, but they give pretty decent sized portions. Entrees also came with free rice. The inside is decorated really nice and the cashier was friendly. Probably wont be back as theres so many other Indian places in town.
