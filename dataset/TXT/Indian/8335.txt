7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ I have eaten their buffet lunch seven times now. Great food and great selection. They change it up so it isn't the same menu each time. The only reason I would give them a 4/5 is some times the food gets a little old toward the end of the buffet. Haven't tried their dinner yet.
