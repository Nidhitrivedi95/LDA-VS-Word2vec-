X2jST-Dnm49koyi9PAnjMw The best thing about this place is the price. 
Good quality needs improvement to be honest. 
The location is a plus. 
Not a good place to sit and have food as essentially you are in a grocery store. 
Acceptable if not great. They have the advantage of the fact that they are the only 'Indian grocery' store in the complex. 
The quantities were also uneven. One day I got less than average. The other day more than what I expected. 
It lacks a certain consistency. 
Also restocking is a problem. They have a little buffet of sorts in the front and I've seen some of the dishes almost empty. Professionally they need to be topped up. 
However, that day they didn't top up the food because 'the time was short and it wouldn't be beneficial', which was a weird thing considering the store closes at 9 pm and it was only 7 pm when I went.
