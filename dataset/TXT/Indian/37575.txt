It was nice to be in a group (6) so we could try many things. If you are in a small party or don't want to share, try one of the plates at the beginning of the menu. They come with a bunch of awesome side dishes. All our food was fresh and flavorful. Even my aunt, who rarely finishes a meal, cleaned her plate.
