UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Strongly recommend their food - great and diverse list of menu to choose from, apparently mentioned to be using organic produce. 

The service is little slower as your food is made to order but is all worth the wait. A very interesting and fusion blend of alcohol menu. 

They seem to be super experimental with their cocktail menu, one has to check the kinds of lassi they serve with infused alcohol. The interiors of the place is full of modern art that also reflects in their food which is a good blend of traditional recipes tweaked to accommodate the modern day diverse palate. 

Definitely coming back for more food during my next trip to Vegas.
