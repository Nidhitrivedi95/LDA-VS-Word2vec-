KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Bombay Chopsticks, another fantastic location to find Hakka (Indian-Chinese) goodness. I used to work in Mississauga and this restaurant was a lunch staple. It was just too tasty too avoid. 

The menu is massive so unless you're vegetarian, try to stick with what I consider the cream of the crop below. The service is usually great, yet it can become quite busy during peak times. 

Hot and Sour Soup  (very strong and musky, great for colds)
Chicken Corn Soup  (good, even better with a splash of soya and chili oil)
Chili Chicken   (dry) (unreal)
Chili Chicken  (gravy)
Crispy Beef   (unreal)
Manchurian Mixed Chowmein
Spicy Crispy Fish    (dry)

* I'd recommend going at lunch over dinner because the difference in price is rather substantial. Check out my ideal order below and you too will become a repeat customer over dinner.
