J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ This seems to be a South Indian restaurant that offers a lot of Northern Indian cuisine, probably because the general population know and like it more. The problem I find with these type of joints is that if you eat a lot of Indian food, you can tell the difference.

I order Benghan Bharta almost anytime I eat Indian food. Mostly because I love the dish, but also it helps me gauge the quality and taste of the food. So, I order my favorite dish and it's really bitter and too dark, which I think contributes to the bitterness. The naan was dry and flavorless.

This was my first trip to Toronto and I enjoyed it so much, but I will not be back to this spot.
