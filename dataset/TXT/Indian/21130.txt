Servers were ok. Not so friendly but it didnt bother me.

Presentation of the food was alright, but the flavors were really good! I couldnt stop munching on the garlic and especially the cheese naan bread! Currys were tasteful! All of our orders turned out great! Im happy with the tastes! 

I would recommend this to anyone. I have three stars only cuz i expected more cuz of watching the show. Would i come back for more in the future? I would say so! This is a good place to eat traditional food!
