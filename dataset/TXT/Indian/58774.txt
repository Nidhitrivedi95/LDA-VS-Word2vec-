YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA Ah hell no! 

I went here for three reasons: firstly, having passed this restaurant many times, I had never noticed it and that intrigued me.  Secondly, I read a few decent reviews for it.  Most importantly, they have dosa on the menu which I haven't had for a long time and I miss it so.

I kind of liked the campy interior hence the two stars.  My partner said it reminded him of Scarborough basements of childhood friends' houses.  My friend said it reminded her of "that" restaurant you see in various Indian movies.  I think they both have a point.  I didn't like the fact that there was only one other customer in the restaurant, but hey, we were there now, so we might as well sojourn on.  

My hopes vanished when I ordered the masala dosa and was told they didn't have dosa that night.  Wha WHAT???  After unsuccessfully trying to recover from my disappointment, I completely abdicated responsibility and allowed the rest of the table to order.  I knew I was in safe hands anyway.

Unfortunately, I didn't like any of the dishes except the naan which was decent.  I only had one small sampling of each dish and even that I didn't finish.  Before we left the restaurant my face was burning.  I am very allergic to MSG and a few other food additives, so that's not too surprising.  What was surprising was by the time we hit the streetcar, my partner's face was on fire too.  Believe me, it wasn't the spice in the dishes because even though we ordered them medium hot, I didn't find them remotely spicy.  I'm not sure what stuff they're putting in their curries, but both of us had a terrible case of gut rot.  It was so bad that the leftovers ended up in the garbage can at the corner of Queen and Broadview.  

I suppose it's needless to say, but just in case, I will not be returning.
