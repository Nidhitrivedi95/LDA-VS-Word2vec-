Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg This is the third time I go here. The area isn't great but the restaurant does a very amazing job at making you feel like you're in a very nice area due to its amazing decor. The place is simple. The staff very friendly. Service is quick. The menu is limited but it will have addictions in the future. People keep saying it's pricey but they do not take into account that the place serves HALAL chicken which is far more expensive than regular chicken. The servings are very very large and their sauces are so unique and delicious. Absolutely love this place and would always come back.
