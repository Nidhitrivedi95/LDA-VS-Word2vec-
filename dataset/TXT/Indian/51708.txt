UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I usually find the food in Las Vegas not very good.  (I am an outsider).  My only experiences have been on the strip, so please don't think this is a blanket statement about the entire area.  But, on and around the strip I have generally found the food sub-par and relatively expensive. I don't doubt some of the food is excellent, but I don't want to pay Morton's prices just to get high quality foods.  

Thank you yelp.  Without which I would not have discovered Mint Indian Bistro.!

Excellent service with good prices.  We asked for our server's recommendations on a $25 entree budget (for two people).  We had more than enough food and were very happy with the quality and subtle flavors and spices. Also, typically Indian food leaves my digestive track in lurches afterwards.  Not so here.

A great reasonable dinner just off the strip.
