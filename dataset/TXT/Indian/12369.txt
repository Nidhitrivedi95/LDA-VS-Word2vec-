aX_uLs7LYmnK7VJTZJzACg I wanted to like this place but as a delivery option, it fell short of expectations.  First, it took 1.25 hours for delivery (on a non-snowy Edinburgh evening), second, the doner kabab w/ chips that I ordered was missing the chips + the garlic sauce that it was to have come with.  Lettuce was a bit on the dried/old side and only 2 slivers of tomatoes were included in the salad.  Third, there was a curry sauce in there that had more than the usual amount of oil floating to the top.  I think I'd come back to give it another try, since the price is fair -- however, I'd avoid delivery and do take-away instead.
