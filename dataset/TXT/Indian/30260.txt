K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g My partner and I love Indian food, and have eaten at Indian restaurants across the USA and in Europe.  This one is special.  It's SOUTH Indian, for starts, a cuisine not as often offered in the West. The ingredients are very fresh, the recipes excellent, and the chef does not skimp on the expensive spices that give South Indian cuisine its unique flavors.  

You can tell, for example, that the spinach pakora (spinach dipped in batter and deep fried) was made using fresh rather than frozen spinach.  The staff is attentive, courteous and friendly.  We've been there four times and already we are being treated like family.  

I'm a vegan, and I ditto what Dave S. wrote: "the staff took time to ensure that all of my selections were vegan."  It's not easy to find a vegan-friendly restaurant in Phoenix!  My partner and I try different dishes each time we go - there are dozens from which to choose - we've enjoyed each one.  Prices are very reasonable, especially for such beautifully prepared food.  

Another thing I notice about Ananda Bhavan is that the customers are mainly ethnic Indians.  That should tell you something about the authenticity and quality of the food! How we found out about this little jewel was by asking the owner of the Indo-European Market (the local East Indian grocery, DVD rental and dry goods store), where SHE goes to eat out.
