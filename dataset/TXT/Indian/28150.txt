iX0XUpk34WqHfUuLjPhR9g Came here for a late night meal and drink, and was not disappointed! Randomly stumbling into this bar, ordered the shrimp and green beans, as well as the veggie plate. Both came with curry and rice, cooked beautifully. Veggie plate came with egg plant, potato, cabbage, curry and rice. Had a curry flavor throughout, a good amount of spice to leave you reaching for your beer, not too spicy to ask for a glass of milk. The shrimp and green beans was the spiciest, but even then not overly spicy. Highly recommend this place!
