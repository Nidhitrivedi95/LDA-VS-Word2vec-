Yoc9_4sv6AT1AIohPPiGbA The best place to have dosa , i dont think so any other place offerining dosa for $5 ,they have good thali as well and carrot halwa is my favorite ........worthy and finding the satisfaction and finding fulfillment in continuosuly serving food with same taste  to eat every time u walk in  is really great .

we feel chennai express as our home and we became so close to every one intheir that we cant end our day without  visting them.
