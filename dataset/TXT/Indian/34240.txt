MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ While I was on a business trip, I stopped at this place for Indian food.  The manager seated me and he was very friendly.  My food was great.  Expensive, but Indian food usually is in a nice place.  
My Asian waitress was struggling to understand my English, but I was patient and ordered a meal and a beer.  When I was finished I asked her to give me 2 separate checks. One for the food, and one for the beer. 
Guess what she does.... she brings me another $7 Kingfisher beer. Me being a nice guy, explained in very slow English what I needed.  And instead of making a big deal of the situation, and because she would not understand what I was saying anyway, I told her it was okay, I would drink and pay for the beer I did not order or want. That adds up to $14 in beer I have to pay out of my own pocket. 
So when my checks come, guess what? She informs me that they cannot take my credit card because their terminal is broken. And she points across the street and mumbles something about ATM.
I believe someone, including the manager who seated me, and could speak English, should have warned me about the broken cc terminal. I left $0 for a tip, hoping they knew why.... If they thought I was a cheap ass, now they will know why.
