MmwKWBBrR0NF05hGBxnWjA My favourite Veda location! The food is served hotter here, there's more of it and the service is the best. 

As a campus foodspot, I would even consider giving it five stars, given the limited and unremarkable options. Four stars is more accurate though. 

I come here for the curry bowls and samosas. A small curry bowl is sufficient for the average eater, but large does exist to satiate additional hunger. For the amount of food, the pricing is very fair -- $6 for a small bowl, and a dollar and change more for a large. I haven't tried all the curries yet, but the chicken curry, veggie curry and lentils are all tasty. Some of the curries do tend to be a tad acidic (from tomatoes, perhaps?), but it's not noticeable enough to be off-putting. 

The samosas, like all the food actually, is not greasy at all. The pastry is more similar to a thicker, tastier jamaican patty pastry than the usual fried pastry. There are veggie and chicken options, and the samosas are crammed with fillings. I also like that they heat it with an actual oven before it's given to you to ensure that it's hot and crisp. 

I think Veda strikes a fair balance between healthy cooking and flavour. While it certainly may not taste like your usual Indian fare, the food is very enjoyable nonetheless.
