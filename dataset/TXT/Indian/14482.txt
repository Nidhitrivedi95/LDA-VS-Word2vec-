C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA If you're looking for a brunch spot that doesn't require an hour wait; Kalendar is your spot. I've been here twice for brunch and been seated immediately and there's still tables left over. 

The downside is that their brunch menu isn't overly extensive. They have a handful of omelets, steak and eggs, French toast and that's pretty much about it. 

The plus side is that their coffee is delicious. I drink my coffee black and that little hint of cinnamon is so lovely in the morning. Also, their service is really attentive. Coffee/water refills nonstop!
