XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw What a humble but great place to tryout Tibetan cuisine right in the city. Was veg this day so I tried the Lhasa and Kothey Momos and the Veg Chow mein and they were absolutely delicious! The portion size was great and the flavors were spicy and a treat for the senses! I can't say enough about the chow mein as it was simple yet extremely well made! Can't wait to tryout the meat and sea food dishes another time which my friends say are a delight! 

The patio at the back of the restaurant is a nice surprise but I think they need to do something about the mosquitoes and bugs which were quite annoying. 

Nevertheless great service and pleasant and humble folks who deserve much more praise for this hidden gem!
