m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw By far the best Indian restaurant in Urbana Champaign. If you are looking for competitive advantages, they are priced better, their service is better, and their food is wayyy better than any other place. They are a bit far from campus, but it's definitely worth it. First Indian food in the area that tasted like home. I got the vegetarian thali.
