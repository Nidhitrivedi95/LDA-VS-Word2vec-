B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Great Indian?  My favorite part of this restaurant is their lunch menu (they don't do buffets) it is so affordable, so you can take multiple items home to try!  For under $30, my hubby and I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Shrimp Vindaloo, Lamb Biryani (rice dish), garlic naan, plan naan, and extra raita.  All meals come with their cumin toasted basmati rice!  We have enough for at least another meal and half!  I am so excited they opened.  Haven't ate in yet, dinning room looks nice and staff is always wonderful during counter service.
