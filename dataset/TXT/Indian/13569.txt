biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg Went for lunch today with Rand H at this great east indian buffet ,
there is new owners in the place and they have been there for about a year now. The food is still some of the best indian food you will find in the valley. Everything i ate from the lentil soup , lamb , goat , tandoori chicken ,naan , lots of veggie dishes were all delicious and for dessert they had a mixed fruit mango custard that is real good , so good they serve it everyday because it is so popular. The restaurant itself is clean and nicely decorated and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone wanting good east indian food.                   yumm  yumm   yummm
