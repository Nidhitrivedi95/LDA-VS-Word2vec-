SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg We just finished dinner here and I have to say it was great! The best Indian food I've had in a LONG time. Yes, a little pricey-but it was worth it. The only complaint I would have to say is sometimes the staff was slow in refilling our water. 
The place had an okay sized crowd -tonight was a Sunday night.
Lamb Samosas, vindaloo, and chicken saag were especially good.
WE will come back.
