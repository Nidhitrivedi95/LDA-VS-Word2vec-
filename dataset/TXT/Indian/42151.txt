qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Bombay Grill is located along Hwy 7, past McCowan towards Markham. It's located in a plaza that also has the service Ontario office. 


Pros:  Decent Food,  Very good Mango Lassi, Faluda, Kulfi and decent prices. They have this great deal for meal for 4 people or something, you get lots of options to choose your dishes. Perfect for families. Decent naan (not chewy)

Cons: 
The decor is OLD as HECK... it's not rock bottom prices on the menu to get this kinda 90s decor. I grew up in a South Asian household and frequented Indian restaurants since I was a child. Walking in here takes me back to the 1990s... and it's 2015 for crying out loud. 

The owner seems friendly and wonderful. But the times i've been there occasionally you get some staff lacks basic knowledge about menu items and sometimes pricing.   But that's okay! 

Would I come here again? Yes. But I would appreciate a change in decor!
