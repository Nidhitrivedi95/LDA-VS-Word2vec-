2B4bC4w4PDC8Pj53SfTG2g I love Indian food and I've been to all Indian restaurants in the valley but this place has AMAZING FOOD! I have to say it's my #1 Indian place, plus you can't beat the prices and food quality. They also serve fresh chicken samosas so BOMB and their mango lassi is to die for!
