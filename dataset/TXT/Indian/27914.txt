IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA I've been there numerous times now, and I am always amazed at just how good the food is.  Huge portions, wonderfully seasoned.  I get the chicken barg soltani and it is amazing. It comes with rice and a salad (or just rice if you prefer).  We always start our meal with some tadiq with gheimeh bademjan.  Making good tadiq is an art form, one which this place has mastered.  The yogurt salad (yogurt with cucumbers and mint) is stand-alone delicious, but I prefer to have it on my food.  And for dessert try the Persian ice cream.

If you've never had Persian food you are missing out on some wonderful meals.  There are numerous vegetarian dishes, also.  Give this place a try - you won't be disappointed.
