5PGBRXTNTUHmh24puxGtSg Great ambiance and vice, nice decor, friendly service and good food. I am addicted to their Raas Malai! The best ever! Their butter chicken and Naan bread are also delicious. We went on a Friday night and there was a live DJ and the waitress said that it will turn into a lounge/club on every Friday and Saturday nights. Will come back.
