RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Pretty standard Indian fare - not great.  The raita was soupy and flavorless.  We ate here with a coupon associated with the Penn and Teller show.  I think that is the only reason why this place stays open.  So how do they GET you - their rice is $9.00!  Yes, $9.00.  I will never return.  RIP-OFF!
