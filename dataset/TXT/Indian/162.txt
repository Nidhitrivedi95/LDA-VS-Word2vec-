-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g This is my favorite all time Indian Cuisine Restaurant I go to and in fact one of my top favorite food places in general. I always go for the lunch buffet and have been going here for 2+ years now.  The variety is very good and sometimes they switch it up but for the most part the food items are pretty consistent. The food is amazing and top notch quality!  The food is always on point and consistent with the quality. I have brought so many of my friend over the last 2 years and every single one of them fell in love as I did and they have started to bring more of their friends as well.  I have had many other Indian Buffets before but non of them compare to this place.  When I first started coming the prices were very good and I really liked it but recently the price has gone up (Especially on weekend they often have specials now with champagne and it is much more expensive than the week days) Even with the price increase this place is too good not to come and I still try to go often even though I moved a little bit further away.

Oh and the mango smoothie is included with lunch buffet and is delicious and unlimited garlic nun is dangerous because it is so addicting and good!

Our main server is very friendly always welcomes me back warmly and usually recognizes most of the friends I have brought in over the years since they have all become repeat customers.  I'll sure be going soon after I write this review and I suggest you go and find out what you have been missing out on ASAP.
