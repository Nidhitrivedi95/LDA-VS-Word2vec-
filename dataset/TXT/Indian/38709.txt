OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g **Vegans Beware**
Went here tonight with one of our vegan friends and boy did we have a bad experience. 
For starters it took for ever to get our order taken and when we asked our server for suggestions he said he was new and would go get someone else to help us with suggestions.  Our server returns and said they were too busy and that he could try with the couple things that he had tried. We placed our order, 2 appetizer and 2 entrees and then sat around almost another half an hour before anything was brought to our table. When our appetizer were dropped off one of them wasn't even anything that we ordered and when we asked where the app we did order was it we were just told that it was still on its way.
Now the biggest issue is one of our friends is vegan and that's the main reason we came here because she's heard good things, well her food was not vegan as it dairy based which we did not find out about until we started eating and questioning our server about what the appetizer we didn't order was. He then went and got the manager who told us her dish was vegan just the sauce was not.... At this point we decided that we would just leave and not have our entrees since at this point we could not trust what our friend ordered would be vegan or not. We offered to pay for our drinks but the manager insisted that we stay and he'd give us our food for free. I'm sorry but if you are server vegan or kosher food it had better be prepared that way. 
After telling the manager and server three times we'd rather not have the entrees they finally let us leave.  This was a very disappoint experience since our vegan friend was really looking forward to trying this place out.
