UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Excellent Indian food hands down. For the money, the daily buffet is a fantastic value. Really wonderful dishes. Everyone of them made with care and just delicious. Pretty much sampled everything and really liked the vegetarian tikka masala. Even garlic naan is included but I prefer the plain buttered naan. I'm not going to say it's a negative thing, but one night we went for dinner and not buffet and when our food arrived they were very small portions in small little bowls. And very expensive for the quantity vs. value I thought. The food was excellent but won't go back for dinner again.
