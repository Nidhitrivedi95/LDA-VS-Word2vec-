a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g Came here for our last lunch before leaving Toronto. Had always heard about famous Gerrard Street so wanted to try a place from there. Ordered a lot of vegi dishes. Everything was really solid but the paneer tikkah wrap was outstanding. MIght be one of the best wraps I've eaten. Service was decently fast. The place is complete dive but serves really solid food. Would definitely be back.
