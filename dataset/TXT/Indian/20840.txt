g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA We tried samosa chaat and the chicken curry combo plate. Now I expected that for 5 dollars samosa chaat would be 2 samosas but uh uh came with one. Taste wise it was alright nothing like authentic indian chaat. Coming to the chicken curry plate, comes with a paratha, pulav, chicken curry. we were disappointed that the roti  (bread) was the frozen type. I mean seriously for 7 dollars I have been to places that serve excellent fresh Naan and delicious curry. Chicken curry was the only good thing of the combo plate. It could have been a 4 star rating since it's really good taste and a decent place to sit but for the roti and slightly high price for one samosa in the chaat.
