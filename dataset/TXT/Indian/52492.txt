UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw Buffett style is great with vegetarian options. I'd like to try the dinner menu. The place is kinda dirty, rice was all over our table and our server cleaned it off onto the floor. And left it there. Nice people, food is amazing. I got an unsuspecting red chilli pepper that ruined my taste buds, but alas. I will come back here if to see the menu.
