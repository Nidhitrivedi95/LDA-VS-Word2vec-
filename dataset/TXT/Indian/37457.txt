OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Can't say enough about how good this place is and how good the service was. We called in ahead for a reservation of 9 people and they had a table ready for us even in a small place, which was great since we were all super tired and hungry. They adjusted well to our unusual dietary restrictions and the food was great. The only thing that could have been better was that the bread could have been softer. They also gave us papadum for free. The serving time was quite good and they gave us an amazing mouth freshener with the check. Good food and great people!
