82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Dahl Lamb was really good rich in flavor and ingredients. Highly recommended.

Can't say the same about Butter Chicken.
It was very poor in flavor and too creamy, almost as a bowl of hot cream with orange coloring with some unspecified non essential meat dipped in it. 
Very easy dish yet so disappointing. this dish didn't taste as the real indian butter chicken. 
It was an absolute washed down orange cream dish with no spices at all. 
I have eaten this dish all over the world countless times and that really is far from the real deal.
Absolutely not tasty at all, not fragrant at all.
There was no trace taste or smell of : 
tomato sauce, ginger, garlic, Indian chili powder, garam masala, dried fenugreek leaves, no chicken taste or any other ingredients that were supposed to be given the dish a traditional spice and fragrance. 


Go for spicy dishes with lots of ingredients if you are dining here. It will come out mild anyways.

Good service.

Very high price as for the food we got. 
On average with tax you will pay 30$ per dish. ( high tax)
