ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA This place is fairly new and a little further away from the Strip but i would definitely say it's worth the drive.We went in for dinner and were warmly greeted by the staff,after settling down at the booth the complimentary papadum was served with two varieties of chutney tamarind and mint.

We then placed our order
~Sweet Lassi $3.95
~Chilli chicken (spicy) $12.95
~chicken and egg fried rice $5.95

The lassi was perfect and the fried rice and chilli chicken were good.
What i noticed instantly  was the portions,they were way more generous than the average indian restaurants for the price point.Then the owner walked up to our table and asked us if we liked the Food,now me being a snob for indian food i was ready with various points and we got talking about how much we missed the taste of authentic Indian street food/dhabas.
He said they could totally customise it if we specify before ordering.

so I decided to get some food to-go
~Butter chicken $14.95
~Tandoori chicken $12.95
 
All the curries are served with a side of Rice.

I was blown away by the Tandoori chicken as was my husband and transported directly back to India.The chicken was well marinated,juicy and succulent with the right amount of spice.
The gravy of the butter chicken is one of the best i have had in the US.

We were so happy that we got the tandoori chicken and Cheese Naan to-go the very next day.
And Again it turned out to be perfect (this tandoori chicken is definitely a 5 in my books).

They also have a buffet for lunch which i'm going to try when i'm in town again.
The management is friendly and courteous,they will make you feel very Welcome.

Cheers!
