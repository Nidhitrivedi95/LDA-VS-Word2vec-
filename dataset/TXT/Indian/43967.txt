RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This is one of those Pakistani places that I go with a bunch of friends. About 8 of us go there to eat and clog our arteries. 

Okay, first and foremost, this place has been 'under construction' for at least 4 years since I have known of it and some of my friends told me they have been under construction for far longer. 

Now let's not kid ourselves, when you eat here, you are eating in glorified portables and during the summer they make their parking lot into a so-called "patio." The food is served on paper styrofoam and the cutlery is plastic. The decor and everything about this place screams 'low, low budget' except for their bathrooms which are in the new building, they nice and are in huge contrast to the rest of this place.  So for sure you are not going for the decor. Service is basic but serviceable. 

The food is not bad,  incredibly oily and unhealthy. However, it's very tasty and trust me,  you don't come to Tikka if you want to eat healthy food. Check your table after you and your group eat, the amount of grease is quite shocking. 

Normally, I will avoid rice dishes and just go for the veggies and the meats. Most dishes are in the $9-$14 range so if order a number of dishes, then it adds up, but nothing surprising about that. Yet overall, I refuse to believe this is the best Pakistani place in Toronto, it can't be. But when I ask people about a great place in Toronto, almost everyone names this place. 

Having said that, if you go with a group and eat communal style, everyone sharing, I think it enhances the experience. I would not take someone on a date here, for fear they might think I am cheap due to the horrible decor, however, I would go with a few friends simply because I do not know a better place.

All my Pakistani friends (4) think this place is great for the chicken, hence the name(!) but there are better options. Most of them in Mississauga.
