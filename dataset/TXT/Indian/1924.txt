-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ In order for me to give a good review, I look for the following things:  freshness/taste, cleanliness, and of course, good price point.  With their most expensive items on the menu being ~$10/$11, Kwality meets all of those qualifications!

Hostess, lady behind the sweets counter were both patient and nice when our order took longer than someone who's a regular.  During the meal, hostess even checked up on us, asking how everything was, etc.

We ordered 2 "lighter", app/veg items for dinner:  Channa Batura ($5.50) and Chaat Papri ($4.50). Turns out that both weren't very light at all, but quite filling, enough for dinner serving, that's for sure!  

(I love Indian food, but in general, I find it quite heavy, so I don't eat it often.)

Batura, fried bread, was delicious, and even though dish came with 2 pieces, 1 was more than enough for me.  Channa (chickpeas) were nicely seasoned.  With the exception of the pickled/salted mango, the other pickles were nice.

Chaat Papri was quite saucy, a bit on the sweeter side, but tasty.  Not sure if I'd be able to eat it on my own.  Good value though.

The only minus points was for the setting.  Seating was "closed off" from ordering counter and another dining area.  Kitchen was closed off as well as station that stated it was for Masala Tea.  I like open spaces more.  Actual restaurant looks larger from the outside.

I also ordered a Chai that never came, but I was charged for.  I told the staff and they were prompt to remove it from the bill.
