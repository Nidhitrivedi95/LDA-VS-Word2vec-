49taxSIx7Gwdjnr10QrnUw Zaiaka really just isn't all that good. First of all, it's in the middle of nowhere. So, I guess if you live around there then it's fine if you're looking for something less than exceptional; however, I definitely would not recommend driving out of your way for it (as I did). 

As far as food -- I thought the vegetable pakora was good, but everything else I found to be underwhelming (and one appetizer definitely cannot make up for $40 worth of food). The vindaloo wasn't all that spicy (despite my requesting it be very hot) and forget about getting any extra heat on the side. 

It was also a little strange because there weren't any other patrons inside -- so I was left whispering as though I were in a library. 

I mean sure, people seem to love this place a whole lot, so maybe you will, too, but I was definitely left wishing I had just went on a date somewhere else.
