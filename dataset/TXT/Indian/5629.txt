3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg Great place for Indian food in an area full of spots for this type of cuisine...
Standouts: lovely location and cozy eat-in area - clean and bright, very comfortable!
Everyone that works here is incredibly friendly and will help you choose a dish that you're sure to enjoy if you are not too familiar with Indian food (which I am not!).
We usually order the channa masala and naan bread (which is made fresh) and it's a great treat. 
Need to try the butter chicken after reading these other reviews!
