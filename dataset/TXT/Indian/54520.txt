W1iwBUfcDxoOPfhwr6EOGQ The Saravanaa chain is pretty rad overall, IMHO, bringing traditional South Indian dosas to major cities in the world. This one needs more staff, though service and restaurant itself is still impressive. 

I came here on a Saturday night expecting a kick-ass Masala Dosa(MD), stuffing et all, but they ran out of the Masala potato filling that makes the MD what it is.

So we settled on a Rava and Paper Roast instead, and it was OK. Next time I'll call ahead.
