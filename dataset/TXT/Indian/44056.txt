RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Very, very delicious food. What we appreciated was that while there was a bit of heat to the dishes it didn't over power the flavor. We had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which came tender, tangy, creamy. The best Chicken Tikka we've ever had. We also had the Sizzling Beef Kebabs and the Trio of Veggie curries, accompanied by naan and rice. 

While some may be  turned off by it's ambiance, I think it builds character and authenticity. The staff is also very friendly and helpful. We had a great time and enjoyed what was probably our best meal in Toronto.
