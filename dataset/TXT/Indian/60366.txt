ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Best Indian food around! They deliver too which is what I did and the food came hot and not soggy. I got the chicken curry and my wife went with the chicken and rice. They were both really good. The only complaint I would have is that it wasn't spicy enough, so next time I will be asking for extra spicy curry.
