Beautifully painted place with super cute and witty Sindhi jokes on banners; 5/5 for ambiance. The serving dishes are also very traditional and eye-appealing. I'd highly recommend their pani puri, sharmaji ki chaat, haryali chicken tikka, masala cola, and sindhi biryani! Seekh kabob are very average. Moreover, serving sizes are quite small. The chai is astounding in taste but never served as hot as you want it.
