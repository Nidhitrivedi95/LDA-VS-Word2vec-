iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA We're from London England (also known as the curry capital of the world) and we LOVED Marigold! Totally unexpected authentic Indian food. 

Our server Pushpa (ironically used to live in London) and we really enjoyed speaking with her. 

Great service, great wine, and great food! Get the masala dosa and chicken tikka masala for sure!
