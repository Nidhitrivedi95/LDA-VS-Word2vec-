Come on a busy day and they would show you  how they care a fuck about their customers. They promised us a la carte ordering for dinner and a group of around 40 people showed up after us. They quickly changed their attitude and went ahead to actually fight with us. Food looked like it was lying around for more than an hour. And bathrooms super yucky. Thumbs down till they reach rock bottom.
