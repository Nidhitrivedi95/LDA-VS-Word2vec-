FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I love this place. Lunch buffet is pretty good, but sometimes I can't get what I want, so I often go for dinner too. My favorites are veg samosa - which I eat with onion chutney, and Paneer Tikka Masala - Hot, spicy one. LOVE IT LOVE IT! If you are a student, they give you 10% off- so please do use them. it's my top favorite restaurant in town.
