x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ One of the best places in US that serves Indo-Chinese food. The other place that comes to mind similar to Inchin is the Chinese Mirch on the east coast. Out of the two Inchin wins in the food quality and taste and the options. Also it stands out pretty well in terms of the ambience and service. 

The pan fried chilli paneer and 'drums of heaven' are the shining stars of the big menu. Schezuan fried rice and cauliflower manchurian fares out pretty decent too. If you are in the phoenix area, Inchin is definitely worth the trip.
