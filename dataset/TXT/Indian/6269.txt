3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA This is one  of the best Indian buffets i have been to in USA. It's $14 but it's totally worth it. We were in Zion National Park for 4 days and really craving Indian food while on the way back to Vegas airport we stopped here and I am so glad we did. I had an awesome meal, there were 5 chicken dishes, a goat curry, 4-5 Indian dishes ( palak paneer, aloo mutter, korma etc) , nan and pulav. The only thing which I didn't like was gulab jamun which felt a little old but all in all a good restaurant.
I will def visit again
