ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg It pains me to write a negative review of this place, having had some good experiences here in the beginning but after several VERY disappointing meals delivered both by bitesquad and taken to go, I felt the need to share my experience in the hopes the owners/chef make some changes. I will add, I am relatively new to Indian food so I don't proclaim to be an expert. Our first visit was very good, I thought the Naan bread was a little thin and overdone, but improved on the second batch and later visits. Butter chicken was initially good, but after the second or third visits, then ordering take out and delivery on two occasions the quality dropped significantly. This last order, I was really craving butter chicken and begged my husband to give them another shot - hoping this would be the turnaround meal. We ordered the garlic shrimp, butter chicken, jasmine rice (because the last time we ordered the peas pilau we actually got vegetable rice instead.) The garlic shrimp was not what we expected, full of bell pepper, onions and no hint of garlic - but being newer to Indian cuisine I'm sure that error was based on our expectation versus the reality of this dish. On the flip side the menu didn't describe the dish in any way, so that's really what my review is based on. The real reason for my poor review though is based on the butter chicken. The pieces of chicken are pathetically small and sparse. On top of that, there was gristle and cartilage in this last batch, and the consistency is seasoning has been very all over the place. Going from almost too hot to eat at a spice level of 2 to bland and no heat at a 1. I was initially excited about this place and the people that work/own the place are really nice and sweet. But IMO there's no excuse for charging $14.99 for a dish with barely any chicken and with some seriously poor quality control.
