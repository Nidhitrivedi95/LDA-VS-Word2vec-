csDrjCYpINQtnIu7xA9oqw To be honest, the food was okay but not for the price that I paid for it. The service (or lack there of) was terrible! I would not have minded to pay a lot of money for exceptional service and decent/mediocre food, but this place did not have good service and the food was not exceptional. Their food was not bad, but it was not to die for, it would never be the kind of food I would crave for. The service was really bad though. When I first walked in, the employee looked up at the opening door but did not acknowledge my presence, did not greet me and did not direct me to a table. I randomly chose a table and seated myself, and proceeded to wait 5 minutes before bringing menus. The waiter just plopped the menus down on the table and quickly scurried off before I could ask any questions about the menu. After choosing what I wanted, I had to wait about 15 minutes before getting his attention to take my order. The only reason I COULD get his attention was by standing up and waving at him for awhile before noticing me. I have the waiter my order and immediately asked him to bring me water. As he hasn't done so yet. The food was served to me after a reasonable amount of time. The waiter seemed to hide behind the counter and truly seemed to do anything to avoid acknowledging and making eye contact to any of the customers. I would not want to come back to this restaurant until they fix the customer service problem. Otherwise, I would consider coming back to the restaurant for a more fancy night out. 

Also, the parking lot for this restaurant and the rest of the building that houses other businesses is ver small, tight and cramped  it may or may not be difficult for larger car to park, exit a parking or pass through the parking lot if the parking lot already had several cars parked in it.
