LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Shwarma's are unbelievable and the staff is awesome. They're generous about letting you try their food and are very friendly. Great value for awesome food.

I've been there 4-5 times and the food has been consistently great. Meat is always good quality and tender while other ingredients seem fresh.
