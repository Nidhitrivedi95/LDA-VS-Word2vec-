wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw Ambience & Decor: Ethnic, contemporary, very high ceilings & open concept seating plan. (4 stars)
Service: Service is good, the staff are welcoming. 3.5 stars.
Food: Is good a few dishes like halwa/puri/chole, veg thali are outstanding. (4stars) 
The vada pav & pav bhaji were okay, the amritsari kulcha was good. (3 stars)
The Sindhi ka Rabdi Falooda which is a signature dessert was very disappointing. Had to ask if rabdi was added, the falooda was water logged & over cooked, the whole dish was not sweet enough. 
The place is interesting enough to revisit.
