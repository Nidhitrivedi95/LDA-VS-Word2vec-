F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Thoroughly enjoyed!

I just had a date with the wife here.

Service:  attentive, prompt, pleasant.

Ambience:  modern, comfortable.  Midday Thursday, few other guests.

Food:  delicious, fresh, plentiful.  Ordered fish in hot garlic sauce, roast chicken, spicy potato with gravy.  We then ordered extra roast chicken to take home to treat family, and they gave complementary rice.

Location: very accessible, at Hurontario/Eglinton southeast plaza.  Plenty of parking.

Price: very good.  Four dishes with two extra rice servings totaled $52 pre-tip. 

Overall, I would gladly recommend it to all.
