ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg We found this place on Zagat's and Yelp as we were traveling southward. We'd already planned a stop in Charlotte, so we thought this sounded great. It's in a beautiful early 20th century home, nicely set back from the street and with a nicely decorated interior (a lot of - ahem - copper in the decorations). SO - a nice first impression.

We read that their specialties are Indian and Indian/fusion, so (since we have a lot of good Indian fare not far from us) we both went with the fusion-y side of the menu. The bread (I can't now recall what it was - naan-like, with fillings) was delicious, and the main courses were both really good. Again, I waited too long to post, and I don't recall what we had; my husband really liked his, probably fish - mine (probably chicken) was good, but I felt a little let down - I'd hoped for more oomph and flavor.

Portions were reasonable, prices high but not out of line. Setting is fabulous - elegant, romantic. Definitely liked it, would go again (but I might go for Indian food this time instead of fusion - it smelled wonderful).
