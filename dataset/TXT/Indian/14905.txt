cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg It's morning and the leftover still taste amazing. We ordered the standard butter, taste great and not like your normal butter chicken. We also ordered the chicken korma which had a nice fresh tasty sauce. Even the naans were fluffy and flavorful. Would love to go back again.
