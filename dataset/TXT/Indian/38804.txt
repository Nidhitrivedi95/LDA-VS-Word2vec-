OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We took a slightly different approach to Indian and chose Urban Turban over other options.  Definitely had an excellent meal full of flavor and spice. Some great Indo-Chinese options here and the food seems very fresh. Throw in a couple of friendly and fun waiters and you have a great experience. Pro-Tip: end your meal without a paan shot, so good!!!
