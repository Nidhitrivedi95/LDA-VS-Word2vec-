Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Confused about all the great reviews for this restaurant...if you think this is great hakka food then you really haven't eaten great food. Everything is deep-fried and even though I explained what I was  looking for what I got wasn't even close. We were told to order medium-hot...that it was spicier than most could handle...not hot at all.  I guess for a neighbourhood haunt it's ok...there's no competition in this area...but not food worth traveling for and definitely not the service level i'm accustomed to
