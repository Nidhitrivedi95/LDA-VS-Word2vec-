z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Worst indian food I have ever eat in US.  

If you read my review I bet you that you will regret if you give a try to this place. 
it's a joke of indian food. I have been eating paneer kadhai from 20 years and I know how it should taste. It was horrible. first time I went for dine in and the food was horrible , customer service was awful.  After 6 month we taught we will do take out order and will order something else than we ordered last time. I honestly thrown it in garbage as I felt horrible taste and smell in food. I didn't wanted to go sick after eating that.
