zYn8m5x3CXYYb1bLjcyrNw Everything was excellent about this place. The best authentic south Indian restaurant by margin in GTA. We went to weekend buffet for 15$ and it was awesome. Must try place, if you love spicy south Indian food.

On weekend buffet please make sure you go at noon, if you go  around 2 pm or so, then its not worth it. Food will be cold, half of the items are empty and on and on..
