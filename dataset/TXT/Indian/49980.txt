U2SepNV2djq1hgk4WxL1mQ Thinking 4 stars is perfect, my husband and I eat there....wow, so many jars with spices on display, but our food did not even had a trace of salt! Rice which is so good at Indian places was bla without a hint of a taste. Forget about marsala... Thanks for eggplant's side dish - it was spicy, so, we both used it to have some taste in mouth. Samosas were not bad. The place needs a lot of improvement.
