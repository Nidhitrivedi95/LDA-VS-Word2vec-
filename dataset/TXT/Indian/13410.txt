bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug reno was good. It looks like a springrolls.. kinda. more updated decor, better lighting. food is still meh.... 

I just want to understand chilli chicken - I've never had good chilli chicken. Especially not the one here. I was excited to order it after reading all the other yelper reviews but when I get it ... it's just weird tasting. I keep trying and the dish just keeps.. sucking. I dunno, it's probably just not my thing. I've had better hakka food elsewhere.
