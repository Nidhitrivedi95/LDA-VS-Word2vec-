Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w This used to be the best place to get momo. We would come from Mississauga when we wanted good Tibetan food. Haven't been in a few months and came down and it moved to 1500 queen street. 
Well what a disappointment. The beef momo are made differently. They have a think gross shell of Dough and the meat inside wasn't even cooked properly.  
We also ordered shabtak. The girl on the phone asked if I meant chili beef. I said ok. Well it was like beef jerky with gravy on it.  Horrible and not like any other restaurant ever served it.  Such a waste of time and money.
