gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw It was late and I was hungry, so I hope that didn't cloud my judgment too much.  Prices are beyond reasonable (a characteristic of any good food stop during a lovely evening bar hop), and the menu was... varied... I stuck with the traditional, falafels, pita, and hummus.  YUM!  

The hummus had the perfect balance of tahini and lemon (and you get a generous bowl full).  It had a nice tang without being overpowered by the sesame.  The pitas were just crisp enough on the outside but warm and tender on the inside (they serve flatbreads, I think for $0.99 each, not pocket pitas), and the falafels could have been a little more done on the inside, but overall very satisfying.  I took a bite or two of a friend's gyro - which was traditional, warm, and good.  Made from meat sliced off a spit, not that creepy rectangular compressed stuff equivalent to Oscar Meyer bologna that you sometimes find at festival gyro stands.  Definitely a thumbs up when the hunger pangs hit while checking out the Fremont bar scene.
