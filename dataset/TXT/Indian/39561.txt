I know.. I know.. I always say service usually depends on the server but nevertheless I do have to mention it here. Our server seemed pretty friendly at first until we were seated and then it all went down. I'm not sure if he was trying to friendly but it just came out to be simply rude.

We started off with some appetizers and being here for the first time - we asked for few more minutes to decide on the entree. Our server's response "Hurry Up! Okay" - not that we were taking that much time and I would probably understand if the place was packed which it wasn't.

The food here is good. The buffet supposedly a lot better but haven't had the chance to try yet. Given the service, I think the buffet is the way to go at this place.
