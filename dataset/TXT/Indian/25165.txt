hbzVZzrEeREZsd2jzwL1YA Is Dosa Rama a pun on Dollarama or it is named after the god Rama, the seventh avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu?  I walked in because I thought it was punny. Based on the religious decor, it is likely the latter. I have a feeling the owner may not have appreciated my pun. 

My companion and I walked in during the buffet service. The buffet option is $9.99 on the weekend and $7.99 on the weekday.  Needless to say, it was busy. The service was decent nonetheless. The staff was friendly. Service was prompt. 

We had sweet coconut appam moments before entering the restaurant and did not feel we can justify unlimited dosa. The risk of food coma, far outweighs the notion of economy. We made the responsibile decision in avoiding a situation with a "diminishing return on investment" and shared a rava onion masala. 

The blend of semolina and rice rava onion masala crepe was gigantic. It is filled with an impressive amount of masala potato. It was flavourful. Consistency of the tomato chutney, coconut chutney and mint chutney were thin and watery. The crepe was very thick relative to other dosa restaurants. While it had the same crunch, it lacked the finesse of a typical rava masala dosa. 

Rice crepes being served to other diners, seem light and crisp! To determine whether this is the case of "grass is always greener on the other side of the fence", I may need to come back with my stretchy pants a lunch buffet.
