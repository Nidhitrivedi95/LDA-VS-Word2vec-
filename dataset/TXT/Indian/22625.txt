gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I have found my favorite Indian food place and plan to return many times. There is a fabulous selection of mostly Vegan dishes, chai tea is included with the buffet and you get complimentary crepe-like bread stuffed with seasoned potatoes. Feed all your Indian food cravings at Ruchi.
