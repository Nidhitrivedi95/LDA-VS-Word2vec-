A_05gZ2QwayLb0YeQ_TItQ This is an authentic Indian restaurant. The family owns this business and they cook your dishes themselves. At the beginning, you might think that this hole within a hole in the wall might be a bit sketchy, but trust me it's worth it venturing out of your comfort zone. Their Masalas are God sent: crispy on the outside and tasty on the inside.... yum also their Biriyanis get sold out FAST so get one when you can. Overall, if you're looking for some authentic Indian/Pakistani food, Chennai Express will definitely satisfy your cravings.
