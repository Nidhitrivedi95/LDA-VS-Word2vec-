AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw Hot pockets from India.  These rather large pockets of delight have been a weekly work lunch trip lately, a few dozen beef, chicken or lamb or the chopped chicken tandoori.    I highly recommend hitting them up at 11am before the lunch rush when they are freshly fried.  Ask for a coupon, they have some behind the counter for next time; buy a dozen get a few bonus. I recommend the spicy light green yogurt sauce and no others.
