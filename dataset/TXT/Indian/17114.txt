DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I love this place.
Food is amazing, very tasteful and nice presented. 
I love the ambient, unlike other Indian restaurants they've put in an effort to make this place look different, not just another office space turned in the restaurant. 
My favorite is definitely Malai Kofta and no other place can make anything similar to that! Always to be back.
