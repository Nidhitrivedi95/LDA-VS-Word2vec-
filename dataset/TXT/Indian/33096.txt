llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Terrific food, good service, nice menu selection make for an outstanding experience at this restaurant. My new favorite Indian food restaurant in the Phoenix area! The selection of naan breads is particularly good. Also impressed with the wait staff who were always refilling our drinks and checking on us. Will be back again and again...
