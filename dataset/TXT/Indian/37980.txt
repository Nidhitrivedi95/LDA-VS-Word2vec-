ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw My favorite place to eat Indian food in Las Vegas. Selection is very good and its always a good experience to eat at this restaurant. It is tad expensive but I will any day pay that premium to have top quality Indian food. Perhaps addition of a few vegetarian items will make it even more attractive. Will always recommend to anyone who wants to have top quality Indian food and wouldn't mind paying a bit of a premium for that. We recently had a group dinner as well and again the experience was just fabulous.
