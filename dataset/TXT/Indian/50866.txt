uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w Unfortunately a bit hit or miss.  Sometimes the food here is spectacular and absolutely on point and my friends and I will gorge until we're stuffed for days and regretting our decisions in life.   But, even when the food is good however I recognize that it isn't as flavorful as it should/could be for Indian cuisine. Other days the food is just almost unpalatable and doesn't look like it should be served.
