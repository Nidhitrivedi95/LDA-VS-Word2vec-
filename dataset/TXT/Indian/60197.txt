ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Even though I had to give one star because Yelp doesn't let me post with zero stars, I will NEVER go back!!! went there in the evening on 01/23/2012 to celebrate my wife's birthday and it was a terrible experience.  The walls are riddled with muck and the cheap quality furniture is very uncomfortable, the staff is unfriendly even though there were no other customers there when we arrived! (Note to self: when you enter a restaurant and there's no one else dining there, turn around and exit!)

Now to the menu - be forewarned - there's NO alcoholic beverages or even sodas! Are you serious?  Yep.  The chicken vindaloo my wife ordered only had three pieces of chicken and three gigantic pieces of potato - that's it, for $11.00 - what a rip off.  My paneer curry was too sweet even after I asked them to make it spicy.  I'm indian and I like spicy food.  They couldn't even do that right.  We bought my grandson along too so he can celebrate grandma's birthday.  Poor kid took one bite of the dosa and didn't touch it after - he said it was too hard.  Sad to say, we all left the restaurant hungry and disappointed.  The staff didn't even have the integrity to apologize after we complained - what a dump. 

They think just because they're located near UNCC that they will always be profitable, but being cheapskates with food quality/quantity will not let them stay in business for long.
