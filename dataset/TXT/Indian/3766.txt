0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I went here on the recommendation of a friend.  I was not impressed.  The location/neighborhood is scary.  The restaurant is old and outdated inside.  The prices for the complete dinner was very reasonable.  The spice level on my meal ordered mild to medium came out HOT. (compared to others at my table and the way they ordered their dinner).  The naan was good when hot, not so good as it cooled down.  The mango lassi was delicious! The service was inattentive and lacking.  I won't go back.
