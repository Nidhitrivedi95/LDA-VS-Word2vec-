xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw Tonight my husband and I visited Cleveland Tiffin and we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience.  Before I get into sharing about the food, I must express how friendly and personable Anup and everyone at Tiffin were.  While waiting for our food, Anup shared fascinating information about Tiffin Carriers in India.  I will continue to learn more about this process on my own.

     Now on to the dinner,  I am vegan so I ordered the Palak Paneer and traded out the paneer for tofu extra spicy.  I also ordered Vegetable Biryani extra spicy.   This was a delicious meal.  The spinach and tofu was so flavorful and fresh and the Biryani was aromatic and addictive.  My husband orders the Chicken Tika Masla.  He also enjoyed his dish as well.  The portions are large so I have a lot of food left over to eat.  All dishes are made to order...like a homemade meal.  With that in mind, prepare to order a couple of hours before you plan to eat dinner.  It is definitely worth the wait.
