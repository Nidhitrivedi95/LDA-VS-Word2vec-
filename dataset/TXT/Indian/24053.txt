GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg Writing this review as I dine here . We were a group of 7 on a Thursday afternoon . We were the only people in the restaurant . Mediocre food but ridiculously long wait time . Reached around 11:45 am got my food at 12:45 . I guess there was only the owner who had to take orders, make and serve food . There was this other group who got in but had to get to go boxes since the food did not arrive on Time . And the temperature inside was super Warm . Arizona summer and no air conditioning - duh ??
