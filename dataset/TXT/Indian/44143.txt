RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Mediocre at best. I went with my boyfriend a couple of months ago. 

 I ordered the vegetarian combo, I don't remember what he had. We are both huge fans of Pakistani food, but we were both very dissapointed and felt this restaurant didn't hold up to the hype. 

 As someone who regularly eats authentic Indian and Pakistani food (twice to three times a week) I thought the food was way too greasy and gave us huge stomach aches. Same thing happened with my Pakistani friends who went here, as well as a lot of people at my work. 

We both feel it wasn't worth the price, and we aren't coming back.
