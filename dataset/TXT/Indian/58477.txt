yjBKddxPSOV4vjxWRCX0ug I'm not really masterfully adept at recognising a good Indian: my weak British mouth can't handle the chilli and often leaves an unshakeable burning sensation for the rest my meal, ultimately ensuring I can't make head or foot of what I'm eating.

Deciding to man up and re-kindle my Indian food knowledge I opted for the BBC's kashmiri curry with a liberal dose of Cobra beer.  Much to my surprise I found I could recognise each flavour rather than  sweating the spices away and subsequently had an enjoyable meal.

Reasonably priced and with a cool name, I'll be back again.
