To start we had the Chau Chau Soup...absolutely delicious, not to be missed. Then we shared 3 vegetarian dishes, Vegetable Korma, Mutter Paneer, and Malai Kofta...all were delicious. We also had Chicken Makhani (butter chicken) that was outstanding. The hot Marsala Chai tea was so pleasant and warming.

We're in from out of town on business, but always make room to stop here for a great meal.

Thank you Mt. Everest!
