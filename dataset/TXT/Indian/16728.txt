DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Really excellent Indian food, with full flavor and large portions. Certainly the best Indian restaurant in the Valley, and all the more special because of the focus on Southern Indian cuisine. The interior has really fantastic large format photographs that will immediately cheer you up. Everything we have ever eaten at Udupi has been delicious.
