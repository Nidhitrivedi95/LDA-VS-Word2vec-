ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I gave India Garden 5 stars because it is 'as good as it gets' anywhere in northern Ohio.  Consistent, flavorful and reasonably priced.  The menu is extensive with A great selection of vegetarian items to go along with the traditional meat items like chicken, lamb and even Goat.   The vegetable pakoras are fantastic, not too oily or heavy. Great breads also. I do prefer my food to be extremely spicy and this restaurant can bring the heat if you ask for it. The buffet is worth the $9 if your into community eating. This is the best Indian food around if not one of the better restaurants period.
