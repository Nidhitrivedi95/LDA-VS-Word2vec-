PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg I love the Mosque Kitchen! been heap of times and will continue to go back because it's just really good food, fantastically cheap and friendly lovely staff!

Went again last night - in between fringe festival shows - yes there was a wealth of food stalls around George Square but nothing took our fancy and decided to opt for filling, wholesome, big portion great value food at the Mosque.

It was really busy (a victim of its own success and location) but staff were apologetic, helpful and did everything they could to keep the food coming and get everyone served as soon as possible. 

If you haven't been before you may find the Mosque Kitchen a little rustic - for me this part of the charm... The Kitchen is situated in the grounds of the Mosque with access from West Nicolson Street and Nicolson Square. The seating area is outside, but under cover - basic, tables and chairs, no frills but clean and adequate for eating your meal. 

Don't expect table service - you will go into the cafe area, where you can pick from and array of dishes, cooked and ready to serve, cafeteria style, pay, sit, eat, enjoy! 

The food is just delicious! There is normally a lamb curry, chicken curry and at least two veggie curry options, rice, naan bread and some sides. Portions are generous. 

Last night I had a minced lamb curry with rice and a meat samosa. My friend went for the Vegetable Curry, opting for half and half of each. I paid less than a fiver! It was delicious, chocked full of vegetables and extremely filling. 

Will be back again soon!
