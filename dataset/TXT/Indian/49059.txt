TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Went in here for dinner with a friend and was pleasantly surprised.  I tried the buffet in order to maximize my dinner with different options. Everything tasted great. The butter chicken and the chicken curry were both my favorite. The owner was very pleasant and helpful in explaining things to me, with it being my first time eating Indian food. 

It was definitely a good dining experience and with the food being so delicious I will definitely go back!
