H4PWUUInSMs5i8uPpMCwSw What? A new Indian restaurant in the neighborhood? I'm there. Billu's Indian Grill is on Banksville Rd., adjacent to the Day's Inn, where the now defunct Maharaja used to stand. Good riddance Maharaja, this is most definitely an improvement over that unhappy place. We went for lunch yesterday, eager to give the buffet a try. First impressions are that they gave this place a much needed deep cleaning, as it looks better, though the decor has not changed. We were greeted and offered a booth and a beverage, and we both asked for masala spiced tea, then headed for the buffet. It's a smallish buffet, with both vegetarian and meat options available. The cold buffet with the raita, chutneys and salad is around the corner, which we missed on our first go 'round. Yesterday they had chicken tikka masala, goat curry and tandoor chicken for the meat choices, and dal, a spicy potato dish, cauliflower and mutter paneer for veggie options. They also had those yummy fried vegetable fritters, rice and naan, with kheer and that sweet shredded carrot dish for desserts. The chicken tikka was excellent, and the mutter paneer was light and delicious. We both liked the spicy potatoes and the cauliflower dish. I found the other dishes a little oily and heavy for my taste, but this is Northern Indian food, and that's the style. The food has good flavor, with cardamon, cloves and cinnamon showing up in quite a few of the dishes. They sweeten the masala tea here, and I wish they wouldn't do that...people can add sweetener to their tea if they want it, and I do not. Service here is thorough and friendly, and the hospitality of the staff is wonderful, so they get points for that. We'll be back.
