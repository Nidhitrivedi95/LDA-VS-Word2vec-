nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ Definitely one of the best Indian buffet restaurants in Peel. There is a lot of variety in every section (appetizers, curries, desserts). The dosa and sambar, kabobs, chicken curries, dal makhani and chili chicken are all excellent. Some other dishes should really be better: roghan josh, amritsari fish, some of the paneer dishes.
But the overall taste and spice of the dishes is very good. 
Also, pleasantly surprised by the restaurant's ambie.nce and look. inside décor is very good. Photo gallery does not do justice
