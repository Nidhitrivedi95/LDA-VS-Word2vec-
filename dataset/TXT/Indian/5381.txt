2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw When you get 5 samosas for a buck I don't think you should be questioning how good they taste. I'm pretty sure samosas in India are around the same price if not more expensive. Be prepared to stand in line though as Embassy is really popular. I saw people in the line picking up as many as 40 samosas. I got the regular vegetarian samosas, chicken samosas, onion pakoda and a chilli pakoda all of which were really cold and tasted kind of crap except for the vegetarian samosa. I guess thats the only thing that gets made fresh. Not the best samosa I;ve had but probably the cheapest food I've bought in Canada and that includes cup noodles. The only problem is my friend threw up right after eating them. I'm not sure if it was in his mind or if the samosas were bad but thats what happened.
