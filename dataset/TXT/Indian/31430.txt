ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw Hole in the wall indeed. I have been there for several occasions. It's quick and close to work. Food quality is low. Price is economical. Nothing to write home about. 

Generally, vegetable curry is $4.99 without rice or naan. Vegetarian combo is $6.99. Meat combo $7.99. 

Daily specials are also offered:
Monday - 1/4 Tandoor Chicken with Rice or Naan ($3.99)
Tuesday - Chicken Biriyani ($3.99)
Wednesday - 1/2 Tandoor Chicken with Rice or Naan ($7.99)
Thursday - Butter Chicken with Rice or Naan ($6.99)

Naan is made to order at Indian Biriyani House. There are not many Indian food options in the neighborhood, if you are looking for a quick bite, pre-made heat lamp food is not a bad option. 

If you are able to walk for blocks, I would recommend heading to the Village by the Grange. The general rule of thumb is, the further west you walk, the less commercial and cheaper the food offerings. Not to mention it's a good exercise before you indulge!
