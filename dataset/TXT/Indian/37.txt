-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g FANtastic! This review is for take out. I ordered Aloo Gobi (with a slight modification that they were HAPPY to accommodate)). They allowed me to order at the bar and I asked if I could wait in my car and they said "absolutely" and offered to take it out to me. They brought it out within minutes! When I got home I was happy to see that the portions were large and the food was piping hot! The rice was yummy and fluffy! The garlic nann was great! Aloo Gobi was superb! I was VERY happy with the food and the entire experience.
