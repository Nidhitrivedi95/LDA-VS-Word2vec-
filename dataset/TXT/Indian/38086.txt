ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw My family and I were craving Indian food during our trip to LV and for some reason, it was harder to find an Indian restaurant on the strip than one would imagine (things may have changed since those days). 

So off the strip we ventured, determined to find a solid Indian meal and found ourselves at Origin India. Not knowing what to expect, we were beyond pleasantly surprised - the ambiance is not that of your usual stuffy Indian restaurant (I know, I have so much faith in my people). Rather it was uncluttered and tastefully decorated, combining both traditional elements with avante-garde accents... clay colored walls and archways reminiscent of Delhi's Red Fort, which were offset by modern touches such as comfortable brown leather chairs and sleek wooden tables. 

The menu echoed the mix of tradition and contemporary, including staples like samosas and Rogan Josh, but was also had unique offerings such as Atlantic black cod and Grilled Canadian rock lobster. Everything we ate was delightful and the service was great too.

The distinguishing nature of this establishment is a testament to its founders, an England-based restaurateur couple that modeled Origin based on their industry experiences in the UK (which is well-known for their Indian cuisine).
