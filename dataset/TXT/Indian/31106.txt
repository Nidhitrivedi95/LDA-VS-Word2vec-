kkJVhJjF54GOk7ScR_tgIQ I'm glad there is finally a nice Indian restaurant in Oakville. We tried the chicken biryani, butter chicken and vegetable pakora. All the dishes were very good. The portions were also a good size. The basket of naan was delicious. I could just eat that alone. The service was prompt and she was very helpful with the menu. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.
