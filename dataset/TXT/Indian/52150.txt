UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Mint is a nicely outfitted casual Indian/Himalayan restaurant near UNLV and DRI in the center of town.  I have been there for lunch - they have a very good buffet - wider range of options than most buffets of this type, high quality ingredients, and very good mix of salads, soups, vegetarian dishes, and dishes with chicken, paneer, goat and other items.  Restaurant is very clean, service is professional, and providing fresh naan made to order as opposed to providing this on the buffet line is a nice and high quality touch.  Toughest aspect here is tight parking in the shopping center (not the fault of Mint, and can be dealt with).  Highly recommended.
