ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg There is a lot of great things to say about this place. The owner/staff are super nice and on top of there game. I have tried the chicken biryani , butter chicken , chicken vindaloo , and the tandoori chicken.. They all were amazing to be honest. Flavorful , spicy ( to your liking ) and delicious. The rice was cooked perfect! The garlic Naan goes great with everything. Defiantly give this place a try.
