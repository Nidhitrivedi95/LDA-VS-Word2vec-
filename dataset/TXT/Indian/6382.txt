3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Was really hoping this place would be good as there were some good reviews for it, but it just wasn't. Ordered garlic naan and butter chicken and rice. Garlic naan was ok, nothing great. Butter chicken was not good. The butter chicken from Longos is better than this. It had no flavour and was probably one of the worst butter chickens I've ever had. Also, the rice which cost 3 dollars extra was just plain white basmati. I should have saved my money and made it in my rice cooker at home it was so disappointing.
