NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Choolah is very large, very modern, very busy, and very hard to get out of! It's located right on a shitty spot on Chagrin, but crazy traffic and bad drivers won't stop me from going there. I love the paneer tikka masala- the paneer was deliciously creamy, and the restaurant manager informed me that it's made by the Amish in Amish country. Very cool. The chicken biriyani was good, but I enjoyed the tikka more. My only qualm is the price of the sides: $1.50 for a rather small section of naan is a little pricey. The samosas were good, nothing special. 

While the food isn't authentic, it's suited for American palates and I still love the concept. Try it out.. and exit near the service exit for the dealer next door. Waaay easier than trying to turn left on Chagrin.
