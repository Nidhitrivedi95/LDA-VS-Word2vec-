-w3Ba4RXUYgdLwr4sbOhIQ I went to this little take out Indian place in August 2015, and I really liked it. The quality of the food was amazing for the price. I had the palak paneer and shahi paneer with spicy chutney and it was soooo good! Especially for the price. Well seasoned, perfectly cooked and most definitely fresh. The only downside I will say is that there was quite a bit of oil so I wouldn't consider it healthy by any means. Take out isn't usually healthy but just saying. They do have daily specials on the wall. Channa masala is $3.99 on Tuesday's, which is so cheap! Anyways I recommend this cute and tasty family owned place.
