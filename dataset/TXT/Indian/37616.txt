OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I decided to try this place on whim after it was suggested to me and it did not disappoint. The service was very good and the hostess  was attentive in answering all my questions about the menu. The restaurant is small but cozy and quiet. If you can handle medium spice but worry about getting too much food, then I suggest one of the tandoori dishes. The paneer naan was also slightly spicy but worked with my dish. I went in very hungry and exited feeling very full indeed - it was the best meal I had after a full day of touring. If I ever come back to Montreal, I'd visit again.
