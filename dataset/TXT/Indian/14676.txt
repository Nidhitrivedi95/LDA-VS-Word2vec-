cCMyypY73m9GJBKI4RvFcw One of the good things about this place was that it had a very large and varied menu, and it seemed like it would have a very large and good lunch buffet (I went for dinner).  Unfortunately, I found the dinner to be rather pricey considering the food that we received.  I ordered the lamb tikka masala, and it was ok, but the meat was tough, and the sauce was just nothing special.  Copper restaurant is above and beyond a better choice at these prices, plus their chicken tikka masala is one of the best things i have ever put in my mouth.
