4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw I usually only go on Tuesday for half-off, so keep that in mind. I've been going there for the past 2 years semi regularly.

I would give the food 4stars. You get a lot for the price. The raw onion garnish is a nice touch. Naan is good.

I have to give the service 2stars (it used to be better). I understand its half-off, but the service is really unbearable. Its horribly slow. I'm quite patient too. I used to go a lot, but the poor service just keeps me away now.

Don't know their official policy, but I've never been charged corkage. I even brought in a case of beer just bought from the distributer around the corner, and they put it in their fridge to keep it cold.
