epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg Love this - went there this past weekend with my friend as we were walking by to Shoppers.. Decided to check it out since it's so close to my house.

Walked in, ordered Lamb Biryani and Butter Chicken on Rice - delicious!!

Definitely will be trying the rotis there next. I am so glad to have found a cheap roti place near my house!

Also, EXCELLENT service. The guy is super nice. I went to some other fancy expensive Indian place in Yorkville last month (called The Host) and their service was THE WORST, so a nice change and great to see that these guys put in the effort in service even if their customers don't pay ridiculous prices.
