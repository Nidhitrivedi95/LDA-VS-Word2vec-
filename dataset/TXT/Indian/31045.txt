kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I've only tried 2 Indian restaurants in Charlotte but this is my new favorite! The takeout order chicken Tikka masala, was AMAZING. The right spicy, enough sauce, the naan was well done and the entire meal was hot. The guy who waited on me was very polite at best 9pm and told me it would be 20min, I think it was out in 10.
