DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew this probably was the worst Indian dining experience I have had since I lived here.
I am surprised four n half star, our experience was below par at all level food service and value
We called in for table of six, around 9.pm - phone girl said yes come in but the  kitchen closes at 930 
So we rushed there and right from the start it seemed like Why have you Turned up - Go Away
The waiters, who could bearly understand English - Eastern European from her ascent was not welcoming - few of arrived early and the last family were a few minutes behind us and she ensured to remind us, twice, call them or we close. 
So we quickly ordered 1. Dhal Makahini, 2. Paneer Saag, 3. Veg biryani 4. Egg plant & two Idls for the kids. 
Food came out super quick, and boy it was off the mark totally - not one dish seemed to made fresh - all reheat and serve. Indian food especially when reheated changes flavours - all dishes here were below par, nowhere close to any level of classic Indian food as so many Yelpers have rated this spot - 
Most of us left of food and did not bother to take out .
Poor experience on all levels
DO not go here late, maybe their service and food is better during the early hours. 
Keen to know
