b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA Went to Sahib today after managing to avoid it for four years and I was not disappointed, they confirmed my suspicions, it was mediocre at best. It is a basic Indian joint, a bit too dark, probably to hide the food that you are eating. 

I ordered the Tandoori meat platter just to sample a bit of everything and my wife the thali. Flavoring was okay but nothing to write home about. The vegetables they served were the frozen kind...yuck, but that is standard Indian restaurant fare so I can't complain. (My fault for giving in and trying this place). Food service was sporadic, waiter apologized several times for slow service from the kitchen., even said "its not my fault". My plate was served in several parts as they forgot a portion of it.  My wife's thali arrived 5-8 minutes after my plate. The nan bread arrived ten minutes after the meal. The last piece of chicken was brought to me after the nan. I guess Rajiv was not in the building.

Overall not for me ever again, but certainly to please the pallet of  the West Islanders judging by the reviews. Enjoy folks.
