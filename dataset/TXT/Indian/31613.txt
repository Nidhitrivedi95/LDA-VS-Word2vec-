KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Positive: Open very late into the night, quick service, not too pricy, filling portions
Cons: Food is microwaved and not at all fresh, very oily and unhealthy.

Overall, i still go there from time to time because ultimately food is tasty, and having that kind of food occasionally (once a month) can't do too much harm to me.
