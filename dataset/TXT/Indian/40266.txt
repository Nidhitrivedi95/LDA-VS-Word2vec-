pJXhUly8CcrYan9FOrrjow I tried this on the basis of yelp reviews and I am impressed by the service Qasim and his employees provided! 
Bravo Qasim! I hope you never sell your business. We catered Haleem, Biryani, Veggie Pasta from Qasim for my sons first birthday party and ALL the food was delicious. EVERYBODY asked me where I got it catered. I hope your business flourishes. Haleem was outstanding! Best in all of GTA! And so was biryani and pasta! Delivery was spot on time even with a snow storm. 
Great Job and Thank you!
