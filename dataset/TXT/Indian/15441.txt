CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ Everyone had an impression of poor service at Indian Restaurants, this one overcomes that impression. Great Service and food. Limited menu, it would be better if few more items are added. Had Chilli chicken when I was there first time which was good, sad that its no more on the menu now.
The ambience can be better, now it does not look like Indian fast food place.
