Their concept is very entertaining offering both traditional and modern interpretations or new applications of old world flavors. I must stress the food is very nice but the service is not bad, it just was not the level to which I'm accustomed for this price range. We ordered the samosas and side salad which we split, Murgh Tikka Masala and Lamb Chops in Mustard Ginger marinade for our entrees.

The group we were sat near was quite loud which would not have been a problem if our waiter had spoken up. I had to ask him to repeat himself most of the evening. I was also disappointed he could not recommend a wine to pair with the Lamp Chops. A glass of Menage a Trois blend was quite nice by the way. Type A personalities may be more concerned that a runner brought our salad out as a second appetizer after the samosas (which are wonderful) when we had asked our server for to be served with dinner. The runner also failed to take away the empty samosa plate which cluttered the table. The food itself was excellent but those who put a premium on service should relax expectations.
