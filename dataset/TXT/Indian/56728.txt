xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw This is my favorite place for fry bread, and IMHO the best place you can go to get some.  I've been coming here since they we e at the location near 7th AVE and Indian School, and this spot is INFINITELY better.  Not the old location was bad, they just outgrew it.  This new location used to be a couple of different Mexican Food locations, most recently a Pancho's I believe, and was a Maya's before that, I think.  In any event, same great food, but a ton more parking and restaurant space

My favorites are the ultimate taco,  green chili stew with a fry bread, and hominy stew with a fry bread.
