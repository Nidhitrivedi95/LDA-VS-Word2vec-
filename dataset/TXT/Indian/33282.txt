llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g This restaurant has outdone itself! A $9 weekend buffet with awesome variety and great service! Being vegetarian, I was happily surprised to find so many veg options on their menu! They had veg pakoras for starters with condiments of chutneys, raitha and salad. They were crisp and very tasty! Main course was 5 veg curries/gravies. These were good (not awesomely delicious but still very tasty) and served with freshly baked naans and rice. We finished the meal with 4 desserts! But the icing on the cake will have to be the Zafran Chai included on the buffet menu! Apart from this, the non-veg menu has one starter and 4 curries. The staff were very courteous and ensured tht our water and naans were regularly refilled. The ambience with the Indian feel and Bollywood music on the TV is great!

Overall, we were thoroughly spoilt for choice, service was commendable and the pricing was very very pocket-friendly! Kudos to the chefs, waitresses and manager of this restaurant.
