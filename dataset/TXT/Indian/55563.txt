x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag Yum! Dropped in here last evening on the way home because traffic was bad and I had been meaning to check it out. 

Friendly and helpful (and cute) waiters, modern and welcoming décor, delicious food. The Hakka Vegetables are kind of like tempura - breaded with a very light touch, deep fried and a bit spicy. SO tasty! Great value for the prices.
