fCdcxvZJjkwh7PbOOWUmJQ The food was fantastic especially the the tandoori lobster risotto and the tandoori chicken. I have eaten around the world and this is some of the best Indian food I have had. You can tell it was made from scratch. The ambience in restaurant is nice. The service was excellent.
