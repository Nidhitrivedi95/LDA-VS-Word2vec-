cJLx99fsYPM0SlNfWLb4Ug I went in late on a Saturday night and there wasn't anyone else in there for the entirety of our meal. Besides being a little too quiet for my liking, the food was fantastic and the staff were super pleasant. The chutney that comes with the meals is tasty. The last time I ordered from there it was take out during prime time on a Friday night. The place was hopping. I will definitely have to come back to check out the buffet.
