Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q Food was really good. My gf had the cioppino which she loved, and I had the tandori steak tacos, and we started with calamari. All of which was really good. The cocktails are for sure the highlight. While the gimlet is a bit small for the $9 price, it is damn tasty. I think between us, we had almost all of their cocktails, and they were all really good. The one with chai infused bourbon was as perfect as any cocktail I've had in the valley, and I'll be back for that very soon.
