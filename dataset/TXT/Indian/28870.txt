jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Found a gem of a place right next to the airport with a view of the planes taking off. Apart from the location, the buffet was awesome.The mini samosas and the pakodas should be tried with the mint chutney. The butter chicken and the goat curry were good, the chicken biryani was well cooked and I liked the flavour. They give both plain naan and garlic naan (with no extra charge). I was so much full with the Non vegetarian items that I could not try the vegetarian food. My friend loved the vegetarian dishes though. Overall I loved the food here and the five star is for both the food and the view.
