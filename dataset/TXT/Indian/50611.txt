UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Been to Banjara several times and we order food from there at least once a month.  The food is good, the portions are large, and the value is excellent.

It's not a fancy place, very basic, and it's often busy (so plan ahead).  If they have a table of six and you are two, they will put you together if it's busy.  The staff can be a bit gruff when it's busy.

The food is similar to restaurants in Delhi (i.e. - northern Indian food) but slightly Canadianized.  They have all the regular foods: butter chicken, dahl, aloo ghobi, etc.  The naan is excellent and made in an authentic fashion.  They don't have a huge selection of chutneys, if that's your thing.

Oh, and there are usually a lot of people of Indian decent eating there, so that's a good sign.
