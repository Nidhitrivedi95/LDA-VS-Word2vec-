1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g Subba is a simple, local Nepalese/Indo-Chinese restaurant located on the 2nd floor of a building on Cedar Ave. on the Northside.  The entrance is non-descript - you would almost miss it if you weren't looking and one must climb 2 flights of stairs to get to the restaurant (note for people with mobility issues).  The space is large with basic decor and the staff was very efficient the night that we went.  They have a range of offerings from basic "Americanized Chinese food" to authenic Nepalese and other Asian dishes.  I ordered the shrimp lo mein and my boyfriend ordered the Mongolian Beef while our friends ordered the Lamb Biryani and the Hunan Chicken.  The prices are inexpensive and you get a lot of food for the money - enough to share.  Overall the food is good, and I would like to try the Nepalese food the next time I go.  Definitely recommend checking this place out.
