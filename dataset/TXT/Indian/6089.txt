3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA First time trying Indian food. Didn't know what to eat so we figured AYCE is a safe way to go to try everything. 

All the food was delicious!!!   Be aware, some were spicier than I could handle. But the yummy mango lassi hit the spot. 

Manager/owner was very nice and helpful. Prices are great.  Going to go back for dinner and try more items. 

Only reason why they didn't get five stars was the service from the wait staff. The manager came to the table more than the young girl that was supposed to be the waitress.   Only one other table was eating besides us and she walked past our dirty plates and we had to flag her down to get drink refills. 

Other than that. This will be our spot to go for curry and naan.
