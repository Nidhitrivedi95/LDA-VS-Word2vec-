yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Best Indian food in the state. Been to every "taste of India" you can imagine and this place takes the crown. Amazing vegetarian options, craft beers and wines. Service isn't the best but you won't have to worry, the food will make up for anything. The owner is super friendly and will make sure your enjoying everything. The nann is some of the best I've ever had. Get the korma or the tiki masala. Love this place and the market has some really cool stuff.
