jdylAP9AWIJVZ4O0T2YgIQ We live in a generation of complaining so if anything goes wrong people tend to think the worst of a place unless it is really that bad. The 3 one star reviews are a joke. 

Anisha: Many businesses have a minimum amount to use a card and why?  It costs them more money  for a small transaction.

Cee: No delivery that I know of. I could be wrong but I doubt it. 

Cee and Raj: Howcome you only have 1 review each and only for this place? LOL

Aside from that i've been to this place several times. It is in a crappy mall and surprising how nice this place looks. Nice ambiance. Service can be slow.

I've had their lunch special. Enough to feed two people. If my friend and I knew we would have ordered 1 plate!

I've done take out and no issues.

I like their pepper shrimps, fried wings and sweet and sour chicken. I have no real complaints. I'm giving it a 4 because of the overall experience going there time after time.
