nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA By far, this place has the best butter chicken that I've ever had. The best rated in Toronto award is deserving. 

I used to come here a lot whenever I needed my fix for Indian food when I lived in the area. I haven't dined in the restaurant, but the owner has always been friendly when I waited for my take-out food. I miss this place! They do offer delivery through Orderit.ca, so I can still get this butter chicken in the Junction. However, I feel the $6.95 delivery fee is a bit excessive.
