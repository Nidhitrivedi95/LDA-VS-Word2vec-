ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg The food was good but the service was awful. We came in for dinner on a Monday night when it was not completely full. Our server was very pushy to get our orders and then was so hard to track him down for water or dessert or the check. I would expect better service for this price range, hence three stars and not four despite the food. 

For food, we had the modern chicken Tikka with black sesame and apricot glaze. The chicken was cooked perfectly - moist on the inside with the glaze beginning to caramelize on the outside. The veggie biryani was also good. For dessert we had the kulfi, which was a small portion and left me wanting more because it was so tasty. I would come back but maybe avoid the service and just take it to go next time.
