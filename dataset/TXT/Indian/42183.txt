qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ I have finally found a place in the GTA that makes a wonderful paneer.  After (4!) long years in search of a good paneer that matched the paneer that I had in (believe it or not), Guelph, I've stumbled upon this jewel.  We came on a Sunday night.  

Initially, we had intentions to dine in the place but to be very honest, we were a bit sketched out.  First, there weren't that many people in the restaurant...so I actually had to contemplate for a second if I was going to go in.  Then, when we got in, there was a lack of lighting there and the table clothes were actual cloth...in need of cleaning 10 years ago.  BUT...the place smelled delicious so the bf and I decided to be brave and stick to ordering ...for takeout.  

We ordered a chicken korma and a paneer with upgraded garlic naan.  We also ordered a chicken pakora for starter.  The chicken pakora was sub-par actually and had that been the only dish I ordered, I would not have gone back.  The parkora was definitely not freshly fried and tasted re-fried/re-heated.  The portion was also very small for a dish that costed $10.  

The chicken korma was quite good and flavourful.  The only complaint I have is that they used a lot of dark meat, making the chicken taste very fatty.  Their garlic naan was definitely worth the upgrade because they used LOTS of fresh garlic.  

Their saving grace was the paneer makhani.  OH. My. God.  It was SO delicious.  The tomato sauce was just the right amount of flavour and they were bang on on the texture of the paneer.

This is definitely a place that I will come back to - hands down.
