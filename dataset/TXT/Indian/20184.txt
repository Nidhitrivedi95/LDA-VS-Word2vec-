fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA My first all you can eat Indian experience. 

I'd much rather go to a place like Bombay Bhel and pay a little more for exactly what I wanted and have better quality. The food didn't taste bad so to speak, but it wasn't fantastic either. 

The price was fair for AYCE and the venue is ok.
