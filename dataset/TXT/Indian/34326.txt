MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ Yeah, the best Indian cuisine we have had in Arizona. When we asked for our meal to be a 9 out of 10 on the spice meter, they didn't just throw in a bunch of cayenne pepper. The flavors and textures we full and well developed. The Naan was thick and fluffy with just the right amount of char. My one criticism would be portion size. Our entrees were much more sauce than goodies but the sauces were so good we didn't complain. We will most certainly be back, oh and the service was just fine. When my husband told our server that the beer was flat " go ahead and try it" he commanded, the server did! What more can you ask for!
