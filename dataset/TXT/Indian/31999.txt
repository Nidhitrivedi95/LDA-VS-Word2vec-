Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg Just came back from Atma and my boyfriend and i loved the food!! The service is very good, the staff is really nice, always smiling. We took one entree for two the samosa chaat, it was amazing!!! For the main dish my boyfriend chose the butter chicken and i went for the chicken korma, both were so yummmmmmyyyyy!!! All the flavours and spices wow!! I forgot to mention that when you enter the restaurant, there is a very nice food smell. The ambiance is really nice and it's cozy! I really recommend Atma especially it is your first time trying this type of food, this is the place you should go to!
