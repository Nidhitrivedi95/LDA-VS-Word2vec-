-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g This place is not the place to go if you are in a hurry. BUT if you want seriously good quality, fresly prepared, delicious food then this is your place.  Tonight we had the chili garlic nan bread, the vegetarian fried rice, the chicken vindaloo and the Chicken Milagu kari - all I can say is it was outstanding!  I have eaten in many Indian Resturants, in many countries but these people consistently produce excellent food that surprises me every time I go there. One of my all time favourites.
