-w3Ba4RXUYgdLwr4sbOhIQ I give them 0 stars. The quality of food was terrible I've never been so disgusted in my life. Ordered mateer paneer tasted like the green peas and paneer were just thrown in with a can of tomatoes. The paneer was yellow and translucent. The dish was so sour. I called the restaurant and the lady just made excuses. I hope I don't get food poisoning. Oh and let's not forget the bugs I saw only until after paying. I threw all the food in the garbage after one bite. Waste of my 22 bucks. Horrible restaurant never going back and don't recommend anyone else to either.
