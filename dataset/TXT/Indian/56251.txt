xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA This place is a Mississauga GEM.  I have friends that drive from far places just to have rotis and doubles from Leela's.
The goat curry roti is the best and i have never had a dish here i have not fallen in love with.
The servings are huge amd the prices are good.  The best part of it all is the warm and friendly service that comes with your order!
