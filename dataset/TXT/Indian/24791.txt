h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA I love it..  I only did take out and not sure I would eat in the restaurant.  It kind of feels like you're intruding into somebody else's home when you are in the restaurant, but that aside, I really only care for take outs in this case because I'm the only one in my household who cares for indian anyway.  

The food is great.  I just moved to Tempe from Ahwatukee, where I had my Indian Star to comfort me.. and this has turned out to be the perfect replacement.
