qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Red - the colour of Communism, interior design for brothels, Ferraris, and that delicious liquid which turns to this colour after being exposed to oxygen.  
This restaurant is not among those good things.  It would in a category of bad red things like....the tempranillo wine, cold sores, and Mountain Dew Code Red.

I was invited to Kensinton Market (cringe) by an OCAD graduate friend of mine to an exhibit which she was apart of.  I absolutely do not visit this area under any leisurely circumstances, I'm afraid that liberals may jump out at me and shout liberals things at my double windsor and oxfords.  I came here at night, which was extra frightening.  
Not ten minutes after arriving, she decides to for dinner with her select group of friends.  I couldn't believe that I was about to be left behind after making the effort venturing into this hostile neighbourhood just for her.  I just HAD to invite myself!

We walked to The Red Room, a place I never managed to notice despite walking down Spadina a thousand times.  

I hated the design....I mean décor.  The place looked like the hippy rendition of Montana's.  So here I am sitting at the table with this OCAD woman, her boyfriend who looked like every Shakespeare character I've ever seen in book illustrations, and their artiste friends.  I should have had the foresight to foreseen this harrowing disposition.  

The service here is bottom-tier, the food is Asian inspired mall cuisine, and I had absolutely no clue what type of music was blasting from the speakers.    

An evening devoid of chivalry, refinement, or good manners.  
The Red Room...yeah, I can think of a way to make this place live up to its name..
