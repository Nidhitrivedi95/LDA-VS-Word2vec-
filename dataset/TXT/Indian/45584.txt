ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Ordered bhindi masala for take out and received a yogurt curry with nothing in it...just the curry base. -______- Called the restaurant and the guy offered a rain check next time I order. So I guess that makes up for it somewhat. 

Samosas and pakodas were good. Aloo tikki left something to be desired. Kadai chicken was average, nothing spectacular.
