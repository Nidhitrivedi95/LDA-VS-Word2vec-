oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q We(me and 3 friends) got take out last night. Ordered chicken lollipop, chicken schezwan fried rice, chicken Hakka noodles, paneer chilli and veg fried rice. Most of the food was okay to eat but it lacked the amount of spiciness and the Hakka style of food we were expecting. We have tried other places for Indo-Chinese food, this one just din't please our taste buds as much.
