0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I used to always come to this Plaza to go to Bubble Republic, or Pheonix restaurants and I never noticed this place.

I normally don't eat Hakka food that often, so I never thought to try this place, until a friend suggested it.
Their dry chili chicken is probably one of the best I've had.  It was just the right spicy (on the spicy side), and it wasn't soggy at all, which I hate when I am eating chili chicken.  I definitely have to have a big glass of water with me when I'm eating this.
I also tried this other chicken dish, which was a fried chicken that was a bit sweet and was a deep red in colour.  It was amazing!  I can't recall the name of it right now.
