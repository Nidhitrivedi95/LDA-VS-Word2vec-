You can get a small dish(Biryani-Chicken/Mutton or any starters or main course ) for $4.5 and large for $5.5. You can have 2 course of meal during the day given the quantity that is provided. You can customize your spice level from 1-10. Go for real Andhra spice if you like. 

Last but not the least, don't visit because of cheap food, or spicy level, go for the awesome experience!!!!
