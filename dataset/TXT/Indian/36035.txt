NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ The food quality was horrible. I never tasted such bad Indian food in Cleveland. This was my first and last try at this place. I ordered Chicken Achari, Chicken Tikka Masala and Samosa.Never tasted such horrible sourly tasted Chicken Tikka masala in my life.  I couldn't have a single bite, tasted like eating tamarind pulp. God help me, this was not end. I was super brave to order one Chicken Achari also. The photo in their website was super tempting. But  in reality it was a liquid gravy with four piece of chicken with again horrible sour taste. Only saving grace was Samosa.
