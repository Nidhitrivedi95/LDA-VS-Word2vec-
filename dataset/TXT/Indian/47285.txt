TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ Sooo good! The Masala chicken and Jeera beef were both incredible. It's as if you've taken all the delicious flavors of Indian food and then added the positive qualities of a good Chinese stir fry. Boom, that's hakka food. The hakka style rice noodles were also quite delicious. One thing to beware of though is that they only take cash or debit and their machine doesn't read American debit cards.
