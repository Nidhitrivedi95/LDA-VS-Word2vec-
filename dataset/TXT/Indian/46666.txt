SxuD7iY8QO88PNbSdNmNKg Very good recipes and execution under the new ownership. Two dishes stood out for me: the paneer pakoda appetizer was a delicious cheese with light, tasty coating. The chicken tikka (marinaded and baked chunks of chicken, served on a sizzling platter with onions) was the tastiest, juiciest chicken that I have had in a long time.
