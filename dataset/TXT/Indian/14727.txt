CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A I went to Taj on friday driving all the way from middleton to way with my friends who work at UW. When i stepped inside the restaurant I can barely see any customers, we went for the buffet and it was horrible. All the dishes seems to be horrible they didn't look fresh at all. Only thing I liked is samosa which seems to be freshly made. I went to Dhaba, Minerva and swagat on west side and Taj seems to the worst of all. I will never goto this place and wouldn't recommend to my friends.

Stay away from this restaurant.
