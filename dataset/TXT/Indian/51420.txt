UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA the food and service is great here. it's much fancier than the older version, looks like they're revamping the interior.. but i was most floored when i saw the words "vegan" and "organic" on menu items.. i had to do a double take.. and was pretty skeptical while awaiting my dish but was pleasantly surprised - the food was fresh, not too salty, perfectly seasoned. 
oh yeah, it's about 50% indian & i recommend this place for indian food too. 
PS.
 TRY THE ROSE BALLS ( don't remember the actual name on the menu) they are the donuts thingys flavored with rose water. i've tried these many times in different cities but these are hands down the  most delectable.
