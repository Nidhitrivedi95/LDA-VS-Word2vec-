EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Naan were very yummy and fresh! Beef nihari was flavorful. Chicken Haleem seemed old though. Chia(tea) was good. Garden salad was literally just Lettus n bunch of croutons(skip tht). It's a hole on the wall type of place so don't expect much in terms of ambiance n the service mediocre. The food was "ok" but nothing extraordinary.
