cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg The husband and I are huge fans of Kathmandu - and we love that the waitstaff remember us though we aren't in on a regular basis. Their vegetarian items are universally fantastic, thought the Bengan Bharta and Paneer Butter Masala are really standout great. Their bhajis are kind of meh, but the samosa chat and/or chat papry really make up for it.  We've had the lunch buffet, and while we enjoy it more than most Indian lunch buffets in the city, the a la carte items are really where Kathmandu shines. They have recently partnered with JustEat.ca for delivery, which is a huge bonus.
