GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I love this place. Like I've said in other reviews, I'm a student, so I appreciate a deal. I'm also a foodie and have expensive taste, so I love when the three can come together on rare occasions, and bless me with great food! 

I love Indian food, especially Pakistani and Punjabi. I'm still trying things on the menu but so far, the Chicken Tikka was flavorful, I wish I would've gotten their wonderful saffron rice with it, instead of the regular basmati, but saving money, it tasted just as great. The Aloo Palak, potatoes with sautéed spinach and spices was a great vegetarian meal and went perfect with rice and their GREAT garlic Nan. 

I also had the the Goat Biryani and though I loath bones, the meat and saffron rice with the rendered fat from stewing made it worth the extra effort of getting through the many bones (that is to be expected with any goat dish at many ethnic restaurants and is part of the dining experience). Very well done dish.

Yes the atmosphere is laid back, but the owner caters to us college students and that keeps the cost down, I think they're the most reasonable Indian restaurant in the valley, that alone will keep me coming back. The service is good, laid back as well, the owner is very kind and attentive, again the food is great so I'll be back often, you should definitely pop your head in and start with some Nan and let your mind wander through the many choices..

They even have daily specials, like Halal Kung Pao Chicken one day...
