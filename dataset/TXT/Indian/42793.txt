RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg How excited am I to have Indian food just down the street from the office?  Pretty dang excited, I'll tell ya.

I'm even more excited that it's good Indian food.  On my first visit, I started with a tomato and coconut bisque.  It was delicious: smooth, creamy, and just the tiniest hint of coconut under the tomato and spices.  It avoided overwhelming sweetness.  For my entree, I had saagwala.  It was tasty: tender lamb and good flavors.  I might order it spicier next time, though.  I specified a "3," and it was pretty mild, although certainly not bad.

The interior is fun as well.  Red and blue contrast and various designs decorate the wallpaper.

The only criticism I have is that the waiter took quite a while to return our check.  He was apologetic when we flagged him down, but when you're on your lunch hour, you notice things like that.
