f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Phenomenal food. And amazing atmosphere. It's clearly and owner/operator family, and they were very concerned we ate well, and kept letting us know when the fresh cooked food was on its way out to the buffet. Even brought us fresh naan. 

Love these guys. Can't wait to go again.
