NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg You have to go to Choolaah!  You will be be so glad that you did!  Whenever my family visits Cleveland we always go to eat here, my husband and son insist upon it!  Even if we have a hotel room across town, we don't mind the drive so that we can eat here.   I love Indian food, and this place does not disappoint!   It is so good to have a fast-food type of restaurant with healthy, varied menu.  My only wish is that they had a drive through.  One day maybe...
