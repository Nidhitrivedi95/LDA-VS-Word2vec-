DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA This place had great atmosphere--a perfect gem in the wall. It's not a huge restaurant but that's what makes the service better. The staff was very hospitable and attentive. We met the manager Rick, who is the most sweetest, humble guy. It's great for groups of 5-8, but I went with a party of 16, which slowed the timing of the food. (Totally understandable--since they aren't use to such a large party). 

The food portions are family style, and are reasonably priced ($6-$18) We ordered their signature samosas (2 kinds: beef & veggie) that's served with 8 different kinds of dipping sauces (my favorite is the green cilantro one), the butter chicken (yummy creamy tomato curry), the lamb koran (coconut curry), chicken koran, garlic naan, sweet & spicy chicken, tandoori chicken (sooo good!), and a couple more curry dishes-- which I can't remember the name. Everything was really good, and this was my first time eating indian food. All the dishes were very flavorful. Also!! Try their mango ladee drink (it's a creamy yogurt smoothie) and also their signature rice pudding for dessert. Indian food is my new addiction, thanks to Samosa Factory :D~
