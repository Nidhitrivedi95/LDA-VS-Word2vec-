f6sfdqS4WAwaD9zzTADEuw Visited Drupatis as I have always wanted to compare their doubles to the ones I had in T&T as well as Island Mix in Vaughan.
The spotty service and look of disorganization had me worried but nonetheless I managed to order the doubles, boneless curry goat with a paratha roti on the side.
The food arrived quickly and was surprised to see the curry goat on a large flat plate rather than in a bowl. This dish became cool rather quickly!! Don't they realize this in the kitchen?!?
The goat itself was dry and I suspect that the boneless goat is reheated and then placed in the curry rather than allowing it to stew, big disappointment. The paratha was fine.
Onto the double. It was a good size and while I prefer my food spicy, I felt they should offer a hotter sauce! Come on you is trini so u mus have peppa sauce!!
Compared to Trinidad, the double needs some work. Compared to Island Mix, it's very similiar.
My recommendation, stick to the double and avoid everything else.
