zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ We ordered lunch from Indian Curry Bowl yesterday, and I can't say enough about how HORRIBLE it was.  Not just the food, but the entire experience.  The food was very overpriced.  For 2 entrees, 1 side, and 2 orders of Samosas, the total came to $72!!  I was shocked, and looked over the receipt.  They were charging me $10 for chutney??!?  I eat Indian food from many different establishments on a regular bases, and the chutney is ALWAYS complimentary.  It's like charging for ketchup.  

While I was waiting for my order, I was watching the elderly woman prepare the food using...... a microwave.  Really?  No burners or stoves going, just a couple of microwaves.  The food was not good at all.  The Samosas were soggy and undercooked, the Chicken Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer were runny and looked like they literally had been mixed with water.  

So basically, I paid over $70 for food that was microwaved (seriously, I'm still appalled by that one) and terrible.  Never again!!!!
