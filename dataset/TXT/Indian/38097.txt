ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw The food was great, however it is quite overpriced for what you're getting.  I ordered the Tandoori chicken for 12.95 - all if comes with is 4 small pieces of chicken, no rice or bread to go with.  I wouldn't order from here again, it'll cost a small fortune to feel satisfied.
