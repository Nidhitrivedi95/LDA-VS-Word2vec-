svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w I was in the area on a Tuesday night and needed somewhere to grab something quick to eat. Walked in about an hour before close but my food was served hot and quickly nonetheless. I would have liked a little more explanation for the menu items but next time I'll make sure to bring a friend who is a little more savvy when it comes to Indian cuisine. Something that I really liked about this place was their numerous vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. This place seems to do a lot of take out as well. I'll return if I'm in the area again for sure.
