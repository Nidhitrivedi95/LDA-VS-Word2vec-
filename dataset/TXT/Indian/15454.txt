CRgCV0KUx40uW_j_b0p-MQ Pretty good buffet. Not a heck of a lot of options though, but good nonetheless.  I like that they don't have naan in the buffet but bring it to your table fresh too.
I usually like the peas&cheese (forgot what it's called) and they had the cheese in a sauce (big chunks are good) and it may have been spinach with it but I'm not sure.
