0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I was heading over to Square Boy for a gyro but stumbled onto this Chinese Hakka restaurant on the south side of the Danforth.  Place is small, clean with friendly service. Extensive selection of Cantonese/Szechuan dishes and some Hakka scattered in the menu.  Ordered the crispy eggplant (#117A) which was crispy on the outside and still soft on the inside.  The gingery sweet sauce was not overly oily or saucy but could have been more Hakka spicy for me.  Very filling meal and will be back to try more of their Hakka style cuisine like the shrimp pakora but not sure about the other stuff.
