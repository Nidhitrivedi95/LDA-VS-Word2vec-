JkIeLz9_hjUa0sFnyPzCSg We went to Mayura with high expectations. I will admit, we went during the soft opening so still time for improvement, but our experience was not a good one. 

The restaurant is nice and the renovations are impressive. When we booked our reservation, the hostess failed to inform us that they did not yet have a liquor license. This is an easy fix moving forward and shouldn't be an issue as of next week. 

Appetizers were ok. Heavy focus on presentation but honestly, it wasn't anything special. The $29 prawn app and the $17 chicken tikka app tasted exactly the same... 

No servings were enough for more than 1 person. Although the waitress advised they were "shareable" they were not. 

The mains were extremely disappointing. We ordered 6 different mains. They came out after a 45 minute delay, and all at room temperature. This is inexcusable. 

Overall, the soft opening failed miserably. I hope they improve and do well but as of right now, I am unlikely to return.
