Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I went here with my husband tonight for the first time on the recommendation of a few friends. I was not disappointed. The waiter was friendly and attentive, but not annoyingly so. I had the Chicken Korma and he had the Lamb Vindaloo, along with samosas and garlic Naan. The food was delicious and spiced just right. This place is definitely not fancy, but it doesn't need to be. Our bill for entrees and appetizers came  to less than $40, and the waiter sent me home with an extra container of rice for my leftovers.  I will come back here for sure.
