The lunch buffet offers around 12-14 main items, plus salads, condiments, and a small selection of desserts. Our server described the food as North Indian. Everything looked fresh and it tasted pretty good. I found the sauces had a little bit of sweetness in them. Sugar? The tandoori chicken was a little dry but okay. At $10.99, it's a great value!
