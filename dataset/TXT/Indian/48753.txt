TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA The service was very slow and of bad quality. The tables were pretty much empty when we get there and there were 3 front staff. We were told to wait 2 minutes for a table. Sat there for 10 minutes and had to get up to tell the staff that we were still waiting. If it hadn't be for using the groupon that we already paid for, we would have already left. When the server came to get us, he was using a very unprofessional gestures to lead us to the table. The food is ok but not worth the bad service and the wait for the table that was already available.
