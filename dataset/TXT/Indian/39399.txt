OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA Well, it used to be one of our favourites for weekdays lunch and it used to be packed during the lunch time. Their lunch deal used to be 5.99$ which was a decent price for the portion and quality that you could have there. 
However the last two times that we went there, they had increased the price and the quality of the food was really bad. I am a big fan of Chinese foods and usually order General Tao Chicken cause it is safe to order and no matter where you go, you expect to receive the same type of food and taste. But the last two times that I went there, they obviously had used soma trash cheap chicken meets to cook the Tao chicken, It was smelly and very greasy. I tried to eat it with hot sauce to not feel the smell and taste, but finally gave up and went to subway. I didn't go there anymore.... 
Sorry for their greed. Last time that I went there, it wasn't that busy anymore....
