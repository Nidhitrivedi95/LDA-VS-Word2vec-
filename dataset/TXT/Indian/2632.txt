02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Went there today, a Sunday, for the buffet lunch. WOW. Everything was great from beginning to end. The service was excellent, they offered us more chai and naan (which was great) and every dish on the buffet was good and fresh. The flavors were amazing! This cook knows how
to do it right! I've been eating Indian food in Az. for the past 25 years, and this one puts them all to shame now. One trip to a certain Indian place in a small strip mall in Tempe, and you won't ever go back there again. Scary.
