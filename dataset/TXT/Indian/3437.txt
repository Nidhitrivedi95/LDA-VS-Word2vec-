This Indian Restaurant is a little different. It doesn't have the aroma of an Indian Restaurant when you walk in. This restaurant is casual order at the counter service but for sure doesn't look like a hole in the wall kind of place as it looks modern with high end touches of beautiful wood, attractive fire feature and gleaming high end tiles. Food wise they offer more appetizers than I normally come across at Indian restaurants, Unique Indian Pizzas and Fabulous looking Layer Cakes and other baked items.

We started with Cut Michi (battered jalapeños) Nothing wrong with them as they were tasty. Mild like bell pepper but as you know jalapeños are inconsistent with heat. 

We shared the appetizer of Apollo Fish. The mild and meaty fish was marinated with exotic flavors and spiced up pretty nicely. Some pieces were cooked perfect and some with dry and chewy. Still not bad but ok.....

We shared the Vijayawada Biriyani. (combination of boneless chicken and boned leg and thigh with rice dish) All the chicken meat was tender but dryish. Flavors were much milder than from other Indian restaurants...  not a bad thing as some people prefer their food less seasoned. Sides of yogurt sauce and biryani gravy were less seasoned too. Dish was ok just not as tasty or served with as good chicken as I tried at other places. Portion was very VERY large. Maybe not enough meat for three people but was enough rice for three or four people.

The dessert I tried was something that shouldn't be missed. We shared the Butterscotch Layer Cake. It was layers of spongy cake with this delicious creamy Butterscotch Frosting. It was just right. Seemed light and wasn't too sweet!

The food I tried was ok and the cake was VERY GOOD in a comfortable casual restaurant with nice decor.
