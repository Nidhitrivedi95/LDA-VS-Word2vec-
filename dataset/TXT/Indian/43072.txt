RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Horrible Experience, both food and customer service sucked. We went there at 3:30 PM on Sunday. The waitress took our order (Masala Dosa, Manchurian with Gravy, Coffee and Mango Lassi). The lassi came on time because it is probably ready, coffee took 45 mins to come. When I asked the waitress about the food, she shouted out to the chef and he said, 'exactly 3 mins!'. Manchurian came 10 mins after that conversation and the big, dry and cold bowl of manchurian was placed on our table. We were hoping that dosa would be good. After another 15 mins, dosa came (it was 4:30 PM by then). The sambar was thick, cold and looked rather like a left over from the morning. There were no napkins and spoons on the table after asking for them twice. 

We were so frustrated with the service and the food, we decided to leave. We talked about this to another waitress who had just come and she coldly said, " sorry ma'm,  I just got here. I don't know what is wrong. Have a good night btw!"

The staff and food were horrible. No courtesy to even say sorry, and we traveled all the way from the Wst side because my mother wanted to have dosa. Well, not going there anymore even someone is treating me!
