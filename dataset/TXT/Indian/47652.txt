TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw With all the selections of themed places (yuk) I wanted tom find a nice mom and pop in a sea of coyote ulgies. This one looked good and I am very happy to report it lived up to it's recommendations. I had some nan bread and chicken curry and it was great. Seemed like a clean tidy place and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I will be back!
