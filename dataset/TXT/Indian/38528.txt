OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This was our first time at the restaurant,  at the recommendation of my husband's coworker. We enjoy Indian food, so decided to give it a try. Friendly staff member greated us with a smile at the door and all the staff afterwards were just as friendly, including our server Ed. He kindly offered suggestions on a range of menu items. When we described our tastes, he was able to recommend an appetizer that fit. He also checked back on us over time, but not so much as to be intrusive. We decided on the chicken basil bites appetizer...quite tender and flavorful. Main meal, had a taste for the Chicken Tikka Masala....tender, flavorful sauce..different from sauces we've had at other Indian restuarants...Naan was tender...a little too buttery for me, but still nice. My husband had Chicken Farcha...not what we expected as it appeared to be fried in a cornmeal base..he enjoyed it as well as the side sauce. The ambiance is nice with jazz lightly playing in the background, nice lighting, sheek, yet comfortable decor. Maybe get more comfy seats per my hubbie. It was nice for date night,  but we also saw families present. The flavors were a bit different from other India restaurants we've visited, so this was nice for us. We'll visit again to try more dishes, so 4 stars for now.
