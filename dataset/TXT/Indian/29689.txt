jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg I have many things to say about this place.  I'm not even going to mention the Groupon issue I had today. I'm not gonna.  

a) what kind of Indian restaurant charges for naan?  come on.
b) I 'thought' they were honoring my Groupon (WHICH I'm not going to mention) so I got an appetizer.  I ordered the Jewel Kebab.  The lamb was great actually; however the chicken came out on bones.  huh? I had a drumstick and a thigh. That's not a kebab. That is, well, chicken legs and thighs.  Weird 
c) So they bring out my entrée:  lamb curry.   About 4 pounds of rice and a huge tureen of curry, so I thought.  The curry was in a silver tureen/warming pot and I was thinking "Wow that's a lot of food".  No, it was a shallow pan and everything below it was the heating element.  While I don't need a week's worth of food for my entrée, I do have to say that there were maybe 4-5 chunks of lamb and the rest was the broth. So basically I had soup.  

They didn't honor my Groupon (which, again, I'm not even going to mention)  so my lunch came out to $23.  WAs the quality of my lunch worth $23?  No.  It was certainly edible and I did in fact eat it, but the weird kebabs and the lack of lamb in my entrée was in no way worth what I accidentally spent.

There are far better Indian places.
