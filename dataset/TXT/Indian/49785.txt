U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw We recently moved from the Bay Area and were so glad to find this Indian Café. The food is made fresh daily by Chef Maqsood and served professionally by Jobhan. The taste is fresh, flavorful and spiced to your request. The Rice bowl is a great deal and they have goat on the lunch and dinner menu. They have some of the best Samosa I've tasted. It's been a pleasure to find this gem of an Indian Café so close to our new residence. We eat there at least once a week. Keep up the good work and delicious meals guys!
