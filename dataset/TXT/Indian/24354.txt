GYmdm_Vy7sf9tji7WUcohg I went here with my family the other day. There were 6 of us. Service was rather slow and they didn't tell me that the food I ordered doesn't come with rice or naan. Most indian restaurants serve their food with one or the other, and if for some reason they don't then they at least tell you that that. Make sure you make a reservation if you want to go here this place can get full fast, not a lot of seating available and not good for large groups.

So please order rice or naan with your food order otherwise you'll have to wait another 5 mins while your food continues to get cold.

Flavour was lacking, I expect a lot of flavour when it comes to Indian food, because that is what indian food is about but this place was lacking in that department.

They had a lot of variety, lots of vegetarian and vegan options. The coconut tomato soup was great. Their biryani comes with this onion coleslaw that was very flavourful.

Parking is in the back and tricky to find and has limited spots.

I don't think that I am going to go here again.
