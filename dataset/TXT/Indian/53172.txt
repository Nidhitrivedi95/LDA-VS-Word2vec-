VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw It burns so good, I can't wait to return to Taj Mahal. 

As part of a large group attending the UYE here, I must say that Taj Mahal really blew me away. We were fortunate enough to be sitting with Ayesha and Aileen, both of whom knew what to order and how to order it sufficiently spicy. Our app was the samosa and channa chat (heat level 8). Initially, it seemed a bit too hot and we decided to order at a level 7 when we returned; however, I feel that 8 was just the right amount of spiciness to balance out the robust flavors. Next, we moved on to snacking of Aileen's keema naan, which was stuffed with minced lamb and was a good transition from the fires in our mouths. Our entree was the saffron seek kabab, served sizzling hot in an iron skillet and positively to live for. While pretty much everyone in attendance ordered their own entrees, we were able to sample a wide array of Indian delicacies. And, honestly, we tried so many wonderful dishes that I can't even begin to tell you what all I ate. But it was all excellent and delicious. 

We pretty much took over this restaurant. The service was excellent, given our large number and ordering at the same time. As our fragrant dishes came out in waves, it was clear the level of professionalism and perfection the staff applies. They even went above and beyond by providing complimentary desserts! I heard they were good (I don't eat sweets so I go on what I'm told about such matters). 

All things considered, Taj Mahal is a jewel of an establishment that is a pleasant drive from CenPho. The fact they have a good number of lamb dishes only adds to the allure of this restaurant. 

Thumbs way up, Taj Mahal! I cannot wait to return for some terrific Indian cuisine.
