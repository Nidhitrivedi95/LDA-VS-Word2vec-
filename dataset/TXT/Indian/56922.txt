xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I was so excited to eat here after reading everyone's reviews. However the food and service were very disappointing . The fry bread was cold and greasy and there was hardly anything inside. The green chile might have been good had there been enough there to actually taste.  we asked for extra hot sauce (you get a little 1 oz cup with your taco but that's not enough) and the gal at the counter told us she was too busy, yet when my friend needed a box for leftovers she just yelled over her shoulder for someone to give us a box. Why couldn't she do that when we needed more hot sauce? Would NEVER eat here again even if the food was better. Their treatment of us told us they dont need our business.  If you are not from around here and have never eaten fried bread dough with mexican fixings on it, you might enjoy it!
