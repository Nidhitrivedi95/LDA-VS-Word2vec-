ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ My best friend and I went there before she left for India. The food here was perfect! We went to another place a few days later and it definitely didn't compare to here. I liked that the atmosphere was calm and it felt quite like home to me. 

First we had the idli with some sambar and coconut and onion chutneys, then we each had a masala dosa with the same sambar and chuteys, and we finished with some cardamon kulfi. 

We ate everything so quickly that we forgot to take a picture, but we did get a picture of the kulfi. It was so good.
