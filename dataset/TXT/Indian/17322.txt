DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ I have eaten at Sangam two times. The first time I ordered takeout and the order was delicious and correct. Craving Indian and food & being in the Cornelius area, I decided to try the place again. I'm glad I did because I came during the lunch buffet. I normally don't do buffets but made an exception when I saw there were many vegetarian items. In addition to the rice & naan, there were six other hot vegetarian dishes to choose from. Plus there were also many vegetarian items on the chilled side of the bar, including raw veggies, oranges, & a garbanzo beam salad to name a few. The food was absolutely delicious! It was so good that I am still craving it. The cost was reasonable too--$8.95 for adults and $5.00 for kids. I think I've found my favorite local Indian restaurant!
