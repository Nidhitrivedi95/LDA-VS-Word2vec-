7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Currently, in terms of Indian food in the Cleveland area, my go-to place is Indian Garden in Lakewood or Trader Joes, to be honest. Both of these places, as one knows if they love Indian food, are good but not incredible. 

Tandul is my new favorite place to be. I heard of them through the Tremont House Tour and Taste of Tremont and decided to pay them a visit the other day. Absolutely amazing. From the start of a meal with a mango lassi and their complimentary papadum (thin crips made with seasoned dough). They were just the right amount of spicy and sweet, especially with the two sauces. 

For an entrée, I had two very typical dishes that are my favorite: chicken tikka marsala and a form of palak paneer (they didn't have this exact dish, but something very similar to it). Both were amazing. Perfectly balances spices, moderate portions, and steaming soft basmati rice. The naan was rich and fluffy, complimenting the spices very well. 

I have been back here three or four times and am completely hooked. The chicken is my favorite dish in Tremont. It fits in perfectly with the trendy, dinner-oriented neighborhood and provides a lot to our city we all love. 

Three words to describe this:
