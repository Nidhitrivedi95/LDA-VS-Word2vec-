Would definitely recommend their "Weekend" Lunch Buffet.
Nice Ambiance. Dinner (A La Catre) orders takes forever to reach your table. 

Details :
Visited this place may times for both Lunch Buffets and for Dinner (Year 2013).
The Weekend Lunch Buffets are the best (worth the money). The highlight of the Buffet is the Deserts(Sweets) Menu. They have a huge variety of Sweets.
They also have Mango Lassi for buffets. The other items are similar to other Indian Buffets around the city.

Been to dinner a few times, and every time they took more than 40 minutes to prepare the order. The take out order took 50 minutes. :-/
The taste was good. Some of the dishes I tried are Lamb curry, Butter Chicken with Garlic Naan.

The Ambiance is good (intimate), not much of noise (except when there are kids).
