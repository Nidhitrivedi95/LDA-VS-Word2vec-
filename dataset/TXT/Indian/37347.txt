o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg I have come in here multiple times, and each time the food surpasses the expectations.
Here are some of the highlights:

Lunch Buffet: this is the best buffet in the Ballantyne area. The last much hours are pretty busy, so I would suggest coming in a bit early. There plenty options for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. Being a non vegetarian , i gorge on the tandoori drumsticks. Dessert is usually one item like Gulab Jamun or payasam.

Chili Chicken: The taste is again great. We orders the spiciest level. Which was great too. I would suggest going for medium. Check out the pic of the chilli chicken dish.

Chicken Biriyani: this is their flagship dish, and boy they know how to prepare Biriyani. The consistency of the rice is great and is not dry, which most of the restaurant miss out on.

Mutton Biriyani: The one time I had it, I ordered it to go. It was a bit on the dryer side. But I would give it to them for this one dish.

Did I mention their app!!!

You can order to go from their app. And it works;)..
You can order to go and when the order is ready, they call and notify to pick up.

All in all a great place to be...
