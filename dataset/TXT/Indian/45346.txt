S6pZkoM41a2GWbaxR5bYHw If you want to have real Indian food that is so full of incredible flavor and rich in spices  then this is your place. I was so impressed by how delicious the food tasted. I have been so used to being dissapointed when new places open up out here that I didn't expect to like this place. Hands down this restaurant by far is the best Indian food in the Lake Norman area!!!! This place blows the other Indian restaurants away. My husband and I love exotic food and are very picky when it comes to taste. Curry and Kabob House did it perfect. The atmosphere is so nice to eat at.. Smells incredible inside also!! I highly recommend this place if you desire really delicious Indian cuisine.
