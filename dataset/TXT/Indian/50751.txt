UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Worst butter chicken I've had in my life. After reading so many good reviews, I ordered take out to treat myself on a Friday night. Well it turns out that it one of the worst experiences I've ever had with ordering food. The butter chicken was alright. Not at all sweet and buttery as butter chicken is supposed to be. The butter bread was stale and to top it off, there was a worm crawling on it!!
Almost threw up at the sight of it. Cannot look at the rest of the food.
This was my first and definitely will be the last time ordering food from this place.
