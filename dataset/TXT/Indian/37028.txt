None of my Indian friend had visited this place was also a sign. Today I happen to be here and I ate the best Indian food in entire Phoenix. $10 "thali" is reasonably priced. Though limited selection, food was finger licking good. Food is made to order and you can request the spiciness of the food while ordering.

Service is a little slow but who would care for delay when you are eating at best Indian food in valley. May be they should tell patrons about expected time.

Last but not least, it is the first Indian restaurant I found which doesn't close after lunch time. A must visit for any Indian food lover.
