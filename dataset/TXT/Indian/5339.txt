2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw When I think about getting Samosas, Samosa King is pretty much the only shop that comes to mind.  There is always a line up but the line moves quick so I've never waited for more than 5-10 minutes.  Delicious and cheap at 5 vegetable samosas for $1.  They taste great even cold!  At Samosa King, they also have meat samosas as well as a variety of other food items and desserts.  That being said, when I am in the shop, I head straight for the samosas.
