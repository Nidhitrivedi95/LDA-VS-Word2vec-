CMkayuNDHPcd1dxO32kJyA This place is retarded!!!  Called on a thursday, confirmed that the price of the buffet today dinner is $8.99, Weekend is $10.99.  Headed out...

When we arrived, there was couple of dudes sitting at the bar and told us, they are closed today and is only open on Fri/Sat/Sun.  WTF....???

Sunday comes around, thought we'd give this place another try.  Headed out...  Arrived, the doors were locked and nobody was inside...WTF???
