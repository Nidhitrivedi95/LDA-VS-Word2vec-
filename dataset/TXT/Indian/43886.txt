RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w A neighbourhood staple, Lahore Tikka House is located on Gerrard East in the heart of little India. They do one thing and do it well: Halal Pakistani cuisine. The space is fairly plain, the decor is mostly barebones, and they've been 'under renovations' for the last few years. Despite that, this place seems to run seamlessly and churns some serious Indian food. Outdoors they have a large patio where the huge indoor space can spill over to in the warmer months once the restaurant gets busy, which it inevitably does. If the seating is full and there's a line at the door, no worries, this place has a great takeout service, which I usually get. Just call ahead, and it's usually piping hot and set for pickup in about 20 minutes.

Flaky with hint of spice and smokiness, Lahore's samosas are better than your average samosas on the Gerrard. But my usual order includes the Vegetable Biryani. It's a huge portion of perfectly cooked Basmati rice, tomaotes, peppers, cauliflower, chickpeas, potatoes, and a mild blend of tumeric, cumin, and chili powder. I also love their Paneer cheese. The squeaky Indian cheese is an unaged curd cheese that is denser than tofu, but seems to absorb flavours just the same.  Lahore serves their Paneer Tikka Masala, and in my opinion, it's the city's best. Lightly seared and tandoor, it's served in a smoky, slightly spicy sauce; it's made the way it should be. And of course, be sure to order a side of their naan bread. Not only is it lightly oiled, seasoned, and softly charred, but it's also perfect for making sure you soak up all of the sauce.

Next time you're looking for some Indian food, forget all those 'all you can eat' buffets and head to Lahore Tikka House on Gerrard East. It sets the bar pretty high for good Indian food in Toronto.
