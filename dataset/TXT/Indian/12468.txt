Service - 3 Though friendly its very very slow even though the place wasn't that busy. I get that they make everything fresh etc but like someone else said if you have "express" in your name, better get going. And Kathi roll is street style food - it shouldn't take 20 mins

Food - 3.5 - The rolls were delicious and packed with flavour, the chutney was very good. Mango lassi probably one of the best I had - not too sweet. Look forward to trying the street style lassi when available. But something kept telling me that the food could be a lot better; the parathas can be a bit less doughy and well cooked.

I'd go back, for take out that I pre-order.
