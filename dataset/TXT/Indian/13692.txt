bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A I've always had some difficulty finding good Indian food in the valley.  Cafe Krishna was a refreshing change from the sub-par establishments that I have become accustomed to.  The food was quite good and more than compensated for the slightly innocuous atmosphere.  The "combos" offer a lot of food at a very affordable price and may prove to be perfect for someone trying Indian faire for the first time.  Vegetarian, or not, I feel confident that you will enjoy Cafe Krishna.
