RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg This was our first time eating here.  The decor/ambience is so nice - I really loved it.  

We got the veggie platter for an app - it was all delicious, especially the samosas :)
We got a curry dish and chicken tikka misala with rice & naan.  Both entrees were fantastic!  The naan was fresh baked and it was perfect.  

We even got desser - we ordered the Indian ice cream and it was so unique and tasty.  I'm not sure what flavor it was, but it was really interesting and I would get it again!  

My only complaint was they didn't clear any of our plates from the table, so it was pretty cramped towards the end of our meal.  Other than that, this place was great!!
