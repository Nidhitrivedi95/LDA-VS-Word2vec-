OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Went for New Years dinner... Excellent food! My husband had the butter chicken and said it was the best he had had! The curries are bottomless.... So you can always keep getting more :) The mango lassi was great, we also ordered the Samosa Chat and the corn from the Bombay Bites menu. I normally am not a big corn fan - but this was to die for! As a vegetarian, I was super impressed by the food selection, gluten free items are also marked for convenience on the menu. Service was very good, particularly since they are still working out kinks. We will definitely be back - this is now our default Indian restaurant (particularly since we didn't have one after Samosa Factory that we liked)! Definitely check it out!!
