nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Love the concept of this place. The price is beyond reasonable for freshly made food, none the less for a restaurant mid downtown corridor. The staff were amazing, friendly and super knowledgeable about their food. You truly get the feel that they are dedicated to their mission and have a strong vision of what good food and service is. The menu items are easy to understand and straight-forward, the choices are all scrumptious. The portion is reasonable and presentation of the food on point. The restaurant looks simple and relaxed, yet the food is the selling point to impress patron. Come early or set a reservation as food portion run out fast. A local favourite in the area and busy during the lunch time rush. Their food, to our taste, was a bit heavy handed on the salt but was not any less appealing. The pasta was on point with flavor and texture. The chicken was nicely prepared though the pork chop was a bit rough for my taste. Overall, I loved the concept, the value and the restaurant. I am very eager to recommend it to friends as hasn't disappointed me yet. Will try coming back for their dinner set as well. I hope that they are here to stay as it their presence is very much welcomed.
