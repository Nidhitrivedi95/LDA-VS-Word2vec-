DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Mmmm! We checked out this place based on other reviews, and yup! Delicious! We started with flaky Samosas, then had Chicken Tikka Masala & Vegetable Korma. We got medium heat, not knowing quite what to expect, and it was slightly hotter than other mediums around town, but delightful! Service was great, & the restaurant is spotless & elegant.
