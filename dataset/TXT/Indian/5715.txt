3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ Our new favourite Indian eatery.  We were trolling along Bell Rd looking for somewhere to eat as one of our other haunts had shut down.   Dropped in to Haldi at 9:30pm on a Saturday night out of desperation due to the time.
The room was quiet and the staff pleasant.   The food arrived in good time and was delicious.  As good or better than any Indian food I've ever had.
I was amused at the amount of late night traffic that showed up even after us, with a high proportion of families.  The number of Indians present gives weight to the legitimacy of the food.
At 10pm the place was packed and a very cozy conversational buzz filled the air.
We've ordered take-out since, and it didn't disappoint.
We'll be back. Many times, I suspect.
