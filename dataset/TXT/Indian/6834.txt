4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw Sketchy place with Sketchy food and they over charge you for food so make sure you check your bills! ! When you order chicken make sure it's chicken because you'll find random bones in there and the owners don't own up to their actions. Instead of a sorry they bullshit and tell you it's chicken when it isn't and its bones from God knows what kind of meat.  I won't be coming here again and supporting these people who clearly don't know wtf customer service is and don't own up to their actions.
