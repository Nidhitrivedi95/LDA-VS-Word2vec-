Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I went here on a working lunch with some colleagues. We opted for the lunch buffet which had many great options. The price was good and the staff was on top of it. We will definitely come back. The only downside was it was a little loud with the music, but now we know to come and mingle instead of work! :)
