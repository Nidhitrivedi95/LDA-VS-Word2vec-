16-gsPZnaBJgFi9Le-i27w I'm not sure who would find this food on the "bland" side...maybe someone with a fire-breathing habit? Anyways, the food here is adequately spiced - which is to say it's pretty much perfect, but then again, I'm no expert in Vindaloo veracity. Came here with Lauren M. on Sunday and enjoyed a quiet dinner on their outdoor patio, which is colourful and unique (compared to the other Indian restos I've visited). 

It was evident throughout our visit that the staff were earnestly trying to please us. The manager gave us a complimentary app, and we were asked numerous times whether or not we were enjoying the food. Afterward the manager asked us to confirm that our visit had been a good one. This is always a great sign, but the bathrooms may have seen better days.

The quality of the food isn't lacking here, and you won't leave hungry (which seems to be the case with the more pricy restos), but the prices are a bit more steep than most other places serving these dishes.  I'd recommend this place for Indian food lovers willing to pay more on a date.
