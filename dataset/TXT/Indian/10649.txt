A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA If you like South Indian food, this is the place to go! Everything is vegetarian with the majority of the items vegan. Their old menus weren't that clear but judging from other people's pics online, their new menu has vegan items clearly marked.

We've been quite a number of times and tried:

- samosas
- appetizer combo
- masala dosa
- mysore masala dosa
- szechaun dosa
- spring dosa
- paper dosa
- vegetable uthappam
- onion uthappam
- South Indian thali (vegan version)
- aloo paratha
- bhel chaat
- panipoori chaat
- sev poori chaat
- idli chaat
- idli manchurian
- chana masala
- kadai bhindi

Whew. 

Everything has been delicious but uthappams apparently aren't really my thing though they are great here for people that like them. My favourites are the masala and szechaun dosas, the thali (which usually includes chana masala) and the chaats. The fusion idli manchurian was pretty good too.

Staff have always been friendly and service really quick. Have only eaten in but may try delivery soon.

Note: This restaurant is lower than street level so a small flight of stairs and not accessible, but handrails at stairs so suitable for people who can manage stairs with rails.
