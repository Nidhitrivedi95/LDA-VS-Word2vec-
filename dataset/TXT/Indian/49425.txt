Apparently there are some issues with cleanliness. I really do hope that these get resolved as the food was great for a buffet. The nann was excellent. I really like the lamb vindaloo as well. There were some interesting desserts that I don't know what they were but they were great! Chai tea comes with the buffet and that was a nice treat as well. There was a short wait for a table when we were there but when a table opened they got it turned over very fast and got us drinks right out and were very nice.
