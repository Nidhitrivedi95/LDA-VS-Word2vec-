ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Been to a lot of Indian restaurants and this one is by far the best in charlotte we've tasted! Catered to my meat eating husbands needs as well as myself who is vegetarian. The food is delicious and the waiter was extremely friendly and helpful, asking how spicy we liked our food. The manager/owner even came over to ask how we liked the food! The food is decently priced and the portions are filling! Will definitely be back soon...
