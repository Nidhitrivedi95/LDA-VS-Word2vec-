q80WmfxmifLBdB8_rPYu1w I've really learned to like this place over the last two months.  So much so, that I had this selfish inkling not to post a review of this place for fear that it will become super busy and increase it's price.  But alas, I can't do that as it won't be fair to those seeking good hakka chinese food for a good price and it is not fair to the establishment as well.  

Fook Hing is located in a nondesript plaza in Brampton.  I never thought that I would like the food here., I was so wrong!!

I've tried many things here including the chilli chicken lunch special, which is an amazingly huge portion.  The singapore noodle is also a very generous portion.   One of my favourite things about this place is that you can ask for the food to be extra spicy!!  The lunch special is probably the best deal as it includes one meat, rice, a pop or soup for $5.50.  The regular meat dishes are average sized.  One thing I don't particularly like is the fact that the rice is not included with the main meat dish.  I'm used to having a side cup of rice when ordering a main meat dish.

This place is good for take-out and can actually get very busy.  It's not best to dine in here as the cooks/servers take care of the take-outs first, even though you ordered first.  This is not cool, as the venue itself has nothing to boast about as it's not the most visually appealing places to eat at.  I would characterize this place as just a grab and go type of place.

Overall though, the food is above average and the lunch special is a great deal, so I'm a fan of this place, definitely!!
