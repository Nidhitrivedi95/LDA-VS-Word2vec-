7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA After a nice TSO symphony at Roy Thomson Hall, my friends and I accidentally stumbled upon this cozy, intimate place. I love indian food because they offer an array of vegetarian options. We ordered mostly vegetarian dishes ( obviously) including Tandoiri Machi which was delicious! The fish just melts in your mouth. We also ordered this dish called Saag with spinach puree and potatoes - it looks like baby poo lol but it was yummy! Not to mention their butter chicken! 

It was a wonderful way to end the night - they will definitely be seeing me again!
