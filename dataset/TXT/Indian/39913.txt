pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw BEST. INDIAN. FOOD. EVER.  I love their buffet because they have chicken tikka masala - my favorite next to vindaloo (which they don't have in buffet).  Oh, and I also go nuts over the naan and the mango yogurt they have (also in the buffet).  The buffet is only on certain days (I don't remember which days, so I would call and ask).  They recently had a renovation and it's really nice, with a bar.  So yes, they officially have a liquor license.  

I like how they serve the dishes (if you order from menu) with little tea candles under the serving plates to keep your meals warm.  They also have a very dedicated staff.  I have seen the same staff for over 10 years. 

The owner is very nice.  It's very customer oriented.  I used to go all the time (when I lived in Pittsburgh) and there are times where I would stop in to just get tandori roti to take home as a snack.  Th owner recognizes me and would just give the tandori roti gratis, saying it's just bread.  Not only did I just pay for the tandori roti as tip, I kept going back as a dine in patron because I absolutely am a fan of being recognized as a regular.  And the fact that he said 'it's just bread' tells me he doesn't see his patrons as dollar signs.   

Truly, I am not biased by this.  I have always been a Taj regular and every time I visit Pittsburgh, I make sure to make a trip there even if I have to go out of my way.  I have gone to many Indian places:  others in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, LA, NYC, Philadelphia... Taj Mahal still takes home the cake.  Hands down.
