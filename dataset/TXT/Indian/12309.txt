auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ It is a well decorated, charming Indian restaurant in the middle of a strip mall on Eastern. Parking can be a hassle on the weekends for dinner due to it being located next to overly popular and equally overrated BJs.

The service is always incredible. The servers are friendly, accommodating and extremely willing to make suggestions to get you out of the "chicken tikka masala" comfort zone. 

For dinner, boyfriend had Spicy Vindalo ($15) which is chicken cooked with potatoes, spices, and vindaloo sauce which is the red variety of sauce. It was not very spicy as I believe they modified it due to fear of us not being able to handle the heat. I love my food spicy. The dish was good, nevertheless.
I had the Spicy Haryali ($16) which was chicken cooked in spicy green sauce made with onion, spinach, mint, cilantro and green chili. Once again, it was very delicious but not spicy. 

We ordered side of gralic naan ($3.50) and it was very good.
Also, the server suggested we get Peas Pilau ($7) which was basmati rice seasoned with peas, nuts, and raisins. I didn't care for the raisins and probably would opt for just regular basmati rice next time. 

We also shared an Indian variety of beer based on the server's suggestion. It was good and quite large. ($8)

All in all, the food was good and the portions generous...but, the total did leave a bit of a sticker shock. I think I'd opt for the lunch buffet and try to sample more of their dishes.  The service, as I mentioned before, was superb.  I would recommend this place if you are in the area and craving quality Indian food and great service.
