flEnFkUtW5YVowWbenXsSg Talk about hole in the wall! I had gone past this place many times, thinking, "I want to try that place," but I never went in, mostly because the atmosphere with its stark fluorescent lighting and basic tables never really called to me. The other day, I finally tried it. Went with a friend at 1 in the morning after work. 
Ordering here is a bit strange because it looks like a fast food place but there's no menu up on the wall. The man handed us a printed menu and explained the options. Everything looked delicious so we decided to try many things. They brought all the food to our table as well as a pitcher of water and delicious hot sauce. The service was amazing, and the food... wow! It was damn good! Certainly better than I expected from a place that looks very "walk in, walk out." This is high-quality stuff for fast food. If the decor here was a bit better, I think more people would try it out and then the word would spread... Seriously this place is delicious. Definitely try the chick peans (channa). That was the winning dish, although everything had a lot of flavour. 
I love Chinese food, but Sizzler Kabab is a nice little break in the sea of East Asian restaurants on Spadina.
