5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA The food is absolutely delicious and fresh. Everything is made to order and reasonably priced...I would say under-priced. The owners are super friendly and the customer service is excellent! The naans and kabobs are made in the restaurant in the tandoor oven. It's hard to find a place like this. Tastes just like mom's cooking!! And the brunch is amazing!! I highly recommend this restaurant. Great atmosphere and good food at a great price...what more could you ask for?
