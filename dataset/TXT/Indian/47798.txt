TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I definitely recommend this place! 

Our server, Manny, was extremely attentive and kind. 

For dinner, I had the lamb tikka masala which I will definitely be craving from now on!! The peas pulao were also delicious, and I think the naan was the best I've ever had. My friends' said they really enjoyed their dishes too. For dessert, we got the Gulab Jamun, and my friend said it was just liker her mother makes it, which is hard to find. I had never had it before, but I enjoye it -- kind of like a light doughnut hole floating in a honey sauce that wasn't overly sweet. I am a big fan of India Palace and will definitely be back.
