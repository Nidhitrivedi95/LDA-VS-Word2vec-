z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA I love Indian food, and this place used to be my favorite.  But starting 2-3 years ago the food went downhill. We tried it again recently and sadly I won't try again for quite a while. The pakoras lacked flavor, like something microwaved. The entrees were very disappointing -- Chicken Palak was the worst I've had anywhere. Bummer to need to post a negative review of a previous favorite. Hopefully the food returns to its prior quality someday soon.
