This place has many gluten-free options, including various salads, plain rice, biriyani, butter chicken, goat curry, fish curry, chenna masala, and others. While the dishes are labelled with the names of the dishes, they aren't labelled with which ones are gluten-free. Fortunately, there was always wait staff around to ask about it. 

The foot itself was pretty good. The goat curry was really good but the butter chicken was just ok. the salads were fresh and the rice wasn't over or undercooked. Overall, good experience with friendly staff. 

TL;DR lots of options but you have to ask which are gluten-free
