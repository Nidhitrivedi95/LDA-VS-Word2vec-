tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA First time here and we love it. The greeters were super kind to my wife and I and our kids. The buffet is worth the 11.95. They put fresh naan bread on the table. The food was outstanding, the service was great and the experience even with a toddler running around was great. We'll be back.
