Dinner here tonight was Amazing! The owner (Gil) made the evening Fabulous and SO entertaining...The place is a little get away that has Awesome Indian food in Old Town Scottsdale! I had the Pakora Masala which was great and the Garlic Naan was delicious...If you haven't tried Indian food or want a new place to dine this is it!
