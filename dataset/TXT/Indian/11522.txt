ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ The best South Indian food you can find in Downtown! I came here with my sister and her fiancé and had an amazing dinner! 

We ordered the Pani Puri, Calamari Pakora, Mutton Dosa, Chicken Dosa, Madras Marsala Lamb Curry. The portions are very generous. You could order two entrees to be shared with three people. 

The Pani Puri is a street food. There is a lot of textures and flavours that just sing in your mouth. The Calamari pakora is battered with chickpea flour. Its thicker but adds such nice flavour.

The Dosa is the reason what we came for! It is like a thin crepe served with your choice curry, tomato jam and coconut sauce. All the flavours combined makes a wonderful umami of flavours. 

Edit: I came again a second time with my husband. He is a professional chef and he was also really impressed with this restaurant and he is so hard to please! So you must try it.
