PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw I really love Indian food, and there's nothing like that feeling of culinary satisfaction when you're presented with an awesomely tasty meal, with the perfect mixture of flavours and spice levels you require for your fusspot palate. Namaste offers up all of these delightful factors for your consumption, plus the food looks great when it's presented, with the traditional brass looking bowls and serving spoons. This is well above average Indian cuisine, and really reasonably priced considering that fact. I love the Karahi dishes, and the classic Rogan Josh, but there are a range of both Indian and Nepalese dishes to select from.

The staff at Namaste are super friendly and accomodating, and there's a fair amount of seating room, although you might have to book ahead at weekends. The interior, although nothing super fashionable or over the top, is comfortable and feels welcoming. You're also minimal steps away from various Grassmarket drinking joints if you fancy imbibing a few after dinner.
