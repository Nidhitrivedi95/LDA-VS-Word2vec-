BQkfjQlvnaqHKSZuBAQflQ Popped in for a late lunch and thought it was empty because they were about to start a dinner service. Turned out it was a sign. No one wanted to be there. The chicken my boyfriend ate was reheated and covered in sauce. Being that we were the only customers it should have been freshly made, but we realized why when the £69 bill came with service charge and overpriced drinks, when no water was offered and cans of soda were kept at the bar, not given to us at the table. I should have realized the way the waiter had spoken to an Indian female who came to inquire about making a group reservation, was indicative of how they treat customers. As we told  two couples looking in.. DONT BOTHER. Expensive, for crap food and crap service.
