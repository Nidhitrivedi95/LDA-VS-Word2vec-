FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA One of the worst customer service and quality of food I have ever seen.
Me and my friends went here for lunch. And one of my friend had already warned us that they keep saying they have run out of things. But I wanted to be more optimistic. 
The first thing the waiter did after we ordered food was that he said they had run out of one of the item. So we had to change that order (Still being optimistic). After that the food came in. That is when I realized that the ratio of the items and the chutneys required for those items were hilarious. It's as if they're trying to say - "You have to manage with this".
Oh by the way, one of the chutney (Tomato) and the sambar did not taste as expected, and I'm saying this in a bad way. The only good chutney got over pretty fast. And when asked for more cups, we got the same answer. That they had run out of it and had scraped the utensil and managed to get us 1 and a half ultra small cups. 
We also ordered the gobi manchurian which is supposed to be crispy, but what we got was wet, soggy gobi manchurian sautéed with some green onions in tomato sauce (literally ridiculous). And to top it off, the gobi was raw inside.
Finally we gave up and asked for the cheque, which we had remind them twice to get it. And then they had charged us for the juices that were supposed to be free as we had checked in. We had to remind them about that too.
Unfortunately, the experience was really bad with both the quality of food and the service. If you're running out of items, you either prepare more when it's getting over or you remove them out of the menu. Instead they feel good giving such kind of service to their customers.
