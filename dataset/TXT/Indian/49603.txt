tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I had the lunch buffet today for the first time, although I've had the dinner buffet 3-4 times.  Every time I come here the food is amazing and there is a really good selection and variety of both meat and vegetarian options.  The free mango lassi is also a bonus.  The naan is always really good as well.  The service is always great.  I've been to many Indian restaurants and this is one of my favorites.
