9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw My hubby is in love with this place. He'd eat it twice daily if he could justify it to himself. 

I, on the other hand, found the Butter Chicken Roti (their namesake dish) to be the epitome of "Alright." I'm still carrying a torch for Banjara's butter chicken and have yet to find anything that comes close to its deliciousness. But it's decent!

There are two guys who seem to always be working there when we go (one Indian, one Caucasian), and the Caucasian one is now well-known in our household for sighing heavily when you place an order, and muttering "For fuck's sake..." under his breath when people in front of us place large orders. So I'd say customer service could do with a bit of a touch-up, but at the end of the day... long as we get our eats. ;)
