XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Ever since I had a roti here, no other roti has topped it. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on where you live, I don't happen to be in PArkdale very often, so I haven't had one in a while, but I still think about it. Seriously, it's that good.

As I said, I am not a regular, so I was the fool who sat and waited for 20 minutes while smarter people than I came in for the orders they'd called in earlier. Either way, it is super delicious, and worth the wait. Affordable too! I was shocked at how big the roti was! I had half and saved the rest for later - it was still good reheated.

I had the chicken roti, but I do want to try them all. I'll call ahead next time and just randomly order something. Based on the other ratings, it sounds like they're all good!
