VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw It's with a heavy heart that I say good-bye to Taj Mahal. We found them with an entertainment coupon and we fell instantly, head-over-heels in love. We even had a great UYE there. We ate there many times. The food was fantastic, the owners were so sweet. And they made this amazing cauliflower...

But those days are gone. Taj Mahal has new owners now. Prices have gone up, flavor has gone down. And they've done away with that amazing cauliflower.

This is not the restaurant it was and, sadly, I must now find myself a new "go-to" Indian restaurant. Farewell, Taj Mahal.
