9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g This is a fine dining Indian Style restaurant. Run by a top chef, everything is as you would expect from a fine dining experience, but a bit pricy.We were a bit intimidated by the menu, but our waiter Pritpal was fevers patient with us. We ordered some lamb appetizer and butter chicken, mixed vegetarian plate, and rice. I must say I enjoy everything. The spices, the taste, and the presentation was wonderful. Compliments to Chef Sanjeev Kapoor and his crew! We will be back!
