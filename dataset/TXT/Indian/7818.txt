6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w I had dinner here with some friends.
The appetizer was chicken samosas served with two mysterious sauces. Now don't be put off by the word "mysterious". They were very new flavours to me that I ended up really appreciating. Also, everyone was served mango smoothie shots to start, which were nice and creamy.

For the main I had the lamb vindaloo with basmati rice. I came to Ambiyan looking for bold flavour and in your face seasoning, and that's what I got! Beware though; the spiciness of this dish will creep up on you. Not unbearable at all, but not a "comfortable" meal.

Everyone else at the table really enjoyed their meals as well. 
For Indian food, I'd definitely go back and suggest it to others.
