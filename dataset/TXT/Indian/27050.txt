iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Amazing service and food! The manager is always really friendly, the servers are nice, and this place has great Indian food (coming from someone who was raised on Indian cooking) I highly suggest this place to anyone looking for a great Indian, dining experience. The place is a bit small but they're expanding very soon!
