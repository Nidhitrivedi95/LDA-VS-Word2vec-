F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w I came here for dinner with my boyfriend last weekend before going to the Warhol for a concert. It was pretty empty for dinnertime--only one other party was seated.

Service was a little slow; after we asked for a couple more minutes with the menu, we were left waiting for a while before the waiter returned to take our order. He was just sitting behind the counter on his phone. After our food was brought to us, he told us to "just ask" if we wanted more rice, but he was behind the counter until he came to refill our water as we were finishing up the meal. The food was good but not really outstanding. It was less expensive than some places in Oakland, but the portions were smaller as well (though more manageable).
