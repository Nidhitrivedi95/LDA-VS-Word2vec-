LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Very good find in Scottsdale! Went in for the lunch buffet which was a great deal at ~$10. Got some tikka masala, chicken curry and tandori chicken. They bring unlimited garlic naan bread to the table nonstop. The mango pudding was also a perfect finisher for the filling meal. Definitely going to come back again.
