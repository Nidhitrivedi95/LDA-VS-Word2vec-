DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Love this place!  Everything I've ever ordered has been amazing!  Really like the fact that there are so many great vegan options.  Most of the menu is actually vegan.  You can't go wrong with the Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower with a as lightly spicy sauce).  The pacoras and samosas are definitely my favorite.  What can I say, I love fried goodness!
