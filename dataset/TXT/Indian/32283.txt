lGNw9h6npTYgEYPK2U58Ww Found this gem and we loved it so much we went back a second time while on vacation. 

We tried the butter chicken poutine at the suggestion of the staff and it was delicious ! We additionally ordered the Chole masala with naan 

Our second visit we tried the amantra chaat and the chicken masala quesadilla. Both were fantastic.

TIP: Go in a group and plan to eat family style so you can try more items on the menu. There were many items I wanted to try, and only so many things we could eat in the two times we visited.
