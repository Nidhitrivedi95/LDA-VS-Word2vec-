tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I normally don't write reviews but this restaurant deserved my time. I highly recommend NOT to go to this restaurant to anyone!
Where do I start? From the sub-standard food to the unacceptable behavior of the people, this place was an utter disappointment! The restaurant hours for dinner are 5 PM-10PM. But nowhere in their website does it say that buffet closes at 9:30...
On a Friday night we got off work really late and so along with my 4 friends we arrived in the restaurant around 9:30... they said they would close the buffet in 10 mins or so but would hold on for us a little more... we were like ok so we sat for the dinner...most of the dishes were there except some starter pakodas and the biriyani was almost out... we started to eat but they kept on rushing us... and at 9:40 they took all the food from the buffet without even informing us! When we asked about dessert, they asked which one we wanted! And when we said we would like try all of the buffet options they started arguing with us... they lied through their teeth  about not rushing us and about saying that they would hold on for us... they said something about the kitchen boys leaving at 9:30 (then why does it say that they close at 10?)
This is unacceptable! We know we were late... They could have easily told us that the buffet is closed and we would have respected that because we were late. But once you have accepted your customers... you should not be behaving in such a manner. We did not ask to refill a dish that was out... we simply asked for dishes that were still present in good quantities! one of the waiters got so angry that he was banging the plates against each other as he took them from our table!
I have been to buffets that were nearing their closing hours but never have I experienced such behavior and utter disregard from the service providers...
I would give negative stars but there is no option for that!
