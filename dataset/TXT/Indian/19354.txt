F9_g9plM0EUc_pi_zs_MCg Excellent service!!! Staff very attentive and professional! A great example of how great customer service should be done! 

The food was fresh, well presented and very tasty. It was quite busy, so consider booking ahead. 

The restaurant was clean and comfortable. They have it decorated in a Rennie Macintosh design that is spot on. 

It is no wonder it ranks so high on Trip Advisor for all Indian and also all restaurants in Edinburgh!!

Will be back again!
