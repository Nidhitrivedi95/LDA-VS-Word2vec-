uWhBa1bH7hN1ZCNdxTa5mw It was a really great  experience for Home made Gujarati food  during stay at Las Vegas with family. I strongly recommend to order simple & tasty  food if you travel with parents. First day  I ordered it for my parents but after tasting  food I order thali for myself too. It was perfect dish with Thin Chapati (Roti) , Two Sabji, Dal, Rice, Side dish, Buttermilk , Salad & Sweet......!!!! You can't expect better than this in USA ...........Must try .
