YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA We had intentions of eating at Siddhartha's but when we drove by, the restaurant was dark with a sign saying it was closed for renovations and to go to Gautama instead.

Arriving around 7-ish on a Friday night, Gautama was pretty full.  We were able to snag the last table for 5 right in the window.  

Famished from a long work day, we hit up the buffet ($13.99) and loaded up.  While I was spooning food onto my plate, I noticed that the different curries were quite runny and thin, including the butter chicken and daal.  

The mattar and saag paneers contained very little cubes of cheese.  Naan was available for a very short time in the buffet, and not delivered fresh to each table as we had experienced in the past at Siddhartha's. Once the naan was quickly snatched up, it took a while to replenish.  I was actually only able to get one quarter piece for my whole meal and was finished eating by the time new naan came out.

I found the buffet food to be lukewarm in temperature and totally agree with a previous reviewer that the butter chicken was very, very sweet tasting, and the watered down sauce wasn't appetizing.

Finished off our meal with a bit of fresh fruit, freezer burnt ice cream and decent Gulab Jamun.

Service was friendly and efficient for a busy place.

I've definitely had better buffet food in Little India before.  It was disappointing that the the food at Gautama was so watered down and sloppy.
