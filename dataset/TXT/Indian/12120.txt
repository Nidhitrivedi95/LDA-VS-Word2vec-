auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Excellent buffet - except at times it's hard to find the chicken in the butter chicken. Eaten lots of Indian food in Vancouver and Calgary - both with substantial Sikh and Hindu populations.  The nans (bread) is very fresh, and the Mango lassi (yogurt shakes) are excellent. Can't speak for dinner as I've never been here for dinner.
