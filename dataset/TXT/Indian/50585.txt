UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Just finished having dinner there and I have to say I was really impressed. I had the chicken tikka sizzler with a whole wheat roti bread and some Raita as well as a soup for my starter. The food had so much flavour it was not heavy on the stomach but filling at the same time !! Definitely will go back :)
