HVK_m2JUL24hV-w5q_d2Rg Actually a nice restaurant on the inside. Nice staff, though they are a bit absent-minded. A little bit pricy, especially for the Annex. Example - butter chicken is 12.50, but then the rice is 3.50. Or garlic naan bread is 3.49. I still recommend it if you are in the area and don't mind spending a bit on your meal!
