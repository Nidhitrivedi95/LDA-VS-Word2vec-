We ordered kadhai pakora, shahi paneer, aloo paratha, and vegetable samosas. I have eaten Indian food in hundreds of restaurants across the US and in other countries and this has to be THE best Northern Indian food I've had yet. 

Our food took about 40 minutes to prepare (we called our order in -- you should do the same). They cooked EVERYTHING from scratch. These were not reheated sauces they had lying around. You can taste the difference. The food was rich, flavorful, and perfect in every sense.

We sat down for a few minutes and the owner came over with some vegetable pakoras for us while were waiting and chatted with us. Extremely nice guy who clearly loves what he is doing -- and it shows in the flavor and quality of  the food. WE WILL BE BACK!
