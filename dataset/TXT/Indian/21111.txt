GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA After watching an episode on triple D, my friend and I decided to try this location. So glad we did because we weren't disappointed! The garlic naan was delicious and so were the fries!! We also got tandoori chicken and and lamb tika masala. We ate every drop of food! We will certainly be back!
