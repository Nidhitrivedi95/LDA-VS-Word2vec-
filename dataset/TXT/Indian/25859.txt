i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ Good food. All five of us had went for lunch and had different menu items . The food was very good . I wonder why the restaurant has few reviews . Come on yelper's !!!! The dosas very really good and vadas too. Try ordering the 70mm dosa, that's one of the biggest dosa, u ever see in your life. It's a vegetarian restaurant , but the non -vegetarians like it too .
