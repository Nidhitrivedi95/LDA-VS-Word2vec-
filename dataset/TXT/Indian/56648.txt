xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg Wow this was really good the buffet was amazing. I wish they had Somosa but that's ok. The waiter was very nice greeted me with a smile and was very on top of keeping my water filled. This place is 1.2 miles from my house and the buffet for lunch is only 13.99. I will for sure be back.
