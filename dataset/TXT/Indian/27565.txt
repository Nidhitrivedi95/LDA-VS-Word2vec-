I had been craving Indian food for a couple days. I work in Matthews, NC and wanted to find something close by and Tamarind was the first place to pop up on Yelp. The photos and reviews from other customers were enough to initially entice me, so my husband and I decided to try it out. I'm so thankful we did, because we were blown away with the clean and simple design, the INCREDIBLE, TASTY food, and the overall presentation and atmosphere. The hostess/waitress was very helpful and sweet. The owner/head chef (not sure if he was the head chef, but we think he was) even came and checked on us and let us know/apologized about the deliveries being taken through the front since they don't have a back loading area and the truck arrived earlier than normal. We weren't even upset, but he wanted to make sure we were okay with it - how considerate! We left wondering why in the world we hadn't gone sooner?!?! We are so excited about Tamarind and hope they never leaves Matthews/Charlotte...we will be frequenting for lunch and date nights very often!
