rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA This place has fantastic food by all means, one of my go to places to eat.  I normally get take out.  You may wonder why the great review, yet two stars.   

I decided to invite a few friends to eat at la Sani grill, being that it's one of my fav joints.  But the customer service is just awful.  One of the worst! Not the counter service but more so that they give you the most awkward feeling when They want to close up 45 mins before the posted time.   First, they cleared away plates that were still being used w/o asking.   I had one and a half naans left, with 2 pieces of lamb karahi left (only comes with like 5-6 pieces).  They decide to come by and throw my dirty napkins into my food, just because I decided to take a break from eating to chat.   Mind you, it's 945pm and they close at 1030.  Basically saying gtfo.   I was actually planning to take that bit of food home because the curry is awesome.  

Your employees represent you and your business.  Is that who you really are, as the owner? If so, I would boycott the place, even if the food is good.  You ain't the only spot in this great city.
