PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q I used to be a regular, would bring friends, clients, and out of town guests on an almost weekly basis. Over the last few months the service went from mediocre at best to outright terrible. They say they are open until 11pm but now no longer accept customers past 10pm. After the extremely poor and unprofessional service from my last visit I will be finding a new regular spot for Indian food - for which I am extremely disappointed as the food and atmosphere here are top notch, but because of the service I will never return.
