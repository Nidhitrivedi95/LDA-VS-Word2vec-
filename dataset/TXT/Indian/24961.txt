H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ we came here with a groupon since i had bad experience with some indian restaurants in the past, always spendet a lot of money and were not happy with it at all.
So i thought, since we love this kind of food so much...give it a shot.

The restaurant: might need a little fixture(shaky table) here and there, but all in all a friendly atmosphere. It had been nice if there had been somebody at the frontdesk to seat us, we got just noticed after i called one of the stuff from the back. 

I personaly had the feeling that our service had been a bit friendlier without the groupon. I compared this with the table aside of us. Small things like we didn't had any water while the same server filled the other one twice allready and i had to ask.. Dont get me wrong our server was still professional and friendly and made sure all of it was all right.but there was still something different.

The food. was the best i had it in a long time.  

I had a Masala Dosa.this was for us a new dish and we loved it! it was huge and big enought to share as an appetizer

I had the Malai Kofta! it looked so small in this little cup...but trust me dont get fooled by the looks...and  ohhhh was this good. i also loved the fact that he asked me how sharp i wanted it.

Hubby had the Lamb Biriyani and was pleased as usual! 

Iam happy we tried it,and we will be back.
