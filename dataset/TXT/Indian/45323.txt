s5gkuy9MQfYWzPjt1OWFDQ I haven't verified this yet but Pavitra may have gone out of business.  I just received a flyer to try out a new AYCE Japanese-Chinese-Thai restaurant at the same address.  Apparently the new restaurant is called OMI (647-748-4352).  If someone else gets a chance to check this out, be sure to let me know!
