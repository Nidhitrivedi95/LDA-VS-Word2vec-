CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA Greeted upon entering.  7 tables and 4 booths in this clean place.  Decor was simple.  No one here during dinner so we were rather hesitant.  We decided on Chicken Vindaloo, Chana Masala, and plain naan.  We were asked what spice level we wanted for the vindaloo.  We went for mild to medium.  In the meantime, several customers came to get their take out dishes.  All the dishes came quickly and together along with rice.  The vindaloo was perfect with just enough spice.  Any more spice would have been too much.  The Chicken was tender and the potatoes soaked the sauce.  The Chana masala was delicious.  The naan was plentiful and good for sopping up sauces.  A very enjoyable meal.  Plenty of parking in this mall.  Prices are equivalent to most Indian restaurants.
