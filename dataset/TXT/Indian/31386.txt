Ksk5cLav4OtbUtpRGp5b4g I was looking forward to trying this based on a friend's suggestion. I had eaten here years before and it was good. 

I ordered take out on a Sunday evening. The menu had a few different vegetarian options. I ordered the Mixed Vegetables Jalfrazi. My order was taken and presented in about 20 minutes. Not bad. 

The reason I give this place a two is because of the portion size, it was much smaller than most other Indian restaurants and the lack of vegetables in my mixed vegetables. I was expecting a variety of vegetables and it was mostly onions and carrots. The flavor was good but I left wanting more. Y'know that feeling, when you get your hopes up about a really good meal? I had that. Then I was let down.
