tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA $9.95 for the dinner buffet that includes tandoori chicken and perfect garlicky naan brought straight to your table.  I'm pretty sure I had about $7 in naan myself.  How can you beat that?  Well it takes more than price for me to be happy.  It takes good food, and India Oven has that as well.

I'm not usually a fan of buffets...food is often not so great and sometimes the choices are limited.  But in this case, neither of those applied.  I checked out the buffet before sitting down, and found quite a bit to choose from.  I tried most of the dishes.  In a few cases, I didn't even know what I was eating, but I knew I liked it!  I did find it a little odd that we walked in at opening, yet a few things were barely warm though.  Also, if you like things hot, you may want to order off the menu as the buffet is quite mild.  The sizzling tandoori chicken bumped this buffet up to 4 stars.

Definitely worth the drive, and I don't say that about many things.  I hate driving.
