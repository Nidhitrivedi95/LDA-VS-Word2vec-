gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A this was my first time trying Indian Cuisine.
The buffet was a nice selection of different things.  The food was very hot.  Nothing worse than luke warm food at a buffet.  The naan was amazing and there was an orange colored rice that was to die for.
I was not in love with any of the food but I am a very picky eater.  My 4 stars was because the people I went with enjoyed all of the food very much and all have had Indian food prior to visiting Mount Everest.  They said it was one of the best Indian restaurants in Las Vegas!
