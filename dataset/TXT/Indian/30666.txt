KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA Friendly staff and a very authentic Dosa are the memories we will take away from here. If you've never had a Dosa, think crepes on steroids filed with yummy Indian dishes such as butter chicken or paneer. Delicious! 
The restaurant is in a strip mall and hosts live cultural music on the weekends. The identity is still evolving as they experiment with "fusion" dishes such as butter chicken nachos built for the bar crowd, but for a relaxed and super yummy dinner, this place was great.
