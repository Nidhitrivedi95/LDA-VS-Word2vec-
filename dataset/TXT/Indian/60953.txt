zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I don't know why it is so difficult for some Indian restaurants in America to understand that when a customer asks to make a dish spicy, he/she wants to  have overall spice level high not just red chilly or black pepper in excess ! I ordered one spicy mutter paneer and restaurant added amount of red chilly powder that I usually consume in a year !

Pro:
Ambience is good, fast service, I guess they just need to work on their spice level.
