As weird as it may seem they had one of the excellent rasam ( A soup) i've ever tasted. Dinner was as well a buffet spread with neat array of items ranging from south indian to north indian. Surprisingly the sambhar,rasam,pakoras were mind blowing and mango lassi was nothing short of stupendous. Garlic naan was so soft and flavourful.

The front desk staff was very cheerful and attentive. The buffet price was pretty kind on the wallet too. I believe if you take some buffet food to-go its a couple of dollars cheaper, but i've no idea what you may be able to fit in a box in their wide selection of delicacies.
