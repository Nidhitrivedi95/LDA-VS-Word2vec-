afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w This place was recommended by a Sri Lankan friend of mine and I've been back several times since. They have a good variety of short eats. I highly recommend their mutton rolls. If you want to get a taste of this and that, try one of their lampries. Their hoppers are light and fluffy. Excellent value for money.
