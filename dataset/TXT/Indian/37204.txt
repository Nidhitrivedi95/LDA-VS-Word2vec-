o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ TLDR; Tasty, spicy food served quick. Interior is a little psychedelic.

I'm not a roti expert, but the roti was made fresh to order, the chicken was tender and the spices were tasty so we enjoyed it. Not much else to say about this place.

Interior is pretty funky (not in the best way). There are lots of colors, patterns, and textures happening in there.
