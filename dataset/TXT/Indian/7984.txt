72KojSHoxp8DissRtcXn-g Been here once several months ago for Sunday brunch. Not sure if they still serve brunch. 

Food: 
Chicken lollipops - delicious drumsticks, the green chutney dip cools the palette with the minty-yogurtyness but the chicken can be eaten without. 

Eggs Benedict with masala fries - every component was a dance of flavour in my mouth! The poached eggs sat on top of pakora patties and topped with a masala sauce. The masala fries were not spicy spicy but had enough kick to make it stand out. The dish left me feeling on the heavy side, just walk it off and you'll be fine. 

Service & atmosphere: The waiters were alright. The interior is updated and clean. 

Price: The feeling of a satiated stomach is worth it for the price.
