rwuMWGqt7L5l5lDsOYv1dw I love Indian food, and the idea of a fast-food style Indian restaurant on campus was really exciting - so one Saturday I decided to stop in for lunch and see how it was.

Overall, I was disappointed.  I got the combo, which was chicken tikka masala and beef rogan josh with rice.  As soon as I picked up the box I knew it was a let down - it wasn't weighty at all.  I opened it up to find a modest serving of rice with a downright minuscule serving of the two curries.  As for the quality, the chicken tikka masala was pretty good, and the beef rogan josh was just so-so.

At the end of the day, I'd rather spend a few more dollars to go over to Bombay Grill across the street.  They have much larger portion sizes, and it's much higher quality food.  I've given 3 stars instead of 2 only because I have yet to try some of the other menu items, like the Zyggy roll.  Maybe those are good, but I'm disappointed so far.
