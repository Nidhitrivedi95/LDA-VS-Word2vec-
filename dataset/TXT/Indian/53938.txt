VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ Although I've only ordered take out from here (several times), I recommend you check this place out if living in the east valley. Not only because the food is pretty good, but out of the limited options on this side of town, I think it's the best option we have.

Pros: The staff is awesome and always super friendly. Food is very tasty and authentic. Cost is reasonable.

Cons: Although the food is typically good, they are a big inconsistent with the flavor and heat. 

I hear their lunch buffet is pretty good, but have never had the chance to check it out. I say stop in and make your own opinion.
