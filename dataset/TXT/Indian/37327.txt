o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg My wife and I had a fantastic dinner here tonight. The food was great and the staff were very helpful and friendly. The waiters weren't outgoing and friendly at first - here in the south we're used to waiters and waitresses greeting us with a big "how y'all doin'!" - but after we engaged them they were very nice and offered several suggestions. We'll definitely be back!
