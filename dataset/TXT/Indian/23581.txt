gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I feel drunk after dinner not because of drinks but with all the great spices they have on the food. 

We had Chicken Tikka Masala and Prawn Vindulo with Garlic Naan. The flavors were all great especially the Masala. I think it's the best one I've ever tasted. The portion size was also just right compared to the other Indian restaurants I've been too. 

The only downside is the service that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. The servers were very nice but they were short handed. They need more people there. 

We will be back for sure!
