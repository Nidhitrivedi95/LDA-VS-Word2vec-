LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA this is 3rd trip to Toronto to enjoy some delicious Indian food. My stops on the food trip to Toronto :- Tim Horton,  Maroli, Tandoori flames, Lahore paan and kashmiri tea, King dumplins, guru laxmi.  I love the the wide spread of Indian and south Indian varieties on the menu. The dosa are fresh crispy and delicious. Like the fact that you can customize the spice level and oil for the dosa.  My favorite so.far has been pav bhaji dosa and spring dosa. Mini idly with rasam is delicious starter and love the puri korma dish. The rava masala dosa well-made and again delicious and crispy. Liked the onion utapam too. Ended with yummy yogurt kulfi and Madras coffee. Overall .. top place for South Indian dosas.they have double their floor space in.last 3 years but still you may have to.wait in line during peak times on weekdays too
