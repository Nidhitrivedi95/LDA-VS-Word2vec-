IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Tasty kabob is an authentic persian restaurant. It has a good vibe. I went there one night and we ordered Tasty kabob combo one. It had 3 different kabobs and we ordered half rice half salad. Rice and salad was plenty as it also had a pita bread. The kabobs were good. I have to try others and compare!! But I thought it was little expensive!!!
Later we ordered Bakhlava for dessert, however we were sad to see that the Bakhlava was taken out of refrigerator, so it was very bad. I have eaten many different Bakhlava in many states but it was the worst bacause it was hard and cold...:(
