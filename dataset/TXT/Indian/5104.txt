2WiuLnyR8UWXjYQKgKBjkg I decided to go to this place for lunch today. Called in and ordered their butter chicken with rice and salad special. The food was OK, nothing special but for my taste they had put too much of the butter chicken sauce on the rice, you could not even see the rice. The real disappointment was the size of the salad, it was 4 bites, no joke, the small container that it came in was less than half full.
Over all it was JUST OK, but I doubt that I'll be going back.
