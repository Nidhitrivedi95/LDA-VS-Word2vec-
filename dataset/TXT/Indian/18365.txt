eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw You are a vegetarian and a foodie ?
Or if you are a non vegetarian and love to try different vegetarian food..this place is a must to visit. 

They have got ample of options and I bet you would need quite a fe visit just to taste each of them. They food is very authentic and you would love everything here. I have been here with so many people and never heard anyone not liking it.
 As I am writing , I am craving for their food :)
