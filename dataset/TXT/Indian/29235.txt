JkIeLz9_hjUa0sFnyPzCSg Decent potential but definitely some kinks to work out (granted I went before the official opening)... Service was mediocre at best - our server was definitely not customer-focused. We ordered all dishes mild but 2 out of 5 came back very spicy and the restaurant did not offer to fix any of them (nor did they apologize). We ordered a second round of food (since we couldn't eat a lot of what we were served) including a second order of one of the dishes except it was completely different the second time around. Given the poor service, inconsistent food, and price/value ratio, I think there is room for improvement. That being said, you can tell they've invested in the interior decoration and they've done a great job!
