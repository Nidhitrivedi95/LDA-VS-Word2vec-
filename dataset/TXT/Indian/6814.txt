4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw Stay away from Tandoor Indian Grill if you can.  I am writing this after spending the whole night up sick to my stomach from the food I had yesterday.  It didn't go down well and it didn't sit well with me either.  I am a huge fan of Indian food and have tried a wide variety of restaurants all over the country and I have to say that this is one of the worst I've experienced.  The food is heavy with too much butter and the presentation shows no effort or care.  The one thing that was decent was the naan, but that was about it.
