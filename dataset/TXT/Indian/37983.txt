It's been a while since I've been here, can't wait to go back even though the service wasn't that great. Last time I was here, I believe we had:

Tandoori Black Tiger Shrimp - awesome though portion a bit too small for the price.
A Scallop Entree - not on the menu anymore, but really good.
Fresh garlic & corriander naan and roti (both freshly baked, really good)
Dessert - nothing. The wording on the menu needs a little work. It had descriptions like "steamed, spongy cottage cheese balls" that is not very American friendly.
