a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g I normally don't write reviews unless a place/product is really good or really bad.  I have to say that, the food at Motimahal is out of this world.  Especially if you are from Delhi or like Delhi-style food you will love this place.  We had their Paneer Tikka, and Cholle Bhature and both were great.  The "CHOLLE" were out of this world.  I live in the US and would consider making a trip to Toronto just for Motimahal's Cholle.
