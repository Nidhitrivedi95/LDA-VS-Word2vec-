aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ So I recently decided to give this place a second chance, since my first visit was a bad experience.

I thought that having had a few more weeks these guys would've really worked on their customer service & dealt with a few of their food kinks, but it wasn't so, unfortunately.

My smallest gripe was when I recently found out that the whole concept of the restaurant is just a copy of a similarly named one in New York (Kathi Roll Company). That was a bit of a turn off, since I enjoyed how these guys seemed to be something new & unique.

During my second visit here, I ordered a jumbo because I knew that the Mumbo I ordered before was definitely not enough. The chicken was very dry and all I could taste was the sauce ( I couldn't even taste the egg in my chicken tikka roll)..

Even though we were the only ones in the restaurant, these guys took their sweet time preparing one measly chicken roll..:(

All in all, I feel like I wasted my time and money. I don't know what all these 5 star reviews are on about, maybe they had better experiences than me, maybe they weren't honest, but, guys if you are reading this, PLEASE work on your portions, & hire more people! Please do these things to better your business, it will only better Yonge street. I will see you again once you work on these pleas from many of your customers.
