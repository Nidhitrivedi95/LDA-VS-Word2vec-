The Swad dinner menu has so many lovely dinner options, it can be difficult to narrow down. When deciding on my level of spiciness for my Lamb Vindaloo, I went for medium and it was pretty dang hot. I'm normally have a taste for medium+ levels, though if you have a tame palate I would play it safe here.

Overall, the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. I called ahead to inquire about a Friday night reservation which was not required for a party of less than 5. However, the staff I spoke with still took my name saying they were looking forward to seeing us. It was a little gesture, but it showed a warmness that isn't always found in short phone interactions with restaurants. Great job all around, Swad!
