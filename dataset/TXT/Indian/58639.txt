YmCN2ZdfCQ5InqT8KaA3lw Haq's is a good quality Indian takeaway on Leith Walk which offers great food and pretty fast delivery.  My flatmates and I ordered a curry from here last year and it arrived speedily and at a fairly reasonable price.  We had one their menus put under our door earlier in the year and decided to give them a shot when none of us could be bothered cooking or walking to get a takeaway.  My only complaint of Haq's is that the phone call to order the food was about as strenuous as walking to the nearest Indian probably would have been.  My mate had to repeat just about every detail twice and was literally screaming our address down the phone at the guy.  
After this, however, the food seemed to take no time to arrive and only cost about £8-9 each, including delivery.  I had the chicken Kathmandu which was delicious with good quality meat, but just about blew my head off it was so hot!  I would recommend Haq's for delivery, just practise your elocution prior to the phone call.
