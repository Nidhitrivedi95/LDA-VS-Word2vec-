SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Had a very small Buffet Item line, for lunch, but it was overall good, and very quiet inside. 
What I really Appreciated was the amount of Naan they supplied our table with, was pipping hot and very good! Since we were a bigger party, they made sure that their was enough Naan togo around and were not stingy about it. 
The Marasala was good, the Samosas were actually fresh and had just come out. It's hard to get fresh food at the buffet, but it was good that we came at time when the food must have just been out. 

over all yum stuff!
