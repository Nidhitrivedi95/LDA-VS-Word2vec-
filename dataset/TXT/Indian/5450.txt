33yClygMVQZb5y9WgOCHLA We were on the lookout for authentic Middle Eastern food, and not the mainstream familiar most people go for. Our friend was in town from the UAE and we wanted the real deal (We were actually looking for a Ramadan Iftar meal but I don't think anyone serves it in Phoenix). The first place we went was actually closing for Ramadan, but the owner recommended this place. So glad we found it! I wasn't sure at first - they didn't seem interested in helping us order (she answered the phone while we were ordering), they were out of hummus, etc. But eventually, we placed our order and grabbed some drinks from the fridge. I was about 20 minutes or so until we got our food, but from that moment on, I was completely taken into a magical land of glorious food. The authentic rice and goat, the Tandoori melted in your mouth - the cook even brought out one of her favorites at no charge - Beef Masala. The Garlic Naan was buttery, warm and delicious (and I swear she brought out WAY more than one order of Naan). This little hole in the wall is a must visit for authentic Pakistani/Indian food. Don't be intimidated - dive in and try it!
