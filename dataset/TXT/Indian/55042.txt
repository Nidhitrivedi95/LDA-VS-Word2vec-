Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw The food is great, however they say they offer 15% off asu students... We brought out IDs and the server replied that he had already applied the discount. I'm a math major and did all the math... No discount. 

We had: 
Vegetable fritters
Chicken korma
Chicken tikka masala
And 2 sides of rice
We were charged $33.60!! (I hope you read this management)

So, not only did we not get the discount, the waiter lied to our faces about getting it as well! Totally unacceptable. Will not be coming here ever again if he thinks all ASU students are this dumb.

We also just called in not five minutes after leaving to inform them of the miscalculation, and I was told "oh, sorry, you will get it next time!". Unbelievable.
