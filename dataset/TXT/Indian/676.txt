-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ Pakistani BBQ is probably this restaurant's specialty. We had Peshawari kababs, bihari Kabab, lamb Biryani and their chargha. Each of the items was truly delicious. We went early in the evening and there weren't too many tables with clients, so service was quite good, we've been there before at the usual desi dinner time, i.e. 9pm, we had to Wait for a table and the service was extremely slow.
So have an early dinner, get good service and enjoy delicious food at this restaurant.
