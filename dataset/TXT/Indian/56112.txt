Xl2zyEFXHSHS4Xpo6ja4BQ Well this restaurant saved our Christmas hunger becasue it was the only restaurant open on Christmas Day in Central Edinburgh. We have been roaming in North/South Bridge area, Dundas Street, Rose Street, part of Cowgate, part of the Royal Mile = everything was closed and deserted !!! (I thought it was the end of the world!)

When we found this Indian restaurant at about 5pm, we first ordered a coffee and deserts. For this I would give 2or3 points because they were so sweet as if eating a lump of sugar (and mostly based on icecream), though of course they were very good. The deserts were just under a fiver and found them expensive. I am used to pay 3Pounds. 

Optionless, we dined here at about 7:30pm too. We had a good service and the waiters were okay, though it's a bit true, they come with several suggestions to order this and that, though I think it was a good suggestion to order their 'bread' as you can use it to enjoy the sauce instead otherwise leaving it on the plate. We ordered a starter (mixed kebabs) and main course and the food was tasty and at the right proportions.  A small negative was the sparkling water - we wanted a big bottle and the waiter told us it comes in glasses as the sparkling water comes from a machine (a machine?)  Well, I assume they fill the glasses from a bottle so as you pay more. The glasses were pretty small and the drinks a bit expensive. They merit a 3 points in general, but giving 4 because they saved our Christmas Day. 

IF you happen to be a tourist in Christmas, make sure you go to Tesco on the 24th to buy food!  (even the hotel restaurant was closed!)
