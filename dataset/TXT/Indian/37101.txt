o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw First time visit but not our first time getting Indian. We had the butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Both had a significant portion of meat! The cardamom rice was great and the naan was also good. Overall the dinner was very good but not amazing. My main complaint was the fact that the kulfi we ordered was completely frozen and inedible. We pointed it out to the waitress but she just said that sometimes it is like that after it comes out of the freezer. So that really bothered me. I wouldn't have ordered it if it was going to be like a solid block of ice. Lol. Also the waitress messed up our payment which was slightly frustrating.  I would have given this place four stars if it wasn't for the issues with dessert and the check. We will likely be back because the food was really good and give it another chance.
