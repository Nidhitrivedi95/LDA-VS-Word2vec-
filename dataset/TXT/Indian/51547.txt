UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Been going to Mint Bistro for years! I love their lunch buffet. Its about $11.99 all you can eat and they serve you unlimited naan. The butter naan is my favorite! 
The price for the mango lassi was a bit expensive especially since the glasses were too small. I was trying to savor it but it was too good.
