f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg If you like Indian/Pakistani food, this place is a must try!
Delicious, authentic food and the Owner and Servers are very warm people. 
This is the only place I have ever reviewed and I felt if I didn't, I wouldn't be as nice as the people who served me that delish food today!
