h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA The food tastes great here, but I probably won't eat here again.  Why?  First of all, the food selection was comparatively small.  Most Indian buffets I've been to simply have more options.  Next, it's not the most flattering facility.  It seems a bit dingy.  Finally, they gouge you on the price.  $10 for a lunch buffet is just too much, considering you can go a mile down the road to Pasand for $2-$3 less.
