LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw Why, oh why, do all the local Indian places charge extra for rice? Seriously? I was pretty disappointed with this place, way over priced and really not as good as other Indian/Himalayan places I've been to. But, because it's the closest to my house, I'll make my own rice at home for $0.25, instead of paying $3 for each order, and get take-out from now on.
