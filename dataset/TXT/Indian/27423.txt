IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw We called ahead on a Sunday evening to book a table for 4.  By the time we got there, around 630pm, it was pretty empty, so that's good.

They have an a la carte menu or a buffet price.  We went with the buffet for $15 each.
The buffet table spans about 20 different dishes (different types of curry, rice, desserts, veggies, salad bar).

Butter chicken, goat mutton, and the tandoori chicken stood out for me, as I kept going back for more.

They will also serve fresh naan bread (regular & garlic) to go with your buffet.

Overall, it's a nice restaurant and for the price, it's definitely worth your money.
