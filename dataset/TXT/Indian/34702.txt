Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I ate here once for Valentine's Day dinner. The image I gleaned from their website made it appear to be all plush pillows, flickering candles, and meditating statuettes. 
The internet can be so deceiving. 
First of all, the chic dining area they prominently display on their website, which is (and I quote), "designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist Farhad Elahi" is their reserved banquet dining room, tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant. Regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space, complete with standard tables and chairs. I suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner, but it was V-Day and I wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit! Exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation. Being adventurous- not to mention gluttonous- we pretty much ordered one of everything. The mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water, while the other Pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat. The service sucked, especially considering it was V-Day. This place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley (Gandhi's and Gaylord's), in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine list somehow makes you less of a mediocre North Indian/Pakistani spot and more of a, and I quote, "hipster hangout." Next please.
