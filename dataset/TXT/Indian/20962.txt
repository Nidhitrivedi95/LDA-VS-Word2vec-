gb12fH_2NwRxfRI-dgHaOA Twice I have been in Edinburgh in the past 3 months and twice we have gone to Rivage only to find it closed with no sign as to why. I walked by the evening before and the place was busy. Their sign outside and brochure found at the hotel say they are open 7 days. At least they could put up some indication as to why they are closed.
