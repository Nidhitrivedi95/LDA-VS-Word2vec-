OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I came here in 2015 and it was way better than it is now.
Their food just looks like Indian food, but it isn't.
All the curries have too much water in them and tastes bland.

The positive thing was that the owner comped our food and he was nice. I would rate him 5/5 on taking the feedback positively.
