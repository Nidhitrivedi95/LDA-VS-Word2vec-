f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg WOW again!! I just believe that you can actually transport to Pakistan and India just by eating here. As I saviour the Goat curry, my eyes are closed and I am instantly surrounded by the flavors and smells of food as if I am actually in that country.  

How often can you go to a restaurant that the food is SO good, it literally brings you to the origin of the country?  I am not exaggerating when I say this  is a place that needs to be on your bucket list if you want to know that REAL Pakanstani and Indian food should taste and smell like.  For once, you don't have to go to Pakistan or India to experience the food as if you were already there. 

Everything here is on spot. I drive 2.5 hours one way just to eat here. IF ANTHONY BOURDAIN should ever come to NC, you must make a stop in here.
