uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA $5 ALL DAY lunches on weekdays; $6 on weekends and it is SO worth it. They jam pack the box with food! You get to pick one rice, one meat, and three veggies from a variety of options.

One of the servers told me that their mutton curry is the spiciest, so if you like spicy food, give that a try! I've been here several times and have never ran into any problems with the food or service. They always have a handful of staff on hand - both at the counter and at the cash.

Samosas are four for a dollar!!

P.S. This place is takeout only, so there is no seating.
