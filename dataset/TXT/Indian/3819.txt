0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Kohinoor is a wonderful indian food place with very reasonable prices!!! There are two options for ordering take out
1) buffet take out - they give you a to go container and allow you to fill it at their buffet, then they charge you by weight (5.99/lb) This is my favorite option since I like an array of dishes from them! 
2) Take out by menu, this is your usual take out, you look at the menu pick the dishes you want and order (even the menu items are well priced) - they make these items to order :)
my favorite dishes from kohinoor have been; Chicken tikka masala, onion bhaji, chicken makhni, palak paneer, and their eggplant bhartha. The chicken dishes are made with good quality chicken, unlike so many other indian food places in AZ. This definitely rivals some of my favorite indian restaurants in So Cal. A must try!!!!!!
