OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Just arrived from a 3 hour feast @ Urban Turban. We had a special coupon from Travel Zoo and ordered from Bites Side (chicken, lamb, seafood, vegetarian, garlic/cheese/butter naan. Had champagne, Moscato wine, Salam Bombay drinks and ended with rose ice cream. There were 4 of us and our friends were newbies to Indian food. Noticed many a couple of customers that looked like they came straight from the Airport(apparently could not wait to get here). Our friendly server JOSE guided our friend through the menu, patiently and explained the dishes not only to him, but to us as well. We sat, ate, drank and were not rushed. JOSE had other tables, but still made sure we enjoyed our dinner, We will be going back. Thank you JOSE.

Did not meet the owner, maybe next time.
