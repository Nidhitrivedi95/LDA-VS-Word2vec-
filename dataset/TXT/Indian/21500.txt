GdzCnx5OWURyklzTjaQIPw Unperturbed by its 'spicy' name, my mum and I stumbled upon this place on a day out and decided to take advantage of the pre-theatre menu for £9.95. And what a surprise. The staff were friendly and attentive (maybe a little too attentive). The food was beautiful. For starters, we got 2 poppadoms with spiced onions, chicken pakora and haggis pakora. The haggis pakora was very nice and different and the pakora came with two delicious sauces. The presentation was marvellous with streaks of sauce, grated vegetables and a sprig of mint. For our main courses, we had lamb korma, chicken tikka masala, pilau rice and a peshwari nan. The lamb korma was unbelievably good and the peshwari nan went very well with it. We couldn't fault this meal. We ate every crumb. Our bill altogether was close to £27 which was great considering we got poppadoms, nan bread, a drink and a coffee as extras. Good value for what was a gorgeous meal. Great ambience too. Wonderful decor and traditional Indian music. Very relaxing. We're definitely going to go back to this place. We may try out the lunch buffet on another one of our 'mother-daughter' days out. Super place. Sometimes it's tough to find a gem of a restaurant in Edinburgh and we were lucky to choose this one at random!
