qMw7mFHAjgG7qN82aXmeZg Absolutely awful place, I'd rather starve. My family and I were insulted by the terrible service. Do yourself a favour and please go across the street to Kwality or McD's instead. 

The restaurant was empty except for another table that got excellent service, while we starved. The idiot server was aloof and infuriatingly frustrating. We ordered tea + meals, and only got our tea after asking 3 times and waiting 40 mins. 

It appears this dump's main focus is take out, which we unfortunately found out the hard way. As we waited to pay for our tea, after giving up on our food, we saw the cooks behind the glass handling food without wearing gloves or hair nets. 

Not only is the service terrible, but it's unhygienic as well. I can't imagine the number of health codes it violates on a regular basis. 

Here's hoping this place gets shut down.
