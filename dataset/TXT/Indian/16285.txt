DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA My favorite place in all of Las Vegas! I only order 2 things, so it's hard to rate it all. The Veggie Korma and Spinach curry. I love them both! The garlic naan is covered in garlic and cilantro. It's delish too. My husband is not adventurous. He orders the chicken tikka every time. Getting him to even go in was a huge effort. Now, most days it's his idea to eat here. I also highly recommend iced chai tea!
