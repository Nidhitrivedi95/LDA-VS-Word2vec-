***SMELL IT BEFORE YOU EAT***

We came and ordered South Indian thali, they gave spoiled subjee and  has bad smell, it's clearly smell like it's gone, but the reply from them this recipe is like that.

Another family also ordered and they also suspected but the reply is the same 

They are not accepting their mistake and they are defending, this was the worst experience I had
This is not that old OM
