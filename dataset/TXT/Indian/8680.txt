7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA Came here for Valentine's Day and the place was quite busy. We were seated by the window tucked in the corner. The restaurant itself was nice looking but the table arrangements were a little strange. 

The service was awfully slow and not as friendly as I would prefer. It took over 2 hours for the appetizer and food to be delivered to our table. We were often ignored and were told the food would be right up, and then we waited and waited some more. 

we ordered:
Appetizer platter- Onion bhajia, Vegetable pakora, chicken pakora and a samosa. Nothing impressed me at all. The samosa was horrible and one of the worst ones i have ever tasted.

Tandoori chicken- this was nicely done, good taste and nice presentation
Butter chicken- I liked the sauce but the chicken tasted strange. The meat was tough
Garlic naan- very garlicy! still tasty though
Roti- nicely done, hot and fresh
Rice- well done


The owner came over and spoke with us as well for about 15 minutes. I must say i really enjoy when the owner makes his rounds and talks to the guests. He was a really nice guy and was open and honest about his restaurant. I really enjoyed speaking with him and thought his customer service skills were excellent. I wasn't sure if i would ever come back here again but after speaking with the owner I might give it one more chance.
