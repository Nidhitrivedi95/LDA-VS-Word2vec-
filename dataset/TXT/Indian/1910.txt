-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ I really enjoy good Indian food, ands at this place there is a nice selection. Every time I am in the area I eat here and I have never gotten the same thing. 

The food is very authentic and quite tasty. They have a nice variety from the different regions of India. The prices and curly is great, not overly spice just right for the Canadian palate. There is a nice variety of fruit drinks that I have come to enjoy. The one thing I always get time I am here is the garlic naan, which is so tasty! Everything seemed to be very reasonably priced so we can get several dishes to try and not break the bank. 

The staff are friendly and courteous as they take your order plus they are willing to translate and explain the menu. Our last server offered us some suggestions which turned out to be a great deal! 

The baked treats are my favourite I am determined to try them all! I have not yet but I will definitely be back.
