GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Kelly was awesome, great waiter, friendly and knowledgeable. Food was good but wasn't mind blowing, didn't take too long to be served. Chai tea... was ok. Samoas were pretty good. After Kelly left though our group didn't get taken care of by the relieving waiter... it wasn't even busy in there.
