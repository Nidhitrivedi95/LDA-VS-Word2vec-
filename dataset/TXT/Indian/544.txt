-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g Great tasting Indian food! My husband and I were here for dinner on a Friday. Plenty of parking space available outside, and the restaurant was not completely packed (so no waiting time). We ordered Papdi Chat, Medu Vada, Podi Dosa and Veg Hakka Noodles. Flavors were authentic, except the Indo-Chinese noodles tht were a tad bit over cooked. Special mention of the Sambar and chutneys served with the vada and Dosa ... total awesomeness!!! Service was great and the waiter came back to refill water more than once. Ambience was as expected of a good quality Indian restaurant with some nice music and TV to compliment the meal. A good experience! We will surely be going back!
