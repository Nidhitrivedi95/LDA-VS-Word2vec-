CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A In Madison for a couple of days (nice people around here by the way). Swung by Taj for lunch. Place was nearly empty but I was already here. Went with vegetable biryani.
The vegetables were way over cooked and included some not listed in the description while adding some for the heck of it. Definitely had the impression they just threw some leftovers together and fed it to the guy in the suit (me) figuring I wouldn't know the difference. To make up for the crappy vegetables, they over-seasoned the heck out of the poor dish. 

Disappointed.  Maybe they weren't expecting someone to order off the menu given they had a buffet.
