KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Three of us went for dinner this visit.

Tikka Masala, Korma, & Andhra Curry - all chicken.
Butter, Garlic, & Paneer Naan.
Chicken 65 appetizer.
Everything was served with white rice. 

The Naan was all very good. Soft with just a hint of toastiness, not too dry.

The Chicken 65 was unremarkable. Lightly spicy with lots of onion and cilantro.

The Chicken Korma was ordered extra mild for the non spice eater in the group and come out spot on. Very flavorful without any heat. The chicken itself was bonless, tender and absorbed the flavors well.

The Chicken Andhra Curry was ordered medium but came out a little over spicy and astringent. The aroma hinted of flavorful spices but was overwhelmed by the heat of the dish. Surprisingly the chicken was served bone-in! The chicken was swimming in sauce which made it not finger food and made enjoying it more of a task. 

The Chicken Tikka Masala was spot on for both flavor and spiciness. The let down was the chicken itself, dense cubes of chicken breast. The chicken was dry and absorbed none of the wonderful flavor in the sauce. 

Nothing was really bad, just not fantastic. Worth another visit.
Maybe for their lunch buffet, too.
