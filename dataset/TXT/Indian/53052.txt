V7vrXl_1-8dCwNXP7tua1Q India Paan is where I have been going to fufill all my paan needs.  Prior to walking into this place one fine day I didn't even know I had paan needs.  Apparently they specialize in "Maghai Calcutta & Banarasi Paan."  

So what does that mean to me?  Well, I like to get three things here:

1) Puri Paan - crispy little cups filled with delicious spicyness, chickpeas, red onions, and other stuff.  Make sure to order spicy water with it (which, by the way, is supposed to be poured into the little cups).

2) Sweet Paan - it's a bunch of sweet spices, seeds, rose petals, and other unfamiliar things wrapped up in a beetle leaf.  You just eat the whole thing.  Depends on who's making them - I've had them range from really tasty to just okay.  

3) Sugar Cane Juice - made fresh in front of your eyes - that alone will set you back about $6, but it's so yummy!

Now when you go in there you won't feel like a complete dope - definitely worth going in for a sample.  Mmmmmmm Paan.  They also make a mean spicy corn on the cob - made my mouth burn for HOURS.  Consider yourself warned.
