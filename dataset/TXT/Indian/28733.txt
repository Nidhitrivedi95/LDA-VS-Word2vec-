Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ Pretty standard Hakka Chinese fare here. Smaller portions here compared to the Brampton location on Steeles but nicer plating and presentation. Usually have the Chilli Chicken Gravy or Black Pepper Beef. Have also had the fried chicken wings which were nice, batter wasn't too heavy. The food is consistent and tasty if you are looking for Hakka and/or something nice and spicy.
