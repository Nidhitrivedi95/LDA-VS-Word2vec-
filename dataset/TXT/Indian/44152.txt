RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Best indian restaurant I've been to in the city.

Service has gotten much slower since the founding owner passed away and waitstaff were subsequently cut.

Still an excellent restaurant with great food. Spicy curries, delicious naan, and great kebabs.

I recommend the butter chicken, lamb kebab, and garlic naan.

All dishes are really, really heavy. Expect to leave feeling 5-10 pounds heavier.
