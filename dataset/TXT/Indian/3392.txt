This place is significantly overpriced for identical portions as compared to others in the area like Tandul in Tremont or Jaipur Junction in Hudson. Chicken tikka was 14.50 compared to 11 dollars elsewhere, but here's the kicker... this place does NOT include rice like all of the rest. You have to also purchase that separate! Total sham! 
Second, the food wasn't  great. The butter chicken was overly salty and tasted terrible, think tomato sauce loaded with mortons salt. The chicken tikka masala had peppers in it that overpowered the entire dish. Pass on this place and go somewhere else. We've had Indian food in several regions of the world and this is by far the worst
