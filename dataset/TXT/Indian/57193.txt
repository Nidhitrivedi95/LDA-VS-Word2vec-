XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw I always have to stop at Mother India when I'm driving through Toronto.

The food here is by far the best Indian food I've had anywhere. They specialize in rotis, and when they say roti, they mean whichever Indian dish you like, but inside a roti. Kind of like a wrap. I always get the mutter paneer roti, and my non-veg friends get the butter chicken roti, which is also amazing.

Be careful about the level of spiciness. If you normally ask for things spicy, I'd recommend going for medium-level here. They aren't kidding around at Mother India. I've gone with some Indian friends who asked for Indian-level spicy and their mouths got burnt off.

 I almost always get take out, but I've eaten in a few times too. It's definitely nothing fancy inside, but if you're coming for the decor, this isn't the place for you.
