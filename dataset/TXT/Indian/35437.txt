Mv6ripiINornDXI07VPaLA I keep hearing good reviews for this place, so I tried it again.  This time we had chili rellenos again and nachos.  The chilis were larger than last time we were there, so that was an improvement  The service was definitely better.  The nacho plate was large and looked nice, but tasted AWFUL.  The meat was very tough, it seemed overcooked or possibly reheated.  I did not feel well after.  I wanted to like this place, but I will not be going back.
