OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w Great service, good ambiance and good Indian food.

My friend and I ordered the dumpukht lamb and the chicken r-something (it was minced chicken + chicken gravy) 

I personally loved the chicken, but the lamb was a bit too sweet for my liking. 

For appetizers we ordered papri chaat but felt that something tasted off and had it returned. They were kind enough to not put it in our bill.

I've heard the dumpukht biryani is supposed to be good but I'm not sure I will travel to Markham from downtown to try it. I like my desi food to meet certain expectations and this, while it was a good experience, it was definitely anticlimatic
