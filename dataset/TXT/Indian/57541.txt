ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ The service was a bit slow even though it was Sunday night and there was hardly anyone there.  They forgot my drink.  My first drink took about 15 mins to appear.  The food was good though.  Naans were great.  So was my Lamb Vindaloo.  We had the spicy tandoori wings for appetizers.  And my golfing buddy had the Aloo Gobi which was great.  Irish the service were more prompt and I would give it four stars.
