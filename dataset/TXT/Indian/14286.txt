c_ZDTkfDlfzLm0a3osk1ow This past Friday evening, my girlfriend and I did this North/South Indian restaurant thanks to an ad from a mailing circular. We were excited to see they offered a dinner buffet, which is rare for non-Chinese restaurants.

What a disappointment! We arrived shortly after they opened, around 6:30 PM. Service -- as others have pointed out -- is excellent; no complaints. However, the buffet was mostly leftovers from the lunch buffet, and the quality, appearance, and taste all pointed towards that conclusion.

The one aloo dish (veggie jalfrazee, perhaps?) consisted of primarily potatoes and broccoli. The potatoes were underdone, yet the broccoli had been blitzkreiged to somewhere between "blackened" and "mush". Most other items were lukewarm, not hot -- another sign that items were lunch leftovers. And all of the food choices had an unpleasant sour component as well. Maybe that's due to tamarind, maybe not. I couldn't be certain because of the lack of overall freshness.

Best item we sampled? The tomato soup! The rasam soup was spicy-tasty as well but not quite as good. Plus, it should have been refreshed as the ladle was scrapping the bottom of the pot.

On the plus side, chai tea and mango lassi drinks are included in the dinner buffet price ($13.95) and service is exceptional. But the downside is an expensive meal for leftover poor quality food. The fact very few actual Indians came in while we were seated was yet another tip-off to the food quality.

We, too, are a "one time and done" couple for this location.
