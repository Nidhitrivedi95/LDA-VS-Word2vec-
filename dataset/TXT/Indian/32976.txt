llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg The good variety of food at this buffet is delicious! The curries are yummy especially with the fresh flat bread they serve.  The different hot sauces are also fairly spicy. I also love the vegtarian options as well.  The only suggestion I would make is to get a bigger venue.  It can seem a bit crouded even when its not a full house.
