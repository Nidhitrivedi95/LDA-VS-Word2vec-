iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Some of the best Indian food that I have had!  I hadn't been there prior to their remodel but now I can see why they needed to expand.   Their new bar and open front area are a great addition to their fantastic food.

I had lamb with butter sauce and it was likely the most tender, delicious lamb that I have had.  My girlfriend had chicken korma and it was equally delicious.  This was after we started with Sea Scallops which were huge and cooked to perfection.

Add to the amazing food, our very attentive waiter, Abe, and it was an unbelievable experience for our first time there.  Also, the main chef/owner came out to check on us and that was a very nice touch.   All of the help was very friendly and accommodating!   We will certainly be back many times!!!
