This option allowed us to taste an array of food that was amazing. We loved discovering unique items. We both loved the spices on the fish and many flavors in the chicken options. Vegetarian's would be pleased as well. The owner/ manager was so kind and encouraged us to try different items.  Go and be sure to leave room for the dosa's. Those and the breads made fresh are worth the journey. 
P.S. The place is spotless. The people ordering carry-outs kept coming in steadily. The most beautiful Indian families came strolling in to enjoy foods from their homeland. Always a good sign.
