fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Wanted to come here for a long time and I wasn't disappointed. Self serve dishes with decent selection. Several lamb choices if you like lamb. 12.99/14.99 ayce lunch/dinner. My favourite chicken curry was great, juicy and tender. The spices in the curry tasted great as well. Just not spicy as I assumed it would have been. The naans are served fresh to your table. Cool Bollywood being played on the TVs to set the mood.
I recommend!
