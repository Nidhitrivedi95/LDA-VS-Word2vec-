iX0XUpk34WqHfUuLjPhR9g 4.5 stars. I really like this place. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's a little light to be a *destination* bar. It's a fantastic little neighborhood bar, and I think it would be best for it to stay that way.

I keep coming back to this place, and even when there is a substantial period of time between visits, the owner/operator always remembers us, and treats us well. The butter chicken is great, and very inexpensive. For that matter, prices are very reasonable all around. And some of the best cocktails in the city. No joke. I have had Dark 'N Stormys all over North America and the Caribbean, and these guys get it right. My undergrad dorm was full of Bermies who would bring Goslings by the case back to school to show us how it was properly done, so I know of which I speak. And the "Whinging Pomegranate" is worth trying at least once; with double alcohol and substantial preparation, $10 is exceptionally reasonable.

The music selection is eclectic, and awesome, even when it's not to my taste. Every time I think the music sucks, it also makes me laugh, whatever it is. Some nights have DJs, and others are just prerecorded mixes. It's small, intimate, and comfortable. There is definitely a hipster vibe, but not so much so as to be pretentious. In fact, it's just the perfect place to hang out with friends and talk when there is no DJ, and a great place to party when there is; two thumbs up!!
