vzjmi_Cxom5b1OVQC3B6MA I have enjoyed Indian Spice Kitchen on several occasions. I can report that the owners have added labels to the food with general descriptions as well as indications of the level of spiciness. If you need further help anybody will be glad to assist.

An assortment of meat dishes (mostly chicken) has also been added to the menu, though it remains largely vegetarian. I am also quite pleased with their reasonable prices. Indian Spice Kitchen also features a nice salad bar and a small but scrumptious assortment of desserts. All is included in the price of the buffet, although they also feature a traditional sit-down style menu (available on their website). If you are in the mood to stay home they also deliver!

All the food has been quite delicious, and the freshly prepared naan is delivered to the table in a never ending flow. The staff is very friendly and prompt with serving their customers. Dishes are cleared from the table by the time you get back with a new plate from the buffet.

The atmosphere is very relaxed and enjoyable. The tables and chairs are sturdy and kept quite clean, including the spotless white linens. The washrooms are well maintained. I believe the dining area has separate overhead ventilation, so as not to inundate customers with smells from the kitchen/buffet area. I have never noticed any, apart from my own plate.

I have introduced several friends and family to Indian Spice Kitchen and they have all enjoyed themselves. I look forward to introducing more people to this hidden gem! If you have not yet been, what are you waiting for? Bring your appetite because you will not leave hungry!
