A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA the first thing that struck me about udupi palace was the décor. it reminds me of a cafeteria? it wouldn't be a place i'd just like to hang out in. 

the food, however, is fresh and yummy. i've been about three times and the quality is consistent. the place is usually packed, or at least crowded, which is comforting to me.

the servers are helpful if you're a dosa virgin, which i was on my first visit.
