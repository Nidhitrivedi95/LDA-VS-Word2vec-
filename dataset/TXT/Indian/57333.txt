ybawte9OmM1n5z1ouNaIUA The food is OK, fairly bland but a wide array of different preparations and sauces to try. Pricing is reasonable but the service is pretty abysmal. I'm the type that always likes to give the wait staff the benefit of the doubt and I would like to think of myself as a pretty low maintenance customer, but even in an empty restaurant it was absolutely impossible to get our servers attention and even when we did he was dismissive and short.
