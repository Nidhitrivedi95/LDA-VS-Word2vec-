Tla8mDMUAnpB7QcWAf7c5g The cook in the Kerala style which was foreign to me but based on complex spice mixes

We enjoyed the Fish Molee in a coconut sauce

Vegetable Khurma with a coconut sauce and a pistachio base

Jeera Pulao rice dish was moist and perfect to sop up the sauces

Award winning Butter Chicken was the best ever

The owner dropped to say hello and we enjoyed his interest in how we enjoyed the food. This really shows a dedication to serving up some of the best indian food I have had. This is really a genuine homestyle meal served in a restaurant. Authentic, Genuine and delicious.

Very very highly recommended
