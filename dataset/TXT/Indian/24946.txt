H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ Best Indian food in Scottsdale/Phoenix!  Just moved here from Philly and thankful to find a fabulous Indian restaurant.  You know its good when other Indian people come to dine and that's what we observed.  Food was great (ordered Chicken Tikka Masala), service was fantastic (Sam was our waiter; who also made a killer Grey Goose Gimlet!) We'll be back!!!
