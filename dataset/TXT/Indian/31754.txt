kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA I was visiting Edinburgh for a few days and went looking for Indian vegetarian food on a Sunday afternoon. Walked into Kalpna and was glad I did. The lunch buffet was very good - I would have been happy with mediocre quality (for no particular reason) but was very impressed with what I had for lunch. The decor is also quite nice. Don't hesitate to try it out.
