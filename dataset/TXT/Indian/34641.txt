For appetizer,  we split the tandoori chicken.  Hugely disappointing.  Absolutely no flavor, not even on the outside. 

The goat biriyani is quite spicy, even if you ask to decrease the spice to a mild level. Our waiter said it ia because the spice is added to the meat itself and that decreasing the spice is hard. 

The rhogan josh was DELICIOUS. I literally tried to lick the entire dish. 

The chicken tikka masala was subpar, not what you would expect because it was sort of bland and did not have well cut pieces.  

For the best bang for your buck,  order ashoka's plate. You get a lot of variety and option to try many things. The gulab jamun on it was delicious and a great way to end the meal. The dal on it though had a very monotonous flavor.
