9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w I've been wanting to try Indian food for the longest time so I chose this location to be my very first.

Restaurant was packed and seemed to be very clean. I thought the decor was very nice. 

I really can't remember what I ordered but the pic is posted below. The chicken Tikka (reddish chicken shown) was very dry and wasn't fresh. The goat (brown stew shown) was very nice. 

Naan bread was okay so was the rest of the food. I also didn't find the food to be that spicy at all but I'm used to eating very spicy food.

Overall I would say the food was nothing spectacular which is surprising because if I thought if one particular food would knock my socks off it would be Indian food. 

Service was excellent, my server was very happy to explain all the different foods on my plate.

I don't think I'll be back as though as I want to try other places. I think I will try Tandoori buffet as I will get to try many different dishes for one price.
