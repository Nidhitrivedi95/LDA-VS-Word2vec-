yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This place has great food and great service.  I've visited a couple times now and tell everyone who likes Indian food to try it out and no one has been disappointed.  I'm not a huge spicy fan so I was bit apprehensive on our first visit.  Needless to say, it was fantastic and beat my expectations.   The only negative thing I saw was the restaurant is not very big so sometimes the wait is very long but it's worth the wait.
