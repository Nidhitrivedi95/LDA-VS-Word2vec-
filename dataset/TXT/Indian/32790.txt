LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This has become my preferred place for South Indian food, particularly Dosas, Idlis and such. The food is very well done; and a really good introduction to South Indian food. Having said that, I'd say I have 2 reservations - they tend to be so busy that the sambar is really piping hot when served; and the service has been hit and miss. We've generally gone as a party of at least 6; and have had our orders not completed correctly or served in a coordinated fashion. I would play close attention if you've got a reasonable sized party. Recommended for the food.
