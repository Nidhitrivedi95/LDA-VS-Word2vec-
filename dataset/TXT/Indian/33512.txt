LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw Service was really good. The person who greeted us (guessing the owner) seemed very friendly and attentive. That being said I would rate the food reasonably priced but OK when it comes to my standards for Indian food. It was bland to what I am used to at my usual Indian restaurant (Farmington MI). I will note I have worked for an Indian family for the past 9+ years and have had various types of Indian cuisine and LOVE Indian food in general but I prefer the spicier dishes. So if you are looking for Indian food but don't like things too spicy then this would be a great place.
