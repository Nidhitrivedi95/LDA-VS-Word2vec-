DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ This is my once-a-month (if not more!) favorite for delicious Indian food. I always go at lunch because I love the wonderful variety of their buffet. The food is always fresh, the options change daily, and the food is yummy! The restaurant is small, clean, and the service is very attentive. Hmmm - I need a trip back there next week!
