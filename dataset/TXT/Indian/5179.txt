Picture this: You've just come back from a long day of work/school/just all around tired in general and you need sustenance. But you don't want anything too far or expensive, in fact something perfect would be close by, a take out, fast and cheap.
Enter Indian Roti House and their magnificent curries and biryani. I can't remember the amount of times I've defaulted to Indian Roti House as my takeout option, just because of ease of access, combined with the amazing money's worth I get for my food. 

My recommendation is the lamb biryani or any of the chicken curries; extremely savoury, insanely delicious, prepared fast, served hot, and you really get your bang for the buck, priced at just around $11 (It's even enough meals for 2 meals tbh)
Want to top it off with something sweet? Look no further and get that Mango Lassi. What's that? You wanted a fast meal but instead you're being treated like a sultan for a cheap deal? Did Indian Roti House just do some magic? Yes. Yes, they did.

Even before I moved to harbourfront, Indian Roti house has been a staple for my take out, delivery and fast food options; and now that I'm closer, even more so. 
Their staff are pretty accommodating with the spice levels and will give you decent recommendations. Don't want your curry in your roti? That's fine, they'll make it separately for you! 
Nothing short of a perfect score for this place! Cheap GREAT food delivered at fast speeds at an amazing price. Definitely getting your bang for the buck.
