VrftSduLIducNfEzITOL5A Went here recently to get my fix of Indian food and little India (Gerrard).
Was a little later on a Thursday night and after getting a ticket 2 minutes after parking my car, I was looking forward to a good meal to take my mind off of the f'n $40 ticket.

However, Haandi didn't deliver as much as I had hoped. I think it's just timing and freshness. Although they had a nice variety, the place just wasn't busy and the food was probably a little better at Lunch. When I say food - I mean the buffet. Nice variety, just really lacking freshness and the exotic rich taste I come to expect from Indian food.

The staff seemed quite nice and accommodating, it's unfortunate because it's got potential. I would suggest going when the place is busy or at a busier time - friday night, or lunch and ONLY if the place is busy. Otherwise I'd give this place a miss and default to the tried and true Lahore Tikka house. I guess it's the turnover of the buffet. I didn't order off the menu, so perhaps that's a better route to go.
