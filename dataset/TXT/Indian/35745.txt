nAnpTnodDchSl9H0f6R2pw Ordered the butter chicken and garlic naan for take-out last week. They said it would take a bit of time as all their meals are made to order. I didn't mind the wait as long as the food tasted good. As many have mentioned, the garlic naan was delicious. Very soft and and chewy, full of garlic flavour. It was perfect for dipping in the butter chicken sauce. The sauce was not up to my expectation but it was good enough, especially with the naan. 

However, the chicken they used in the butter chicken had some kind of unpleasant odour,  the second I bit into it I had to spit it out. I tried another piece of chicken and it tasted more yucky! I have never tasted any meat like that. It was so disgusting that I haven't been able to eat any chicken since then. 

Would love to give this place another chance and have their naan again, but I am still afraid to go back. Still traumatized by the whole experience and I actually regret writing this review because now I can actually taste that darn chicken in my mouth again!!
