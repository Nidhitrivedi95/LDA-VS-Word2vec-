kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I've eaten dinner here a couple times.

For the most part, the food is good, and they have been consistent.  One item I like about their menu is the "Indo-Chinese" section.  I think this is something unique that reflects the regional differences that often get glossed over in Indian cuisine.

The food is flavorful, and service is fast.

My two complaints:
1) something always seems to get miscommunicated to the kitchen regarding the spiciness of the dish.  Not too hot--_too mild_!  This has been verified when I look at my cheque--they list the spiciness requested next to the dish.

2)  While quick to refill water, if you order any other beverage, it gets forgotten.  My soda/tea glass is empty, and I eventually have to ask the waiter for a refill.  In terms of service, this is a big issue for me, personally.

Bottom line:  good food, pretty good service.  I hope to one day be in Charlotte to try the lunch buffet other reviewers have raved about.

One last item, this place is in a _tiny_ shopping area with a _tiny_ parking lot, so be forewarned.
