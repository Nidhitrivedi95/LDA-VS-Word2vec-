Now, I had my groupon and this was my first Indian experience. I was a bit nervous since I'm a picky eater and didn't really know what was in each dish. I'm also a vegetarian/vegan, so I was concerned that what I ordered could be a meat dish. I did some research beforehand though. The restaurant is BYOB, and for you groupon users, you have to be sure to make a reservation or else they won't honor it. (This may be only on weekends, and they weren't very strict about it - but a head's up). The setting was nice, with intimate dim lighting at the front for small parties, but brighter in the middle where larger groups were being seated. Our server was really sweet, helpful and patient while answering my questions and helping my pronunciation. We got the Channa Batura as a starter, which was a delicious chick pea curry sauce and puffy bread right from the oven. SO GOOD! My date got the Chilly Chicken and his mouth was on fire, but he said it was very good. I got the Veg Kofta, which were kind of like little falafels in a nice sauce. I got a side of more chickpeas (kinda obsessed with these guys) and date got the delish lentil soup. All in all I was totally into my meal, and happy that Tamarind took my indian food virginity :)
