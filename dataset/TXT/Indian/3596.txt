While I greatly enjoy Hakka food I don't know much about it so I usually just stick to my pakoras and manchurian meats. I believe you can order some dishes with or without gravy/heavy sauce depending on your preference but I like my food swimming in it so never asked.

The only reason I took a star off was because of seasoning. While it's good most of the time sometime I find the dish too salty compared to other times. Still good but makes me eat way more rice and drink more.

They have a pretty good deal on takeout orders as well. When you order $25 or more there was a 10% discount last time I ordered for pickup. Even when just picking up food for myself I just order a bunch and keep in the fridge since the food was good even when reheated.
