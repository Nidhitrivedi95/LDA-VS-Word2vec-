TBHpa0OX9WnWdlrti-KBxQ I am so glad this restaurant is in Strongsville and close to my work and home! Best Indian food I have ever had and feel comfortable after eating. Very good curry and rice and best naan (with a bit green onion but not too oily). The staff there is also very fast at preparing our office's pick-ups but need a slightly better way to mark the food (we have multiple orders) or we won't know what we ordered. The buffet is the best, especially the dark green lamb/chicken thing, desserts are nice. Make sure you try the mango lassi or regular (with a white color) lassi.
