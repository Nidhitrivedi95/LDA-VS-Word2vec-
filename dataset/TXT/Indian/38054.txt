ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw The good stuff first...nice décor, great samosas and chutneys. Great chicken tikka masala (sp?). The bad...the awful shrimp dish...spiced just right but the shrimp was overcooked...how much...obviously reheated, or held too long...like biting into a whole water chestnut. I should have sent the dish back. Did mention it too the waiter...oh, I will tell the chef...no response at all from management...were busy bs..ing at the bar. 
Lesson learned by me...just return the 'bloody' dish...just hate doing that though...would I go back...yes, definitely
