82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Been going there for over a decade now and it is one of my absolute favorite restaurants of all time!! Not cheap but both food and service are fantastic! It's a la carte but during the week there's a lunch buffet which is very reasonably priced and what a feast!  Whether you go for supper or their lunch buffet...it is consistently fresh and so delicious!
