8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg The best Indian food in the area. Period. 
My favorite chill spot.

I have been in champaign on a small time for work. Probably around 7 months. I travel more than most and rely and the vast Internet for food and drink. The Internet didn't provide me this spot. The locals praise it and directed me towards it. It has not only the friendliest staff but it has amazing Indian food for the area. It had amazing Indian food for all the places I've been to. 

Need a place to decompress? Have a beer at their bar and order something amazing.
