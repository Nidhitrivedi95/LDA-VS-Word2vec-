QKv_BUkrL0t3sGpdR3H3Kw I wouldn't eat anything from here again

For food that tasted like it was heated up in a microwave, I don't know why it took an hour to reach my place within a 2 km radius. On arrival, my 2 naans were completely crumbly like papadums; the beef ragun was drowned in a portion of sauce to go with the grease, the meat was overcooked (dry & chewy); sag paneer was bland & too watery, the cheese was not quality (prob ruined by microwaving); the tarka dal was delicious, but way too runny. Better Indian joints exist in the hood.
