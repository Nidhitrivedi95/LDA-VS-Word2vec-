XNL6PRXaQxyDO2yeBdy11w I've had the best thali of my life at this small, friendly restaurant on Somerled. Under $10 you can have almost half a pound of delicious food ! What I liked the most was the choice of dishes available to include in our thali and the possibility to have it more spicy. Also, the service is really quick and the people are so kind ! And they deliver!!! :)
