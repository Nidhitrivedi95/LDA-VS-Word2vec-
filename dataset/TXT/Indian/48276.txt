ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Saffron is nothing to write home about but it's perfectly fine. This review pertains to the lunch buffet specifically.

As buffets go, it has what you'd expect. There is certainly plenty of food and the service is very friendly. Pretty much all of the meats on the buffet as far as I can recall have been chicken, which doesn't really reflect the full array of Indian dishes.  However, this limitation is not surprising considering the lunch buffet is all you can eat and it's only $10 per person.

Would I list it as a "great spot to brag about and bring friends to"? No. Would I likely go there again for the buffet, due to its ability to appeal to a large group and its reasonable and predictable price? Yes.
