Hubby and I used to have a favourite "hole in the wall" Indian restaurant in East Markham. That is until I took my brother and sister in law there and a roach crawled out from the side of the table. Never again! 

Thankfully Bombay Bhel is NOT that restaurant, and it is now our go to place to satisfy our cravings for Indian food. The restaurant is dimly lit, clean, and decorated with Indian inspired art along the wall where a number of booths are located. 

We usually order butter chicken with naan (can upgrade to garlic naan for an additional fee). The butter chicken sauce is creamy but not too thick, and I have been known to sop up every last bit of the butter chicken sauce goodness with naan. When are feeling the need for veggies, we order the okra dish, or the aloo gobi (Indian style cauliflower with potatoes). Each dish is served with your choice of basmati rice or naan. Their vegetarian samosas are pretty good too, and are served with a delicious sweet sour tamarind sauce.

The food is reasonable priced for what you are getting, although I find many Indian restaurants' serving sizes to be on the smaller size (this place included). Nonetheless there are few places where I would make a special trip to get butter chicken, and this restaurant happens to be one of them.
