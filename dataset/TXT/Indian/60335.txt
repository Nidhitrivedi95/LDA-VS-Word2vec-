ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA My first time in Charlotte, NC we decided to go to an Indian restaurant for some yummy Indian food. This was the highest rated restaurant on Yelp, so we decided to give it a go. It did not disappoint. We ordered the Chicken Curry and Chicken Korma with Naan and it was absolutely delicious. The service was good, and it was a good sign to see many Indian and Asian patrons which gave us second opinions as to the authenticity and taste of the food. Would highly recommend to those that are looking for a great Indian restaurant to visit in Charlotte!
