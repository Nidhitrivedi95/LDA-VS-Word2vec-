LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA My sister and I were really craving Indian food and we found Guru Lukshmi on Yelp with raving reviews. Without hesitating, we drove our way over. Our big mistake was not calling ahead for a reservation, we thought we would wait, but the next available table was in an hour and a half. This place was packed! Note to self: call ahead of time. 

Good: Since we couldn't get a table, we decided to get take out. The menu was unfamiliar to me, as I didn't really recognize any mainstream Indian dishes on it. I asked the girl at the counter and she recommended the popular dosas and vadas. Best decision ever. The food had such rich flavors and the sauces were perfectly paired together and the dosas were perfectly crispy, I really enjoyed the food.

Bad: Make a reservation. Don't walk in.

Bottom line: I'll definitely go back again if I'm in the area when I visit Toronto!
