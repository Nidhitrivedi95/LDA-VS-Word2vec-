The next waiter couldn't decide whether to be nice to us or not. He smiled the first time and made snide remarks the next. The third guy was visibly relieved when we didn't order dessert. All this when we arrived well before time and someone else had just started ordering when we were leaving. The food was so-so. We ordered Dosa and frankly, there's a lot of room for improvement. Would not recommend going there. There are other better indian restaurants to go to.
