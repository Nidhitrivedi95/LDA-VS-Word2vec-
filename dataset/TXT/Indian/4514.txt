1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg My review is 3.5 I'd say.
Food-wise: 
Been there twice. Once for dinner - I really liked the food that time, the spices and the hotness of the dishes (veg biryani and malai kofta) really hit the spot, but the prices were a $1-2 more than what I saw online so I wanted to check the cheap lunch special. 
Lunch - $5.99 for the veg thali: half a papadam, rice, daal, 3 kinds of vegetable curries (I had the mixed veg, eggplant and cauliflower/potato. They also had chickpeas and potatoes). The food was tasty. However, I would say that I don't think they used fresh spices but a spice mix, which was good, but I like the genuine thing when I eat Indian food out. but I guess I can't complain for $5.99 for a big and filling portion...
Service-wise:
The dinner waiter was so rude we started laughing about it. Extremely rude! He brought a plate of papadam and took it after a minute when it was still full (!) to refill the dish and give it to another table (at least that's what I think happened).
If we asked for anything he just didn't say anything and walk away (so we didn't know if he got what we wanted or not) and overall seemed very grumpy.
I wasn't bothered by this because the food at dinner was very good and reminded me of India.
