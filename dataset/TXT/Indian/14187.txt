C_chktl5jFeRqu1C0rmScA One of the better Kerala food I tasted. I recommended this place for people who want to try this style of food. If you like fish and curry try the Meen pollichalhu. Completely worth going here. It is the most unique taste in this place. Masala omellete is my next recommendation. It is a spicy omellete, light and flavourful. The standard Indian food there was not the best. Better of trying at other restaurants more specialised in them.
