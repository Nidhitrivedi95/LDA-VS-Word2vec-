I always get the lamb chops as an appetizer. They are freaking delicious!

Entrees you can mix and match 2 different types, what style (bowl, roti tacos, plate, etc). I ususaly get chicken keema and lentils. All the entrees have good flavor, some spice (I like to ask for more) and are nice and filling, but not in a heavy way. 

Service has been mixed from super nice waitresses who would fit in at any 5 star place to surly and unattentive ones who need to be flagged down for even the basics (like drinks, ordering, asking for check, refills).

UPDATE:  I went there the other night with my wife and two kids (4 and 14mo). There were at least 6 tables open and the manager (owner?) came over and told us that there were no tables available. None of them could be combined into a table for four. It was 6pm. I call BS. There weren't any kids there and she gave us a good look up and down then shook her head no. We've been there at least a dozen times with the kids, we order lots of food, tip well and our kids don't disturb anyone. We eat out every night of the week. They are both model citizens. 
I know the look that I got. We weren't welcome there. Don't worry....we wont be coming back, ever. There's no shortage of good food in this town. We can find plenty of places that aren't afraid to see a young family walk in.  Good lamb chops aren't worth being disrespected.
