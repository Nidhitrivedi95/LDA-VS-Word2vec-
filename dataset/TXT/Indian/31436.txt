ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw First off I love Indian food. I eat it at least once a week. Ive been to this particular restaurant 3 times now, the first 2 times were average but the 3rd time was a whole other story...

I ordered the Chicken Biriyani for $5 or $6. First off, the food was cold. Like straight out of the refrigerator cold. It was also really salty and there were only 2 small pieces of chicken (mostly bone). Essentially it was just biryani rice. My girlfriend started picking at one of the chicken pieces and kept asking what kind of meat it was because it was so tough. After inspecting it myself, we flipped the piece over and it was COMPLETELY RAW! Right away I felt sick. I brought it up to the owner and instead of taking responsibility he says to me "Oh thats Biriyani chicken".. ummm what? then he continues making excuses like "Yea thats how its suppose to be". After just staring in disbelief he finally says, "Ok I will replace it" Replace it?? Replace the raw chicken with more raw chicken? After realizing how stupid an idea that was, he ended up giving me curry with rice (which I ended up giving to a homeless person).

The thing that ticked me off the most was how he would not take responsibility for the raw chicken. There are a lot of other Indian restaurants downtown. Do not risk going here and putting your health on the line. I have also contacted Toronto Public Health and filed a formal complaint about this restaurant. Hopefully theyll do a check in the near future.
