Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I was a bit hesitant from the looks outside and that there was not a lot of patrons inside so I passed, but came back the night after. Come to find out, the patrons are mostly Indian (good sign), the food was delicious, I had the fish masala (spicy) with rice, onion naan, plus tamarind/mint chutney, everything was great, service was more 'human' than other restaurants on the strip, prices were not bad.
