ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Annoyed! 5/24 unable to get in some sort of party. Asked for to go food they said no....today i see on the door they have delivery??? 5/25 i come in there were only 3 customers ...imagine my shock when the waiter wanted me to sit at a tiny table behind the entrance wall... I went off on him.   Dude this place has l 30 emply tables and paper table cloths whats the problem?    Finally got a table.... I rate the food a 3/10 wont be back its just a headache to find parking and deal with BS on a 1 hr lunch break
