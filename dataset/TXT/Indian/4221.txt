1PfNM_6ouYvNEbAukY76EQ This veggie restaurant is more than decent in its offering. The chat (rabdi chat) and appetizer (achaar gobi) were pretty good (barring the bland veg manchurian) - the Biryani was flavorful, tandoori rotis were fresh; Pashtuni dal makhani, paneer butter masala, and veg stir fry were pretty good.

I am docking off one star for the below-par service offered. We had to do at least a couple of rounds to the front desk to get some attention and service. Not cool. For heavens sake, employ more people at least during the weekends - at the end of the day, it shouldn't be your service that drives people away from your restaurant.
