ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw so we went here because we had a desi food craving. unfortunately this was not fulfilled at all. the place has good decor/atmosphere and the service is professional and friendly. however the food does not do justice to the name "origin india" - maybe they are better at meat dishes than vegetarian but their kofta was basically all potato and not tasty. the food was bland and i would not go back there to eat. however they do have a wide selection of beer which was intriguing because its not the typical stuff you find - mostly belgian.. so if you do end up here then ask about their beer selection - its the only tasty thing i had there!
