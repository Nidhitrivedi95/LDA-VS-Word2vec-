Beverage: PREVIOUSLY - This place had tasteless food, (some of it tasted like they had just opened frozen veggie packets & added some sauce), the worst gin & tonic I've ever had in their previous location off of Yonge street. We had not visited this place in a few years. We wanted to give it another try after seeing the Yelp star rating. They have moved to a different location on Yonge street close to the previous one.
PRESENT- Looks like they have reinvented themselves! Their G&T was among the best I've had.
Food & service: The food was freshly prepared, well spiced, standard North Indian & Punjabi fare. It was quite good. They have an interesting south Indian Madras Paneer which is very tasty & extremely spicy (you can request that they tone it down as it can become unpleasant after a few mouthfuls) which goes well with rice. Their aloo nan, which is a different twist on the paratha, was delicious. The bhindi was very flavorful & delicately spiced. Their Mughlai kofta was also a refreshing change from the usual malai kofta.
Overall, a good, satisfying Desi restaurant you can stop for dinner or lunch especially on these negative temperature days.
