C_chktl5jFeRqu1C0rmScA I have been dying to eat some authentic kerala food. This place brought home food to Canada.  Thank you much. The fish biriyani ( the thalasery  special fish biriyani ) was very delicious.  We also ordered the fish polichathu  and chicken varutharachathu.  Everything was above expectation. Really loved the place. Will always come back .
