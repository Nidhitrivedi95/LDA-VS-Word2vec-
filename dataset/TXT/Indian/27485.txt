Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg I've eaten here over 10 times and Every meal has been fantastic. From the Somosa's to the Nan (love the Rosemary!) to the veg and non-veg entrees, the food is always good. My favorite entree is the Methi Chicken with the Rosemary nan. Don't be afraid to order it hot as they are fairly conservative with their "heat ratings" (1-4). 

The service is also very good. I ordered take-out once and they forgot my nan. The called me back and apologized and assured me next time I ordered or came in they would give me free nan. They didn't disappoint as the next time around they remembered me and came through on their promise. 

I highly recommend this restaurant.
