K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g Terrible food. The service was awful, the ownership and staff lied to us and are completely unethical. 

Walked in for a buffet and most of the dishes were finished. We asked if they were still serving and would be  refilling the buffet. The server and owner assured us that they would. After serving us a couple dosas (cold and unappealing) we were then told that there was no more food. 

Pretty unfair to do this in the middle of your meal. Anyways the owner asked us to bear with them as they had a larger lunch crowd than expected and that they would make it up to us in the bill. So after eating a cold, half filled buffet of terrible food we were given $5 off a $55+ bill. Seems like the management is all about great service. :)

I would never go back.
