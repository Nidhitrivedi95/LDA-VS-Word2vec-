o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Got a takeaway, once we got home we realized there was no rice  I've never had a curry not come with rice. We don't live close, so just made some white rice that we had at home- food was cold by the time the rice was cooked. Over all good food but $35 for two curries and two naans (idk how much they charge for rice) is a little spendy for what you get.
