gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Absolutely love this place. This was my first introduction to Indian food and it was phenomenal! Everything is so flavorful and hearty-you leave feeling like your tummy is getting a nice warm hug. Everything is clearly labeled vegan and the owner is beyond accommodating. He even makes special gluten free items if you just ask! The ambiance is a little lacking, but the food (which is what really matters) more than makes up for it.
