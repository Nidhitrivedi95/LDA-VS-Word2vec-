biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg Love this buffet. About $14/person for lunch but lunch is served late. Wonderful selection. Butter chicken and potato masala are my favorites. Always very friendly servers and quick to refill waters. Been to this location many times and will continue to come back. No complaints. Always leave extremely full. Naan included :)
