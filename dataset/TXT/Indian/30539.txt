KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ This place is DELICIOUS.  The freshness of the ingredients is apparent in the color, smell and flavor of the food;  bright and tantalizing.  Surprisingly, it isn't advertised, but after a little prodding I found it to be true, everything is made from scratch down to the home spun ice cream!!  Coming from San Francisco, I would say it's better than any Indian food I've found there in the last eight years...Definitely take advantage of this place, Ohio!
