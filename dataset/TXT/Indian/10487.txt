9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw Ordered from Just Eat the other night, it was so good! Spicy enough without it being difficult to eat, and arrived hot from a friendly delivery man. My only complaint is how expensive it is. $11.95 for a small signature Butter Chicken roti is steep considering the portion size. But overall, the taste of the dish outweighs it's price and portion.
