MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw Was here last week! Very disappointed! Food was not good, service was terrible. Only thing edible might be their naan, and butter chicken. I do not recommend coming here. Apparently they changed their entire staff, food once taste good I heard. If u wanna risk it, go try it:/
