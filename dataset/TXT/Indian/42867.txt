RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Perfect! My GF and I went there last night Saturday, reservations for 6:30pm. They were ready and had our table set! Very friendly greeting and even told us where there was a secret elevator that would bring us up to the restaurant door next time.
Our waiter was extremely nice, smart, funny, and attentive, regardless how busy he was. Our table was intimate and warm. Prices are perfect for a nice night out without breaking the bank. Food was out of this world! We had the fried-ish cauliflowe for an appetizer... excellent. Main course was braised Lamb and a Chicken Tikka Masala with a coconut sauce. To die for!!!!
Definitely recommend, and WILL be going back!
