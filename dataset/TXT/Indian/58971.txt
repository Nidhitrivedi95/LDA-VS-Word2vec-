YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A This place was so good. Great food and really attentive service. I came here with a friend for dinner after a conference nearby. We had the bhuna lamb, bhindi masala and chicken tikka masala. it was all wonderful. Our server was very helpful with recommendations and very attentive. Then the chef came over mid-meal. And instead of it being a drive-by "how's everything," he spent some time with us asking specifically about each dish (What did you like? Would you change anything?) It was warm and inviting. 

This was a great place. Nice modern decor with clean lines and bright accents. I'm a fan.
