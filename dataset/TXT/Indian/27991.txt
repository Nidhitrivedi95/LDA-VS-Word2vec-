IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Decent place, if you're by ASU and want persian food then its good enough. Server was a younger kid who was great. Place was empty on a weekday evening, but im sure its busier when school is in session. Ordered the chicken kabob, it was okay. Chicken had a weird texture and flavor was okay. GF ordered the tadig ghormeh sabzi, it was okay. Ghormeh wasnt as good as other places or as good as mine but like i said if you dont want to make the drive to Scottsdale then it will be fine. On the menu next to tea it said no refills which is pretty cheap IMO, I literally get 3 pounds of Ahmad tea for $8 so to charge for refills is pretty annoying. Overall decent, if Im in the area and need persian food then ill come back.
