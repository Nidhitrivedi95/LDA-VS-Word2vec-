bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Came here with a buddy to try out their take on Hakka food. Got chili chicken, fish pakora,  and mixed fried rice. Taste was pretty good. Although I thout the chili chicken was a bit too salty for my liking. Fish pakora was good... But I think Lin garden's was a tad better. Price point wise... Was on par. Good value for your money.
