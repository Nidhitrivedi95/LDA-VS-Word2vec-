P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg This is one of my favourite Hakka places in the world. I cant help but order a whole bunch of items since everything is so good. Appatizers : LOLLIPOP CHICKEN and GARLIC SHRIMP, So good. I also order Chicken 88 for my dry item and Sa Po chicken , since the sauce is soo good and amazing with plain rice. Plus the waiters speak bengali, my native tongue. Definitely a plus. I go to many hakka places. This is one of the top ones.
