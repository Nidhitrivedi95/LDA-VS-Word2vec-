1) They claimed to be Halal certified for meat and chicken. Showed a certificate dated 2009 from ISNA. I contacted ISNA and they confirmed my suspicions. We were lied to. When a business owner lies about certification... How can I trust them in any thing else. 

2) Food is bland. Nothing special. We ordered the Fish and Garlic, Shrimp and Garlic and Pasta Shrimp.
