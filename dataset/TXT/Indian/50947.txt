uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw Went there on Saturday evening and there were a lot of families enjoying their food there. We ordered chicken biryani, chicken chargha, Bihari boti, boneless chicken tikka, beef kabab and malayi tikka, salad and chutney. Biryani was good but wasn't the best in town. Malayi tikka and Bihar boti were ok but if you want some amazing bihari boti and malayi tikka then Cafe De Khan is the best place to go. Chicken boneless tikka was really good and beef kabab were ok too. Chicken chargha was amazing. It tasted just like the chargha we used to eat in Pakistan. Overall it was a good family experience and I will come back to try more stuff.
