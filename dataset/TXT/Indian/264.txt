-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Really enjoy this place and have been returning fairly regularly, especially for the well-priced lunch buffet. I've had difficulties in the past with locating an Indian restaurant that I liked in the area, and even though many others are closer, this has become the one for me.

The buffet selection is smaller than some other places, but I prefer quality over quantity anyway. Most dishes are there every day, while a couple seem to rotate in and out. Including free unlimited garlic naan and mango lassi with the buffet is a nice touch and something other places don't offer.

The service here has been good as well, which is important considering service has been a struggle at many Indian places I've visited in the past. Waiters fill your water and check on you frequently.

My one minor ding would be that the tikka masala could use a little more flavor, at least for me, and a couple dishes could stand to be spicier. I believe when you order off the menu here, you specify how spicy you want the dish, so it's very possible they make buffet dishes a little blander to cater to all audiences. Admittedly, I like my food spicier than the average person.

Still, it's overall a clean, tasty place that I try to eat at once or twice a month. Keep up the good work!
