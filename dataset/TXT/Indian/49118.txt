tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I love ethnic food, the heck with burgers,pizza,chicken, blah,blah. Here we are in the greatest country in the world and we have the most boring  government controlled food choices. We don't have as many choices as other countries, BORING.....
All of our food has to be politically correct or we can't buy it or find it in restaurants!!
That's why I love ethnic food, they can get away with it to a certain degree, not totally though.
I happened upon the Indian Oven the other night with other some other people (Oops, am I politically correct) that enjoy food.
We were seated promptly, received menus and were asked if we were interested in the buffet.  We checked out the buffet and just by looking at the choices I knew it would be great. My daughter was craving for goat ! Can we buy goat in a grocery store ? No!  She likes fiery hot food, takes after me, and ordered the hottest curry ever with rice. I'm enjoying the leftovers right now, huge portion.
The buffet had so many choices, I can't even remember the names and if I did I wouldn't know how to spell them. The food was fantastic, and all of the items were fresh and delicious. The food was being replaced regularly and no one had to scrape the bottom of the barrel.
The service was great and we were asked many times if we needed more food , like the skillet of Tandoori chicken and ground meat sausages along with naan. Not to many american restaurants do that, unless you pay extra!
I can't say enough about this place except for, I'll be back, and I approve this message.
