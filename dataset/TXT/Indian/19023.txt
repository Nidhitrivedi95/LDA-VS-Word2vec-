F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw This place is pretty good for a quick, filing meal. The service is pretty quick and they get your take out meal to go pretty fast. 

My go to meal here is the chili fish with extra gravy. Sooooo good! (This is actually my go to meal for any hakka place) 

I've also dined in here, and the environment is pretty lively with a family vibe to it. 

Pretty good, thumbs up.
