S-lTS8UX34-Z7G1uYjVzvw First off, let me say we went with a group of 18 people. This pretty much took up half the dining room, and most of these were loud chatty college kids. The wait staff and manager were very accommodating and the service was very, very good.

The tandoori grill items were amazing! I would highly recommend them. They came out on a platter still steaming and smelling delicious (the same way people bring you fajitas in the states - same thing). Between four of us guys we got each one and swapped and shared. They were all super good. We had each of the varieties of Naan as well. All were excellent.

The chicken biryani had very generous amounts of chicken chunks in it and the rice was fantastic. I'd recommend a plate of that to share with your friends while you get a grill item.

This was our last supper together as a group before heading back to the states the next day, and it was a perfect way to cap off our trip. Good food, good friends, great service, very accomodating of a large group, and well priced. I'd highly recommend stopping in!
