U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw In a sea of taco shops the Bay Leaf Cafe is like a lighthouse of dining adventure. This was my first visit to an Indian restaurant and I loved it. Our server Jobi was friendly and helpful and navigated our way through uncharted waters. The vegetable samosas, a pastry wrapped appetizer, was flakey and delicious. Chicken tikka masala is outstanding. Be sure to order naan bread right from the oven to dip up every bit of the rich tomato gravy. Our meal at the Bay Leaf Cafe was a culinary adventure and a dining success! Look forward to our next visit.
