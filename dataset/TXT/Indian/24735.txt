h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw I ordered from this place on Grub Hub around 5:40pm on a Saturday. It said it would take 40-50 minutes to come but it came in like 25 minutes! So fast!

I ordered the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan. I had a $10 off coupon so it was pretty inexpensive. 

The chicken was creamy and good but it could've had a little more flavor. Overall it was pretty tasty and served as two meals for me! The garlic naan was delicious. I would recommend this place to anyone!
