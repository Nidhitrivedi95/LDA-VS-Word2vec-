auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Beware! They can kick you out half hour before closing time!!

We were a family of seven driving about 500 miles to visit Las Vegas for vacation and decided to eat food here before heading to our room. We had 3 kids and elderly parents with us. They outrightly asked us to leave the place saying that they are closed when the yelp showed they closed at 3, and even the door said they close at 3.

We had no choice but to look for some other place. We looked at a Thai restaurant ( Pin Kauw)  in the same complex. They also listed the same hours. But they welcomed us with bright smiles and served us fresh food! 

I am never visiting Taj Palace again!!
