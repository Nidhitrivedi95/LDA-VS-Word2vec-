GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Loved it! Very different but delicious, tried the Tikka Masala Fries (reminds me chilaquiles), Hummus (the best I have had) with Naan (reminds me of homemade flour tortillas), Tandoori chicken, and Goat Karahi. I love spicy food so I did not think the food was spicy at all, I could have used more heat but if you are sensitive to spicy food you might melt. I didn't think the service was bad as others have mentioned. I would come back and would bring friends that like to try different food.
