g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Oh my. Looks like I found my forever restaurant location. True, quite hole in the wallish looking and forget coming for lunch at 12, cos everyone and their mama here. But hey, I didn't come here to stare at the chairs or the wall or at some of them Indian ladies' gorgeous hair, I came here to stuff my belly with some Indian street food deliciousness so let's get to that! Food is a bit on the spicy side, just how I like it. One dip in the buccal cavity and voila, a burst of flavorful sensations. The right combination of sweet, sour and spicy. Yum!!! I'm not a fan of the desserts though. Too sweet, but that's typical of Indian desserts if you dig that.
