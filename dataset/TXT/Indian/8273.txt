7LNuQqjcjAn0bBlGHIiQzQ we ordered dinner for two when we stopped by. had bad experience with other buffet style indian food in the past - everything seems a lot more watered down. 

some of the stuff was good in the pre-fixe menu, some are kinda weird. i liked the tandori chicken and the lamb stew thing. grilled shrimp was mediocre. the long log of some sort  of meat was not very good. 

naan was fresh and crispy so that was a plus. had some leftovers to take home for the next day even. food is alright, not fantastic.
