JoHDOuZ1BnFi63PgC_zYeQ To start with: this deserves zero stars, but that is unfortunately not an option. 

Ordered: Samosa Chaat, Veg dum biryani, garlic naan, kadai chicken, shahi paneer.

The place is very big and can seat lots of people, and in terms of cleanliness it was very nice. I went tonight, and got there around 7. It wasn't very busy, and I ordered one appetizer, one side, and three entrees. We were seated promptly and served water, but it took about 25 mins for someone to take our order. After they took our order, it took about one hour to get the appetizer and the main courses showed about 30 mins later. The entire restaurant was entirely unorganized, the staff had no idea what they were doing and it seemed like they could not handle their take-out orders with dine-in orders. No one came to check on us at any point. We had to ask several times for them to check on our order. The waiter had no idea what we had ordered and did not know what to check for, and when all the food did finally arrive, it was cold and extremely bland. Portion sizes were extremely small. At the time of payment we went up to pay, and the waiter could not even find our receipt and did not give us discount for making us wait almost two hours for our food which was cold and terrible. 

Overall, super unorganized restaurant, really small portions, bland food, terrible service. Kohinoor, the only good Indian restaurant in the area is excellent both in terms of service and food.
