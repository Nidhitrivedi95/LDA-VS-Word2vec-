C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw One of my go to take-away restaurants. Their Kothu roti is always fresh, flavourful & filling. It's like a cuddle in my mouth...
 I always request special spice levels and they're so accommodating and kind! I love the abundance of flavour in the K-roti.. I always get the butter chicken variation and it's soooo tasty. Last time I changed things up and got the lamb wrap which I'd highly recommend! Lots of packed yummy veggies and SE-Asian spices. Pairs well with the mango lassi whoop whoop. Thanks Saffron team! Always so tastyyyyyyy
