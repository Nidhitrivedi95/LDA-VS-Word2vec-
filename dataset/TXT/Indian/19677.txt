flEnFkUtW5YVowWbenXsSg Would I bring a first date here? No. She'd probably leave but if she's that shallow, I wouldn't want to be with her anyway. Moving on...

If you're looking for a real South Asian meal, this place is the real deal.

I grew up in Vancouver but I spent a good 10 years in India and other parts of South Asia. When I moved to Toronto, finding decent Indian comfort food wasn't easy.

I usually order the Haleem, Any Biryani (depending on my mood), Tandoori Chicken is the real deal and you should try out their breads as well. I haven't ordered each and every thing on the menu but anything that I have tried, was worth the order.

Don't walk... Run to Sizzler Kabab.
