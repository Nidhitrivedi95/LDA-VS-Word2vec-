auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I can't say I have a lot of places to compare this to as I don't usually eat this type of food! But came here with a friend who highly recommended the buffet during lunch time and let me tell you it was so delicious! I can not wait to come back. The food is all amazing! The flavors are so rich and perfectly executed. We got the garlic nan bread that I used to soak up all the leftover sauces! Ugh heaven. I literally think about this place all the time. All types of meat dishes and vegetarian. The service was great and I like the venue. If you want to try something new this is a great place, I am looking forward to bringing other people here to try it.
