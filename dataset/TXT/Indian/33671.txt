lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw Maybe its me but I thought the food was ok. Loved the decor. Now I have never lived or been to Mumbai (Bombay) so I have never had authentic street food there so I am only going by what I had today. I had the chicken frankie. It was very saucy and a messy dish. There was no salt in my first bite so I asked for more salt. I should have tried a few more bites as my food as there was salt in the food. The mango lassi was thick and not too sweet. Not too much mango flavour. The fries again had no salt as all the salt was at the bottom. 

I always give a place 3 tries if the first try was ok. So I will go back two more times. I really want to try the chai there. I haven't had good chai in ages.
