GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw This is the first time I have eaten Indian food, so I would not be able to say if it is the best around. Here is what I do know, I had the lamb tikka marsala. It was very good and they brought the chutneys on the side so I could adjust the heat according to my own white boy whimpy palate.

The service was good and I will be back to try other things to expand my culinary boundaries.
