I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw Although I'm thankful that we have a new option in dining choices in this area, this place needs some work. I called in the order and drove over to pick it up. The inside of the restaurant must have been 85 degrees inside. It was so hot that I was literally soaked with sweat after waiting a mere 4 minutes for my order. How can a place that hot be sanitary? The garlic Naan was meh ...okay. I wouldn't say it's any better than the kind you can buy at trader Joe's. The Tikka Masala chicken had great creamy flavor and would've been perfect if the cheap Styrofoam it was in didn't break inside the bag and spill. The rice was was cooked as it should be, nothing special. The price was high, another negative.
