qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Things I love: the pricing and the delicious food.

Things I hate: the pathetic lack of identifiable service and the overly loud environment.

Red Room is loud as all hell, drunk as all hell, and dirty as all hell. The bohemian feel is nice, but bohemian service is sub-par. They lack uniform and coordination, so it is difficult to identify them. The bathroom situation has improved from several years ago, at least.

The food though is really The Red Room's saving grace. Their pad thai with chicken and tofu, though it has one additional "meat", still comes under $10. The portion size is fantastic as well; finishing it was a genuine struggle.

The dichotomy between the food and service problematic, though it's a fixable problem. I just doubt it'll even be considered, given it was in this state last time I visited, several years ago.
