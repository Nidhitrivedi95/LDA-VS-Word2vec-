7dZtL9I_AsTQ1pc6t9TTyA My colleague and I, along with our manager, were working late at the office on Thursday night. Our boss asked whether we needed dinner. It was 7:30 pm. I said that we did. 

Chaska is a new restaurant that has opened close to our office. My colleague called to ask whether the place was open. Yes! It closes at 9 pm on Thursdays. 

We walked over there, which took roughly five minutes. I don't recall what business was there before Chaska,!but Chaska is between Subway and Pita Lite. 

You basically pick and choose what you'd like to eat. I went with the chicken tikka with brown rice, medium curry sauce, and a Diet Pepsi. My colleague and I didn't discuss what we wanted, but he ordered the same meal! You can tell that we work so closely together that our food tastes are the same. 

Our manager ordered the salmon salad with a mango lassi. 

My food was delicious. The chicken was tender. The medium curry sauce was spicier than I had anticipated, but was flavourful. 

The decor is trendy and cheerful. I loved the lighting. There are plenty of tables. 

I'd come back here for a quick, delicious meal. You can order out, too.
