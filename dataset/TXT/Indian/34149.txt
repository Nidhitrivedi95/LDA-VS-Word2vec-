md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA My husband and I, we're not Indian, but ADORE Indian food.
We've been to this restaurant at least 10x and each time we're never disappointed.
Anything I've ordered from the menu has been great, and my husband (who is more picky than I am, on food quality) agrees it's the best Indian restaurant he's ever been to.

For me, a good meal is a combination of some kind of biryani, with a vegetarian dish such as paneer or vegetable medley and a meat dish (lamb or chicken), accompanied by a mixed yogurt drink (i.e. non-Indians might call a 'smoothie' lol).

My husband ADORES the paan bread and butter chicken.

The price is reasonable, according the quality and portions. I find the service quick and the waiters not too pushy (but then again, we don't mind ordering too much - lol).
