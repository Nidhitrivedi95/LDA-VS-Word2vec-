ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ This is the third Indian restaurant we've tried since moving to the area, and it is by far our favourite. We usually go once a week, at least, and it is great whether you eat it there or get it for take-out. My husband gets the Shrimp korma and I like the shahi paneer. The garlic naan is also delicious. They are willing to do a mild version of the food for wimps like me. After the mild version, it gets spicy quickly, but they can also do half mild and half medium. The restaurant is family-owned, so we see the same people there each time, and they are very friendly. If you go on Friday or Saturday night, it is quite busy and the pace of service is a little slower. Any other time, and it's pretty calm and quick service. The portions are also pretty sizeable, so I usually end up with lunch the next day.
