Have dined here for several years.  This is one of the only Indian restaurants where I can happily dine without heartburn afterwards (I don't usually get heartburn, even to spicy foods...only to Indian food).  I've tried many other delicious Indian restos, but sadly, experience heartburn that make me regret my meal.  

This visit to Copper Chimney was on a Thursday night, and it was good thing we had a reservation; the place was packed at 7pm.  Per many of the reviews, the food is really good.  I do find, however, that some of their dishes are too drenched in sauce - The Chili lime wings are flavourful, but were covered in too much sauce, as were the garlic veggie balls.  In some of the dishes that come with sauce (Paneer Makhani and Butter chicken), there was too much sauce, and too little paneer / chicken.  I know some people love using the sauce for dipping their naan, or saucing the rice, but overall, the servings could've been a little more generous.

The wine pricing is decent though;  and when we polished off a bottle and ordered extra glasses, the pours were very generous.

Service was competent and efficient;  there was a constant line at the door, as well as constant take-out orders being picked up.  And once again, no heartburn after this yummy Indian meal!
