aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q I've been coming back for years. Friendly owner that remembers everyone, a unique menu that each item gets the same amount of love on. If you want kabob, come here, if you want a burrito, come here, if you want roti, come here. Mostly though, come for the roti. It's magic wrapped in a dream.
