We'd been put off by the prices, but when our server explained that the menu is a tasting menu with dishes designed to serve a few people, the prices seemed quite reasonable. We also had received a postcard with a $20 voucher. Pukka puts a twist on some traditional dishes. They certainly know how to cook shrimp. We went back several times.
