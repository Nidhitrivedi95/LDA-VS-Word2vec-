llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Seeing as I live in Monona and have been to Swad many times, this review seemed like a must. My boyfriend and I have been for the lunch buffet countless times and always enjoy it immensely. The quality of food is amazing for a buffet, which usually tends to taste like it's been sitting there for hours. Swad somehow keeps it looking and tasting fresh. With the buffet you also get a basket of fresh-baked naan which is a nice touch. Overall, amazing buffet experience every single time.

We have also gone a few times for dinner. While the food is still the same amazing quality as the buffet, I am typically left feeling a little bit underwhelmed because the dinner prices seem a little steep. I understand that having a server makes a difference in the overall experience, but it just seems silly to me to pay more money for less variety and less food.

So my suggestion is go for the buffet and don't mess around with dinner. As a side note, this is also a great place to come if you're feeling hungover.
