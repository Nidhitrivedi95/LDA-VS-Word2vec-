KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Our plan was to grab Indian with another couple. Then we told a couple of fiends and next thing you know, 9 of us show up at 6:30 on a Saturday night. The staff was great and attentive, but the place was pretty empty. We ordered some appetizers and all were great. Especially the cauliflower and paneer. Side Note: always bring one vegetarian, it forces you to order things you normally wouldn't. 
I've eaten here before and what I liked was the variety of dishes from across India. Something for everyone. I had lamb, yummy. The wife had tandoori chicken that was cooked perfect. My son had chicken tikka masala. So good. 

Everything was heavily seasoned, which I like. Medium spicy was just that. A bit of heat but not "get me a Mango Lasi" hot. Good beer selection as well. 

Everyone had a great meal and we will enjoy the leftovers for lunch today. 

This is one of those places that many people drive by all the time and "want to try it". Give it a shot, be adventurous. You will not be disappointed.
