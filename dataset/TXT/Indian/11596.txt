ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Haven't been here in awhile but was craving Indian food.
I got the coriander potatoe dosa.
Good: good size, sambar nice
Bad: the filling is bit mushier not too many chunks of potatoes. I'm used to getting the coriander mixed with my potato but the coriander was like thin paste put on my dosa itself.  The unfortunate result was not crispy edges.  the dosa was still tasty to eat 
Sambar: I liked it. Was mild so if you want Indian hot, this is not the place. It taste homemade. But if you want an extra side of it as I found it wasn't enough, you are charged for it  $1 but I've been places where it's no extra charge.

Overall decent place for dosas. Can't say it's my favourite but it will do in a pinch
