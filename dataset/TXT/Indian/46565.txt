sUGlSS0AF2xPYFEjvKJbSA The food here is amazing!!  The best Indian food around.  We had the goat curry, mixed tandoori, mango shrimp and chicken Makhani.  The makhani was so good we had to get an extra order to go.  They make great drinks from scratch - mango margarita was so good!!
I was very impressed with the service as well.  I travel often and eat out a lot at high end restaurants and the service here was top notch. Very friendly and helpful.
