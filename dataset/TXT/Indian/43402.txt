RNbGxVLDu6SBQXkq-7MBow Well its a take out or catering place so don't go in thinking to sit down as there are no seats. Before I get down to food lets talk about other stuff.

My order - catering for 35 people!

Service level - restaurants like this I am not expecting much as its a take out joint. But the lady did verify the order.

Restaurant - the restaurant looked clean.

Parking - not a problem as its part of a plaza. 

The food isn't the top notch but some dishes are better than others and the pricing is a little easy on the pocket compared to other desi (South Asian) restaurants.

Veal Biryani (rice with veal meat) - 4/5
Alo Palak (spinach with potatoes) - 3/5
Tandori chicken pieces - 2.5/5 
Chicken korma - 3.5/5
Bagara baingan (Eggplant masala curry) - 2.5/5
Gajar halwa (desert) - 4.5/5 
Kheer (South Asian rice pudding) - 4.5/5 

you also get rita, green salad, Pita naan. This place also serves halal meat!
