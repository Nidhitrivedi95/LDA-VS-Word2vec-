DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew We called to order take out after reading what Norm & Philip had to say and...

First Navi on the phone was so kind & helpful.  He could not possibly be nicer! He is a 10!

The food was amazing... But much hotter than I expected.  I ordered medium.  Next time I will order mild:)))

Lamb, Chicken, cheese dish, basmati rice... It was all Amazing! 

Try out this little jewel of Indian Cuisine.  You will be delighted. They will likely end up with a strip hotel location. Any casino would be lucky to have such rich, luscious, Exotic food!
