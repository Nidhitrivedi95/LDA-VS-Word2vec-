ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I've been on an Indian food kick recently and have wanted to try this place for a while. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday and were surprised to see at least 6 groups of diners entering while we were eating. Not quite a hidden gem when everyone knows about it. We ended up getting paneer tikka, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan. I enjoyed the paneer tikka, but would not get it again. I ordered the spice level at a 6, and could not distinguish any heat at all. Ditto for my boyfriend, who also complained his chicken tikka masala was tough. The naan was the best part of the meal. Waiters were extremely attentive, nearly to the point of hovering. Overall, it wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't make a special trip back.
