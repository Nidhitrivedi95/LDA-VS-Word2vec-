kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g First off, I should have listened to the reviews...this is definitely an Indian restaurant that is catered to first time Indian food triers. Of course the flavor will be bland when using no butter/cream in Indian food. But it still tasted good, very light.
If I lived closed I would definitely come back for the happy hour. Which is REALLY good. A few bucks for small portions of different Indian cuisine = A+! We ordered from the happy hour to start - tofu REALLY good but only 3-4 pieces, 2 samosas yummy for not being fried and my bf got the 3 chicken wings, he said they were spicy. We both ordered from the create your entree section for our meal. I was wondering about the noodles which is really odd to see on an Indian menu. Luckily the waitress said under her breath that they are NOT good and then said after "wow I should really not have said that" I appreciaited it though! I got the brown rice, mixed vegetables and tikka masala. My bf got brown rice, lamb and tikka masala. The good thing is that you can eat the whole dish and not feel really bloated and full like regular indian food. But it was a little bland and did not taste like authentic indian food. It almost reminded me of the trader joe's indian food packs you can buy there. Overall I would visit this restaurant if you live close by and order from the happy hour menu.
