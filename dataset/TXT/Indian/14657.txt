CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ We went there last night and it empty, service was stretched, food was not very good at all. Naan was frozen mass produced not made in store, Samosa again were frozen mass produced. Water had moldy taste to it and business seems to be struggling to stay open.
   Lentil soup was ok but really only a few old carrots and I couldn't find a lentil, Salad is useless would rather have had some papadums, with some chutneys. Menu is incredibly limited portions were tiny and prices were high. Naan was rationed out one piece at a time. Waitress was coughing and not covering her mouth, silverware was gritty and all in all 35.00 for two mains and a bowl of rice, just drank the water.
  It is so sad when I see people keeping places open that should be closed, bring people in and charging more for less does now make for return customers, just makes a funny conversation ride home. All in all we should have left when we walked in , before you jump on me I am a chef and my husband is Indian.
