H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ This place can be very inconsistent. Quality of food can be anywhere from 2-5stars. They have a really good lunch special that come with a drink for $6-$7. I find that the quality of chicken is different in the lunch special compared to when you order the same dish outside of lunch. They don't clean the meat as thoroughly during lunch I think because of the volume, a lot of fatty pieces in the chilli chicken. I've tried most of their menu and found consistency in only a few items. Chilli chicken, any rice dish. Everything else is a coin flip.  Don't dine in, service is trash. All the workers seem unhappy.
