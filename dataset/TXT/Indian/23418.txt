gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Must say my review is a little biased. I'm from Houston and we are so spoiled with amazing Indian food. Unfortunately, this place is just average compare to what we get at home. We had Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Tikka, Lamb Vindaloo, Goat Biriyani, yellow dal, and all types of Naan. I think my favorite is the Chicken Tikka Masala. The Naans were fresh. Their staff is great and attentive.
