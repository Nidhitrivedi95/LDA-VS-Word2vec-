pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Horrific. From start to finish a travesty of a dining experience. Being referred to as guys, fellas, boys, gents and les gars by a waiter who is ten years younger than the youngest at table, ca fait mal. 

Being asked 'How about starting with some appys boys?' brought to mind the worst chain restaurants and this brand of overly familiar service persisted until he was too embarassed even to come to the table because the drinks and then the food took forever. 

The food: over priced, overwrought,  unimaginative, tepid and unfulfilling.

This place was so bad the hashtags on display on many of the surfaces in the dining room almost inspired three non-twitterers to open twitter accounts just to be able to trash the place.

If you live in St Henri spend the money on a cab, go up to Jean Talon, eat like a king, get in another cab to come home and still come out on top.
