TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Having previously lived for yrs in s california I've learned not to judge a restaurant by its neighborhood. This certainly applies with India Palace, as its Twain/Maryland neighborhood leaves everything to be desired. Yet this excellant little place has had me returning over & over for yrs.  Seems like they've never changed their chefs, as the top notch food quality and its uniqueness has not wavered at all.  Service, cleanliness and pleasantness of staff also should be praised.
