DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I love this place! I drive from Centennial Hills just to get some amazing food from them. Everything is amazing.. Butter Chicken and Malai Kofta Korma (vegetarian) are some of my favorites... Don't forget your veggie samosa or the mango lassi. Amazing. The food is always so fresh and perfect each time! The owner is also super friendly and they have excellent service! Make a point to visit them and get some yummy food :)
