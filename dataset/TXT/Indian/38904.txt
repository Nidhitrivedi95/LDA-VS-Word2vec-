OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Authentic Indian cuisine in Las Vegas was a big surprise! And it's a vegetarian's paradise...being an Indian vegetarian it's very difficult to find a good Indian Buffet where everything is perfect but this place was just awesome!
The Dal Bukhara was the best I've ever had so were Bhindi, Aloo Korma and paneer. And they had given us a huge Garlic Naan which was freshly made and Nice and crispy !
The owner is a very genuine guy and when we appreciated the food he brought the chef to let him enjoy the appreciation! It was my anniversary and our friends had planned a surprise cake which was well executed by the staff and that added to the moment to make it a memorable! My husband being non vegetarian asked me to add the non vegetarian food to was good !
