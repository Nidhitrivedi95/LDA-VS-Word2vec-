ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA This was my first visit to Saffron and I was impressed! 

My friend and I arrived a little after noon and the place wasn't crowded, we were seated immediately and our server was kind and attentive. 

The buffet offers a great variety of options! My favorites were the samosas, lamb meatballs and chicken tiki marsala....and let's not forget the yummy naan bread! The food was really good! Since I'm new to enjoying Indian food I liked being able to sample many different options and not being stuck with something I didn't like. Lucky for me everything here was great. 

I'm sure to be back again!
