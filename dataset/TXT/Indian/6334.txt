I was shocked at how tasteless everything was. We ordered the veg samosa special as a starter- too thick a dough with a filling that had no bold spice. Then Aloo Ghobi which although we liked that it wasn't greasy, was full of mushy waterlogged tasteless cauliflower. Butter chicken was super sweet- totally over the top and the dhal had great consistency, but again- just tasted the beans, no real spice in there. I don't get it- nearly a full house and the most boring indian food I have ever eaten. This white girl's home made indian food tastes way better.
