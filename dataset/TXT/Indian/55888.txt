xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w I called them at 11:00am on a Thursday and asked if I could order lunch for 10 to go, which is not something they normally do.  The waiter checked with the chef and they were able to accommodate me and it was ready by noon.  I left a huge tip and was so thankful that they were able to help me out.  I ordered saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, naan, and rice.  The people who ate the food said it was the best Indian they have had in the city.  I will defiantly be back.
