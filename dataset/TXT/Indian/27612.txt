Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg My wife and I were in the mood for Indian, and we had heard from a friend this was a very good restaurant. So, we tried it, and it didn't disappoint!

We started with samosas. Excellent, as they arrived very hot, and had a delightful cinnamon flavour to the crust.

Our main dishes were Gobi Matar Peneer Keema, and Chicken Sorpatel. The Gobi Matar Peneer Keema was an amazing vegetarian dish, that now is one of our favorite all-time Indian dishes. And, the Chicken Sorpatel was perfect, as it didn't have too much coconut that sometimes can overpower the dish.

Our waiter was the owner, the Head Chef, which we hadn't realized until we began ordering. He made the evening a more memorable experience, explaining each dish in detail, and where the spices and influences for each dish was from.

We have found our new Indian restaurant!
