DxbdfvNYPCyiLJDDPJK3Tg The price is great and staff are friendly. Seems like a family restaurant and the place itself is very spacious, great for parties or big groups. Their vegetable pakora and chill chicken are phenomenal, definitely recommend. They have lunch specials for $5.95 everyday, since I work in the area I'm loving this new place!
