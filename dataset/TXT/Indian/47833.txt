TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I had a hankering for Indian food and had been meaning to try India Palace. I grabbed a friend and we headed on our way. 

As others have said, the neighborhood is a bit sketchy. The restaurant is nice inside and looks recently renovated. The staff was extremely friendly and seated us right away. 

The food is good. Really good. They immediately brought us papadum and a few various sauces. We ordered some garlic naan (delicious) and the Bombay fish (decent).

We ordered chicken tikka masala and Reshami chicken along with two orders of basmati rice. I ordered the tikka masala as spicy as they make it. It was spicy but, I wanted tears and didn't get any. It was still delicious. It's the best Indian food I've had in Las Vegas during the 5 years I've lived here.

Great service, great atmosphere, and great food. Go!
