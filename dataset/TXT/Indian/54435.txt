vZu3xxlMQSqFngDgdFLfXg I am obsessed with their paneer! I've gone three times already this week, and there's always a different paneer of the day. The food is delicious, the naan is fresh and the prices are very affordable. The butter chicken is also quite tasty. Staff are also very friendly and helpful in navigating you through the menu.
