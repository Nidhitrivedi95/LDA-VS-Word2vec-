ZXMlmZgdzhEYWQgJKduSGA This is the top ranked restaurant bar none for Brossard (on another review site).

It does not disappoint on either food or service.
It's a family owned place that treats it's guests wonderfully.

It was my little sister's birthday and while we can eat Indian food anytime we want, it's normally the service that prevents us from doing it for special occasions. 

We had three table d'hôte ($15 lunch and $20 for dinner)
The butter chicken was very mild and creamy,  the lamb curry was very spicy (as requested) 

All the veggie dishes and naan were awesome.

I had the mixed grill plate that comes sizzling hot, various meats and awesome jumbo shrimp ($23 with small rice and salad).


Mahbub and family really made it a wonderful trip for us.

And it's only 10 minutes from downtown
