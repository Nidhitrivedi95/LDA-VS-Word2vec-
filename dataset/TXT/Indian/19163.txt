f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I went for weekday lunch buffet. It's not so tasty and very limited items.All times not are not like fresh made, chicken biryani was dry.
Less options for vegetarian folks.The owner is really and good hostility.
Suggestion for management please  change the chef or train him to make some flavor food.
