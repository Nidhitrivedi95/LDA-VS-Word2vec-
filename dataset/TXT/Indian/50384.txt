UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w I love Indian Food but realized today Little India provided me with my first authentic experience!

Anita at the front counter was super friendly and helped me order because I had no idea what I was doing!

This was, hands down, the best Indian cuisine I've ever had. The Chaat was incredible and special #1 was the perfect introduction to a meal that wasn't Tiika Masala. 

If you are vegetarian and looking for some adventurous, tasty, and healthy food this is the place to go!
