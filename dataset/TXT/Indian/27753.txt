iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw Well, what began as a lovely and relaxing meal ended a bit ridiculously. Turned away from our first choice, we headed to Babur for a civilized lunch on a cold Friday afternoon. The decor was minimalist and attractive, and the smells emanating from the kitchen were intoxicating--at least to those who were starving. The poppadum arrived--tasty--and we ordered a range of dishes, including the haryali kebabs, salad with tamarind dressing (delicious!), malai kofta, paneer korma, chicken saag, and peas pulao. While everything was tasty,  nothing was incredible, and the service lagged significantly. Another table was served before us, even though we had ordered before them, and when offered some additional rice, we were charged $5. Yes, that's right, $5 for a cup of cooked white rice. Ridiculous. When the bill came, we realized that we had spent a total of $13 on rice alone, and the total was over $90--with nothing but water to drink! That's an expensive lunch for three anywhere, but considering it was Indian cuisine only makes matters worse. We laughed, paid, and left--only too gladly. And it's too bad, because Babur could be good, with larger servings, lower prices, and an entirely new waitstaff. Alas.
