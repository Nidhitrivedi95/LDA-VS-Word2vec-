iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Best damn Indian burrito I've ever eaten. The lamb was off the chain! Great little spot for all your hunger needs. Super highly recommended, even if it may fall into the destination location category for you. Owner is one cool, laid back, chill, dude. Seems like he genuinely loves it when people enjoy his food. Check this spot out sooner than later.
