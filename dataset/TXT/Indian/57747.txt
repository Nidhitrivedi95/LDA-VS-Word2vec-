yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I've eaten lots of curry throughout my life.   This curry was just okay. 

The menu is massive and offers a lot of variety, for someone unfamiliar with the cuisine it's quite daunting.   Since I was trying out this restaurant for the first time I decided to try something I was very familiar with and ordered a shrimp masala.

The dish was seasoned heavily, like any Indian dish should be, but the flavors didn't really seem to balance out  very well, all of the seasonings tasted a bit off, and were a bit overbearing in a funny tasting way.  But alas, not bad by any means of the imagination.  I cleaned off the plate and would try it again.  The shrimp itself was wonderful, very fresh and well cooked. 
The garlic naan was to die for, it was one of the best naans I've ever had.  Cooked to perfection. 

Judging from other reviews, I'm not sure if we just came in on an off night or what, but the service was not good at all.  We were probably sitting for 15-20 minutes before someone came over and took our drink orders, and this was not on a busy night.  Our server didn't seem particularly happy to be there.  The food took a little while to come out, but I expect that when ordering more elaborate meals, and was not at all turned off by this.  

The restaurant has a little side-shop, which sells British and Indian goodies, which was delightful.  A definite plus.
