tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA While visiting PHX, got a craving for Indian and this place hit the spot.  A lot of buffets I have been to will have chicken tikka masala but not as many places will serve up lamb vindaloo which is my favorite.  I enjoyed both.  The lamb vindaloo could have been spicier but I just asked for some hot sauce to turn up the heat.  
The garlic naan was great.  A good selection.  Clean establishment.  Friendly and attentive service.  Great reasonable price.
