TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw We went there for lunch as I had read really good reviews. Its under new management and the owner is a nice lady. Very personable . 

Food was average. We ate the vegetarian part only and found it to be missing the Indian flare, so I docked a star. Also, the naan was not well cooked, so I docked another point.

The decor was very good and the place clean. One Indian restaurant where the restroom was spotless.
