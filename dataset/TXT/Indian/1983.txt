-z_DR7omzpcR__l7MbDu0A The staff is awesome! Attentive and great service. I've tried the weekend buffet, the two things that stood out are ginger chicken and double ka meetha. Also tried the chicken biryani on a weekday night and I'd strongly recommend it for all those who love the authentic flavor of the biryani. This place is a great addition to the Mayfield area.
