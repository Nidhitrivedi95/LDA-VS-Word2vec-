jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Okay so I've tried a new Indian place every other week here in Las Vegas off and on for about 6 months. Most of them didn't even have buttered chicken or Naan!! This place though, amazing Stuffed Naan with yogurt dip, then the lamb vindaloo was so delicious and spicy( they ask you how hott you want it). I was really amazed how big their menu was so many dishes to try and a really great atmosphere being that this place is on the second floor overlooking the airport. Just for myself I spent about 30 dollars on my meal Naan vindaloo and Taj Mahal beer but they do have a 10 dollar buffet for peeps that don't wanna spend a lot. Bottom line you want some outstanding authentic Indian food without taking a long international flight or dating an Indian girl and service to match GO TO PURE INDIAN CUISINE!!! I will post pictures next visit unfortunately I ate it all too fast okay had lunch and dinner here in the same day dinner butter chicken cheese naan so amazing and served enough for five but I ate it all soooooo good
