4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw WAY too much vegetable oil in the curry & the chicken was like rubber. The dish came out rather tepid as well (not hot thru). Even the basmati rice was greasy and seemed rather old. The curry set me back $11 plus $3 for the rice. Also, I asked for a cup of water, was brought a bottle of water and was charged for it (this left a bad taste in my now oily mouth). There was nobody in the place. Still waiting on the check, which is giving me ample time to write this. Very disappointed, as this is the closest Indian food to my house. Won't be back. Bummer.
