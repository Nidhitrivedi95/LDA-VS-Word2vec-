iJfS02AOptwkaWD-vOVRew Quite an interesting experience, unlike almost all Indian & Pakistani places I've been to in my life, this was pretty much the only one where food was plated in such a way as to evoke Top Chef. The food came on (square I think) plates rather than in dishes and the presentation was excellent. The food was good, not quite what I was used to but ok. Those of you without traditional desi tastes will be more pleased I think but that's just my opinion. We ordered the tandoori platter and for the first time it came on plates, not sizzling. We asked about that and it seems to be a cost and ease decision, just FYI if that's your favorite. I would recommend the lentil soup and pappadums most. The two are filling enough for a meal. What made the largest and best impression though was the courtesy of the owner's son - politeness, friendliness, response time - can't be beat.
