GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA So, the other day my friend and I wanted to go and have Cantonese food down the street from this place, but they were closed for an ASU welcome back dinner; wack!! So, I scrammed to find a yummy place last minute on Yelp which was in the area, and Curry Corner popped up.

I am very happy that he and I went to this place after all. Since I am doing a physical and spiritual cleanse at this time and cannot eat meat, dairy, processed sugar, sweets, breads/white flour products, this place made me happy. 

I had their veggie combination and was blown away by how well delectable they can make chic peas and spinach taste with their spices and techniques. 

I am going back when I can eat meat and bread and will enjoy their fish/chicken dishes and supposedly amazing naan.

I am a fan!

Love,
