5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ The food is SURPRISINGLY excellent!! 
We got Groupon. 

** Vegetable Korma 
The texture and flavor are just right to the point. 
We ordered medium spicy. 

** Chicken Masala   
Spicy level 4 out of 5. Really Knicks in the spice level. Chicken is juice, which means the dish is freshly made (unlike some other places which might recycle their lunch buffet CM to dinner). 

** Garlic Naan
Perfect texture. Not too dry. 

Mango lazi is good too. 

We have tried many Indian restaurants in both coasts. This one by far has the best food. Check in on Yelp and get a free appetizer. 

Way to go Pari for the excellent food.
