sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I've been haunting these digs for the past 8 or so years, and I have to say I'm definitely a fan. This place visually-speaking is nothing on the inside: a few scattered tables, and you literally walk in to their entire kitchen area. One person making and pressing fresh roti through a machine, one chopping onions, one stirring the pot, and a no-nonsense feel on the interior, with a basic menu at the front. I actually like being able to see what goes on in that magical kitchen.. 

It's a really delicious twist to traditional roti in that it's east indian curries that fill the inside of these delectable delights. The roti/bread itself is also perfect - it's not greasy or too thick, but a perfect texture to house wonderful concoctions on the inside.. 

This place is a complete Queen West landmark, and I would reco if ordering out, to call ahead so you won't have to wait for them to make your fresh roti which can take 10-15 mins a pop... My personal fave has always been the chicken roti (I am a total creature of habit when I love something) and tend to order it medium-spicy. Also adding eggplant to the mix can be quite delicious.. but you'll be spending about $2-$3 more per roti on that note.. 

Over the years, I have found the rotis to definitely get smaller (I am a girl who can EAT!), and spicier.. I've cut down from hot to medium, and I do find that the rotis don't fill the takeout pans as much as they used to, but all in all, still damn delicious. You also know a place is damn good when it's can sustain itself by only being open Mondays-Fridays only. Booyah. 'Nuff said.
