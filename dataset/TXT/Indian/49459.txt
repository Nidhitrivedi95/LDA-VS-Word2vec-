tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I've eaten at India Oven more times than I can count; the servers who seat us are kind, gracious and funny, especially now that I know them well enough to joke around. The naan is always piping hot, perfectly crisp and soft/chewy (it is too good, according to my daughter who always eats too much of it, LOL) 

I always look forward to the lassi and tea that is included with my meal, something I very much appreciate about their buffet. Beer, including Indian options, are available as well.

All of the dishes are delicious; they have a nice balance of chicken, lamb, paneer and vegetarian options. Mint chutney, tamarind sauce, raita condiments included...yum. 

Go, enjoy the food and try not to eat too much. You'll be glad you went.
