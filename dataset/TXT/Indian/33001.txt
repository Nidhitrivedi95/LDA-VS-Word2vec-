llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg I went for dinner last night with three of my family members. We ordered the chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, shrimp curry and a bunch of appetizers and desserts. Everything tasted absolutely divine. I highly recommend the mango lassi too.

I'm taking one star away for the clumsy service. They at first brought out fish curry instead of shrimp curry. They forgot to bring our raita and poori until we reminded them well into our dinner. The server spilled my tea on the table and in the end, they ran our credit card for someone else's check. 

They were very polite and quick to remedy all of these problems, but it was a bit much. Perhaps the server was having a bad night? Nevertheless, I will be back!
