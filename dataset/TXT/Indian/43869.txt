RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I heard my colleagues praising this place for its famous Tikkas and shish .Yesterday was my first time and I was surprised to see that they have a large number of vegetarian options as well . I ordered combo sizzler with Nan !!! And it was just yummy and delicious ! So glad that I found grilled vegetables sizzler with lentils and chick peas !! Portion size was so generous and I had to box part of my delicious sizzler !!
