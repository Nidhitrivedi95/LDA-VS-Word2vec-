pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA We went for dinner. It was crowded even on a Tuesday night at 9 pm. I wanted to get dosa but discovered that they had a dinner buffet which includes dosas. They also had a wide spread of dishes like sambhar, biryani, fish, chicken, idlis and medu vadas. They had quite a few dessert options as well including ice cream, kheer, fruits. The service was great. They gave us extra chutney and raita as the buffet had run out. It just took a bit of time getting our bill. Definitely a place worth visiting.
