JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Had dinner at Aroma Indian Cuisine last night and was by far the best food my husband and I have had since moving to CLT 6 months ago. We ordered the following and it was enough for 2 adults with extra to bring home: 

Lamb Roganjosh (w/rice)
Chicken Tikka Kabob
Garlic Naan Bread

We definitely recommend the Lamb Roganjosh with the Naan bread for dipping. Tasty flavors and delicious! The staff was kind and very attentive too. We will be frequent regulars in the future. Thank you for the wonderful experience AIC!
