TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We had a special deal for this place while visiting Vegas so we tried it. Absolutely no doubt some of the best Indian food we have ever eaten. The only disadvantage to this restaurant is that it is way off the strip and difficult to get to unless you walk a mile or take a cab. The restaurant itself is extremely clean the service is excellent and the food is awesome. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you want Indian food while you were in Vegas however just expect to pay for transportation unless you have your own car. The rice is perfect the naan bread was absolutely delicious and we shared a vegetable korma dish that was absolutely divine. If you want inexpensive after dinner cocktails or drinks go to the bar right next door to the restaurant we were able to get five drinks for less than 10 bucks. The prices of this restaurant are very reasonable considering the high quality of food.
