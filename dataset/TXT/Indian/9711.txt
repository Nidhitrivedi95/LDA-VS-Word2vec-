8ZcZvOcUZ3nT0Q5LvHwQEA Oh what sadness the day that this restaurant decided to move their business to the North Scottsdale branch.

We always used to order Indian food from Indian paradise Chandler because they made delicious naan, basmati rice and all things Indian curry. For what it's worth - go check out the Scottsdale branch if you are in the area.

I have yet to go but I promised myself that I will put in a good word for this restaurant once I open my Yelp account.

Living in Chandler I know that I will be going to the Scottsdale branch as soon as I have reason to go in that direction.
