We had Karamura Paper Masala Dosa, stuffed with mashed potato, dusted with spices, and yes... it's really "large". The Dosa was prepared with perfection... not greasy or oily but made nicely crispy!! Had Kadai Paneer, full of spices and aroma.

And must mention... they have excellent customer service, and the place is much larger than it looks from outside.
