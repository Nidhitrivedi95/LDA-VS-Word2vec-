TAnzFr9NixvCbvUdJMWL5Q I have been waiting for this place to open in the valley and it is worth the wait. I have tried biryani in all the Indian restaurants in the valley. This is by far the most decent biryani in phoenix. The gravy that comes with the biryani was right on. That's how you know they are here to stay for a long time.
