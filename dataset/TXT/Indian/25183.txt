hDaookbWWFR3bEm-1_orrw I had heard about this restaurant from a co-worker, and I don't often take the time to review, but I am all about helping a new restaurant.  I thought the food was delicious and a welcome change to the boring chains all over Glendale. I loved the fact that it was a buffet, so I could taste all of the different options. The naan was great, and to top it all off, I had the most delicious Indian coffee (just creamy, frothy coffee)at the end. The only drawback for me was how far it is from my house. But I am certain we will make the trip again.
