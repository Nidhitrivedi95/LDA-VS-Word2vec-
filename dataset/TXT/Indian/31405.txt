ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw Ordered for delivery using TasteAway because they had a crazy good deal. Food I received was abysmal. 4 pieces of floating bone with tough meat and tendon was what I received in my 2 lamb dishes, and the butter chicken dish had a floating chicken drumstick in it with a few other pieces of fatty, tendon-y chicken. Also the take-out containers were under-filled and some arrives lukewarm. Worst $40 I've ever spent on food. So disappointed. And I love Indian food..
