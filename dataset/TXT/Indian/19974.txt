FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Came here for an IYE! Great time meeting new people!

2014 was the year I became a fan of Indian and Thai curry so when I saw Maharani was on the menu for a IYE, I was all for it. 

Like many have pointed out, wait staff seems to the odd man out. I wouldn't say they were rude but maybe a bit... uninterested?? I am not sure if that is the correct word. Hard to explain. They were very much about getting straight to the business. More like "hurry up and order" It was just odd. Some people weigh service more heavily than others. For me, I am very much in the middle unless the staff is just plain rude. Again, the staff wasn't rude but they could work on being more open and inviting to diners. 

Curry and naan was plentiful. So much to choose from. I think I speak for all of those who attended the IYE when I say, it was hard to make an entree choice. There were several curries that peaked my interested. I finally settled on Chicken Vindaloo.

OK. I am extremely picky about chicken. I do not eat dark meat. Only chicken breast. It was my mistake for not asking what part of the chicken is used in their chicken curries. To my discovery, my curry used both dark and white meat. Ehhhhhggg!! I ended up picking out the dark meat. It wasn't that big of a deal but just still sucks. Next time, I will ask questions. The other curry places I frequent uses white meat. I guess I became accustom to this too quickly.

I do prefer Dhaba and Haveli over Maharani. To me, the other two complete the package of what I like about eating curry including atmosphere. I won't rule out ever dining here again however if I am in the area and wanting some curry.
