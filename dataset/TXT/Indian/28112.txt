iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Honestly I don't know if it was because I ordered this through Uber-Eats and I might have fucked up on my burrito order but this is what I ordered:

Chicken Makhani Burrito - Has some flavor but for some reason it was lacking substance. I just felt like I was eating rice and chicken wrapped in a tortilla. 

Masala Fries - These were salty as fuck. My mouth felt like how a snail would feel if you put salt on it...dying...it's like overly salted garlic fries at a baseball game....

I really wanted to like this place and I was hyped about it but it fell short of my expectations....I will prob try it out again sometime this year and pyshically go to the location but for now it's a 3/5.....
