rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I ordered through ubereats tonight and couldn't have been more impressed by the food. While it is a bit pricey it is definitely worth it - the string chaat is a salad dreams are made of and the rose dessert is light and delicious! Seriously check this place out for innovative, delicious dishes that you will come to crave!
