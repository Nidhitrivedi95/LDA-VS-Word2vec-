9q8JSsHC5lR6Hh16W_5ggg Worst experience from start to finish... 

I went here for dinner with one of my friends and when we first walked in, the environment looked very nice; the restaurant was about half full.  The staff completely ignored us, they bluntly walked past us instead of seating us or even telling us we will be seated in a few mins. After the wait to be seated, it took them quite some time to take our order.

After the order was taken, the wait began! We received our app after about 10 mins but we sat at that table for another 20 mins waiting for our drink order and our entree. As we waited, we noticed people who came in after us were being served before us. After half an hour in the restaurant with no meal, I went to pay my bill for my app that they brought out and the owner argued with me before letting me pay my bill.

He claims that just because I didn't get my drink after half an hour its no excuse for me to leave. After I repeatedly insisted to let me pay my bill for my app, he finally let me pay my bill.

I can only judge the food from the app I received, it was way over spiced. I have been to MANY Hakka places but this one goes down as the worst in my books.
