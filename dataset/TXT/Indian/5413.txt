2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw 5 for $1 samosas! Great food, great meals and rock bottom prices.

The line is always out the door and this is a super long restaurant and that says a lot.

And given the fact that the area has many times of similar cuisine which have low prices and high quality, the fact that people come her says a lot.

Whenever I am in the area I spend maybe $25 or $30 and that gets me and the GF food for days! 

If you are ever in the area you MUST give it a shot!
