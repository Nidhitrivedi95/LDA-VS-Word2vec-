Qiu1W1BlKg6JdefD1jPZqw Good place for take out Indian (Punjabi) food. Conveniently located if you live in the area. Price isn't bad. I usually just get naan and a couple curries. Order the naan 10 min ahead of time because they make it fresh. They have 6 or 7 curries ready to pick from when you get there.
