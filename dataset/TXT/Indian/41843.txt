QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Ordered an eggless cake from their 'bakery' section- and it was awesome. We wanted the cake to be of a normal design without too much flowery stuff- and it was perfect - not too ordinary and not too designy. Tasted awesome too. I would have loved not to interact with those part time waiters who turn up on weekends to help. They have no clue what they are talking about and sound as they are the CEOs of some IT companies who happened to do some 'welfare' activity. He took his own sweet time to pack the cake- didnt know where the boxes were, etc.
