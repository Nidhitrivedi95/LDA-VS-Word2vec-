TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw It was not too long ago that I tried this spot for the first time. Waiter could've been more enthusiastic and less rushing, it wasn't that busy for dinner. Main courses were served in a tiny bowl. I got the variety platter. Sauce was filling as usual and good but the dishes skimped on the meat, which was disappointing because the bowl was already small. I wish the price could've been more proportional to the amount of each dish served. I'll try other Indian spots.
