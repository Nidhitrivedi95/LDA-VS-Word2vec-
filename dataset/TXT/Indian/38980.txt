OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g OMG!!  This was by far our best experience ever. Growing up on Indian food this reminded me of why I love it so much and I was so glad my husband loved it as well(it was his first time). Our waiter Shawn was so amazing and personable and the owner Bashaan was very tentive and made sure we enjoyed our food and we were well taken cared of. They both suggested some amazing recommendations from the menu and they were spot on delicious. The Butter Chicken Royale and Manchow vegetarian soup was amazing but what sold me was the Lamb. Will be returning for sure.
