auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Very sad to write this review. I have been eating at Taj Palace for 3/4 years now. I was a big net promoter of theirs however on Sunday I ordered masala and rice pilau (something I always order) and the rice looked weird, different color to the typical yellow and all the nuts were burnt black.  How do you send this out surely you see!

Yesterday I ordered again almost on auto pilot as I eat their so often and it got worse the rice again was weird, mushy and filled full of char burnt ingredients nuts Etc.  The worse part is the curry was very weird, heated up it would not join and settle. The oil was separating, representing 30%. The consistency was way off and the food looked so bad I couldn't even try to eat it. 

IMO the chef must have left and a server picked up the reins.

Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. There will not be a third!

To send this food out demonstrates the lack of quality control, I can no longer trust Taj Palace to cook and deliver food.
