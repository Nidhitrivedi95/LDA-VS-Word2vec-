ecid5p4yhTEJbWEJTuzX3Q I've only had the curry poutine but I still think I am qualified to review the restaurant. As a vegetarian, I'm not too fond of most poutine because the sauce is very salty. The cury poutine, however, replaces the sometimes bland sauce with a delicious and spicy curry. The fries and cheese are both good, but the star is far and away the sauce. If you don't really like curry or if you don't really like poutine or if you love both, you'll enjoy the curry poutine. It is served in its own green frying pan, which is a nice touch.
