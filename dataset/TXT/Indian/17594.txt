DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ I love Sweet India! Been coming by this place for nearly 20 years!!! I grew up on their samosas, puri's, burfi's, and gulab jamins. Tons of memories! At $7/lb for most of their sweets, they are cheaper than some of the other establishments like Kwality Sweets (near Steeles/Airport Road). Yes, the interior is simplistic as M.K. Gandhi would have liked it, but the food is rich with colour and taste. Go for the samosas (at ~70 cents a piece, they are a steal!) and you have to try their puri's with channa, then leave with your taste buds satisfied with something sweet. Oh Sweet India, I lurve thee.
