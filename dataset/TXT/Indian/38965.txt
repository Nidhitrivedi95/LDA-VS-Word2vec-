OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Come here for GREAT Indian street food! Not only do they have pani puri (puff pastry filled with potato and chutney water) and bhel (rice puffs with finely chopped veggies and tamarind sauce) but they have Vodka Pani Puri!!!  Lots of options for vegetarian and meat eaters. We ended the meal with paan shots, which is great way to top it off.  Great artisanal cocktail menu as well.  Nice break from the strip.
