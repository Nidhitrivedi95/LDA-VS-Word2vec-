7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ Being from India, we eat Indian food several times a week both at home and outside the house.  Persi's has a great reputation and they didnt let down on our visit. Good food for a lunch buffet overall.  The selection is not big but it was all pretty good.  My favorite was the chicken tikka masala with white rice.  The chicken biryani was also good but it was a bit on the spicy side.  Intense flavors are good but the heat was a bit overbearing.  The desserts lacked as they only had gulab jumun and fresh fruit.  It was good but I was left wanting something more.
