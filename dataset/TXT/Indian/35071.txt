The rice is fluffy, long-grain basmati, seasoned with saffron and biryani masala, and shockingly, no turmeric.  It is the best I've had anywhere.  

The place is a dive in a strip mall (why are these always the best places to eat?!).  Horrible decor, with only 8 or so tables, it's at least clean.  

Their curries are amazing, mostly Pakistani style, and very spicy.  The seekh kabaab karahi (sic) was probably the spiciest curry I've ever had, and I absolutely love spicy food. Their butter chicken is superb, thick and creamy with a slightly sweet note.  The chicken tikka masala is loaded with onion and chunky green peppers in a thick tomato gravy, it's a winner.  

I'm working my way through the curry list, but everything I've had has been excellent.  I heartily recommend this to lovers of Indian and Pakistani cuisine, you will not be disappointed.  Just stick with take-out, or ignore the pedestrian decor, which won't be hard once you start eating.

My rating might have been a 5, but the sit-down service isn't great, and they often bring me a small garden salad before my meal and while this is a nice gesture, it's not very fresh and has no dressing with or on it.  No thanks to the plain limp lettuce!
