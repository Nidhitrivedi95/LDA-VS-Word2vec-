pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA Went there after along time and they have done a soft transformation. The menu might be more or less the same but I feel the food quality has improved greatly. Had the veg soups which was great as always. I have never been dissapointed by their soups. Even their mutton soup is great in flavor, even though I wish there was more meat in it. Talking about Mutton, I feel these guys make justice to it out of all the places available in Toronto (including all Tamil take out restaurants in Scarborough) They have a good variety of mutton dishes and they all taste great! The portion size is decent and the flavour is amazing. I also had their dosas which  was good. The tomato chutney could have been better in my opinion (The Saravanabhavan one is the best so far). Their seafood selection is also pretty good. I should also mention that their service was pretty good. Even though they didn't have a table for us when we went in, within 10 minutes they organised something for us. Nights are usually very busy especially in the weekends where Lunch time would be busy as well. But I am liking the improved version. Would be great if the Kaima Idly and other south indian dishes like pongal, upma, kool, appam are included in the menu.
