z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Many consider Bombay Grille the best Indian restaurant in town (not saying much), but I have to disagree.  If this place was in NYC, San Francisco, LA, or any other big city with a larger Indian demographic, it would not succeed (IMHO).  But in a city with limited options for Indian cuisine, many people like it because they don't know any better.  Or they eat at B.G. because there's really not a lot of better options.

Bombay Grille is more authentic than most Indian joints around town, but definitely isn't "the real deal".  If this place was in a big city I'd give it one star.  But everything is relative in life so I'll give em two.
