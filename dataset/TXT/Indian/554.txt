-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g I could not wait to get the check and leave. What kind of Indian Buffet doesn't have Tandoori chicken?  This one... first and last time eating here. The food was poorly presented and mediocre at best. The wait staff were pensive and difficult to understand. The overall dining experience was most unsatisfying. I highly recommend NOT going there. Uggh... I don't know who in the hell would give this place 5 stars. This place sucks...
