Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Went to Tamba while visiting Vegas. Honestly, we found this place because we had a coupon from the Entertainment Book. We ended up going twice.

Our first dinner there was on Sunday night - we fell in love with the place. The waiters were friendly and helpful. We were given a second dessert for free because we were told we HAD TO try that one too. We were so happy that we did. My first visit to Tamba - food, service, perks - gets 5 STARS.

We went back to Tamba a few days later with a friend. The food was still good, but seemed saltier than Sunday. We had ordered different dishes so not sure if the saltiness was just due to our order. We still enjoyed the food and the service was good, but a little off on the timing. Barely touched appetizer before main course came out. One of the servers seemed annoyed by the use of the coupon, but otherwise, it was still good. Second visit: 3 STARS.
