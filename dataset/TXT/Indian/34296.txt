MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ Al Hamra is a nice Indian food restaurant.  That sounds like a pretty basic statement but that's kind of the point.  My experience was not remotely bad nor was it remarkable.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly and I would give it four stars if it wasn't for the fact that one of the dishes we ordered was a lamb dish that was overcooked, but I took them home for leftovers and it was oddly better.  

We got Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and Lamb chops.  Chicken Tikka was exactly as I hoped and the Garlic Naan was perfect.  It was flavorful and on par with what Ive had at other establishments closer to home.   I wouldn't order the lamb chops again but id order curry dishes without any hesitation and be confident that they are good.  The lamb chops however as i said previously were overcooked.  

If you are in the area than I would recommend trying it out.  Its a great looking place with great staff but unfortunately is hidden in the mastros complex so deep that its more word of mouth than anything else.  You certainly wouldn't drive by and know its there.  It is however absolutely worth trying if you have a craving for Indian food.
