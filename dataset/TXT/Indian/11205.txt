abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg I went to give a try in Rickshaw based on reviews, and ordered Khao Shay and Spiced Coconut Chicken. they were tasted yummy with coconut flavour and south Asian spices, but personally I felt the chef added a little bit more salt in the Khao Shay (salt also gives special taste to it in a good way). when the waiter asked how much I like the food, I told him how I felt. surprisingly, he took the matter seriously, talked to the kitchen at once, and insisted to give our table a free dessert. I will say their service is SOO great! me and my friend have a really nice experience here:)
