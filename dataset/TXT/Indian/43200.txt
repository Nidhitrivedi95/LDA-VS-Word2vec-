Rk82QHtWp268GM93qWj3dQ My wife and I went there last night for dinner. I ordered the chicken dosa and had to wait 30 minutes until it was done, my wife was already finished with her dinner by the time my food came out. The chicken was fatty and not much of a portion.  My wife got the chicken tiki Marsala which has always been good. 
The service was awful, no waiter had been assigned to our table and we had to ask for refills and even where my food was without a response from 3 waiters. Overall we were on the restaurant for 2 hours. I have decided I would not go back based on the service we received last night.
