SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg Concept is good based on chipotle , but the food  has no flavor . Spice level is zero or can say suited to American taste buds .chipotle or Italian food has more flavors .
In the name of street food they just hav 2 options CINNAMON bhelpuri (I guess Americanized ) and  samosa chat  only 
Again the chutneys r watery  , salt less  and flavorless 
 Paneer tikka  was more like paneer cooked in tomato and yogurt 
A small  bhelpuri cup for $3.50  pricey food huh ! 
Coming to Indian place and getting pita bread as naan and wheat tortilla as roti  was big turnoff 
 The portions r small , so If ordering rice bowl  for 1 person than be prepared to order something else or u can remain hungry .

In an all I was here to have some street food And all I got was cinnamon flavored bhelpuri  and  choley chawal .

Next time I'll prefer going to chipotle rather going to bland indian food .
For me it's a big NO NO
