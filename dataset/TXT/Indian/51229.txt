utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw I brought my granddaughter here for her birthday. She had never tried Indian food before. This experience was wonderful. The service was friendly and helpful for a novice in ordering. we were recommended a less spicy option for the young lady (she is 9) and regretted not getting the medium spice. 
I would love to know how they make the Chicken 65 and Tandoori Chicken. Do you share the recipes?
