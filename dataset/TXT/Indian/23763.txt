gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My boyfriend and I came here to try something new and let me tell you, I was kind of skeptical about it at first. But I am so happy we decided to give this place a try. This was the first time we had real authentic Indian food.

We ordered one of the Thali specials: Mount Everest India's Cuisine Special. Which was a platter of mixed appetizer, papadam (Indian chips) chicken tikka masala, dal makhani, palak panner, lamb curry, chicken tikka (4pcs), rice, naan, raita. When the platter came out, I honestly didn't know which was what, but everything was SO good!

We also had the Tandoori Chicken. This was my favorite dish we ordered. It was chicken baked in a clay oven, marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger, herbs, and spices on an onion and bell pepper bed on a skillet. All the dishes were so flavorful from the spices. And the portions were huge! We ordered a lot for just us two and only spent $43. But we had yummy leftovers to take home. :)

Service was quick and friendly; always kept our waters full. They also have an all you can eat lunch buffet. Will be returning.
