Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg If I could give this place 10 stars I would. The service was absolutely amazing.  This was my second time eating Indian food, both times in Toronto.  The night before, we went to Babur, while the food there was good, the service was horrible.  We had long conversations with two waiters here at Trimurti, both of them were so great to talk to.  
We started off with the veggie samosas which had the perfect amount of spice.  I don't remember the name of the dishes my boyfriend and I ordered but the chicken in both dishes was perfect, so I would imagine any dish here would be just as amazing.  We got a side order of naan and basmati rice which perfectly complemented our food.  
The price of the food was less than Babur and way better.  This place was extremely welcoming and we will definitely be back if we return to Toronto.
