Rather than go with pre-selected Lunch Special Combo's, we chose off the regular menu and ordered enough to share.  The Garlic Naan was the best I've ever had.  The Samosa's were flavorful and delicious - perfect way to start the meal.  We shared the Chicken Tikka Masala (didn't try this but my 3 companions loved it), Mattar Paneer (cubed farmer's cheese and peas in a delicious gravy), Beghan Barta (baked eggplant with onions and tomatoes with spices), and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower and potatoes baked with herbs and spices).  All the flavors were rich and wonderful.  

My favorite was the cheese and peas, followed by the baked eggplant.  I love that Indian food has so many flavorful vegetarian options.  It was a fantastically satisfying lunch.
