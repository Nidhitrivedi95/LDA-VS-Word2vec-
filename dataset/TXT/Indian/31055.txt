kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I have been a long-time customer of the lunch buffet (take out). And after today, no longer. 

The food has been deteriorating in quality lately. The vegetable dishes are now made with lesser quality ingredients, and with  less care in preparation. The dishes are bland with little flavor. 

Very disappointing. Used to be a good reasonably priced lunch. No longer
