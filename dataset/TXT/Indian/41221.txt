PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ The customer service at this place is terrible. We were there with a group of friends for a birthday and waiting upon the rest of our group to arrive and while waiting one of the waitresses was hassling us to get food as they were closing at 10pm. We arrived at 8pm but we didnt want to get started without the rest of our group. When our group arrived, the same waitress, I believe her name was Kiran was hassling our group and rushing us to go and get food, and we ended up getting food eventually. The food was decent, but the service here was really not. We had to keep asking for water and at the end, when it came time to pay they gave us one bill for the entire group when we specifically asked for seperate bills. The waitress spazzed out at as and started arguing with us saying that we told her we wanted one bill when we NEVER said that and then at the end was taking our payment with a horrible attitude. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Theres many other places you can go for better indian food and will be able to receive better service than this place. This place is an absolute disappointment.
