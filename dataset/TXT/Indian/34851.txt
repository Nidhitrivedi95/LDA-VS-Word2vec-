Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg No spice , no flavor. Don't waste money on this place . It used to be a good place with a lot of crowd like 2-3 years back , but now the place is super empty and you won't find more than 3 tables filled with people.

They don't add any spice , nor do they add any salt and you just have to throw all the food eventually. 

There is a shake shack close by, try the veggie burger with portabella mushrooms.
