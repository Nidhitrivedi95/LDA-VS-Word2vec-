FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Nice Pakoras and nice people! I ate the lunch buffet there one sunday on my way through town, and three hours later i realized I left my jacket. I panicked, called them right away, and asked if i could send a pre-paid priority mail envelope to them for returning it. They were very nice, and i got my jacket back five days later. Whew, and thanks, Swagat!
