tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Really great Indian buffet and even better service. The food is great quality, good selection, and fast service. The first time I visited this restaurant my partner and I were surprised at how cheap it was. A place this good and we were expecting to pay a lot more. If you want to try something different order off the menu. Also boasts a full bar at very favorable prices. Give this place a shot, especially if you haven't had Indian food before.
