KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I've been coming to this place ever since it opened - 4 years or so. I LOVE the food, atmosphere, and the staff is the best! Happy, the owner, cares about his product and makes sure all of the customers are well taken care of.  The bar is awesome for HH. Just writing this review makes me hungry. I'll probably stop by tonight!

PS - The BS reports of food poisoning make me angry. Their Food Safety score is always an A. They proudly display their inspection reports right at the front entrance (its also public record). If you can't handle spicy food, just let them know when ordering. They will make sure it is mild.
