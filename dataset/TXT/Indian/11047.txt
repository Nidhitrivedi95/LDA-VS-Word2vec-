a8o8OMGhWg4JwbuMMnVOHQ Excellent tasting gourmet food. I came here on a weekday at 6 p.m. That place was dead. 

We ordered a beet salad and it was enough to serve three. Good thing we shared it anyways. We ordered Tikka Kabab. It was seasoned perfectly, not very spicy at all. The tomato chutney condiment was also very tasty. 

The menu is vast. The price is a little more than average ($50 for two people for just a  shared appetizer and 2  dinner kabob dinners. No drinks, no desserts)

I would totally eat here again.
