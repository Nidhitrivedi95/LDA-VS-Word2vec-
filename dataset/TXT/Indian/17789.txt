E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw This restaurant is a great deal for dinner! For two entrees and an appetizer, the check was about $26, which is pretty good for two people -- and we were stuffed. The food is delicious, the portions are decent, our glasses were always filled with water, and service was prompt.

Only two negatives, no liquor license and the atmosphere is a bit lacking. It was a little too loud and a little too crowded, but it's a good place for casual dining.
