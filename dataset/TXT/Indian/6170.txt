3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA This place got great reviews so I figured I would try it. Well, not going back. 2 stars for the way it looked. The food all had the same spice level. The rice, both of them were really dry. The buffet is in one location that makes for poor circulation of people. Crowded, a lot of screaming children. Thanks but no thanks.
