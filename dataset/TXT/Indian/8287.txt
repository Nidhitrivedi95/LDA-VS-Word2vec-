7m8MoWuudrxU98fEw7iBIw My family is south Indian. I've lived in south India. I think this place is great! I would have given 5 stars if it was closer to campus.

The location is pretty far from campus but well worth the drive (hopefully you have access to a car).  The interior is simple and unassuming but, let's be honest, I'm going there for the food.

I ordered the onion pakkoda (crispy fried onions and spices) as an appetizer and it was amazing!! Exactly how I like it - fresh and crispy. They were also fairly generous with the size of the helping so I was filled with thanksgiving, delight, and delicious food. It also set a good tone for the rest of the meal.

My friend and I ordered some dosas (crispy indian "pancakes"). I got a masala dosa and he got an onion dosa and a plain dosa. His dosas seemed very crispy and he really enjoyed them. My dosa was pretty good as well but a little soft on the inside. This is pretty common though since there is food on the inside. The sambar and chutneys (sauces for dosas) were also pretty good.

I thought I'd be adventurous and ordered some parotta (round indian bread). It's a special food I remember eating when I was living in India. When the parotta's came out, I was filled with glee to see that they were exactly as I remembered them. Awesome!

In summary: great food. good price. you should eat there.
