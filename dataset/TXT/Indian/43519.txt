rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Love this cozy, unassuming little place. A relaxing quite hangout and friendly staff. But most importantly, one of the best Indian place in the East Coast. Layers of flavored but not drenched in grease. Lots of traditional favorites and some Indo-Chinese dishes. Don't hesitate to try their traditional desserts and cakes....a delicious finish to a good meal.
