jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg Haldi is delicious. Simply delicious. I pick up food for the week sometimes just so I can look forward to the currys in my fridge.
The Lamb Rogan Josh has that after kick of mild heat and heavy spice I love.
The Saag Paneer isn't too heavy.

The service staff has a knack for knowing when to be there and when not.

Haldi's could do 2 things to get my rating to a 5.
1. Make the dining area more intimate. Maybe some booths. It's noisy for my comfort.
2. Offer riced cauliflower instead of regular rice. I'd pay extra for this substitution and it would help me eat here Much more often. My paleo eating friends would agree!
