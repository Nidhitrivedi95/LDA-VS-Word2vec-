gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw I'm not an Indian foodie, even though one of my best friends is Indian and she brought to one of the best places in the city. Truth be told, I wasn't particularly excited to go there. 

So, Devi has a list of lunch specials. You get a soup, salad, dessert and coffee. I chose the lamb Rogan Josh. 

Remember when you were in school and you got a plate with your drink, meal, soup and dessert. Well this is similar, only much better, in all the ways. First, the food is obviously a million times better. Second, on your plate, which is nicely presented, you have your main course, a bowl of rice, a small salad and a rice pudding. 

The lamb was actually very good. It wasn't too spicy for my taste. My boss bragged about their na'an bread and I got to say it was delicious. I think I ate an entire plate to myself. 

Conclusion: Much better than I expected, considering I am not a fan of Indian food. I won't go back voluntarily, but if people want to go, I won't complain.
