UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w So Affordable! 
This place is delicious and the servings are the perfect size. I let them know I'm vegan and they make sure to not include any dairy or eggs in my meals. They are very accommodating. This is what I imagine to be a very authentic Indian market that serves wonderful food. I have been here many times and am never disappointed! They also claim to have the BEST Samosas in the United States and I have to admit they are pretty good!
