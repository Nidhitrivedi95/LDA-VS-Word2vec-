aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Great service for a take-out/ fast food place.
The owner was nice enough to go over the entire menu with me.
They serve street style Indian food.
I got the Shami Kabab (lamb) roll this consist of minced lamb, chickpea, lentil and  bound with egg. This roll came with a mint basil sauce.
The roll was great.
I also found the Indian music videos playing in the tv very entertaining.
