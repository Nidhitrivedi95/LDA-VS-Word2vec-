P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I absolutely loved my meal (chicken tandoori) and the meal of my girlfriend (chicken tikka)! We had a very nice waitress as well as a very helpful staff which constantly took care of us and our drinks even as our waitress was busy. Also $2 off any entree if you show your student ID. If you want authentic feeling and tasting, All India is the place. Only thing that drops this restaurant down to 4 stars was that the restaurant was slightly stuffy and a bit warm and also the Chassa drink we ordered was unforgivably horrible (of no fault to the restaurant, we just had never had it before)
