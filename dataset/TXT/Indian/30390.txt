K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw A pretty solid Indian restaurant, and definitely one of the best in the area. Don't expect a beautiful dining room here, but you will get excellently-prepared food. We ordered a few dishes, rice, naan and samosas to start. The samosas were nice and crispy, although a bit lacking in spice. The naan was fresh and warm. It was generally fluffier than most places, which I liked. The dishes were absolutely delicious! Butter chicken and saag paneer; pretty safe bets when going to a new place, but these were exceptional. Very flavourful and fresh-tasting.

All-in-all this is a great place. The service could be speedier, but the servers were very polite. I'd like to try their lunch buffet to compare the quality to the a-la-carte menu items. 

Oh, and had a mango lassi, which was awesome!
