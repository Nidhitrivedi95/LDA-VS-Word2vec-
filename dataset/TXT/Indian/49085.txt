TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw We got free tickets to a show at the Hilton last night and were looking for a restaurant to try in the general area. I've read a lot of good reviews for Namaste so we decided to give it a try. 

I had thought about going there a couple of times but could never bring myself to do it. I love LOS and just couldn't imagine walking past LOS to go to another restaurant. I'm glad I decided to do so last night.

We ordered garlic naan, chicken biriani (waitress' suggestion/house specialty), paneer malai (cheese in a creamy onion sauce), and kheema mutter (ground lamb in a curry sauce).

We were given papadum to start. It was good and I really liked the mint chutney that accompanied it. I wasn't as fond of the tamarind chutney, but that's because I'm not a big fan of tamarind.

My wife had a mango lassi. She said it was good but that she's had better. She prefers hers a little thicker and sweeter.

The garlic naan was good but was a little under-cooked and doughy. The chicken biriani was my wife's favorite. I liked it quite a bit, but it was a tad too minty for me. My favorite was the lamb curry. I thought the flavors were really well-balanced. The paneer malai was our least favorite, though we still liked it quite a bit. It was a tad sweet for me. They also gave us regular naan which was good and buttery.

About half way through our dinner, the waitress began to sing. She had a really nice voice. Because of her accent, some of the words were a little off on pronunciation or cadence, but overall I enjoyed her singing. My one complaint was that she had the volume up pretty high, which made it very hard to talk while she was singing. She only sang a few songs though, so it wasn't too disruptive.

Overall, we enjoyed our meal quite a bit. Next time we're going to try the lunch buffet which one of the waiters recommended (as do a bunch of Yelpers). Namaste's pretty close to my office so if it's good, I may become a regular.
