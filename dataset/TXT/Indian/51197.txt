utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw I had the SHAHI PANEER - Chunks of Cheese Sautéed with Ginger, Garlic, Onion & Tomatoes,Garnished with Cashews and Raisins, Cooked in Creamy Sauce. A Royal Vegetarian Delight and the PISHAWARI NAAN - Unleavened White Bread Stuffed with Dry Nuts and Raisins.  I ordered it extra hot.  It had a decent heat level, though not extra hot.  The naan was good too.
