GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA OMG! Seriously one of the best Paki restaurant EVER. Well that might be me saying that because it was the only place which served me Chapli Kabob lol. But on a serious note i think this place has done really well for themselves even though i think they have a competition only a block away but its always dead. I was in tempe for 2 days and and went there both days. Customer service was great as well. The dude from the TV wasn't wrong. :D
Most of their business is from the HUGE Indian and a Pakistani student population by ASU. So if they all love it trust me you will as well.
