LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng Very enjoyable experience. Able to converse easily w/o noise. Excellent food. Reasonable prices for entrees. Alcohol prices were somewhat high. Distinctly different kinds of food compared to Sitara in Urbana, a favorite of ours. Plan to return often. Service was excellent. Ample space. Seated immediately.
