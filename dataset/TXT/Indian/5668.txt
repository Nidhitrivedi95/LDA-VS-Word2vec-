3iUabwGw2Wlf3Qm93NUm5g This isn't authentic Hakka...the owners are Indian and the flavours don't sync up with what I'm generally used to. The food was more indian fused and it didn't have the kick you yearn for in Hakka.

Ordered Manchurian shrimp fried rice (they use basmati rice, the colour was not red as the usual), chili chicken (watery), Manchurian chicken (dry, not bad), and the Hakka special noodle with chicken and shrimp (not so special, noodles sucked, meat was cubed up and dry).

Overall, this was a womp womp womp story.  Giving it 3 stars because the food was edible and I didn't get the runs ...but definitely not worth it. Having explored authentic hakka restaurants such as Lin Garden and Fredericks in Scarborough, which easily put this place to shame, I will not be returning.
