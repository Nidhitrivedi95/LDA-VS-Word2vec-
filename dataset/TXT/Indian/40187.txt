PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg I cant believe I lived across the road from this place for nearly a whole year and didnt try the Mosque Kitchen.

It was recommended to me, and frankly I didnt fancy it - but I was there today and I am now kicking myself that I didnt take advantage while I still could.

The food is great. It's propper Indian/Pakistani food, and more importantly there is absolutly loads of it for a very tidy price. Eating outdoors is also great, and gives this place a great vibe. I really will be here again!
