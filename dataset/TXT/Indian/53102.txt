vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg We came here with some out of town relatives because they wanted to tour the neighbourhood and eat Indian food. This restaurant is definitely not my first pick for Indian food.

The restaurant was large, oddly constructed and mostly empty (though the patio was full) on a Monday at lunch time. Service was slow but adequate. The food was fine, nothing to write home about (do people in India want me to write to them about Indian food in Toronto?).

Saw some homeless guy eat off plates that were left on the patio tables by diners who had left a few minutes prior.

Edible food, adequate service, probably a safe bet for Indian food in Kensington market.
