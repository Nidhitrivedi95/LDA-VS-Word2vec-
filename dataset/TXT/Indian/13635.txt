BmFStvt6hs77XmYR7zmHtQ Tucked away on the edge of the PATH, this pace has authentic, spicy and delicious Indian food. Very good value for money too. Two orders of Chicken Biryani were within $13, taxes in! Only thing is, its well known to some, and dishes such as the biryani run out very soon.

If you're looking for the North Americanized version of Indian food (read sweet butter chicken) then this is not the place. But for the real thing, head here!
