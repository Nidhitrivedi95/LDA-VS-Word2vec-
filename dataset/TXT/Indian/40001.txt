pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Loved it here! Recommended by some friends on the north side. This place has a weekend buffet from 7-9 and it is very busy!!

We went here one Saturday afternoon. We thought they'd have a buffet but they didn't so we decided not to go there but while in the parking lot changed our mind and went back inside. 

After looking over the menu we chose the non-vegetarian platter and chicken vindaloo which was plenty for two to share. The platter came with so much food it was enough to make two meals. *check picture* 

I don't remember everything that was on it but it all tasted great!! It was hot, fresh and delicious. Our waitress was very kind and accommodating convincing my husband to buy two beers instead of sticking to water. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an Indian lover.
