_4UyKqVcyO8xajUgMKK-Nw I wouldnt give any stars to this place. It has been the most rude and crazy experience ever. We ordered our food and after few minutes the server comes over and says they do not serve one portion to 2 people. Most ridiculous thing ever said to me!! He could have mentioned this policy before seating us or atleast while we were ordering. How does it make sense to embarrass ur guests after few minutes of taking the order. Since he saw me getting angry in a flash of a second, he backed down saying he will make an exception to my order and serve us. 

When asked about his policy, he says he has to cover the costs of this restaurant and I am nobody to question his business decision. yeah right, people paying you cant question you. My simple question was, why dont you serve us like we order. nothing offensive, I didnt ask for his balance sheet and revenue statement. Anyways, the jackass says, he is getting charged for the seats we are occupying and only way he can make money is by making us buy extra food that we dont need. we have traveled in over 5 countries and not even once has anyone shown me this business model in restaurant business.

Since we were the only patrons that night apart from another couple, it seems highly unlikely that this guy is popular or even makes money at all. If he is so stupid about his business he might start charging people for just entering his restaurant. 

On another occassion, I would get up and leave but, i didnt want to waste his food //money as this incident happened after 10 minutes of order and food was already getting made. I respected his business but seems like he doesnt know how to respect the guests.
