qCTuGaciae73u7C57s2_0Q Service was fast, staff were friendly, portions were large and tasted great!

Not sure why Jenn below is such a grump really

We picked this restaurant after wanting something a bit different - and we ordered through justeat.ca  

The food took about 45 mins to arrive (exactly as it said it would) and we were very impressed!

We liked it so much that we actually dropped into the restaurant the next week to pick something up - the guy who took our order was incredibly friendly and helpful, he even gave us some free pakora while we waited for our food to be prepared.  Once again the food was delicious and everyone was very satisfied!

Thanks a lot guys, keep up the great work!!
