xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg If you haven't dined here, you're missing out on something truly special.

Every dish takes me right back to childhood growing up on Indian cooking, dinners around the table with our Indian friends.

William's dishes are on point and exactly what I remember.
His dishes make me feel like I'm back home, I can envision the platters and dishes used to serve our meals 20+ years ago.

We have never been disappointed here. And partner is always just staring at me as savoring every heavenly bite with sparkly eyes and child like excitement.

I've heard of a couple of good places in Las Vegas for Indian dining.For me, everything is so spot on point here that I have no desire to search any further or try any other places!

I love Paradise India.
