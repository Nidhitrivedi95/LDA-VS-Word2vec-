qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA I have to agree with most people on this one. Although this makes a cool spot to spend an evening it's way too loud to enjoy yourself. It's terrible hard to get any service. And the food... well let's not even talk about the food.

I give it an 'okay'. Simply because I've had so many fun times there despite the quality of the venue.
