RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA Been here a few times and never left less than bursting! 

There's a good choice of vegetarian and proper food, with both regularly refreshed. Its reasonably priced and will keep you going well into the night, the only concern would be the curry after burners, but that can't be helped, especially after a few ales.

The restaurant is a little off the beaten track but is easy to find - a couple of doors away from the brass monkey and black medicine cafe, 2 fine establishments, and a handy pit stop if you've been energetic enough for a morning stroll up Arthurs Seat.

While most people who pretend they're local after spending a couple of weeks in Edinburgh, very few manage to discover this place so make an effort and you'll be glad you did!
