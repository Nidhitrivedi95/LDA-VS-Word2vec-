YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw This is one of my favorite spots to grab dinner. Persis was recommend to me by one of my Indian co-workers, as I did not have much experience with Indian cuisine and she totally pointed me in the right direction. The Chicken Tikka Masala is delish! As are their chicken wings from the appetizers. Each time I go I ask the servers for recommendations, and every time they bring a new and exciting dish. The wait staff has always been attentive and very willing to help point me in the right direction with the food. If you want to try lots of different things I recommend the lunch buffet, it is a great way to try their food and it is very reasonable.
