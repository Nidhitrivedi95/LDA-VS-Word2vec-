v4ZVAIDgE9ZXhMcpx8tctw Yes, it's expensive.  But you will be hard-pressed to find more flavorful and tender chicken, whether in an India restaurant or anywhere else.  The cook is a master of the tandoori oven.  The tikki masala was texturally excellent, and the flavors of the chicken were not lost in the equally flavorful cream sauce.

The garlic naan was fluffy and well-baked.  The rice (pro tip: order rice no matter what you get, just to make sure you have enough) had a wonderful mix of peas and onions.  And all of this was served in a relaxed atmosphere by a friendly wait staff.

I walked out knowing how memorable the meal will be when I look back on it.  I doubt I'll remember what the number was on the bill.
