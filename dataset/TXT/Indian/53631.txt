vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Pushap is still good and cheap but I think they've raised their prices ... so, one less star for you. 

This place got five stars in the past simply because of the cheap cheap Yankee Doodle prices. You could have a feast for two and it would have run you around twenty dollars or so but now that same feast is about thirty. 

All I'm saying is that if they're raising the prices then they're gonna have to raise the quality and maybe cut back on the overly surly service. 

Again, everything is as good as it used to be ... just a smidgen of a tad bit more expensive. The chana batura (chickpeas simmered in aromatic spices served with fried flat bread, achaar (lemon and mango pickle) with whole green chillies and onion) is excellent. The bhel puri (a puffed rice street food type snack) is very good. The thali is a good tasting platter.
