Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g My disclaimer wil state: I am not an expert on all things Indian Cuisine....
HOWEVER... I do know good food! 
I was waiting for someone in the area and could no longer ignore the hunger pangs in my stomach.  I pulled up the Yelp App on my phone to see what was nearby with good reviews.  Everest came up and looked good enough to try. 
 I ordered the butter chicken lunch special.  WOW , the soup that came first was so flavourful.  It finished with my spoon scraping the bowl. If the bowl was larger I would have been satisfied if that was the meal! The butter chicken with naan bread rice and a vegetable potato ball were alll soooooo good! At $7 this was filling, tasteful and gratifying enough that I will travel from the East end over to the West end simply for another meal at Everest.  Did I mention that the service was wonderful.  A tasteful amount of inquiries... is everything okay... can I get you anything else. 
Everest deserved my time to write a review. I will definitely go back
