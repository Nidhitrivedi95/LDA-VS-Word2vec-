IuGzUnd3fy5F9Gz_SoNUdg I've been coming here to get samosas and mithai for a few years. I found this was one of the few nice samosa places in Scarborough. A bit pricey at .80 cents each but worth it. I always call ahead to make sure the samosas are freshly fried before picking up and the owner always seems offended when asking. The service definitely needs improving.
