F9_g9plM0EUc_pi_zs_MCg Really great food, best Indian meal I've had in Edinburgh. Staff are very friendly. Outside and inside was refurbished recently and looks the better for it (photos on yelp are dated now)The food is tasty, great variety; sabzi chiili dahl is amazing, the chicken dish in the chef's special wow!
