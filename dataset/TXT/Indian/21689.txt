GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g This is my first time having dinner at Woodlands. This place has gone through multiple ownership changes I think. The current owner was very pleasant, accommodated my request for changes to the dinner 'Thaali'. The food was a revelation. Absolutely awesome. The portions were big and the curries were just splendid. 4 different curries and each had it's own aroma, flavor and completey stood out. Reminded me of a couple of places back home in Tamil Nadu. Loved it, highly recommend it.
