Wow, in my 28 years of being alive and eating at many Indian restaurants around the world, this is the best Indian buffet I've ever had. All of the food was fresh, delicious, and of high quality. The buffet spread was plentiful and all for such a reasonable price. I will not be trying any other Indian restaurants in my PA stay as I've found all that I need in this one.
