ry_c9N_E4zmB3VlyLDE26Q I cannot sing this restaurant's praises enough.  I can truly say, hand on heart, my favourite Indian restaurant that I've ever been to - anywhere!!!  I've been here many times and have never not enjoyed or even been disappointed with any of the dishes I've eaten.  The flavours and spice combinations that explode in your mouth during each bite is spectacular - truly a pleasure.  

What are you waiting for?  Go now...
