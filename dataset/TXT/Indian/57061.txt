xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I've driven by this restaurant over 100 times.  I was finally curious enough to give it a try.

Because I had read the reviews here, I knew what I would order for my test lunch.  A simple red chile beef taco.  I went ultimate - all the toppings.

Holy crap!

I hate it when I drive by a gem 100 times without giving it a try.  This is going to be a regular for sure.

It's a 5-star bit of food wrapped in a weak service and marginal cleanliness package.  The table we sat at was sticky, the guy who brought our food dropped it splattering a salsa bottle all over the table.  They give you only 1 see-through napkin for what is a messy meal, and although he said more were available - not handily.  Treat it like a giant immobile food-truck.

I'll make it a to-go place, but I'll be "to-going" once a week.
