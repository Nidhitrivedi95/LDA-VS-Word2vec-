Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg I usually avoid AYCE buffets but I was with two voracious eaters and figured they'd get their fill at the troughs here. Well, color me impressed. The offerings at Trimurti's lunch buffet were not just plentiful, they were tasty and well presented. 

They have a nice assortment of starters including salad, pappadum and chutneys. I'd skip the samosas. They were no longer warm and had become leaden with dough. The butter chicken lived up to its name and was buttery. I thought the real winners were the vegetarian dishes: mutter paneer; spinach stewed with chickpeas; and eggplant with potatoes. Great, great, and great.

My one quibble is that the naan had been sitting out too long and had become spongey. But, really, all this for $10.95 per person -- I really can't complain too much. 

Oh, and the lunch buffet includes ice cream -- yay!
