uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Went here on a risk, I'm snobby with Indian food and generally not a fan of what most Indian restaurants pretend is 'Indian' food. So, based on reviews I decided this restaurant was worth a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. The decor place was pleasant using earth tones, service was prompt and food was served quickly. We ordered the palak paneer and another dish. The naan was great (as with most places), the palak paneer and the other dish was good. Summary: Not a place that is a "must go" but if you are looking for decent north Indian food, Shere E Punjab fits the bill.
