eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Good quality curries and service. Except they had burnt my naan and decided to still serve it to the customer !! I paid $5 with tax for the one naan and got it burnt. The naan was also hard like a Indian milk biscuit. Maybe they need a new tandoori chef or tell him to wake up while he is making naans. As you can see in the photo how burnt my naan was. It was definitely not edible.

The aloo gobi that I got was a medium size and it was $12 with tax and it was delicious. Their large size aloo gobi container is not much bigger and it $15 with tax! Crazy prices! However, I must say it was one of the best aloo gobi curry I've had and I have tried aloo gobi from many Indian restaurants before. The aloo gobi would have been much better if my naan was not burnt.

The service was really good and if you get takeout, it will take no more than 10 minutes. The cashier was really friendly and they had packed my food with wet napkins and cutleries without even being asked. One of the only Indian restaurants that goes the extra mile for customer service. 

When you're paying $12 for a vegetarian curry and $5 after tax for a butter naan in a Indian restaurant, you automatically have higher standards. Brars is overpriced but you do get good quality food minus the burnt naan. Next time, don't serve your customers food if it doesn't meet the quality of how much you are charging them!
