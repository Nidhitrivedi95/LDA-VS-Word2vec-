CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I went there with a party of 5 people, without reservation. We were seated in a timely manner. 

The waiters were very courteous, knew the menu well and made good wine pairing suggestions. Two of my friends asked for their dishes to be not too spicy, and the staff made sure it would be as they wished. 

We all took the 30$ prix fixe option. 3 courses, served with all you can eat rice and naan. 

I had the chicken tandoori for a starter. Good portion, nice presentation and was spicy (5/5). I then had the butter chicken. Delicious sauce but I wish the chicken would have been slightly tender. I give it 3/5. 

The waiters brought 2 huge bowls of basmati rice with cumin and herbs (4/5). The bread also came with the mains, and you could tell that it was freshly made. There was both classic and garlic naan served (5/5). 

For dessert, we were all served a mango smoothie that was refreshing and not too heavy after such a big meal (4/5). 

Overall a good experience. it took them a little too long to bring the bills but at least they broke it down for every guest. 

The only thing is that they yell a lot in the kitchen, the staff should try not to do that as it looks a little bit sketchy for the customers.
