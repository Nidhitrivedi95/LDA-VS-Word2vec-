I'm spoiled by a variety of excellent Indian options in SoCal...I was quite excited to find such a great Indian food restaurant so close to my hotel!

Seems to have a loyal local following and lots of take out orders when I was there so don't be put off if you walk into this large restaurant and find it empty.
