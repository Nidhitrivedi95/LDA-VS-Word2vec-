LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This our favourite South Indian restaurant... Anywhere....including many that we've been to in India!

We moved away from Toronto out west and every time we come back, this year is one of our must do destinations. The food is consistently delicious and comes out quickly. It's nice that there is a variety of spice levels to choose from and that one can customize the dosa's, never mind the sheer variety to start with. Although a tad on the higher price side (compared to other South Indian restaurants), the food quality justifies the difference.
