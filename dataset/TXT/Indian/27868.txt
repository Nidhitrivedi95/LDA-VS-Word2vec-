IuGzUnd3fy5F9Gz_SoNUdg This is a nice place if you are looking for Indian snacks and sweets. The Samosas and the Pakoras are something that you'd enjoy but are pricey. [7$ for a pound of pakoras]. The service is okay but you don't really care because most of the time you are in a take away mode. I wish they served some nice masala chai too!
