Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I had been in vegas for a conference and it was about time for me to have my indian fix. The first thing I noticed was that this place was packed with Indian people. That was a good sign, everything tasted authentic, fresh, and healthy like having a meal at home. Like others have stated the chicken tandoori was moist and delicious! The rice pudding was the best I've ever had. I also didn't feel heavy or thirsty after the meal which I usually do from NYC indian delivery spots.
