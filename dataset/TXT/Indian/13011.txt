b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw I've got to say this is my favorite Indian place, and probably my favorite Lakewood restaurant at the moment. Unfortunately, I can't come here everyday because it's a little too expensive for that. Both times I have been here I ordered the Andhra Chicken Curry. I'm not sure what makes it Southern Indian, but it's a lot like most chicken curry dishes that I have had in the past, just much better. Both times I have been here I tried a different appetizer. First we tried the Masala Dosa which you can see in the pictures. It's a big rolled crepe. The Masala one had potatoes and other veggies inside. It came with dipping sauces and was awesome. The second time I came here we had the vegetable cutlet. It looks like an egg roll but was a very delicate fried vegetable roll. This was also delicious. Also, you must get the naan with your meal. 

The service is great as well. I've been coming here for Sunday brunch and they serve the dinner menu at that time. I could probably come here more often if I just go during the lunch menu. I just wish this place was closer to my place of work.
