zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw Ghee in all of the vegetarian dishes making them not vegan friendly. 

Owners or operators not willing to make without ghee. Vegetable oil costs less and is likely better for you, so why not make the exception for vegans?

The menu further states that they will make you any curry if you ask, even if it isn't on the menu. Apparently they can't make one without ghee.  No money from me.
