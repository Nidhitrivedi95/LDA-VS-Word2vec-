49sbCG7F2jvqJsfG6-N8Rw The food is delicious! That's usually all that you need to know. However, this restaurant also features a warm & lovely interior, multiple rooms and seating options, and the family that owns and runs Spice Affair are the tops. They have been taking care of us for years at the People's Garfield location. So seeing a new and slightly more upscale - without being stuffy - and even more welcoming new endeavor is just wonderful. Can't wait to come back next week!
