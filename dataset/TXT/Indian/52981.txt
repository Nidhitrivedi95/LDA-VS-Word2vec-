v4ZVAIDgE9ZXhMcpx8tctw I stopped in last week because I had a hankering for Indian and Allo Inde was just a block up from my hotel.  I guess I was a bit late for the lunch crowd because the dining room was empty, except for a couple of people near the window finishing their meals.  

The bartender looked up and motioned me toward what was obviously not one of the choicer tables and instead of a nice, sunny view of Rue Stanley, I was treated to a corner on the dark side of the bar with a view of a high chair and a rack of tourist brochures.  Big deal?  Well, I was hungry and I wasn't that picky so I guess I won't hold it against them.

As I made myself comfortable, it became clear that the staff were setting up for dinner and I was a bit sad that I didn't get a flickering votive at my table. (So long as it's not burning down my house, I love fire.)  The waiter made it all better, however, when along with the menu, he left the list of $9.99 lunch specials.  I didn't look past the first item, chicken curry, and I placed my order, along with a can of Coca Cola and naan.

A few moments later, the waiter brought me a bowl of lentil soup and just as I finished that, out came my naan and chicken curry, a small salad and a vegetable dish with cauliflower that I couldn't quite identify.  It wasn't the best Indian meal I'd ever eaten but for fifteen dollars including the tip, I got a tasty lunch and more food than I could eat.  I would definitely return although next time, I'd ask for a better table.
