sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ When you overcharge your Biryani about 20% higher than any other Indian place you should at least include Raita with it and not make your customers have to pay for it separately. Secondly the Biryani that I received was more like Muttar Pulao and  hardly had any chicken in it.. Not going to lie, it did taste good but when I ask for Biryani, I expect Biryani. It's too bad this is the only Indian takeout option near by, cause i'll never be coming back.
