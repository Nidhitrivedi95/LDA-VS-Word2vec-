li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ 3 Stars for now.

I went here with my fiance for their "Grand Opening" lunch.  They had a limited menu but still had what we both wanted.  So we both got a chicken entree with naan and a side of rice to split.  Paying was a breeze and so was the speed at which the food arrived.

The curry was pretty tasty.  Nothing amazing, but would satisfy an indian food craving.  The rice was sort of bland, and the naan was pretty terrible.  I like naan that can soak up some curry, but this naan was like a dry cracker.  It was sooooo thin.  

So they get 3 stars for now, I'll prolly go back.  Hopefully they will figure out the naan.
