Mv6ripiINornDXI07VPaLA If I could give it no stars, I honestly would. The new management (not Mexican) was sweet but tried to persuade us to purchase from his new menu, Indian food. He did not have carne asana, ice , tea or Lemonade. While we were eating he attempted to fix the ice machine and the a man stepped onto the counter, where he keeps utensils straws and lids, with no shoes or socks on.  If you want Mexican food, this is not the place to go.
