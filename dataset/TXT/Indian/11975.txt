auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I have eaten at many an Indian cuisine Resteraunt from here to Ontario. So I'd like to say my palate is seasoned. Taj has good food. Alot better than the three other Resteraunt's that were here that served canned curry and canned veggies at the buffet. The naan is great and compared to their competitors it surpasses them easily. The butter chicken is flavorful and nothing on the menu tastes artificial. Ghandi's is still my favorite in town, then Orgin India and this place is third. But if you want a quick buffet that is yumy and satisfies the senses ...come here!

As for customer service they are always great. Very friendly and funny. And I love the open seating. 

Over all 4 stars. Dang near perfect.
