Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw Always go there since it is very close to my office.

FOR buffet  The lamb is the main food i get, too much milk in the source, is not that bad but not worth it for the price.
 
IN Order dinner menu, Tast better and smell good... you will smell like it when you eat too much lol still bit costly for what you get. 

will go there if project is paying me to do so ^^
