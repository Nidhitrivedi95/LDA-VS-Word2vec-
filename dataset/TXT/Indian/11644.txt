ajMgo23H5Qcn7Ma-xtiCqQ Love this place!  I have tried the butter chicken, saag(palak) paneer, buriyani and naan. It was the best I have ever tried in that area. Def should give it a try. Right at the corner of high park and dundas. Only thing is the hours of operation, I've drove by there twice around 5:00pm and both times they were closed. Otherwise, amazing food!
