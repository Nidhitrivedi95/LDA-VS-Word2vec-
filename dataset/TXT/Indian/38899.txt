OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Urban Turban is a restaurant based off an Indian Fusion Bombay Style restaurant in Auckland New Zealand - I don't really know what that means exactly but the food quality here is a little higher than your typical Indian buffet or dive spot.

Coming from the Bay Area, there's a lot of choices for good, cheap Indian food especially in Silicon Valley. In Vegas, the choices are noticeably fewer and I think a higher class of Indian food could catch on.

However, I didn't find that my experience here was eye opening nor a particularly good value. The prices and stipulations with the "bottomless" curries were discouraging to me. The primary stipulation with the bottomless curry is that they aren't to be shared, and naan and rice can be charged if you want extra. That being said it was plenty of food, so if you don't come in starving, you'll probably be full after a plate of food.

One thing that was quite nice here was their rice. It was tender, non-sticky, and yet not dry at all. I had the Himalayan Curry. The chicken inside the curry was extremely tender and tasted of a higher quality overall than most other Indian food joints. My curry itself seemed a little watery, and while the menu said it was spicy, I couldn't detect much personally. The GM did come out and say if I had a problem with it, he would gladly bring me a spicier one but I was too full at that point.

My friend had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which, not being a curry, was not part of the bottomless deal - which is a bit of a bummer still. The naan was quite good, though nothing special in my mind.

I don't really know what a good value is at a place like this - the atmosphere does speak to a higher level of quality, but the food on the plate wasn't so outstanding, especially when I compare them to a typical Indian restaurant. I'm curious to see how well they can do with the location and price point, but for now I will give them a barely passing grade.
