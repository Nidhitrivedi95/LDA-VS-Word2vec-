Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ What they lack in customer service, they gain in their food quality. We tried several items off the menu, and enjoyed everything we ate.

I would highly recommend the chicken tikka masala with their fresh naan. We also tried the briyani and lamb curry which satisfied our taste buds. All items are reasonably priced. 

However, our waitress took forever to give us water, take our order, bring out our food and give us our bill at the end. We had to request each step several times. This really shocks me given the small size of the reataurant; you would think they would rush us out in order to serve the next guests.
