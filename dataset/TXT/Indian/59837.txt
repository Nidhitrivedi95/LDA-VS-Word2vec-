ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I believe this is my very first yelp
I just had to comment
I was supposed to go out for Italian and then I thought this gem Tucked Away by the LVAC gym
If you have ever wanted fresh Indian cuisine this is the place to come
I went for the buffet with a friend and I savored every bite
The address is 4165 S. Grand Canyon Dr. Suite 105
The phone number 702-876-0050
Today with the luckiest day i've had in the definition of great food in a fast and fine manner
Come here and thank me later
Angela
