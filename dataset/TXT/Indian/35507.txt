Mw4OBWvBQ-L_a0EOFKFDjQ Came here with a bunch of friends this past week end and was a bit apprehensive from reading some of the past reviews!
What a nice surprise as the Pakistani food taste was spot on.  This is a no nonsense sit down and tuck in kinda joint as it has a fast food vibe to it but the portions are generous and very tasty.
We had the Chicken Karahi, Haleem, Nihari, chicken Biryani and a Dal with boneless chicken tikkas and the freshly made naan....all amazing!
I would definitely recommend this joint if you want good Pakistani food and don't care much for ambience!!
We will definitely be back!
