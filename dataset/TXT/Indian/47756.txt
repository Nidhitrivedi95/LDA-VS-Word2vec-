TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Went to the lunch buffet, very yummy!! Unfortunately they didn't have the chana masala, which i heard was very good, so I plan to go back and try that. I had a mango lassi, it was creamy and delicious, complemented the flavors of the food nicely. and the service was super friendly and attentive! Great decor too!
