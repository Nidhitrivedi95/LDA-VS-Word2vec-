tcclqqE4T8XbgS-02vsl6A What a great cultural event full of good food, entertainment and vendors. $5 per person entrance fee plus food and vendor costs, it was well organized and a nice space to watch the ongoing Indian musicians and dancers on the stage surrounded by graduating grassy hills of the amphitheater. The Indian Viasakhi Mala Festival had 5-6 local Indian restaurants selling lots of yummy food, there was vendors doing henna tattoos, demonstrating how to tie a turban, and had jewelry and clothes for sale. The entertainment was absolutely beautiful and the event coordinators did a great job. There was local and out of town performers singing and dancing, decked out in traditional Indian dress. 
I highly recommend next year attending the festival, it was a great outing for our family. And there's tikka masala, so, you know it's a good thing.
