rwuMWGqt7L5l5lDsOYv1dw I had the potato (aloo) zyggy roll and it was absolutely scrumptious! It was really flavorful and the spices were great. I can't wait to try the other zyggy rolls. The place is pretty small but when I went it was deserted; hopefully more people hear about this place - I really hope it is here to stay! The roll came with a drink which was nice. They also offer fries which I was a bit surprised by but I haven't tried them yet.
