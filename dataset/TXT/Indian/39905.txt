You can easily drive past this place unless you know where it is (Right beyond Mad Mex and a Mattress store as you drive south on McKnight Road--before Ross Park Mall). They have a parking lot that fills up on weekend evenings, but you can park nearby without a problem. 

I love the owners of this restaurant. They are charming and very pleasant. They visit the tables and make sure guests are happy. The waiters/waitresses are mostly attentive and friendly. We've had a few problems with not getting food we ordered or getting the wrong food. I chalk this up to the fact that the place is usually busy and little mistakes happen. They are quick and willing to correct mistakes. 

There is a buffet that most people seem to opt for. I see people making multiple trips with plates piled with their fragrant, steaming choices. The aroma makes my mouth water! Smells so delicious! We typically order from the menu because I'm a big fan of leftovers, which (like all places) you can't take if you visit the buffet.

During our last visit, the three of us--without discussion with each other--all ordered the chicken tikka masala. Something must have inspired us (the aroma of someone else's food?) and it turned out to be a great choice. The sauce was creamy with the perfect amount of spices. Not too overwhelming, not at all bland. Our friend who accompanied us is 2nd generation Indian and she gives it her hearty approval. She has dinner here with her parents fairly often. The nan was warm and tender--great for scooping up those last bits of sauce. 

Rather than eating at the many chain restaurants nearby, this is great choice for authentic Indian food. The service is prompt and the food is delicious. We always leave happy.
