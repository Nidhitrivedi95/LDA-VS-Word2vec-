NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Good food at a fair price. Told the nice guy it was my first time there and he  perked up and helped me eagerly with my order. He even let me taste the soup (?) which was DELICIOUS!! And don't get me started on the truffle! Was a little slice of heaven in a little soft chocolate ball. So glad I got two!...99¢ each. Oh and I got the cheese Paneer plate (kinda tofu-ish.) with rice, bread and a lemonie green sauce for dipping and lemon wedge garnish. Only had to wait 5 minutes or less for my order. Will definitely go back! Great little meal all for $10.97!
