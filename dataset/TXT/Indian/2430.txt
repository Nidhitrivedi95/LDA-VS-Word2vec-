02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ After moving from Flagstaff, I was looking for a new indian food restaurant that could meet the standards of the one I frequented up north. This place does not disappoint. The service is exemplary and the food is phenomenal. I highly recommend the chicken korma! It's my go to whenever I go!
