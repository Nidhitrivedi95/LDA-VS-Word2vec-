u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw Great little spot in Scarborough!

The service is great and they take accountability for any mistakes (forgot to start an order once because they were swamped, understandable).

The food is made with great care and quality consistently - hard to come across these days.

Here are the items I've had so far...

Snacks:
Chicken and jerk chicken samosas: made very well, fresh and tender meat.
** they have random samosa promotions, try them out!
Mogo: the best fries I've ever had. It also comes with their home made spicy sauce.

Take-out Menu:
AAA Beef Ribs: the best ribs I've had in the city. I was skeptical at first but one of the owners encouraged me to try it and now I'm hooked. The meat is soft and it's cooked perfectly. The seasoning is bang on too.

Chicken breast/chicken leg quarter: I'm not a huge fan of the burnt style of cooking. The meat is tender and juicy inside but the skin is usually over-done but I think that's the style of cooking. My colleagues love it, I'd give it 4/5.

Marinated Meats:
AAA Beef Ribs: A smaller quantity compared to the take-out menu but same quality ribs. It really is cooked to perfection.

In terms of seating, there's only two tables. It's more of a take-out/catering type business.
