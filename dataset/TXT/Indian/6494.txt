3quopZyL8WuqVFfsCi0z2A As an Indian who has access to delicious homemade Indian food, my standards for Indian food at restaurants are extremely high. And let me tell you, Lageez met my expectations and then some. 

We ordered the tandoori grill plate, the tandoori shrimp, the butter chicken, and lamb korma. Everything was excellent. The shrimp in particular was noteworthy - they were huge, juicy, and extremely flavourful! The portion sizes are very generous, and the accompanying naan was fresh and HUGE. Even the regular ol rice was cumin scented and delicious! It's definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the city and excellent value to boot. I look forward to returning and trying more items on their menu.
