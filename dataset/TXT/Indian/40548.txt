PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ Last night our 'kids' took us out for a birthday dinner to this wonderful and very very busy Indian restaurant on Jean Talon in what is 'unofficially' India Town in Montreal.  I have to admit I am a huge fan of this cuisine and was looking forward to trying this particular restaurant.  It is BYOB so we arrived bottles in hand but were disappointed to find a long lineup almost out the door. The owner assured us it would not be more than 15-20 minutes so we waited and he was true to his word....and it was well worth the wait.  The menu is long and varied and we ordered from almost  every section of the menu. The Daal soup was only okay but everything after that just got better and better.  The pakoras, bhazi and samosa were all excellent as was the yogurt based sauce.   We tried 4 different chicken dishes, one lamb, and two vegetarian dishes.  All were absolutely wonderful but the standout dish was definitely the Baingan Bharta which is a smoked eggplant dish.  All 6 of us at the table are serious carnivores, so this dish was a surprise to all of us. It was incredible!  The naan bread, both plain and garlic, was tender and delicious and the Biryani Vegetarian was fried basmati rice with vegetables and spices and completely yummy.  This was the first time we did not have plain basmati and again this dish was a wonderful surprise. The service is fast and efficient and the server described each dish as it was put on the table.  
They offer a $20 'all you can eat' option which we did not take because we did not want to over order or overeat.  We were right.  There was so much food on the table and we took home leftovers. The only thing 'wrong' with this place is the noise level is over the top but that is because it is so busy. Don't go there for a romantic dinner for two but if you are a group and want to eat well and have a great time, GO!
