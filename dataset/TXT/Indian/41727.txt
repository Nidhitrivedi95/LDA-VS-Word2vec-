Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw I came here few months ago and the food was amazing... except.. NOT SPICY! At all!! It was a bit disappointing because I love Indian food, and real Indian food has to be spicy. When I asked the manager about it, he gave me strange answer: "Why do you need spicy!? White girl like you don't eat spicy!" I was like - really? Why not??!
So yeah, that was a bit weird. He offered to bring me chili or something but you know.. that's not the same.. Indian food is cooked with spices...
Anyhow, the food was tasty, except few dishes like Spinach Paneer that was completely tasteless.
Other than that, the restaurant is located just across from Eglinton subway station, has many tables, great selection of dishes - hot and cold. Also, they had couple of dessert options, one of them was cold Gulab Jamun. This was my first time ever I ate cold (fridge cold) Gulab Jamun!! Either they forgot to heat it up (which means it was not fresh) or... it's just the way they serve it here. I did not enjoy it cold.
I would definitely like to return here, however the lack of spices is something that keeps me away.
