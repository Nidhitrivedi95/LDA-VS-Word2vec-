gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA South Indian food in Cleveland !  So excited !

Went here with a friend on a cold lazy Sunday afternoon.  It looked promising - sambar ( a really hot spicy indian lentil based soup), iddli (a bread like substance made from rice), and dosas, all of which I love, and a smattering of North Indian options as well.

As other yelpers mentioned, the service was buffet stye and a iittle slow, but that's ok - this is a place to relax.

I should mention the menu is pure veg and there is a pretty nice Indian grocery next door for afterward (the nicest I've seen in CLE)
