-ssULZ_nOuQfrlFv0NXJIQ Finally a good Indian restaurant in Toronto!

We had dinner here on a Sunday night. Despite being short staffed they were attentive and efficient.

What we ordered:
- Pomegranate Chat (light and crispy with great flavour)
- Cheese pakoras with tamarind sauce (not oily like most pakoras found in Toronto, very light in batter)
- Mango lassi (tasted like what a lassi should taste like: yoghurt with hints of mango flavour not overly sweet, just right!)
- Madras chicken curry (rich flavour, meat was juicy)
- lamb biryani (the highlight of what we ordered, the rice was infused with flavour) 
- okra (cooked perfectly, firm in texture)
- naan (might be the best naan in Toronto next to Lahore tikka house)

I'm South Asian and I rarely eat at Indian restaurants in Toronto - all of it seems to be watered down and lacks in flavour depth but this place was unlike those. Thank goodness my husband insisted we try it because I now have a go to place for Indian food.
