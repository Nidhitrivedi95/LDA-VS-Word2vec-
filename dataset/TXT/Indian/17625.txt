This place is DELICIOUS. I came in and had the eggplant and potato with rice (tragically, I can't have the bhatura since it has dairy in it). At first I was a little annoyed with the price, seeing that the other veggie combo is less than $5 (mine was $6.90), but then I got it and realized that this was going to be a two-meal deal for me. 

The curry, amazing. The eggplant was just perfect and the rice was springy. The onion salad that came with it was spicy and tasty, but kind of ruined my breath for the rest of the day.

Note for spice lovers: there is a bowl of green chilis for the taking where you get forks, knives, spoons and water. 

The atmosphere is fine. It's McDonald's like seating (well, before McDonald's big revamp), but the bathrooms in the basement were not in the best shape.

There is also a great bake shop in there with a lot of pastries that I was too stuffed to try. 

Next time I'm dropping someone off at the airport, I am taking them here first!!
