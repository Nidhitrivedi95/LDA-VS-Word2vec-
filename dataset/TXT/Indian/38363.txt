OOBSQF72cl3jBBpLQWhyzw Came here on Saturday evening around 7 pm and the restaurant was not busy at all.  However the service seems to be quite slow, they must have been understaffed.

We ordered the naan brushetta,  which wasn't anything special in my opinion.  Tasted like cheap store bought naan with processed cheese on top and simple tomato and onion toppings.  

The gardein chilli chicken we ordered seemed to definitely be more of a butter chicken,  so I don't know if they got that order wrong.  However,  that was my favourite dish!  It was delicious and the fake chicken tasted pretty legitimate!  

The mushroom chettinaad was aright,  quite spicy,  but still pretty good.
