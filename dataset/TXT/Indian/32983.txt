We know the owner from going to the Maharaja on the West side. I'm so happy he opened a restaurant near where we live now. It's so good. There are a ton of choices for everyone and the samosas are quite tasty. The staff are friendly and courteous. The lunch buffet price is outstanding and the items featured in the buffet are quite delicious.
