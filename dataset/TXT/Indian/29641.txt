Only 4-5 tables full (mostly couples). Not greatest spot for kids cause of noise level...really quiet inside. Our son is kinda loud : p  
Service was good, but not excellent. 
Sauces ok.
Breads ok. 
Dishes ok.
Could have better sauces or better flavors.  
Nice romantic atmosphere-they dimmed the lights & with our toddler that wasn't a good thing. Better for couples. 
Dishes a little more than they are worth.
