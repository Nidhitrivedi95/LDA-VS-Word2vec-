gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw Hard sell from the wait staff wasn't appreciated. The service was horribly slow, and we had to beg for our bill. I ultimately had to approach the apologetic bartender to close out our bill since it had been over a half hour since we first wanted our bill.

The food was ok, nothing special. A little overpriced for what you get too, but ultimately satisfying. The seasonings aren't exactly authentic either. The dal makhani basically tasted like Mexican chili but with lentils.

We won't go back.
