yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg Wife chose this place and we went late Tuesday (9pm) for dinner after I got out of school.  Owner was attentive and very helpful and helpd us order.  he explained dishes and brought usu a few different breads.  Dishes were VERY colorful, tasty, piping hot.  I asked for spicy and WOW..., on that scale, I should have asked for mild.... Yummy food and Great time.
the owner's family children were playing (read: screaming and running around jumping on boothes and staring at us over the wall) the whole dinner, which was mildy annoying in a quaint way..:{
we'll be back. maybe once school starts?
