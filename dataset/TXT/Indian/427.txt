-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g YUM!  The best Indian food I have ever had.  So good.  Came here for dinner with a groupon.  Tried the paneer tikka masala and like it so much that I bought another groupon (my friend had bought the first one) and went with my husband for dinner THE VERY NEXT NIGHT!  He also very much enjoyed his meal.  This time the spice level was a bit higher on my dish (I am a bit of a wimp) so I commented to the waiter and he took the dish - partially eaten - and remade it!  Brought me a new full, less spicy dish.  That is very good customer service.

Was excited to try the $6.99 lunch buffet.  Small kids are $4.99 or $3.99, I forget.  Brought my three children and they all really enjoyed the mango lassi, garlic nan, rice, potato dish, dessert, etc.  The food was a bit spicier than our pallets enjoy so will likely stick to dinner where we can order the level of spice we prefer.

I recommended this place to friends who bought a groupon and also really enjoyed their dinner.
