7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ I have nothing bad to say about this place. I'm a huuuuuge fan of Indian cuisine and I definitely got my itch scratched here. We were the first ones in for dinner service - I was a bit eager cuz I missed the lunch buffet - so we were told to sit wherever. The owner greeted us and we got water right away. The app came out pretty quickly, probably because we were the only ones there. 

The food was excellent, I wasn't disappointed by a single thing. I ordered an extra entree in case the portions were a bit small... There was no need, I didn't even finish the dhal which was what I really wanted. The aloo paratha could have used a bit more aloo for my taste but it wasn't a big deal.

For everything that we got, the bill was less than I expected, WIN! I'll definitely be back. Gotta catch the buffet next time cuz I tend to want everything on the menu.
