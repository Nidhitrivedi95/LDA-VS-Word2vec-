fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA This is probably my favourite place for ayce Indian food. I would highly recommend visiting on a weekday for lunch (cheapest time) with an empty stomach cause it is WORTH IT.

Get the butter chicken with some of their freshly in-house made naan. It's like lying on a cloud in heaven, it so good. Their tandoori chicken is delicious as well- not too dry and it'll just fall off the bone.

Don't forget to also try their Indian sweets. Rasmalali, my favourite, is creamy with a hint of a pistachio flavour. They have some other delicacies behind the counter for purchase of well.
