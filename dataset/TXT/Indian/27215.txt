iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ Simply too good to resist! I had the garlic chicken, with egg fried chicken rice and it is simply the best! I also had the general tso chicken, but I thought the garlic chicken was better? If I remember correctly, it costs a dollar more too? We ordered these under a meal, in which we got wings for basically free! So that was neat! I had shrimp as well, and it's decent, their meals are better!
Overall nice place to sit, decent food, decent price!
