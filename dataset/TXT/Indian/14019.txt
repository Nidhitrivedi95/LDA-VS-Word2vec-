BXeXS9EaNN03AptFwElvjA Nice! The flatmate and i ducked in for a bite this past friday night, after recommendations from Yelp. It's listed as a tea house within the restaurant section and until i got in it didn't realise that it really was just a tea house that did food and not a restaurant that does tea.

Saying "just a tea house" is really selling it short, though. For £15 we got mixed plate of tons of starters, salad, 3 curries and drinks. It said it included a slice of cake or Indian sweets which we weren't offered but to be honest, we would have struggled to fit dessert in anyway.

As for the place itself, it's cosy and really decked out like an Indian tea tent. The Bollywood movies are highly entertaining but the Bhangra music can get a bit much.

Not enough to stop me going back, though!
