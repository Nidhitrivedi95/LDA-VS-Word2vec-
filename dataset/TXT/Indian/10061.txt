9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Absolutely amazing food and service. I have beeb to this restaurant twice. One for lunch buffet on a Sunday and next time for dinner. The food is amazing for the price and the people are extremely friendly. Best for Indian students around the campus. Go give it a try, you won't regret it!
