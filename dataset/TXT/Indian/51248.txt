uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg I really waivered between 2 to 3 stars. The parking lot to this place is small, also felt it was weird that the dumpster was out in front (not appealing!).  I went one weeknight evening for take-out.  I found their menu a little confusing.  I ended up ordering the Paneer Tikka Masala and 1 Chicken Kabab. It took probably 10 minutes or so for my food to be ready. I was a little horrified to see that the Masala was a yellowish/brown --every other time I've ever ordered Tikka Masala, the sauce is a orangish/red color (tomato base).  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and it did not taste like Tikka Masala at all.  The Chicken Kabab was OK. I had to throw away the ends as they were so dried out and hard I couldn't eat it.  It was pretty spicy as well.  I did like the yogurt sauce that was with it. I wasn't very impressed by this place, but may give it a shot again one day.
