lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw Visited this restaurant last night with a friend, it was both our first time. 
The restaurant itself was pretty spacious and very clean. The service we received here was top notch. 

Our server was pleasant and very attentive - always topped our water. She gave us great recommendations and explained the menu to us in detail. We also met the owner of the restaurant. He was quite polite and seemed very passionate about his business. 

Unfortunately, I wish the food was just as great as the service. We ordered the 'Steak with Cheese and Mushroom', the 'Chicken Satellite' and the 'Chicken Pakora'. Both the sizzling dishes were smothered with cheese, cream and gravy however, this didn't add any depth to the dish because it lacked in flavour. The chicken pakoras were the only thing I enjoyed here. 

I regret to say I won't be coming back since this place also gave me a stomach ache =(
