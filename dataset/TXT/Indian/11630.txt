ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ I visit Madras Masala at least twice a month in the summer months. We've also ordered delivery a few times. The food is still decent, but the Chili Cheese Dosa has gone downhill. In fact, the last time, I had to search for any actual cheese. It also appears they switched to orange cheddar cheese as opposed to the nice white stuff they used before. They also haven't been able to make it spicy enough for me the last few times. I'm sensing a new cook or a quality issue.

It's still a solid choice, and the Coconut Milk Chicken Biriani is a great dish. Probably my fave rice on earth. 

I'll be back, but I want to know what happened to my dosa.
