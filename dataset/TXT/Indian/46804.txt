t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg This place has decent food, but is WAY TOO OVER PRICED. $15 - 20 per plate for mostly masala and no meat, unacceptable. Sad cause the food isn't bad. Also the wait staff is condescending and not attentive. Beware you walk in with 2 adult and 4 kids they are going to consider you a party of 6+ and hit you with 18% gratuity. You've been warned.
