3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg Came here for lunch a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed myself. The butter chicken we had was nice and light and not too heavy and out came some very fluffy but crispy Nan's.  We also had the lamb chops which were delicious not overly fatty but flavorful. Since it was my first time in the area the parking is quite limited but it is worth the effort and I want to come again to try different things on the menu
