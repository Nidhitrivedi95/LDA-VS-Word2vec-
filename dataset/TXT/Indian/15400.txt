cQ5flA0MB40EKI78rtrNlg I started coming here the very next day it opened as I'm a food enthusiast and will try almost anything that's new. My first impression about Tikka House was enough for me to come back here every time I felt a craving for Indian/Pakistani cuisine. The food is always fresh, made from scratch and the taste never forgets to delight me. When friends and family are over I always order from Tikka House and they always appreciate and enjoy the food cos most of the indian/pakistani food they ever ate from other Gerrard Street restaurants didn't seem to be good enough. 
I'm glad this place is opened close to my home, now I dont need to run all over toronto to look for indian food. I totally recommend it to people and their Chicken Cheese Kebab and Haleem are pure awesome.
