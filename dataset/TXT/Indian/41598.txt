Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I love this restaurant! Amazing food, amazing service.  The vegetable manchurian is particularly good. Their food is not as oily as other hakka restaurants I've been too. Will definitely continue to come here to satisfy my hakka cravings. Thank you for providing great customer service!!
