VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg The Atlanta Yelp Empress, Kathleen M, came to town this week to help out with the Yelp Rocks event, so since she's a fan of ethnic cuisine, I decided we'd try Tandoori Times.  

It is kind of hidden in the shopping center - I suggest they get some better signage.  But we're smart girls, and we found it... it looked pretty dead from the outside but once we were led to a table, we saw a few other parties dining (including some friends of mine on a date!).

While our service was attentive enough, our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different.  For example, when we ordered the chicken tikka masala, he suggested we order chicken chile instead.  No thanks!  And when we ordered the bengun bhartha (eggplant dish), he suggested something else too.  We stuck to our guns though.  We were girls that knew what we wanted!

In addition to the dishes above, we shared a house salad, rice, and a tandoori roti (whole wheat bread made in the tandoor oven).  We would've ordered an appetizer of sorts (Ie: samosas) but you have to do that during certain times of the day and we missed our window for that.  (Kind of odd, huh?!)  Nonetheless, I enjoyed everything although I added a lot of hot sauce - it didn't have much kick without it.  Gotta love that hot sauce!

I really enjoy Indian food and don't eat it as often as I'd like.  It seems that many people are not up for adventurous eating... I don't get it!  Regardless, I'd come back to Tandoori Times in a heartbeat.  It didn't knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service, decent ambiance, and moderate prices.  Thanks to Kathleen M for trying something new with me!
