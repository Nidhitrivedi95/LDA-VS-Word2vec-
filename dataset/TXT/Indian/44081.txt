RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Walked over an hour to get because a guy in my hostel told me this was the best Indian / Pakistani food in Toronto. I ordered  two of the lamb chicken and beef kabobs , a side of garlic naan and a samosa .
The food was spiced and cooked to perfection .  My only qualms with this place are that the Kebabs are on the smaller side and you  can't adjust the heat level since the meat is premarinated. You can add a side of chiilis but it's not the same .

  . Whenever you go to an Indian spot and get tandoori items you usually get a green sauce as well as a sweet purple / red sauce .which I got with my kebabs here .

With the exception of the raita this place offered the best duping sauces I've ever.


I highly recommend you check this place out if you're planning to visit Toronto and have a hankering for Indian .

I'll definitely be back .
