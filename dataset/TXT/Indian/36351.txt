NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg My 1st time even heading of this place, but I love it, I got the chicken sandwich just to intoduce myself to the place, but I now realize, anytime I come to Cleveland I'll be eating here. I pray they open one in Nashville as well as other cities (I'll be researching this) great flavor, prices. I love the influx of culturally diverse casual dining places.  I normally don't eat Indian food, but this has intoduced me to even more offerings.  This is definitely a winner.
