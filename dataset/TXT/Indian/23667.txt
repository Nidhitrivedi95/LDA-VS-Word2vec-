gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A If you want true authentic Indian food Mt. Everest is hands down the best restaurant. The food is so mouth watering and flavoring you won't want to stop eating. The workers serve us with a happy attitude and the atmosphere is always so inviting. Anytime my family and I have a craving for any type of food we come and leave very satisfied!!
