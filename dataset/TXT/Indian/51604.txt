UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Always a great atmosphere. Good greetings and service that you would expect from higher end restaurants. Very well run and the food overall is by far the best Indian I've had ( am from India ) cheers. Try the lamp stir fry with your kingfisher beer. Awesome combo with the spicy lamb and beer
