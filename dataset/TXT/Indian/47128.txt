Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Glass top tables in need of Windex and the dirty stained tablecloths beneath should be laundered at least weekly. Yuck! 5 guests in the whole place, seated at three different tables. Weird that every time someone else came out of the kitchen they stirred all the dishes on the buffet table. They need to clean. The server stands at the end to pass out plates. Huh! Give that man a bucket and some sponges. Old resataurant saying "if you've got time to lean, you've got time to clean." One postive thing I can say is the tandoor chicken is not totally dried out like that served @ India Garden and the rice was moist not crunchy. Restaurant is dirty. See pics of the tablecloth and vinyl drape under the condiments.
