Hot and soup soup is delish and filling. 
Can never say no to the best chili chicken ever! I always eat it by itself, no rice. 
Their chicken pakoras are good. I never knew I liked pakoras until I tried theirs. 
General Tao chicken is yummy, definitely better than other places. 

I would suggest ordering over the phone and than picking it up as there is very little space inside and there is always people coming and going.
