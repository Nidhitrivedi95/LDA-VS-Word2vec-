WdiTi8PTMlbhRgael5bjAw Still new and figuring things out. When the food is good, it is really good. The last time we visited, I found a piece of napkin in my butter chicken. It was a fairly large piece that was cooked with the batch. The server replaced it from the same batch and then proceeded to serve more to the next customers. The naan bread is great, but the  vegan naan is not quite hitting the mark. Very nice staff and some really great food, just might need some more experience with food service.
