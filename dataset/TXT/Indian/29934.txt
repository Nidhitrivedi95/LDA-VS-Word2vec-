jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Awful place. Don't go here!! My first bite was a hard chicken bone that scratched my throat. I asked for the chef to come out so I could let him know that there was a chicken bone in my first bite and he denied there were any bones in the dish. Giving them the benefit of doubt, I took my next bite, and there again CHICKEN BONES! Chicken biryani also to be also made with white chicken meat, there meat was brown and made from thighs. They charge almost $12 for this crap too! They only refunded $8 for something when I asked for my money back. This was my worse Las Vegas food experience to date. DO NOT GO HERE!! THEY GET AN F-!!
