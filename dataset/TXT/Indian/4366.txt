1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw Best Indian restaurant in town.  Food is flavorful and always fresh.  We eat here a couple times a month and we have never been disappointed. My wife is Indian and this is her go to for food that reminds her of home.  I personally like the indochinese food.  Their gobi manchurian is incredible as is the samosa chat!
