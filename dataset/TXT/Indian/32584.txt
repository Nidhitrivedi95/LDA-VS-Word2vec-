LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Being from Brampton i am used to eating Punjabi food... PERIOD! So going out for Dosa was a different , but great experience. First off, this place is busy.. Lunch service on Fridays, Sat, Sunday only, dinner service all week. This place is veggie and no booze at all, which is fine by me. I went for a lunch service on Friday and it was a business crowd so service was quick. The service was great and the place is spotless. Being new to Dosa i had plenty of questions and the server was more then happy to discuss with me how they work. Essentially picture a medium crispy crepe lined with a variety of Indian spices, potato, mushroom etc. This comes up some chutneys and a lovely;y lentil soup.  They have kids ones as well with chocolate, sprinkles etc. 

I WILL BE BACK!!!!!
