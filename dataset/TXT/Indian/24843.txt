h2cPIifmtPD029q4sthRSQ My friend and I went here for dinner for the first time, and I was impressed. The waiter was friendly but not intrusive and the food was fantastic and they give you a decent portion, which my friend and I were able to enjoy for lunch the next day.

We ended up talking into the night, not realizing until later that it was past their closing time, and were apologetic about it, but nobody ever hinted or ushered us to leave.

Will definitely come here again.
