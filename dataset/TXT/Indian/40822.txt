PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g Amazing warm service. The best service I've honestly ever had in any restaurant in this city. Vinayak, the manager greets everyone with a warm smile as do all the staff. They don't treat you with the normal polite courtesy expected but with genuine human warmth. 

The food is exceptional. The mocktails and the cocktails are very tasty. The appetizers are creative including a baked Brie with an Indian twist. My dining partner and I had paneer makhni, paneer tikka and malai kofta and they were very tasty. Highly highly recommended. A jewel of a
Restaurant in the Bayview Eglinton area.
