VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw I just had lunch at Taj Mahal for the first time, and I'm quite sure I'll be going back.

I had actually walked past the place multiple times on my way to Food City; I was staying in the Hospitaly Suites Resort for the week, and needed to get some food, and that was the only place within walking distance. I have never eaten in an Indian restaurant, and figured it was high time to.

I finally made my way over there for lunch, and boy am I glad I did.

The front is unimpressive, a bit nicer than a normal store front, but nothing that would stand out. Once inside, however, that changes. The walls are decorated with Indian art, and the Bollywood music videos playing on some TVs give it a perfect atmosphere. I could imagine the music becoming irritating at times, depending on what was playing, but during my entire meal it was rather soothing.

Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by two different wait persons, one of whom I believe to be the manager. The place was not crowded, as some of the other reviews indicate; only two or three of the tables had people sitting at them.

For lunch, they offer daily specials; three options (at least the time I was in there). I ordered one of them, the chicken korma. 

I have to say, that meal was -very- good. I still prefer Thai food to Indian, but I can see why a few of my friends swear by Indian. I can't compare that meal to other Indian restaurants, but to this uncultured palate, it was simply good. 

Eavesdropping a bit on other conversations, I heard the man I took to be the manager speaking with someone who must have been a regular, suggesting things he might try next time. This seems like the kind of place that is looking to establish rapport with the regulars; I like that in a restaurant.

At the end of my meal, the manager asked if this had been my first time at the Taj Mahal, and we had a brief conversation about my move to Scottsdale. 

All in all, an enjoyable lunch. Highly recommended.
