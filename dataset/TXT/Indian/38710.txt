OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I don't get it... how does this place have 4 stars?
I brought my Mom, brother and sister here for lunch  yesterday and I will NEVER go back. It was all bad from the start. We were seated and given warm tap water to drink. No ice. We asked about the buffet and the waiter raved about it. I don't know why since when my brother and I took a look it was all old looking. The rice looked, um, crunchy? We decided to order fresh food from the menu. We asked the waiter what was lactose free for my bro and he went to ask the chef. He came back to tell him and then jet off before we could actually order. Then... we waited, and waited, and waited. I waved down one man and he said he would get our waiter. 30 minutes in and we finally order our food.
42 MINUTES LATER (yes, I counted) I was angry. We were literally the ONLY people there! When our food arrived it looked great! I was convinced the delicious food would make up for all that came before. We were starving so we dug right in with gusto. I was immediately turned off by my chicken tikka masala. The chicken was gross. Slimey and possible undercooked. The sauce is what really upset me and gave me a theory as to why our food took so long. It tasted like it was right out of a can and then simmered with some onions and peppers. But not for long enough. It lacked any real flavor at all.  I asked for it to spicy and it had no spice at all... they probably forgot to add the spice since they were "maybe" rushing to get the sauce done at all. It was by far the worst plate of Indian food I have ever had. And, by "had" I mean let sit in front of me.
Brother liked his lentil stew, sister said her paneer butter masala was ok and Mom liked her samosas.
The best thing about this whole meal was the jumbo naan. That was all I ate after two bites of that slop they served me and charged me $17 for!

$85 after tip for lunch and I left hungry and angry.
