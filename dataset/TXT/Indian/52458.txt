UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg This review is based only on food and service.  The restaurant is clean, I have no issues with the decor, but others may. So I'm saying up front, I don't care what it looks like, you just gotta get in there and get some food! 

I have been here more times than I can count, the food is AMAZING. The staff is so nice, as well, but go for the best Indian food in town. 

The naan is perfect, the samosas are delicious, and the lamb saag makes my mouth water just talking about it.  I also really enjoy the fried Cauliflower here. I've sampled several menu items and never once been disappointed. 

I've tried a couple other places around town, but nothing gets close to Situl. A true hidden gem in Charlotte, totally worth finding!
