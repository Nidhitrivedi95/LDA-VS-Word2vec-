rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I love Indian food and I have had a lot of it in different places in the world. I can say that the Punjab chicken curry was an absolute delight.

The service was flawless as the staff was both attentive and very professional without any pretence. All together a brilliant meal. I have found a new favourite and will keep coming back eager for more
