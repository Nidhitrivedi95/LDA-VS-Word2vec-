xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Today I took a trip to The Fry Bread House for my first taste of the famous bread.  Until just a few days back I had thought fry bread was a desert much like an elephant ear or funnel cake.  I had no idea it was used as the base for a meal (they do offer desert varieties too).

For lunch I had an Indian Taco with green chili beef, beans, cheese and the normal taco fixings only it was served on fry bread as opposed to a tortilla. The taco was tasty and the portion was large.  I paid $5 or $6 and it was well worth it.  Just think about the money that can be spent at any fast food joint and the Indian Taco becomes an even better deal.

Service was easy and fast.  I ordered, picked up my drink, grabbed a paper towel and sat down.  By the time I checked in my name was called and my taco was waiting.  

I was very impressed with The Fry Bread House and I will be returning.
