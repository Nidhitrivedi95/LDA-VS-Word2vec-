A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Love it! This place is wicked. 

For any vegetarian, this is great. They have a whole variety of food you can go regardless of your mood. Not only do they have the dosa and idly like other South Indian food restaurants but they have curries and tandoori foods like kababs. 

One of my favourite things to eat is the idly manchurian. Fried idly in a manchurian sauce is to die for.. almost. 

I have had a bunch of stuff and can't recall it all, but the other thing we like to get when we go is the Chana Batura. (I must have a thing for fried food... yum!). 

As others have mentioned, the atmosphere is a bit like a cafeteria, but once you have been a bunch of times, you barely notice it... it just feels comfortable. 

The service is very good. They are very good at refilling your water and leave behind a menu after they have taken your order. 

The biggest downer for me is finding parking. There are spots where an hour is free but trying to find them and navigate there can sometimes be a challenge for me.

Definitely worth a stop... especially for the vegetarian friends.
