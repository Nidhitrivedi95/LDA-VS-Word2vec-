8cDP0mjK0J6lk292IeKRGg My usual roti place in Scarborough is Roti Hut, but three customers suggested I try this place out.  I ordered a bonus chicken roti with a double and Kola Champagne.  I still love my Roti Hut but this place may be a bit better.  The key to a great roti is the curry, which this one had.  What I loved about this play was the moist chicken...usually well cooked and the freshness of the roti.  Highly recommended.
