8NRrrHLOWgEq4NUAcv55Cw The great reviews for this restaurant were spot on. Don't let the store front or decor prevent you from eating here. The food was delicious and hot and the service excellent. 

We had Tandoori chicken, vegetable biryani, a couple of salads and naan. 

One of my pet peeves with Indian restaurants that claim to serve Tandoori chicken is that they pre cook the chicken and reheat it just before serving. This results in dry chicken. This was not the case here. It was cooked to order. Tandoori chicken takes 20 minutes but well worth the wait. If you want great Tandoori chicken eat here.  If you want reheated chicken go to any one of dozens of other Indian restaurants or Swiss Chalet

The vegetable biryani was delicious and the naan light and crisp
