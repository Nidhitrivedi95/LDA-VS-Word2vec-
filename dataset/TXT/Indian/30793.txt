KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Passage to India has the most authentic, delicious, fresh Indian food in the valley. Hands down. My go to meal is the paneer tikka masala, daal makhani, and chicken chettinadu but honestly you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The fact it is a father and son run business with an amazing attitude and gracious service seals the deal. Not all Indian restaurants treat customers this way. Been going there for 5 years and will go there forever. I can not say enough good things about this restaurant's ambiance, service, and quality. If you're searching for a great consistent Indian restaurant you will not be disappointed.
