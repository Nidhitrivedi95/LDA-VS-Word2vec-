NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I really love everything about this place. The location, decor, and food are amazing.

Be sure to try the samosas! They are wonderful. The entire menu is good. The naan is baked fresh in tandoori ovens. You can watch them being baked as the kitchen is visible (behind a glass viewing wall). 

Overall, it's a great choice for a fast yet good Indian meal.
