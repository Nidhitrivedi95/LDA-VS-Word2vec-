SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ Stopped by for a quick bite at lunchtime. The buffet has a variety of delicious food. My favorites were the aloo gobi and the samosas. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean. A very enjoyable experience.
BTW, by noon this place was filled to capacity! And on the way out of the restaurant, there was a guy from the restaurant playing on a drum to "drum-up" business!
