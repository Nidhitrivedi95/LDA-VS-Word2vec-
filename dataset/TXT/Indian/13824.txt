BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ I purchased a $30 GroupOn for $60 worth of Himalyan Food. I didn't realize this meant a mix of Indian and Nepalese cuisine till I got to the restaurant. I was greeted by a very polite waiter, and was seated promptly. They're not busy at all on a weekend night. The tables were set up like I was eating at a fancy five-star restaurant, but the interior design was very plain with a few paintings illustrating the Himalayan mountains/culture. 

The appetizer we ordered was the Chef's Assortment, and all of the meat was dry. I did not enjoy that. Our main course came - the Chicken Tikki Masala and Lamb Roti - accompanied with Naan bread with minced meat in it. Now, that was delicious! I was so full, despite the portions looking small. I could have just skipped the appetizer. I ordered the Mango Lassi in the beginning which was very filling as well. The desserts were not so great. It was either way too sweet for me, or very tasteless. 

I would come back for their lamb and naan bread because they're so noms! The service here is also excellent! I only wish they had parking. The area in front of the restaurant is for snow plowing, so take note not to park there!
