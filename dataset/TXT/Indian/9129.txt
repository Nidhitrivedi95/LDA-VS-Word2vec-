82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Another Montreal winner.  Excellent gourmet Indian cuisine. The only thing I'd say that you should consider is that various guides designate it as in the "$$" two dollar sign category in terms of cost, and we definitely found it to be a bit pricier, a "$$$"  being more appropriate-- but worth it none the less, due to fine taste, great service and welcoming ambiance.
