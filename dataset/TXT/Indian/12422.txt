I walked by this place before dinner on my way to the Eaton's center. It was so cold that I had to stop by to warm up. Inside I saw the menu and decided to try the chicken tikka roll.

Now the wait here was probably 15-20 minutes which is way too long for a fast food joint. That was pretty disappointing, but it was worth the wait. The food was well spiced and good quality meat. I was happiest about the incredibly low prices.

If you're looking for a quick snack and want to watch a few indian music videos while you wait, this is the place to check out!
