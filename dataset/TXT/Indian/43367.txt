RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Visited Royal India Bistro an hour ago with my girlfriend and wanted to give this restaurant a review straight away.
Our host Rahul was really polite and helpful, the service too is impeccable! .The chef cooked a dish for me that wasn't on the menu and it came out fantastic. Ive visited a handful of Indian Restaurants in Vegas and this is the best so far. 
Thank you for our wonderful meal!
