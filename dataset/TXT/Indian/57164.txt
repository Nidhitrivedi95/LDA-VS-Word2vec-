XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Really Really solid Rotis! (Duh)

-I've been here several times and tried the butter chicken and Sag Paneer Rotis as well as the soup and the chai tea. The prices are fair so don't expect the cheapest roti in the city but the portions are huge. Each Roti is easily enough for two meals!  

-I mostly get takeout from Mother India but I've eaten in once or twice. It is decent and the service is fairly attentive. The decor is nothing special thought. 

Recommended!
