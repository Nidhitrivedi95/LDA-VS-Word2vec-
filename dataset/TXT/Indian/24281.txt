gyGHpCcdzLPPZnXn1Pj7IQ After being recommended  by a friend, i gave it a try today. It is take out place with 5 item menu, a biryani and 4 type of wraps. the gentleman at the counter  asked me if i like spicy biryani which i wanted.  Later it turned out not that spicy. The taste is okay, i have had better in other places. The chicken boti wrap was good though. The wraps reminded me the wraps back home in Pakistan.
