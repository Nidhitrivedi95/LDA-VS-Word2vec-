GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw I tried their lunch buffett, and the food was decent- not horrible but also not amazing. There's a good variety of vegetarian and meat (mostly chicken) dishes on one section of the buffett, another section with dips, salad, and desert, and then another section with the carbs (rice, rice mixed with veggies, and naan). I also ordered a mango lassi, and this was refreshing. 

The location is by a strip mall on the Strip and across from a church. We were immediately seated. Service was okay - they were very good at filling up our water glasses but on the slow side when we were ready to get the check and pay for our meal.
