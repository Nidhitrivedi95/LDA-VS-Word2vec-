tcclqqE4T8XbgS-02vsl6A This festival was so wonderful.  The food booths were great and delicious.  My companions and myself had the buffet of the Gandhi Restaurant.  Very good.  We had fun shopping the lovely wares.  Bought several lovely "jeweled" textiles.  There was a very talented young girl who was a Henna artist.  She had done beautiful plates, artwork, candle holders etc. of exceptional artistry and loveliness.  This was called Suhenna Creations.  Not only that, but I had accidentally left my IPAD Mini at this booth and since I did not have my name or number on it, I despaired of ever seeing it again as I was not sure where I had lost it.  Luckily I emailed the organizers of this event and not only did they have it, but they so kindly returned it to me at my home.  This was so amazing and kind and reflects the caliber of this event.  I would highly recommend this festival for a fantastic taste of India.  A great time was had by all.
