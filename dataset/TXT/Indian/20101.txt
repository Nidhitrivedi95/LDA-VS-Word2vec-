FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Maharani's lunch buffet has a large selection, and based on the clientele, it seems appropriate for both Indian and non-Indian palates. I don't claim to know Indian food well, but I tried two Indian restaurants in Madison, and I preferred the other, though the food here was not bad by any standards. I really enjoyed the goat curry.
