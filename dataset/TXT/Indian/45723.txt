scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Best Indian we've had in Madison. The shahi paneer is especially good. We typically prefer vegetarian options when ordering Indian food. Lentil dishes tend to be a bit over cooked. And the aloo ghobi lacks flavor. But there are lots of other good dishes to choose from. And whether you dine in or pick up takeout, there's always great service.
