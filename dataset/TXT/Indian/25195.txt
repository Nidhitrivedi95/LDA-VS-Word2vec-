HF-fLG3QaNepY151QKDNLA Real good Indian restaurant deep in Brampton.  Does not look the greatest from the outside/interior is old; but food speaks volumes.  Tandoori chicken is actually cooked in the tandoor and not in an oven and proclaimed to be made in tandoor like many Indian restaurants do.
Butter Chicken-  very good 4/5
Naan Bread- nice thin and crispy 4/5
Rashemi Kebab- Juicy and flavorful 5/5
Full Tandoori Chicken- Excellent, cooked to perfection, juicy 4/5
