YNut5B1o3FDtcdzwf9F_bw We ordered chillie chicken and kadhai chicken and asked them to make the food medium spicy.
They made chillie chicken too spicy to eat, it was just too hot. The spice rating could be easily 10/10.Unfortunately I had placed to go order as we were in a hurry else I would have returned this order.
Kadhai chicken was ok..garlic naan was not that soft.
