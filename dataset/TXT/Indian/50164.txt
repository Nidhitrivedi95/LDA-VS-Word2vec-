uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA Very very slow service. Food is all soggy. Vegetable pakora has uncooked dough inside.... If you do delivery it will take almost 2 hours to get to your place, and when you call and ask you get angry response. This is really a big disappointment. I strongly recommend you pick somewhere else.
