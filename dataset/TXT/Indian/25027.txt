H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ This is hands down the best Indian food in all of Phoenix. I've lived here for 1.5 years and made a point of trying every Indian restaurant in the area to find the best place.  This restaurant easily takes the cake...or naan for that matter. Lunch buffet is a great deal but dinner that's where they really shine.  The service is great and Sam stands out as probably the most accommodating server I've ever had. The food is authentic and consistent.  Lamb pepper fry is amazing..Bindi Marsala to die for.  Fresh food and quality ingredients is what this place is all about.  The naan is made in house and the aromatic spices just calls your name leaving you with a taste in your mouth in a way only a true Indian restaurant could. They have live music occasionally..just be sure to make reservations cause they fill up quick.
