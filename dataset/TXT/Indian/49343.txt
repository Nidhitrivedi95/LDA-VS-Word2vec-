tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My new favorite Indian restaurant!!! 
My son and I have been here twice since we discovered it two weeks ago.
The buffet is huge, with several selections with chicken and lamb and several selections vegetarian.
The service is excellent and the staff is wonderful.
The owner stops by to make sure all is good and your happy.
So deserving of five stars!
