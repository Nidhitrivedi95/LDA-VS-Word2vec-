ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Listen, this is not glamourous food. This is good cheap eats Indian style. 

The paper roll dosa is divine, the spinach/mint one is sublime. I have never ventured out of the dosa arena at this place because they are just so damn good I haven't felt the need to. I literally find reasons to walk my ass up to the annex around lunch time to have an excuse to go here. I even gave some dosa to my 7 month old because I think it's that damn good. 

Forget Banjara which has gone very down hill over the past few years. Madras Masala is where it's at!
