This place has never been our favourite Indian option as far as flavour goes, but for a local place where we can get some takeout it more than fit the bill.

Unfortunately, on our last couple of visits the naan has been extremely rubbery and we've felt like they have really skimped on the content of our dishes that we ordered. Our Shahi Paneer on the most recent occasion contained a mere FIVE chunks of paneer in a sea of sauce. Sorry guys, but when you're charging slightly higher prices than average for your entree portions already, I expect more than 5 cubes of cheese for my money. On our previous visit we fared a little better, with seven bits, but it's still not very much is it? 

Mantra Masala's food is generally OK, perhaps not quite as tasty as some of our favourites, but in terms of value they are going downhill fast, to a point that not even their proximity to my home will call me back.
