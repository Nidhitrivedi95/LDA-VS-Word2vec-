Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag My family decided to eat here today, and took me along. I love Indian food so I was very pleased with the restaurant choice. This is a very cute location across the street from the Container Park. Walking in through the bar is nice, but the dining area is dim and in need of some art work to brighten up the walls. 

Our waitress was very attentive, and got us our White Linen drinks (a patented specialty drink with white cranberry and elderflower) and orders in very quickly. The staff was extremely knowledgeable on veganism and what items are, and are not. 

Our food arrived in a timely manner. Everyone at my table ordered the lunch specials. I asked for mine to be Very Spicy, and was slightly disappointed since it wasn't quite as spicy as I hoped. However, the flavors were incredible. This had to be one of the best vindaloos that I've had in Las Vegas, and I've had quite a number. 

By the end of our meal, everything had been devoured. We left happy and full and will definitely be coming back again.
