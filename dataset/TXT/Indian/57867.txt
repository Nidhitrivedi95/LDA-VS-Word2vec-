yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw a precious, authentic, little wonder. 

went with my family from out of town and was worried my dad would be disappointed with the relatively conservative portion sizes. however- when you treat your taste buds with something so exquisite, you don't want to overwhelm them with massive platters of ambrosia. And -even though when they delivered the small bowls of tear-jerkingly-delectable curry we wondered if we would need to order more--we actually had enough to take home. 

Plus, when filling up the takeout boxes, we found ourselves shamelessly scraping the bottom of each and every quaint little bowl. 

Why only 4 stars? I haven't tried everything and look forward to updating this with another happy stomach and an additional star. Prices may be seen as somewhat steep for the quantity of food. But again I say, quality my friends, quality.
