tt1ERGD9RSfQIwX2ANyJ1g Bombay Spice is the first Indian restaurant I have enjoyed eating at. My issue with most, is that the food is very heavy and greasy. Bombay's food is light, filling, and taste AMAZING!! While I too preferred the old restaurant and menu, I don't mind their new spin. Having Celiac's Disease, it is NOT easy to find an inexpensive quick place to grab a bite. I have eaten here many times in the three years I've lived in Phoenix and never once have I gotten sick. The staff is amazing in making sure that clean utensils and gloves are used to avoid cross contamination. Also, there are many options available. Its not a place where if you'r a vegan or celiac you can only have one thing. If you've never been, now it the time! Enjoy.
