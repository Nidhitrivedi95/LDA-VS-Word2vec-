UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This place is overrated! We went for the lunch buffet, food was cold and so was the staff. I was waiting for my drink order for close to 20 minutes. They acclaim for their lassi bar , but my suggestion would be to stay away from it. Rather go for any other indian place in your own city/ town inspite of trying it in las vegas.
