MWcN6qLWTfRJqLySxwJNqQ Not bad, not the best ever. I've been here a couple times since I came for a work function and I've always been satisfied with what I've ordered, but always disliked the amount of my bill. I think after coming here a few times I've decided that the price is not worth what you get. Which is disappointing because the service is nice. But I just feel that the cost vs. quality/experience you get is not worth it. :(
