GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I work very close to this restaurant. I have eaten here many, many times. The service is not always the best but the food has always been excellent. In my opinion the food is MUCH better than the Maharaja Palace. I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal here. I also work with many people from India and they all love the place. To me that is a good sign. The only down side I have ever seen here is the service. Like one of the reviewers said before, I have had issues with being charged wrong, etc. I would recommend it for anyone that loves Indian food like I do.
