zI9XhdRLVkL9leCCIrLZ7w Was over this unexplored side of town last weekend and I'm glad we went for a curry, rather than the usual Chinese take away. The little restaurant near Haymarket, not really one for the tourists but is a great piece of local knowledge (taps nose like a prick).

I absolutely enjoyed every piece of it, service was brilliant, warm and welcoming and so fast that it made me a little suspicious.. Warm atmosphere and reasonably priced..
