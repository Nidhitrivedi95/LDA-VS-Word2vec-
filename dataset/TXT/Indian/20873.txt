gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw Place is located at one of the happening street and open till late. In appetizer, karari bhindi and bhati chicken is a must try...am a repeat visitor and always order at least these two dishes. Really love the taste and the way its cooked...however would rate the service as average. Also, didn't like Cauliflower Manchurian in appetizer
