0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Went here on the recommendation of an Enterprise rent-a-car employee when I was dropping off a rental...she said it was awesome, but she obviously doesn't know good indian! 

I had the worst stomach-ache ever after eating here. Seriously, the ONLY time I have EVER thought I might throw up after eating a meal!

I was the only person eating here at about 6:00 PM for buffet, if that says anything. 

Selection was poor, but tasted OK. Waiter/owner suggested an Indian beer (I had never had one) and turned out to cost like $18 (yes it was an oversize bottle, but still!)

There was a bug in my cup of water also...

India Oven in Mesa is SO much better and still worth the drive!
