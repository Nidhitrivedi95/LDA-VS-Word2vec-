kTJEf56gjzBSpi9X14X54Q WOW! You know a place has great food when you come for lunch and end up coming back for dinner....the same day. 

I grew up in Flushing, Queens- home of the Indians and can speak to legit South Indian food. This is better than what I've had in Queens and Manhattan. The owners/cooks/husband-wife combo are very nice and the husband is hilarious. We are from out of town but have made it a point to come here whenever in the area.

Highly recommended!
