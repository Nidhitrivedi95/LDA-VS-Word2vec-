ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I must say I was surprised by Angara India Spice Grill tonight. I arrived around 8:15p and there was only 1 couple sitting in the restaurant. Unsure if I wanted take out or dine in, I took a few moments to browse the menu and look around. The restaurant lights were low, however it was clean and tidy with table dressings. So far so good, I'm thinking in my head. I finally decided to dine in, and in glad I did! Water was offered immediately, along with the flat bread and spices and menu. I must add that it did take roughly 5-7 mins. to be seated due to there only being 1 server doing it all...taking phone orders and servicing the dining area, but later turned into two servers. Let me fast forward, after ordering around 8:30p the food took 15-20 mins to prepare and was served nice and hot. I enjoyed the level 5 spice from 1-10, and it wasn't spicy at all. This could have been a plus because, I was able to enjoy the flavors and freshness of the chicken Tikka Masala & garlic naan breard with a side of rice. Yes, I had plenty of carbs tonight, and all for under $25.00 with a 20% tip ;-) If, you were to ask would I return, I'd have to say YES, with family and friends. BTW, portions are a nice size and can be shared by two easily!

Sorry pic is dark, my camera battery was giving out on me. Enjoy if you plan on going!
