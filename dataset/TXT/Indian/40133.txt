PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw Looking for something to eat around downtown Edinburgh we found this Nepalese place among Pubs and food chains. Good warm food, at reasonable prices. I had a mild chicken order and didn't get disappointed . When you there order the Nepalese section of the menu as the Indian part you can find anywhere else
