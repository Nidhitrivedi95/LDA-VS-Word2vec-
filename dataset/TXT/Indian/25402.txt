HhJ9BQIWdDnpuvdwlMRoNQ I decided to give Flavors of India a try.  Its close to where I work downtown and I work with a bunch of guys from India, so why not give it a try.  It's a very small take out place with about 6-8 dishes.  There are some other things like wraps, etc.  They had a special of 1 chicken dish with rice & naan for $6 bucks so how can you go wrong with that.  I ordered the chicken curry.  The portion size was a little small but the curry was very flavorful.  The naan had been sitting around and could have stood to be reheated a bit.  But overall not a bad place.  Since I'm not too knowledgeable about Indian Cuisine I'll have to bring some of my coworkers here and see what they think.  There are not too many Indian places downtown and Flavors of India is pretty OK.
