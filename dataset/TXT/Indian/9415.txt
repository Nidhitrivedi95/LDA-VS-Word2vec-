8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg The food is very good, I would give the restaurant a 4.5 rating.  But the last two times we went to this place, we had to grab a waiter, demand to order, and BOTH times, we left after 30+ min of waiting for our food.  So if you are visiting off-hours, its a good place.  They are doing a lot of carryout and the in-store customers are lower priority.
