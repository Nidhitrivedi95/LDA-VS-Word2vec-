2ZmZbmsTRHogSZR-nJY_Fw Very bad service. Total disappointment after waiting for a biriyani more than an hour and later they say no food. No value for the customer's. Chats were yuck, dosa's are good. Chicken biriyani is 1/4 th quantity of what other restaurant's serve.
I dont see why they say unlimitted dinner buffet when they can give us only one serving.
If you think you would be really hungry please be at Nasha at 5pm to get 2 servings of food at 9pm.
