La_yPXZpdIJINeDEP-THLA Have been here 5 times. Nawab Indian Cuisine is officially my favorite Indian restaurant. One of the servers recognized me and my boyfriend, and initiated a conversation to see how we were doing and welcomed us, even though he wasn't our current server. The service is absolutely great. Food is so delicious. Can't get enough of this place! 5 of out 5!
