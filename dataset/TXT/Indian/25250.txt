hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q I normally go to Raj Mahal but was disappointed to see when I Googled their menu to place my order that they are permanently closed. First time at this place and was disappointed with the food.  I ordered take out and when I got there at 7 pm there was only 1 table with people at it. My garlic naan tasted like it had been reheated in a microwave - it had that tough texture bread takes on when it is microwaved. The eggplant masala was a liquidy mush.  The bhindi masala was ok.  I will be making the drive to Jaipur Junction next time.
