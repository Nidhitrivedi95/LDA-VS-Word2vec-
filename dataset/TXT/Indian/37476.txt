OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Amazing food. This is some of the best Indian food I've had outside of India. The service was very friendly too, and they welcomed us in even though we got there right before closing time.  I felt the portions were a bit small, but the quality made up for it. Not very cheap, but fair prices.
