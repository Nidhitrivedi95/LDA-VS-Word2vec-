A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA Enjoyed coming here for the first time for a late lunch. Choose the buffet (very affordable lunch option) and the bread they brought out was amazing! 

The owner was very nice and I enjoyed talking to him for a few minutes before leaving.

The only negative was the service was lacking. There was a drink at our table that didn't get refilled for over a half hour, but we had water to work with. 

Not worth traveling a long distance, but if you live close, worth coming at the lunch buffet price (7.99).
