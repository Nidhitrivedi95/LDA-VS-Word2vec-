9MpWhQOYziJ38EB7MctxcA As near full-time vegetarian I eat a great deal of Indian food. I've lived in 3 major cities and in all my time eating Indian take-out (which is fairly frequent, I'd say monthly) I've never been charged for rice. So, spending 40 bucks for 3 veggie entrees and not having rice included is a no-go for me. For the price-to-portion ratio, I am GREATLY disappointed in Cafe Tandoor.
