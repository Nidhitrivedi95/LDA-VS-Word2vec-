To begin with we had the typical so called Indian street food "pani-puri" and the chutney water which is to be served with is was really authentic. This is a must have for starters. They also had samosas in the buffet. Being a big fan of meat, I directly jumped over to the meat section of their buffet. I was looking out for the usual tandoori chicken which they did not serve on Saturday, but instead they had something that's called Chicken chops. This was probably the 1st time i have had the chops at an Indian buffet place. They are a must have for meat lovers. The chops were made from Indian spices and were truly delicious. They had goat curry, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala and the pepper chicken. Tried all of them and they were really good. The pepper chicken was so well cooked, it forced me to have them again in the second serving. They also had fish fillets which were very tasty. The layered coating on the fish had good spices to it. Also, for their deserts they have malai gulab jamun which is something you usually don't get to have at the other Indian buffet places. The desert were fresh and warm enough. Not to forget they were tasty too. 

I did not eat much from their variety of vegetarian food on the buffet menu. They had puri, sambar, veg noodles, spinach with green beans, papad, and vegetable biryani. But if you are a meat lover, then this is your place to go. Try the goat curry if you have never had it. The service is good. The server politely asked if we wanted water / soda. Also to let you know the indian bread (naan) is served on your table each time. We had to ask for napkins however since those were not on our table.

The ambiance is decent. You can go in a group to this place. The pricing is $$ on the lunch buffet.
