bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A I visit this place very often for the lunch buffet. There is a wide variety of veg and vegan dishes in both North and South indian cuisine. To start with there is salad, veg fritters and chaat (north indian snack). The main course has naan (bread), 2 different gravies, a rice dish, 2-3 gravies to eat with plain rice and a curry. You get a choice of dosa (crepe) between plain and stuffed which are both equally good. There is also a desert and a fruit to finish the meal. Sometimes the service is very slow and the waitresses do not clear the plates and take time to bring the check. But overall very yummy and satisfying food. Not just vegetarian folks, but even meat-eaters like this place from what I have seen. Definitely a must-visit!
