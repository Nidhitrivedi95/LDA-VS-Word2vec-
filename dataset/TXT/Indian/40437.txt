PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA I live just a mile or so away from Taj and I can't believe I haven't tried this place before now.   i frequent the Southern Indian takeout place that isn't too far from here, but today, I was in the mood to "eat-in" and thought that I would try this place out.  I stopped in on a weeknight, early evening.   There were a few other diners in the restaurant.  I was seated promptly.  I must say, the restaurant was clean, carpet, cloth tablecovers, glass overlay, cloth napkins, water GLASSES, not cups.  The menu is huge and includes Northern and Southern Indian entrees.   I opted for the Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala and Paratha flatbread.   The Samosas (2) were delicious, a little different than I expected but very good.  I'm pretty sure that the outside was a wonton wrapper and then filled with a delicious potato mixture, that was nicely spiced and mild in flavor and freshly cooked, not reheated.  There were two dipping sauces, one was a bit sweet, like hoisin sauce and the other was some type of mild green chile sauce (I would have preferred a yogurt based sauce).  The main entree arrived shortly thereafter.  Nice portion of Chicken Tikka and huge portion of perfectly cooked, fluffy basmati rice.   The Tikka sauce was zesty and flavorful, with just the tiniest bit of heat at the very end.  The chicken was tender and juicy.   There was enough that I ate until I was full and then still had more than 1/2 remaining to take home.  The Paratha bread was excellent, homemade and cooked in the tandoori.  Nice fluffy layers, brushed with butter.    My water glass was never empty, service was prompt & efficient.  All-in-all, this was a great meal.  I will definitely go back.
