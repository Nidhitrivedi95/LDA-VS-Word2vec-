JHTzeOsZse-g3xkUM20nxQ Been here a few times, its fairly consistent for a hotel bar/restaurant type of venue.
The prices are a bit high, but expected and the staff are great and the bunch of them have been here for years. 
The buffet breakfast is really simple but very well done and the food is always great. Make sure to try and get a breakfast voucher if you can to get it for free. (applies to corporate stays i think).

I have also had the butter chicken, not bad but not what I was expecting.. It's better in Vancouver in my opinion, although the presentation was good and it was prepared with white meat not dark.

Tonight though I had the nacho's and was a little disappointed, the nachos only had a top coating of cheese (which was presented nice and spiced well) underneath its just cheap style chips (in my opinion) I am guessing they may be a normal chip around here, but in Vancouver those are bulk chips.. See the pictures..

You got to love these guys though!  After I wrote this review the manager came by and asked if I wanted more cheese melted on them.. gotta love that!!!
Still totally worth a visit if your in the hotel..

Came back again, because I am trapped here in the hotel.. I had the steak sand which, asked if they could do it without the advertised teriyaki and they were happy to accommodate! Turned out to be one of the best steak sandwiches I've ever had. I like that its smaller and the taste was awesome. Upgraded to 4 stars.
