tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I'm typing this from deep in the haze of a food coma after visiting India Oven.  We took the whole family and oh my......for $11.95 this is the best dinner deal in town!  All the meat dishes were delicious, of course, but honestly I think the vegetable korma was my favorite thing.  The mango pineapple custard was amazing too.  Tea, mango lassi, and endless garlic naan included......get down there!
