FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw This is my Indian home food in Madison away from my home city of Kolkata. I eat here when I want to have authentic Indian food which is sorely missing in many other restaurants in Madison. The best Indian food Madison has to offer, for sure. Great food, great service and I will recommend to anyone wholeheartedly.
