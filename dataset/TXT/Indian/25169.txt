hbzVZzrEeREZsd2jzwL1YA Nice sleek new vegetarian dosa restaurant on the edge of Markham. The menu is very diverse, it has alot of great options. I wouldn't say unique options, as I've seen all them before in other South Asian restaurants.

The dosas are the perfect size. One is enough to share for 2 I would say. All the dosas we got had a potato curry inside of it which was a nice surprise. They were perfectly crisp and very cheap.

I loved all the external curries we got. The paneer was absolutely delicious, and was the perfect size especially since we were eating it with already filling dosas. 

I would skip the appetizers and drinks. The vadais we got tasted the same as any other cheap south Asian eat place. The lassi was also alright, not too unique.

The best part of this place was the price! We order 3 dosas, 1 curry, 1 lassi and a plate of vadais and the bill came to under 50$! What a steal! The service was good, nothing to say. We got all our food in under 15 minutes.
