i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ In short- Awesome & Outstanding Andhra food with horrible service.

I love South Indian Cuisine, and Godavari has really authentic Andhra cuisine and they serve top notch food. But the service here is pathetic and that would be the reason, that even after have such an exceptional food they are not popular. The servers are not efficient and inattentive, they purposely ignore you, and there is not manager present at sight. Its a BYOW and their portions are large.
