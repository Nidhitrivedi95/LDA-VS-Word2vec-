llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg I was so excited for this place, but I wasn't happy with my first experience there. First, my Masala tea came out lukewarm. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Sag for my entree, and for spiciness I initially said, "spicy", but the waiter gave me a sideways look, so I clarified to "a 7 out of 10". Perhaps he didn't understand, because it came very mild, almost not spicy at all. There wasn't much meat in it, overall probably a small chicken breast worth, and what was there was dry and fairly bland. Given the 12.95 price, I expected a lot more. I also ordered cheese stuffed naan, which did not arrive with my entree. I think when I mentioned it they put in the order, because it came out several minutes later. This, too was pretty so-so: there was almost no cheese in it at all.

I'm willing to give this place another chance -- perhaps the buffet is much better -- but almost everything was disappointing this time.
