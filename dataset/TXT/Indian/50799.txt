ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w We seem to end up here alot. Great patio. Love the veggie burger. And the curries are outstanding. Pinot grigio and beer are cold. Wings are great, not a huge fan of the pizza, Found it a little cardboardy (is that a word?) I'll stick to Danforth pizza house or pizza libretto for the pizza. Went for the first time last week for brunch. Had the standard eggs, home fries, toast. They were exactly as I had asked. Will be back.
