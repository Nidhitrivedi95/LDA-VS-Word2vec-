UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA If I could give more than 5 stars I certainly would! Indian good is absolutely one of my favorite cuisines, and The Mint is most definitely the best in Vegas. I have dined at nearly all the Indian restaurants around town and as a Concierge it is my job to know the best places to dine in the city. I always refer my guests here for the authentic amazing food and genuine service. I can't wait until my next dining experience! If you like to try new things I highly recommend one of the tasting experiences you will not be disappointed!
