-qfZdXO2c-GpvOhr0KmNCg Hello! Tried Guru for the first time, based on reviews. I ordered the following:

- Lamb Vindaloo with naan and rice
- Lassi

The lamb was tender and flavorful. The potatoes were a bit tough. The curry, however, was disappointing. I've had Vindaloo in Goa, India (origin of Vindaloo). Sadly, Guru's Vindaloo doesn't make the cut. 

Lassi was good - tasty, fresh, frothy. 

Naan was a bit on the thicker side. I'm from India and have had some mind-boggling naans at 'Dhabas' (roadside restaurants). 

Rice was fluffy and flavorful. 

I may try some of the other dishes at Guru's eventually, but won't be rushing back.
