0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg Just Wow!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE this spot!  I ordered take out to try it out and it was surprisingly delicious.  The chicken tikka masala was cooked to perfection.  I'm got it hot and it was very spicy, which was perfect for me.  The garlic & butter naan is a must to try.  I definitely will be back again.
