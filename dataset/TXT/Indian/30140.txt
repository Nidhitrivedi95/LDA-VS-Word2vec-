JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng When nine Elite Yelpers decend on your restaurant, you're going to have a tough time. I think the strong scent of curry as we walked into Aroma had us convinced that the food was going to be on point.

The restaurant was able to put a table together for us on short notice which was super helpful and while it was a little crowded, it wasn't bad at all.

A curried baby corn appetizer was followed by curries, dosa, naan and more. Everyone really loved their meals and my Chicken Korma was excellent. A very good portion and nicely stocked with big pieces of white and dark meat chicken. Very flavorful and delicious. There was plenty of rice to go around. The garlic naan was also quite good in flavor, though I thought it was perhaps a little underdone.

Keeping it all organized and straight was tough. Four stars for a great restaurant, but maybe a better experience for a smaller party. I think they were a little strained getting nine of us taken care of together.
