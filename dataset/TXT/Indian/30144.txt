JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng The food here is delicious! Lots of options on the lunch buffet, with and without meat, spicy and less spicy. All of it was great - I ate one plate and was so full, but I wished I could have eaten more! We had to wait a few minutes for our drinks, and the owner was so apologetic that he comped one of our meals. It was so kind, we really weren't bothered by the wait but he insisted! Good food, good people.
