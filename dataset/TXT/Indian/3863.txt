0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I love the food here. I used a Groupon, which was 8 buffet meals for 8 bucks, with the purchase of a drink. It was a super great deal. In my perspective, Indian food is really heavy, so im glad that I got the chance to sit and take my time, as well as eat as much as I want. The chicken tikka marsala is great. It is my favorite, and the only thing I eat at indian restaurant, so I think i have a good idea of the differences between good and bad chicken tikka marsala. The chicken is very well marinated and tender. The service can be improved from my perspective. ..my water was not refilled once during the whole time I was there. Also, I feel like they did not have a good attitude towards me and my friend. I am not sure why though. Other than the service (and how warm it was inside - I was sweating while eating), I would come back (using the Groupon for the great deal course)! Tip: come during the evening - less people and a lot of food
