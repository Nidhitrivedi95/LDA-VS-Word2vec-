ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw If I was rating solely on food quality and taste, I would give 5 stars. Adding in pricing and service makes me remove 2 of those stars, though.

The website currently says there is a drawing for tickets to London, which the waiter says was 2+ years outdated. Listed right below that on the website is the happy hour deals, and we would not have been offered those had we not known to ask. I felt as if the waiter was doing us some kind of favor by taking our order. Aloof would be my best descriptive word.

I would highly recommend the chicken chilli fry appetizer. Delicious! The lamb curry and black lentil makhani were very good also. I was very disappointed that the carrot cigar dessert has been discontinued. That was the main reason I wanted to go today. I did not even try to use the Yelp coupon after reading the complications people have run into on other reviews.

If you are visiting and staying on the Strip, this restaurant is very convenient. We parked about 10 feet away from the entrance. That's a plus! If you live here, I am sorry to say I would not drive out of my way to go here.
