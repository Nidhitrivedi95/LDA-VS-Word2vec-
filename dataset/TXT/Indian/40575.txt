prFx0Kg92PfPkoU8OY4KxA Really good food. We got a few different dishes for take out. 2 adults and 2 kids. It was way too much food but it was very tasty. 
Definitely made fresh. Great recipes. Staff was very nice but should have told us we had ordered enough food to feed half of Hyderabad. 
Will be going back to eat on site next time and try more options.
