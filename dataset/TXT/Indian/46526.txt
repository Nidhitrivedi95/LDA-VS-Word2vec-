SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Meh...lunch buffet was underwhelming, ambience was nonexistent. Kudos to the waitstaff for attentiveness and for trying, but promising certain food items (how can you run out of kabobs when you're a major player in the Indian buffet market!) and not delivering (thanks to the conversation my groups stayed the whole time) gets you blacklisted. Better to offer alternatives than to keep the packed house waiting on the specialty. Also pricey for the few options offered. I could have gone to Samosa Factory instead and loaded up. Not coming back any time soon.
