upV1mQ5v0wcKUuA2AY85WQ The food and service are good but my major complaint is that my friend bought me two twenty dollar gift certificates for this restaurant as a gift and the restaurant won't let you spend them at the same time. 

Now I do not understand this as my friend paid cash for the certificates I should be able to use them at once instead of having to spread them out over multiple visits. This simply a bad business practice as I have decided once I have them both spent I will not be returning or recommending this restaurant to friends.
