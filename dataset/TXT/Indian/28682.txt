jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ cold bland food. Cannot call it indian food by any standards.

These people want to make use of a prime location and want to sell stale food overpriced.

Ordered biryani, chaat and chole batura. Everything is in bad taste.

The garbanzo beans in chaat are straight out of can (cold) and the chaat has huge lumps of potato.They didn't even bother to heat garbanzo beans or properly cut/cook potatoes.

I cannot call the Biryani a biryani because it is fried rice (or just colored rice) made quick and is not a biryani.

Oil used for chole batura is stale.This is a very basic dish and they can't even get this near perfect.

Don't recommend. waste of time and money!!!
