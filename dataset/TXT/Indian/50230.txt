First of all, I'm not Indian and don't eat Indian food often.  Anyway, I really enjoyed the dinner here.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm Asian and I like Indian food, especially all the herb and spices!  The stronger smell it is, the more I would die for!  

I rarely come to this area.  Today was a good chance for me to have some nice Indian food in the Beach neighbourhood.  If it wasn't my husband who wanted to be spontaneous haha :D Sounds funny right!?  We came far away from home. Almost 10 kms. just to do laundry.  Our comforter doesn't fit in our washing machine (--").  Anyway, we like to take a walk and have a dinner while we're waiting for our laundry as we always do once a month.  Isn't it an interesting activity for a couple? :)

Ok. Come back to Delhi~ we ordered "BUTTER CHICKEN ($12.99) and MADRAS CURRY with FISH fillets ($13.99)" They didn't come with any bread or rice so we also ordered Garlic NAAN ($2.99) and Rice PULAO ($3.99).  The food was terrific!  We loved it so much.  Butter chicken was creamy and sour. The Madras curry was filled up with a ton of fish fillets.  The waiter recommended this dish if I wanted to have fish.  He said Madras normally was spicy and went well with fish.  I listened to him :) and I like it.  Anyway, for my taste, it wasn't that spicy.  The waiter noticed and offered to bring me chopped fresh chilli on the side.  Thank you for caring.  

The restaurant was a small to medium size.  They have an opened kitchen that you can see what they're doing inside.  There were not many customers when we were there but I believe that they have regular customers here.  

At first I felt the price was a bit pricey but after those things went into my stomach I couldn't say that anymore.  It was filling and great!
