prFx0Kg92PfPkoU8OY4KxA This is my favorite place to eat in Scottsdale. I love this place. The staff are wonderful and always so friendly. The portions are great for what you pay. I usually order the chicken tikka masala,  but sometimes I get the goat which is also excellent. The sauce is perfect, just enough spice (and more if you want). The naan bread was cooked perfectly. I would highly recommend the garlic naan. The basmati rice is fantastic and served in generous portions. Definitely check this place out if you like authentic indian food. I look forward to going back many many times.
