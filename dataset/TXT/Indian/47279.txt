TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ Just finished a great dinner.  Eat here if you like spicy. The place is very casual and does not appear too clean but that should  be overlooked.  The crispy beef is a must.  Very flavorful.  Ginger chicken was spicy with a huge amount of ginger, yummy. Manchurian chicken Chow Mein was very good, if again, you like spicy.  The stir fried veggies were not good as the cook used too much soy sauce (overly salty). We took home more then half the food.  A enjoyable dinner for another night.
