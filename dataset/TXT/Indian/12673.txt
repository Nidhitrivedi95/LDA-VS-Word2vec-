B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg We are always looking for a good Indian restaurant; Dhaba is okay, but I'm not sure we'd make a special trip to go there again.

We began with samosas this is maybe my favorite appetizer, snack there is. Theirs, however, was not up to par at all. First, they came out way too soon, which means they were made previously and reheated (we were there for an early dinner as we did not have lunch). They were on the greasy side, but the worst part was the taste. They had no spice whatsoever. I've had samosas just about in every major city in the country that has a population of people from southeast Asia--and I expected some spice. They were so bland, it was like eating mash potatoes in a pastry (and very little texture as well). I do want to say that when we sent the back, they were taken off of our bill.

The rest of the meal fared better; my husband and I shared an order of Chicken Tikka Masala, which was flavorful. We also shared the Vegetable Mix Curry, which also was good. The nan was a tad on the greasy side and cooled off very quickly, becoming a cracker. 

I think we're still looking for that amazing Indian restaurant...
