lz-imOl4szJQBXKo1aHpqQ Very sad that an Indian restaurant is serving things like cheese burgers and pizza. C'mon guys you can do better, I mean the South Indian food I tried is really pretty good. Also sad to see no effort has been made to change the decor since they took over from Coyaba - the vastly superior Jamaican restaurant which was previously run from the same premises. It looks more or less the same but lacking the soul and vibrancy which made Coyaba so special. To me this = laziness. I've walked past Manna Mahal many times and even on a weekend evening never seen many customers, so I guess there's a reason for the 40% discount. Overall a shame to see the wasted potential of what could have been a great restaurant. If only they'd kept things simple, stuck to good South Indian food and gave the decor a makeover.
