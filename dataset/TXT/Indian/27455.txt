IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA This is now my favourite take away and has overtaken the mighty kasbah for me. I left this a while before reviewing as I often ended up in here on the wrong side of a night out and everything is great when you are half cut. Food goggles I guess ha :D .... Anyway fast forward a few months and I have popped in here a half dozen times or so and the food is consistently amazing. The staff are really fiendly and the delivery service is quick. The restaurants decor is functional and the seating area is quite comfy with some leather sofas or an area to sit in and dine. Often while waiting we recieve complimentary poppadoms and pickles while we wait. 

There are a few stand out curries on the menu for me from what I have tried - Sabzi Chilli Dal, Hurri Mirchi Vegetables and the Vegetable Persian were great and get reordered each time we go. The veg pakoras are worth a mention in that they are great quality and there are loads of them, also served in a brown paper bag (first time i had pakora it was presented this way so in my head its how they should be served). Lastly try the Roti Boti, tandoori chicken wrapped in roti bread. These are amazing!
