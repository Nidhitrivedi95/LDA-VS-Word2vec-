CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ I am surprised they are still around. I have been here in the past, and have been consistently disappointed. I recently  tried them after almost a year, it is still the worst restaurant around. Food is stale, items like sambhar are not edible. If you are in mood for indian snack and in that parking lot, The next door curry n cake (which in my opinion is below average) shines in comparison.
