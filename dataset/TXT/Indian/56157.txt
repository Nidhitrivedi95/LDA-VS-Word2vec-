xMhpJZaj4QT1Soh76-E2CA OK, so here's the deal.  I actually loved the food here.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  The person behind the counter was friendly.  But I would NEVER eat-in again.  When we drove up their were small children playing in the back parking lot, then once inside I noticed a wall that had crayon writing all over it.  Then to my surprise the small half naked children who were playing in the parking lot were now inside with the customers.  The continued to play and romp around half naked.  At one point I looked up and saw a child's bare bottom, which may have scarred me for life.

This is a good place to get to go food from, but not a place to sit and dine in.
