9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w We had almost all the appetizers on their menu and tasted some of the freshest and delicious dishes we had in a very long time. The spices are balanced, dishes are well portioned and prices are reasonable. We did not venture out to the main course in this visit but going by the quality of the starters the entrees are sure to be good. Service is friendly and quick. This place sure deserves a visit. We look forward to the next visit.
