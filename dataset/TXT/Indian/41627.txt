Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g First approached this place a week ago when i first passed it and didnt think much of it. However, everything soon changed after i ate lunch here at 3pm on a Thursday. My brother and i ordered chili chicken, szechwan chicken rice, and a dry spicy beef. The food tasted fresh, chili chicken came with a beautiful spicy sauce, the beef was crisp and spiced perfectly. Its a cozy restaurant. It was a little pricey but you get both quality and quantity. Our server was polite and courteous. Would gladly recommend coming to Everest and will be back.
