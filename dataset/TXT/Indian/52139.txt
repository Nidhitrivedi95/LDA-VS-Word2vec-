UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I've been here many times for dinner, but not buffet.  This review is for the lunch buffet.

There were many items in the buffet line, ranging from vegetarian to meat courses. 

The quality and taste of the dishes exceed my expectations even more now.  I love goat karahi.  I have been to many Indian restaurants where the goat karahi isn't consistent.  I know I can count on Mint to make sure that each piece is tender and flavorful.  I mixed my tender chunks of goat meat with slices of onions and cucumbers, then squeezed lemon on them and tossed it around some more. It was delicious, and the naan was great as well.  

However, goat karahi wasn't the only star on today's menu (according to me, of course).  I have tried tandoori chicken at many places, but I find it lacks flavor.  When Debbie said that the tandoori chicken is her favorite, I decided to grab a piece to give it a try.  Boy was I glad Debbie raved about it.  It was SOOOOO GOOOOD!  I tore off a piece of this delicious chicken that bursted with flavor and put it on top of freshly baked garlic naan. I then dipped it into the tamarind chutney and wala, yummy-in-my-tummy.  

I was full at this point, but still had to eat my favorite dessert, khir.  I was super excited to see this in the  buffet line.  I love the basmati rice, slow cooked in milk with a dash of cardamom.  I got two servings, one for Roland, and one for myself.  Somehow, they both ended up being consumed by me...Oops...Khir...I can't help myself.

I also had the Lal Mohan.  Again, tried this at other places, never liked it.  Luckily, Debbie also raved about this so I gave it a shot...thank goodness I tried it because it is DELICIOUS.

And the staff, attentive and friendly, as always.
