Service - friendly, warm and personable. It's unhurried (which is something I'm not used to), but I realized I just needed to take a breath, and relax. 

Food - more on par with the fare on Elm Street than Eat Fresh Be Healthy's fast food neighbours! Like the service, great care is taken and Chef Dan prepares everything from scratch. In chatting with the Chef, even the pasta is made in-house, and the daily specials reflect what is in-season. Food presentation is a standout.

The takeout prices are beyond reasonable, though be prepared as eat-in dinner prices are higher. I took my family here for brunch on a weekend and not only do they take reservations, but the food was outstanding, and a great alternative to the hectic rushes elsewhere.
