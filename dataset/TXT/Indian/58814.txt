YPmBp9Q0bl-BO-bD4zw4WA To be honest, I just wanted to wax a little more lyrical about Itihaas - and how delicious it's offerins are. Although the boy wasn't overwhelmed by his prawn puree starter or chicken tikka masalla (by his own admission, he 'got what he expected'), I was so excited about mine - from the salmon tikka to start - delicious with enough kick to keep me on my non spicy toes, to my saag aloo (by god I think they got the potato from heaven it tasted so good) and one of the most enjoyable chana massallams I've had in a while. I enjoyed every single bite.
