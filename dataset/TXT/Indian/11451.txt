AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw x2 what Tony said.

Pretty good but not quite sure it's worth the drive to Parkdale (hyuk-yuk)

The beef dumplings were fairly hideous. Thick skinned and bland, not fresh tasting whatsoever.

The Sample Sizzler platter thing was decent. $12.99 for a large naan and a sample plate with tandoori chicken pieces, tandoori tofu, and some beef sausage.

Everything about this place was just completely 3 stars, I really can't find fault with anything but there was no OMNOMNOM factor.

I did, however, enjoy the gossip.
