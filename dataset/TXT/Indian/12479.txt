+1 for being easy on the eyes (finally, an aesthetic improvement to this strip of Yonge a.k.a. Dresses-That-Look-Like-Belts 'R' Us and Payday Loans-ville)
+1 for a number of vegetarian options
-1 for the super long wait time
-1 for no acknowledgement of the super long wait time
0 for decent food but nothing to write home about

We walked in to a spacious, well-decorated and almost empty restaurant, ordering two rolls to-go. Considering the whole "street food" thing, I thought we'd be in/out/full of paneer in no time, but I was wrong. 25 minutes later I was still browsing AskReddit and wondering what was taking so long. The owner in few words told us "2 minutes", but five more passed. I was desolately about to resort to a tragic round of Candy Crush Saga when we finally got our rolls, which were about the size of lightweight collapsible travel umbrellas.

Food was good - flavourful and authentic (I think)! The paranthas were a tad oily. I liked the Achari Paneer Tikka Roll, though the enticing "spicy pickle" was hard to find. My dining partner was happy with the spice level but next time I'll eat in so I can try cooling off with the "authentic Indian ice cream" afterward. For around $6 including tax, the smaller size portions are about on par with nearby options, but hungry visitors may desire the larger size.

Pricing looks a little wacky. $5.99 for a small chicken tikka roll, but with rice & chickpeas, it's a $12.99 platter. Huh?
