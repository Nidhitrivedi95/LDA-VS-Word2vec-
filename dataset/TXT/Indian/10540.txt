The Britannia Spice Restaurant is situated just on the corner of Commercial Street. When inside, the restaurant is quite spacious and its interior certainly is influenced by the nautical history of Leith, with ships galore, memorabilia on the walls and it even has a ship's wheel! 

So, you're satisfied by the decor, but what about the food? Well, the food certainly beats the decor am afraid. The portions are generous and we did not have to wait long to get our starters and then our main courses. The starters were tasty with the pakora and samosas going down a treat! The tikka masala and jaipuri were bursting full of flavours, while the nan bread was ideal. 

The service was top notch even though the restaurant was quite busy, not full, but still busy enough to keep the staff on their toes. 

A great place to eat in Leith!
