iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA First review on Yelp!

I've been here a few times since it opened and I absolutely loved the place, food and service.
The decor, the music and the food is something I really connect to and hence the rating.
The chicken Thali is what I've ordered when I've been here.
They give you a paapad, 2 curries, one naan, a small bowl of rice and a sweet.
I love the fact that the quantity fills me just about right and I leave feeling not heavy but content.
The first time I ordered the Thali, the entrees (curries) were fantastic and the second time, one of them was alright.
I will be visiting this place again and recommend it to friends who like Indian food.
