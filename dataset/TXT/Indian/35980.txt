I was so excited for my bound to be authentic-ish Indian meal in Brampton, especially because AYCE! We got there and the restaurant was crowded, even though it was after 8 p.m. They are wildly disorganized - a huge crowd had formed and there was no system to determine who was next for a table and to divide people getting take out from people hoping to dine in. A few groups that were in there after us ended up standing in front of us, and tried to take our table before I spoke up. After waiting for about 20 minutes, there was no way I could let that happen! 

At this point, I was starving and the buffet was calling my name. A server came around to offer drinks, and I got a (delicious) mango lassi, and a glass of water before hitting the buffet. Naan also comes from the server, who unfortunately disappeared for long periods at a time, which also means that water was scarce - a huge problem for someone who can't handle so much spice.

The food was all excellent and there was quite a bit of variety - the station area was cramped though, and there was no orderly line forming. Also, they appear to fill up their take out containers from the buffet, so if you happen to be stuck behind someone filling up a HUGE styrofoam container, things can get frustrating. Combine that with my lack of water/naan refills, and I left full, but annoyed. 

I don't think I would come back after this experience - honestly, there is too much competition in this area to go somewhere that doesn't provide good service!
