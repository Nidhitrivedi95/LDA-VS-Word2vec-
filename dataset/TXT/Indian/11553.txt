ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ I love South Indian food and wanted to give this place a try because of the amazing Yelp ratings. 
This place exceeded my expectations! I went there for lunch (around 2pm) and ordered a Masala Dosa and salty lassi. The dosa was HUGE! (only $9.99) The dosa was fresh, crisp and came with sambhar, red chutney and white coconut chutney. The lassi was pretty good too ($2.50)!
The ambience was great! They were playing the latest Bollywood music :) 
If you live in Toronto, give this place a try instead of commuting all the way to Gurulakshmi in Mississauga (which is overrated in my opinion).
