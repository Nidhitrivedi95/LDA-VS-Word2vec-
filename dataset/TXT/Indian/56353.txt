XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw 3.5*, pumped up for friendly and hospitable servers!  

Momos = straight up Dumplings.  Just under a different name and it was accompanied by pickled strips of daikon/carrots and this light orange coloured chilli sauce.

I came here during their "Momo Munch Fest" where 100% of their proceeds went back to their community.  However, I feel as if I came on the wrong night as momos (steamed, beef) were literally the ONLY thing on their menu - saved pop, tea, water, & some of their chicken soup.

So since their menu was so limiting, I shared a plate with a of momos with a friend and we ended up eating elsewhere.

I loved the skin of the momos.  They seemed to be made in-house.  However, I found the beef stuffing a tad dry and tasteless.  The sauce/pickled veg on the side definitely helped!  

I'm not sure how they're supposed to taste in Tibet, but in China, they innards are definitely more tasty!  So momos alone, about a 3*, but all the servers were lovely and very welcoming during their charity event.
