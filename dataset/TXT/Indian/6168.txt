I have came to this place several times, and I return every time I get bored of bland everyday food, and I need spicy flavors with the kind of kick that jolts me out of my culinary boredom. For that effect I specially recommend the Chicken Makhani and Malai Kofta; I usually don't care much for the meat and just get the sauce and dip the Biryani garlic bread in it, then I frantically reach for my ice cold Coke (keep it close). The seasoned rice is also great. Warm atmosphere, friendly service, overall very good experience.
