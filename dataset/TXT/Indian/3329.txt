0Hy2VE9tqTo4QbovMz3xrQ How do they do it? How do they fry up their Batata Vada, Chicken Chop and Shami Kebab and still keep the mashed potato soft, fluffy and moist? They definitely are working some culinary magic in their hidden kitchen.

Once you enter MK you can smell the delicious aroma of exotic spices in the air (the cooking spices not incense). The inside is bright and clean. They have 2 small tables a bench and a fireplace: a nice place for couples to have a lunch. Outside they have three picnic tables for groups to sit down and eat. Most people order to go so the tables are always available.

When you want to order look through the kitchen window and get someone's attention (the cashiers double as kitchen help). The staff have always been warm and helpful. They patiently answer all my newbie questions with a smile. If you need to use the washroom, you'll need to go through the kitchen to get there. 

They have the best Indian Street food (Samosas included as well as above mentioned items) in the GTA. They use a harmonious blend of spices that work so well together. Add in the tamarind dipping sauce which has a little heat and you've got all the five basic tastes of sweet, sour, bitter, salty and yes umami (savory) covered.

I took away a star because not all their food is well spiced (Butter Chicken is bland), and the temperature of the food isn't hot enough for my liking. I like my food piping hot right out of the pan/fryer/oven. 

TIPS:
For the best bang for your buck check out their daily specials and definitely add one or more of their yummy "bitings" ($1-$1.50) or maybe a cup of Masala chai for $1.25.

Learn from the regulars on which items to order; remember, I did say the balance of spices are perfect in some things but not others.
