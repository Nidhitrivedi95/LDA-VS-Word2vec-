gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I went there for a lunch buffet and the choice for food selection was very good for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The food was tasty for a lunch buffet. 
The only thing I did not like much on the menu was the gulab jamun. It was cooked well but there was an overdose of cinnamon in it. This place is a great find around the Vegas strip especially for people who crave Indian food as there aren't many Indian restaurant option on the strip.
