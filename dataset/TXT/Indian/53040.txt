V679T4yys91392j8rcKaMQ This is a trendy, more upscale Indian restaurant with an extensive menu.  

We ordered the aloo spinach paneer tiki to share and it was delicious.  Very salty and intense taste but that's what we like! Tamarind sauce is always tasty.

I had the butter chicken with naan while my friend had the "mint mix grilled" which she enjoyed (although she said she didn't like the sausage-like meats).  

We went on a Sunday evening and we were the only ones there until a big group came in just as we were leaving.

I would come back for sure.
