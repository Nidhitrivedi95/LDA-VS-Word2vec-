GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g I really enjoyed the food here. We stopped in for a casual dinner after being highly recommended. I left happy, and WAY more full than I had anticipated. All those light, airy dhosas are deceptively filling.

Another reviewer was on point by saying that this spot isn't really a restaurant, but more of an eatery or dhosa shop. You order at a counter, take a seat, and your food is brought out to you. Pitchers of water are self-serve and there is of course a soda fountain. There is also a chutney bar where you can explore to your heart's content. We brought a sample of each back to the table. Each were delicious and fresh. 

I got the palak paneer, which was delicious. My friend ordered one of the giant table-sized dhosas, of which they were happy to tone down the spice at her request. All in all, everything was great. The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was the plastic... everything. Our food was served in dixie bowls and all the silverware was plastic. It sort of felt like we were camping. The space is clean and bright, I think some real dishes and silverware would really round this place out. At any rate, I will be back.
