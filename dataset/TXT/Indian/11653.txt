aL214MZX45plP6mkzbDwNw I've eaten here a couple of times. Also had take-out, which was a bad experience because I found out the order was not complete when I got home.

The food is quite good, and I find that the place is generally kind of quiet. It's better for the ambiance when some Desi movies are on the TV.

Back to the food - it tastes great and is pretty good value. Don't order too much naan - they are huge.

The downside is that they do not serve alcohol, which is a miss for me when having a dinner on a Saturday night.
