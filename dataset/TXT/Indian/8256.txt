7LNuQqjcjAn0bBlGHIiQzQ i came here to meet two of my friends for lunch and it was great. I had to pay for parking by the subway because it was crazy packed and busy in their lot. It was busy but not full in the restaurant and was seated right away. The server was really nice and quickly took our plates after we ate. The fresh naan was good but nothing to brag about. They do have a good option of food for both vegetarians and meat eaters. I really enjoyed their butter chicken and the vindaloo. The pakoras were great too. I always finish my indian meals with my gulab balls and it did not disappoint. It's definitely a great option if you are in the area fit lunch as it is not expensive. However i probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
