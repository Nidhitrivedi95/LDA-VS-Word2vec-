0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I recently made a field trip to Chaupaati, as I love Indian food; I've been eating it since I was a kid growing up in New York.

The restaurant is set up as a self-serve style - order at the front, get your silverware from a kiosk and they call your name when it's ready. There's a selection of Indian beers, fountain sodas and canned sodas.

The owner is very friendly. He asked where I had heard of his restaurant and if it was our first time. He also followed up with us at our table to make sure we were enjoying everything.

I ordered some standards to check them out:

Mulligitawny Soup: the flavor was 4 star, the portion was 3 - more like a cup than a bowl = small bowl.

Samosas: nice texture, served hot, a little heavy on the cinnamon and cardamom for my tastes - 3 stars

Assorted Pakora: nice spicy kick to the batter - the cauliflower and spinach were especially good - 4 stars

Chicken Tikka Masala: the flavor was right on target - tender chicken - the sauce was creamy, buttery goodness - again, the portion was small for $11.99 - maybe 10 small pieces of chicken - flavor = 4 stars, portion 3

Naan: hot, fresh delicious - 4 stars

3.5 Stars over all in my mind, rounded up to 4.  I would recommend that if you are to try Chaupaati that you come for lunch, as the prices and portions seem more appropriate.
