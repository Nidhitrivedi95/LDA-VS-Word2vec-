I was here for dinner and ordered the madras curry w/ chicken (medium), a tandoori roti and a sweet lassi. The portions were a little bigger than what I was expecting. The curry was flavorful and the lassi seemed fresh - I couldn't taste any artificial flavors, which is quite rare 

For dessert, I ordered the gajar halwa (grated carrot  in syrup) with ice cream. Again, I was pleasantly surprised with the fresh and authentic flavors.
