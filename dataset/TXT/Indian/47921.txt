TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I've been here a couple of times, but I had lunch there today at their buffet. It was one of the most delicious Indian meals I have ever had. I love their iced tea too, it was strong and delicious.  Every single dish I tried at the buffet, and there must have been a dozen or 10 at least, was fantastic. 

I highly recommend this restaurant!
