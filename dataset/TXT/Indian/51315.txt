UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ I'm a new fan!  Already planning to return.

Mixed Grill plate ($16), large portion, enough to share (but order extra naan).  Great flavor, loved the chicken and shrimp, but the lamb and beef were dry. Next time, I'll stick with the chicken tandori. 

Tikka Masala ($11), AMAZING flavor blew me away.  To echo another reviewer, not enough rice!
