We had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, and it was obvious that they were desperate to turn the tables around really quickly; however, we never felt rushed or hurried.

My fiance and I shared a Mysore Masala Dosa and Chole Batura, both of which were excellent. I also ordered a Sweet Lassi which was as good as the ones we get in India. We also ordered a bowl of Gulab Jamun, which were tasty but had a little too much cardamom in it for my taste. Don't except fine dining from this place though. The place was clean but it was nothing fancy what so ever. I am definitely going back there. :)
