kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g I finally got to try Bombay Spice Grill last night and I loved it.  Wonderful service, great unique and flavorful food and a really nice mellow atmosphere.  We had my book club there and the waitress was fabulous providing us with wonderful service and gave all 9 of us separate checks.  The Happy Hour prices are fabulous!  I would definitely have the chick pea ceviche again - mmmmm!  I can't wait to go back and try more things on their creative menu.
