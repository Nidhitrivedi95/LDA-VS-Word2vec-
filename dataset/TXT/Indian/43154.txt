RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA A work colleague came here and was regailing us with tales of plentiful good food and all you can eat plus a free drink for £7.50. On a trip into town for work he mentioned this again, so off all 3 of us trecked to drummond street to check out the smorgasbord of curry we have been hearing about. 

First impressions nice enough looking place both inside and out with a friendly welcome on arrival. Looking good so far. Drinks served IRN-BRU and mango juices all round. Now the food...

Everything looked the part from the pilau rice through to the curries but something was missing.... the smell of the spices. I always judge a curry place on their Dal and this was not good it tasted sweet and the lentils had turned to mush. Think slighty curried / spiced mashed potatoe for texture.. urgh. The rice, Bhuna, sag and tandoori chicken were pleasant enough. The Madras wihich was potatoe and lamb reminded me of irish stew, which my colleague reminded I loudly proclaimed at the table. 

Overall not offensive just lacking a bit in depth of flavours I guess for the food. Lots of food for your money and the service was good, but the food is a bit bland for my palate. With so many options close by I dont think I would be rushing back.
