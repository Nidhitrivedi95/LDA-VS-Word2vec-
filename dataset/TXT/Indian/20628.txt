fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw We visited Bangal Kabab house on a Friday afternoon for the lunch buffet.  It was nearly empty inside, however we were treated very poorly by the one member of the staff we had any contact with.  The host barely spoke to us and when he did he was quite surly.   At one point, because there was a large floor fan blowing directly on our booth, my paper napkin blew off my lap. The host came by and picked it up OFF THE FLOOR, refolded it and placed it back on our table, securing it with my bowl of gulab jamun. Unacceptable.  The food on the lunch buffet was OK, nothing to write home about, but the service was the worst I've ever experienced at a buffet. We felt decidedly unwelcome and will not return.
