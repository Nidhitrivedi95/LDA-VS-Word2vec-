o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I am  planning to surprise my girl friend on her birthday, as an Indian girl she love's Indian food. While searching for some good Indian restaurant and a friend of mine suggested Saffron Indian Bistro.

I decide to take her at  to Saffron. When we arrived it turned out that she had already visited this place and was aware of the menu. We ordered Panner Jalfrezi in as the main course and it was really AMAZING!!! We also tried Chat and Pain Puri both were rich, flavorful and perfectly cooked.
 
Its a really good place and we will definitely be back!
