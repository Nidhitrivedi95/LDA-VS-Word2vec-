9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A Look elsewhere if craving good Indian food. My husband and I live in Rochester NY and the Indian food there is not quite what I'm used to as I grew up in Toronto. I thought for sure Montreal would live up to my expectations but I was disappointed. We didn't have data on our phones to check out the Yelp reviews beforehand so we decided to give it a try. Ambiance is nice with a good sized outdoor patio. Service was well paced. We ordered the butterfly prawn appetizer. When it came out it wasn't what I expected. It was flattened out prawn with a thick coating of breading. When I tried to bite in it was very hard and I couldn't even chew it. We sent it back. They apologized and asked if we wanted another plate of it. I said no thanks but they ended up bringing it anyway, on the house. That was considerate but I didn't want it in the first place. For dinner we got the karai ghost and a mushroom bhaji dish. We had to add salt to our dishes since it wasn't flavorful enough for our spice craving palates. Naan was good and fresh. Overall, disappointing flavorless Indian food.
