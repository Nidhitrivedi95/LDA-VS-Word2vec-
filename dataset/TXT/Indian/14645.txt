CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ Quick Indian lunch at a reasonable price? I'm in.

A friend suggested coming here, so we took our lunch break and drove down. It's pretty nondescript, camping out in a strip mall. Walking in, it's not much to look at. Tables and chairs. Nothing fancy.

We ordered samosas as an appetizer and LOVED the green sauce they were served with. Minty and spicy.

I recommended the curry chicken to my friend, since she's not all that familiar with Indian cuisine, figuring that would be simple and delicious. She really enjoyed it.

I ordered something with chickpeas and spinach. Also simple and delicious. Naan, check. Rice, check.

The portions are perfect for lunch, and the prices agree. Our server was very personable and quick to make sure we had enough to drink.

I probably wouldn't come here on date night, but for a quick weekday lunch, it hits the spot.
