W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant last sunday for the first time and we tried the buffet and since we started to eat we noticed the difference between the other indian restaurants we have been to and this one and Minerva it's so much better! Every single thing we tried was sooo tasty, my favorites were: the chili chicken, the channa masala (garbanzo beans in a creamy sauce) the deep fried vegetables ( they were sooo crispy) and their cottage cheese, it was sooo delicate I did not want to finish eating it, we would definitely come back for more! The only reason I gave them 4 stars its because the buffet area it is so small and I think they should rearrange it, they have the main entrees in the narrower side where most of the people stand most of the time, they should put them in the beginning area, where everybody start to get their empty plates since it is a more open area.
