auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I just moved to the area, and this is the first Indian I have tried in the Las Vegas metro.  So I am comparing it to the only other Indian places I really know, in the Kansas City metro.    This place sucks compared to KC.  Nothing was free (no papads given, no lassi or kolfti samples)  NOT EVEN THE RICE.  You had to pay for the rice separately.  It wasn't very good, either.  The food was mediocre.  I can make a better veggie korma and I am a white girl from Wichita, KS.  The service was very poor.   I won't be in a hurry to come back.  Maybe I will try the lunch buffet at some point.   Maybe.
