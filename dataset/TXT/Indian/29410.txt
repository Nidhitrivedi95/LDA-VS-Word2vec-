JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ This is the first restaurant we visited upon moving to the Charlotte area. We are vegetarians and enjoy hitting a veg-only restaurant once in a while. We have only eaten dinner and have been in about five times now. In our experience the staff is always friendly and the food is tasty.

We particularly like the dosas, which are huge and perfectly crispy. We always eat family style and have tried most of the dishes on the menu. We have enjoyed everything we've tried. They are more than happy to adjust the heat level (spice), depending on your preference. 

I've read reviews stating the staff ignores Indian people. My husband and I have not seen or experienced this. Furthermore, the restaurant is often filled with diners who appear to be Indian. In my experience, that speaks volumes about the quality of the food.
