RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg This place deserves 5 stars. I went to dinner there this weekend while in Vegas and it was a great experience. The ambiance, quality of food, and service was fantastic. I ordered the chicken curry and it tasted just like a homemade dish. We also ordered samosas and they were delicious. The icing on the cake was the fantastic and friendly service from our waiter Aman. We will definitely be coming back again next time we're in Vegas!
