4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q usually when I dine Indian I tend to prefer sit down over buffet however this was on of the best Indian buffets I have been to so far there is a big selection of appetizers curries and desserts it is true certain things where dry and not that great but others were good stick to what you like and it should be an enjoyable buffet i recommend trying chicken curry which is made with dark meat as it should be (butter chicken is made with breast I believe)
also for dessert they fry the jalebi (Indian funnel cake) right in front of you * make sure you wait for the fresh ones* it makes all the difference 

Atmosphere was decent and better than most Indian restaurants I have been to service was mediocre but I guess you expect that from a buffet 

All in all they are good at what they do (Indian buffet) it's certainly not the best Indian food I have eaten however is one of the best specifically to Indian buffets  and I would return if that's what I was in the mood for
