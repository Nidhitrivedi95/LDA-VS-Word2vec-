OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Quaint little place in a strip mall just minutes from the strip. Well worth a visit. Nice clean restaurant with bar. Friendly service. Cute interior. It is my understanding that they do have a lunch buffet. 
We went for dinner and had their butter chicken royale. Wonderful dish. Chicken so tender you didn't need a knife for it. The sauce seems tomato base, a hint of curry, but not overwhelming. I recommend this for folks who are not brave enough to venture into the spicy world of curries, this is a perfect place to start. Full flavor without the burn.
The naan here is perfect also. We had the butter naan... oh my... I could eat a ton... for those of you with a healthy appetite, try the jumbo naan, a huge portion I would say, if that doesn't fill you up you need professional help. 
I would say venture off the strip into a nice quieter area of the city and experience Indian flavor at their best.
