eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Worst attitude towards their customers: the food coms later b'cos the first thing u expect as u enter any restaurant is the staff to be atleast polite.  the attitude (specifically of the till operator handling the take out area) towards their customers is worst- there was an error in my bill (they had charged me for 4 dishes instead of 3 that i had ordered), wen i highlighted this and requested them for a refund for 1 dish that i never ordered. the till operator got extremely arrogant and indicated that it was because of me that this error occurred. It was clear that the till operator taking the orders at the takeout area was extremely confused. and arrogant and was not able to handle the area at all (even after having a high tech head phone to communicate with the kitchen staff) Infact she was blaming the waitress who was cleaning the tables to accommodate guests and was actually doing a good job.

@Food:: elaborate buffet, and a very clean look, which probably accounts for  why they can price their buffet at $13 Canadian. But the TASTE is not worth it. Just stick to punjabi dishes if u still wish to try,,for the rest its just the visual appearance of so many dishes but zero taste.
