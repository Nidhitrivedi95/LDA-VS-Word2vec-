Well, it turned out to be quite the opposite. Here's my story. I went there for a quick lunch food grab. I noticed the ambience is nice and unique. I skimmed through the menu and ordered a shrimp curry priced at 12.99 pre tax if I'm not wrong. I coupled this dish with a garlic naan. So when the dish came up, I was shocked to find out this dish only contains THREE shrimps. Wow, and they are not even big by any standards. So three shrimps and some curry is apparently worth more than 16 bucks if you round up the tax and tips. Then I quickly finished the small piece of naan along with the curry, still felt merely half fed. So I had to order another garlic naan bread, which is priced at 2.99 I think. So I ended up paying 20+ in the end, for a lunch oh yes. To be fair, the food didn't taste bad at all,but that's almost irrelevant. Instead it's just hard to manage the gap between expectation and final cost. Come on, it's a self styled street food place in suburb Mississauga, not a medium or high end Indian restaurant in the centre of Toronto. For this price I wouldn't revisit.
