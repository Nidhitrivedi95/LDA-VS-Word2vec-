ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA My first experience with Passage was through delivery.  My family ate every last bit of food that was delivered to our temporary corporate housing.  Personally, I had the tandoori platter and it was amazing.

My second experience was on a Saturday with another family.  We absolutely got our money worth.  Everything on the buffet was great.  The fried cauliflower is perfection.

I've been back several times with co-workers and everyone has had the  "we have to go back" comments.  

5 stars.
