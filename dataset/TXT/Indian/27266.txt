Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q Visited with my partner and we had an exceptional meal for a very reasonable price. We started with the appetizer platter which feature the best chicken pakoras I have ever had. The tandoori chicken is cooked fresh to order for every customer so it takes about 20 minute shut well worth it for the quality. We also tried the Chana masala which was top notch.

Food incredible 

Service excellent and friendly

Atmosphere so-so but go for the food!
