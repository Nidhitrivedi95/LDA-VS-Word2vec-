gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A It is a good place for an Indian lunch buffet. I did not find it very impressive since I enjoy south Indian food more than the north Indian food. 

Varieties are not much. There are a lot of curry varieties, but only with one kind of bread. I could have given it another star had they included another rice option in the buffet spread. 

The place was very crowded, but the staff managed the crowd well.
