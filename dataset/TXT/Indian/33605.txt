lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw Food was decent, service was horrible.  Had to remind the staff numerous times that we had ordered appetizers but they still forgot.  Our main dishes came before the appetizers so we ended up cancelling appetizers. Had ordered drinks as well and again after multiple reminders the drinks never came .  Once we asked for the check the manager came by and said that the drinks are ready and suggested we take them home.  This enraged us more rather than apologizing the managers wanted us to pay for the drinks and take them home with us.  Spoke to the wait staff and the lady said he is like that with all customers and he only cares about making money.  Manager needs a crash course in customer service.
