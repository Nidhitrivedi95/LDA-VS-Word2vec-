-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw We were traveling and ordered food over the telephone due to time constraints . Since we never visited this place before we did not know the portion size or price. The aloo paratha portion size is huge and costs 7.99 each. The person who took the order did not mention any of this to us and was not helpful at all. We felt that this is over priced. Food tastes good but the service is not great. Though we ordered one hour before, we had to wait 15 min after reaching at the expected time. We ended up paying a lot more than expected.  Dissatisfied with the experience.
