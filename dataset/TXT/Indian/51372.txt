UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ I love the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Butter Chicken.... The price is just at the tail end of what I am willing to pay for good diverse cuisine in the area. I would vote 5 stars if they gave a larger portion size of rice and the nan was slightly cheaper. Overall, a solid 4.3/5.0
