tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g Updated review, now a days their naan quality is reduced a lot and their weekend buffets are not that great. They used to have a lot of options, now they have reduced them a lot. I had to request for chutneys and many items a couple of times. btw they didnt change the price. I used to love their Naans but not anymore.
