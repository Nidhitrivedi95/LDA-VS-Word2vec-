j9YFHVQqxM_qKHIc4nck-A Came here with a friend who frequents this place and we were pleasantly surprised. It's hidden in a small strip mall sandwiched beside a few other restaurants and is really clean. The owners were really friendly and helped us pick out our dinner. Chicken pakoras with coriander sauce were so tasty! They also gave us masala flavoured fries- which isn't on the menu and you'd think would be weird to order but they were perfect and crunchy and delish! We ordered dry chili shrimp (perfect spice!), ginger chicken, beef and broccoli and green beans. All came with a bowl of rice as well. Really big portions and for three of us we could barely finish and took food home. 
Our meal came to under $60!
We will be back because I'm curious to try more of the menu!
