TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I've never been to India Palace, so it was on my list of places to try when in town staying at the Hard Rock. My buddy loves Indian food, so we hit up the lunch buffet today. We came at 2:45pm and they warned us they closed at 3pm, but Vic ended up letting us sit and eat until a bit after 3pm, and we didn't feel rushed at all. I though it was $12.95 for the buffet but apparently it was only $11.95. Had 2 buffets and a drink for less than the $20 for $30 Yelp voucher I had purchaed. Enjoyed all the food I tried, but the naan stood out as really good. Great value restaurant and a great vibe. Thanks, Vic!
