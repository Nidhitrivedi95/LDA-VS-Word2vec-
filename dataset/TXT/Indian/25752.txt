hXB72crkUuzBH9CDONTmew Good food with casual atmosphere. We came here upon a recommendation by a friend and found it to be a nice little Punjabi restaurant. 

We came here on a Sunday evening with a group of 5 people and tried the following:

Mint Chicken Tikka  - Absolutely amazing! 

Lamb Seekh Kebab - amazing! usually Lamb Kebabs turn out very dry and unappetizing, but this one was the best we've ever had! Really moist and flavourful.  

Vegetarian Saag - Pretty Good

Vegetable Biryani - Great Indian style biryani loaded with lots of vegetables. 

Chicken Vindaloo - Boneless chicken in a spicy tomato & onion based curry. I especially loved this one.  - I would highly recommend trying this one

Chicken Tikka Masala - Nothing too amazing, I wasn't a huge fan of filler vegetables like green peppers and onions in a cream based curry. 

Lacha Paranthas - well made, definitely recommend

Plain Naans - Pretty good, I did like that there was seasoning worked into the actual dough which gave it a nice flavour. 

One thing I would recommend, is knowing what size subji you'd like, we ordered one chicken curry dish last minute to add to our meal, and they automatically assumed it would be the large size, we didn't realize until  the end of the meal we could've ordered a small. 

Seating is a bit tight, so it may be a little harder for larger groups.
