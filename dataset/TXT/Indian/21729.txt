gJliACNKY4rK30BTMIzwsQ Kismot opened a few years ago and has been very popular ever since. It offers delicious curries, all cooked by the head waiter's parents. He will endeavour to tell you about his parents cooking behind the scenes, giving this restaurant a personal touch. A great feature is that bringing your own alcohol for a meal is actually encouraged, this is because the familys religious beliefs prevent them from selling it to customers. A great place for an indian meal.
