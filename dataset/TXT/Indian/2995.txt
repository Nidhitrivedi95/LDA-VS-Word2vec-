0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw My husband and I absolutely love India Garden and their staff! The food is delicious, fresh and the serving sizes are generous! They start with a basket of papadum and various dipping sauces and it's amazing! They're always happy to bring us more. On our most recent visit we were brought a dish of veggie pakora that we didn't order. The server kindly explained they felt our dishes were taking too long so they brought us that in the meantime. It was so nice and to be honest we hadn't been waiting long at all! I would have been fine without it, but the gesture was greatly appreciated and delicious! 
Our favorite dish is definitely the (mild) chicken tikka masala (also a great dish for a first timer)! We always get two orders of naan bread. We have tried the plain naan, garlic and the chicken naan, all of which were equally delicious and well made. 
The atmosphere is very relaxing, a little dim (but not dark, it's comfortable), quiet and overall friendly! The staff are always smiling, friendly and attentive. I've never had to look around for a water refill or ask how much longer. They are quick, efficient and so yummy! We love it here and recommend it to everybody!
