eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Always delicious! Lunch buffet is so yummy, fresh and full of choices (meat & veg). Dinner menu is hard to choose from due to the extensive variety. The chicken tikka Masala is rich and flavorful. Definitely a favorite. Garlic naan is also a must! The atmosphere is clean and open, and the wait staff are attentive and sweet. I lololove this restaurant!
