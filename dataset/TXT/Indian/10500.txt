9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw I really like this place! The food is tasty fresh and fast. The owner is so lovely and incredibly hard working. I'm so glad they're expanding. I'm really upset about the fire because I will be missing out on some great rotis! I hope they reopen soon. The rotis are very hefty I usually only eat half of one if I'm hungry. The spice is generous. Some may call me a spice aficionado. Usually I'm asking for extra spicy but here I'm very content with a medium. I love the mixed vegetable, a chicken jalfrezi or the shrimp saag. Keep up the good work!
