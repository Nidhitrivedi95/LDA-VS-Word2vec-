Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Did not have a chance to eat there as we arrived at 9:30 (30 minutes before closing) only to be told as we walked in that they were closed (the door was unlocked, the hours ON THE DOOR said 10pm, and plenty of people were inside eating). They just lost a potential repeat customer.
