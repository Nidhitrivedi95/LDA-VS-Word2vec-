UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I've now upgraded to regular customer. 

Staff are not so familiar with English,  but the food is what I came for. 
Great portions, meat dish each for you and your partner and 1 rice dish will suffice. 
Food was tasty and filling! 
Highly recommend the butter chicken!! 
Got the tiki masala chicken both of the 2 types and neither was up to party. . Not enough gravy. But tasty yes but I'll always from now on have the butter chicken.  

GREAT FOOD.
