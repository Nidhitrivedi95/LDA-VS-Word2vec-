hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Maybe it's meant to be more authentic, but this is the first Indian joint I've eaten at that didn't make their tikka masala with chicken breast cut into bite size pieces. They were very fatty large chunks of chicken thighs. The sauce was kind of runny and light on flavor. The prices are way too high as well. Just seemed like it was made with as cheap of chicken as possible. I'm not knocking dark meat, I love me some chicken thighs and there may have been some white meat in there but there was so much fat on it that it was difficult to eat and tell.  Such a bummer because my wife and I love Indian food but this is the only one in this area. Sucks because we ordered delivery via stub hub so that I didn't have to leave the house tonight, but instead I have to put my outside clothes to go get something else and we wasted 50 bucks.  To put this review into perspective, I felt compelled to do so under the assumption that posting on Yelp is the dorkiest thing I could possibly do and I hope the restaurant owner takes this feedback as an opportunity to adjust his selection of chicken used to appeal more to the masses instead of those looking for something more authentic. Authentic doesn't pay the bills. The masses do.
