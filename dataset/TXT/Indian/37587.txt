OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Horrible experience. When we went in at 8pm, we asked for seating inside and the lady owner was pretty pushy in insisting that we sit outside and eat. It had just rained outside so the chairs were wet. And my family was willing to wait for a table inside. Nonetheless, we chose to eat outside. I didn't like the pushy attitude. The 4 of us were in a table with 6 chairs. And we were asked to move to a smaller table by the servers for a larger group that was coming. I mean why didn't they set up their tables properly? This is not proper customer etiquette. 

And coming to the food, they use the same exact masala for all their entree curry items. The Aloo Gobi and Navratan Korma had the same exact sweet taste. And the Navratan korma had way more potatoes than expected. Usually, kormas have a healthy mix of other vegetables. This was just lazy cooking. Only saving grace was the taste of the biriyani and naan. Our experience as customers was simply bad.
