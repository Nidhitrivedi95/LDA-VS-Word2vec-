2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg We love to try new places and always looking for a great Indian restaurant since there are not many in the valley.  Tried this place through a Groupon yet probably won't come back. 
When we arrived for dinner, we were told only the buffet would be available due to some prior catering commitments the restaurant had. We decided to stay although disappointed we would be limited to the buffet offerings. 
The buffet itself was not too bad. Popular Indian items offered yet mimosas were not, which is was what we really wanted to try. 
Since it was a buffet, we did get lots of food for the price, which was very reasonable. 
The place itself looked a bit neglected in that food stains were seen on the drapes and the prior establishment's interior designs and style was reused. (Photos of black bears not seem to be part of an Indian restaurant motif). 
Service was a bit spotty in that we needed to flag the waitress down for water refills and napkins. 
Although the food was decent (for what was offered) we will most likely not return.
