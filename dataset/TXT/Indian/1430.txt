-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg I love this place - great South Indian food!

The space is clean and inviting but sparse. Service is good but not great. Prices are really affordable. I generally prefer to get takeout from here so I can pig out on my own at home.

As for the food - it's so, so good. The idli is great and the palak paneer is also quite good. Udipi's best items are the dosas, which is different from the normal north Indian fare you get in most Indian restaurants. But it will become a craving once you've had it. Rava dosas, masala dosas and all their variants - all expertly prepared. I think I just made myself hungry writing this review!
