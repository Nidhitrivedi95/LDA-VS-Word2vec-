BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ Took me a while to drop in to this place.
I'm glad i did!

They have a pretty nice Lunch special going on that will hit the spot.
Consists of 2 meats of your choice, rice, salad, yogurt, naan or roti, desert. Even includes a pop for $10.
Lots of flavor for your pallet.
Left me pretty full
The vegetarian special is only $9 and looks just as good.

Definitely will be stopping in more often.
Will have to drop in for dinner to check out the other dishes on the menu.

Nice friendly staff/owner, very clean snazzy place.
A good addition to the neighborhood
