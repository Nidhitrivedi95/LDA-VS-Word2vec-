YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q I ordered delivery the other night after spotting a decent deal on BadgerBites -- buy one item on the menu, get the other half off. After nearly TWO hours of waiting, my delivery man arrived. As always, he brought with him CB's surly, unfriendly, fuck-off attitude (for some reason the employees here have a serious attitude problem). Anyway, the food was just as disappointing as the service. A lamb gyro consisted of only meat and a few sparse tomatoes. No lettuce, hardly any Tahini sauce, and poor proportions. My falafel sandwich was a joke -- falafel had the consistency of wallpaper mixed with cornmeal, and almost no flavor. I couldn't detect any sauce whatsoever, and the pita tasted days old.

Save your money and don't order from Campus Biryani.
