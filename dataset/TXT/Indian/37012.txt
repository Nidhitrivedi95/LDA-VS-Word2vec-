o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Really good food, but not that family friendly. I wish they include rice with the entree. Who would order Chicken Marsala without rice? I had to pay $2 extra for rice (rice is cheap).  That deducted one star.  I rather they did not give me the free appetizer and just give me rice with my meal.
