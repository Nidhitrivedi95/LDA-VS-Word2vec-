vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w This is a very authentic Indian food. Though there are many Indian cuisines restaurants where I live, this one is the winner! I really enjoy everything we ordered. Service is a bit slow and waiter is not attentive due to many guests. They were still polite serving us and we have no problem with that. Solid 5 stars!
