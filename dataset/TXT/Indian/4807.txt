2KkTzafNqkEKr5VTjsR3hw Right next to the New Spiceland Supermarket. Packed with people, long line up.

The deep fried items at the counter doesn't have a name/price tag, so you have to ask. They are usually sells in a few for a dollar.
The vadai was 5 / $1, it was hot and crispy, soooo good!
The pakoda (that's the name they use) was 5 pieces for $1
And they don't have any samosa that day (or they just don't make it?) so the server suggest I try the fried dumpling (which filled with sweet potato as it turns out) 3 / $1

I wanted to try the curry they have, I asked for mutton/goat curry, she goes and check and come back to say they only have chicken or beef. A real surprise as usually places won't have beef at all, and goat/mutton a must have, I guess they really have it the other way around.
I had the small bowl of chicken, it was really oily and the pieces was small like a dice.

I tried to listen and wanted to find out what others are ordering to see what's good. But they were so busy with the big tray of catering food sending non stop from the kitchen, I didn't get a chance to ask more questions... May be next time.
