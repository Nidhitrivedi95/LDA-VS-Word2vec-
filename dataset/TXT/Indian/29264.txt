jpYAApi_w1bR50EJ71LBHg Not bad. Prices and menu hard to follow as they were flashing on flat-screen TVs instead of on paper. Ordered the chicken kothu roti and the mutton curry which came with 3 veg curries and a massive portion of plain rice. Would have liked a little more of the veg curries and less rice. All was quite spicy. $7 each dish. Had passed inspection in Jan (google reviews had mentioned possible problems with kitchen cleanliness triggering an inspection). Service was OK, though they were busy enough that they forgot a wrap in the microwave and the foil paper it was wrapped in caught fire!
