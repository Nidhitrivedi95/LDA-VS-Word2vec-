QT4Ub4DlaDX52vdnKutD0A This is one of my favorite lunch time haunts. This is a small mom & pop place so it is quaint & personal. The owner & staff are always polite & helpful. They cater to my maximum spicy overload! I love, love, love this place! This is right on the light rail & easy to get to.

A lot of great vegetarian & gluten free choices! 

You have to try my personal favorite, the Paneer Tikka Masala! If you are a spicy addict like I am... DO NOT... I repeat DO NOT pass by the marinated spicy onions on their condiment bar. They are AMAZING!! Yummmm! Did mention they have a fantastic buffet too? ...the best eggplant, a must try! Yummy rice pudding.

Another awesome bit of info...they don't close down in the middle of the day like most Indian restaurants do. They are open whenever the craving strikes!
