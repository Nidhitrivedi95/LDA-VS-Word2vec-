OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We wanted to try something different and what a great surprise when we found a gem. The Urban Turban Bombay Kitchen is by far the best Indian food. Try the Curry Leaf Shrimp .....YUM!!  Service waspeccable from the bartender Ron to our server assistant Alex to our funny server Ed. This place is a must DO!
