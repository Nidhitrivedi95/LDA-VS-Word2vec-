There are very few family owned restaurants in the West Valley much less ethnic options. The India Garden has delicious authentic food, excellent service, and a relaxing inviting atmosphere and is family owned.

Today, was my first time to the India Garden restaurant but it will not be my last.  If you like Indian cuisine this is the restaurant for you. The entrees are delicious, and the sauces are very good.

On this visit we had the Shrimp Curry, Chicken Masala, and Spinach Paneer with Garlic Naan, all entrees were prepared and presented beautifully. However, my favorite was the Spinach Paneer with Garlic Naan, very addictive.

The India Garden Restaurant offer a buffet at lunch which is a great way to try a few different items if you don't normally have Indian cuisine and at just $9.99 it's a great wallet-friendly value. The India Garden restaurant is easy to get to and worth the trip from anywhere in the West Valley.
