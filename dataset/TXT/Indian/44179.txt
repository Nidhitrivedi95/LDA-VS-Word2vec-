RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Lahore Tikka House SUCKS. I completely "get" why people still love this place. Its been under renovation for at least six years. The moment you sit, you are swarmed by Pakistani men with light eyes offering you pink Kashmiri tea. The bathrooms are palatial and heck there are TUK TUKS out front. Its all "on the other side of town" and "unique" I understand, but the food itself.. not so good. 

Basically EVERYTHING is doused in oil. It is the most oily food I have ever eaten, not that spicy and it is truly lacking any love. Everything is served in Styrofoam with plastic cutlery and the indoor seating feels very "portable-esque" or "cheap RV-esque" even. Its pretty bad. You sit on outdoor plastic tables inside or out and everything is disposable including glassware. 

The "vegetarian platter" looks like kitchen scraps on a sizzling plate swimming in oil. Its deplorable. Awful. The Saag is so oily its almost amazing. The meat dishes (say my dining companions) are better, but still unremarkable. 

You should pay cash, the one time I tried VISA they rang it through twice (surprise! when i got my statement) and I had to get VISA to reverse. I assume its a mistake but still. 

FULL star for the tuk tuk photo ops and the delicious Kulfi (get it to go)

No booze on premises which is a shame because of the patio and because drunk and Tuk Tuks is twice the fun.
