Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg A lot of mixed reviews here! We have been here twice on different trips (once for dinner and once for Sunday lunch buffet) with a group of 6 and all of us enjoyed our meals both times. Yes the service is lacking with odd waiters who could use a few lessons in good manners but the food was always delicious. 

For dinner, highly recommend ordering pani puri to start with. The puri was crispy and the pani perfectly made. Also don't miss out on the lamb chops! Weird to order at an Indian restaurant but honestly they were incredible. We kept ordering more and more plates because we just couldn't stop eating them! Oh course we tried all the stables, butter chicken, chicken biryani, paneer tikka, palak panner, garlic naan and raitha. Everything was delicious and nothing was left over. The dishes are kinda on the small side so it's good for sharing and trying a bunch of items. 

Ok, so this lunch buffet is pretty extensive and basically has everything your hungover tired body needs--samosas, upma, uttapam, idli, sambar, kadhi, naan, fish curry, chicken like 5 different ways and everything in between.

Definitely give Tamba a try and be your own judge :)
