V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg This is the second time I've been to this Amaya, the first was during the opening week of the Yorkdale food court, and to say I'm disappointed is like saying Rob Ford having to miss football and sit at a council meeting and maybe even having to pay attention.

I've always felt there'd be a huge market for tasty fast food Indian at hawker stand prices.  If all you can eat buffets can dominate the Yonge St. Clair area, surely you could do it cheaper at a food court right?

Sadly this place charges more than the sit downs I've been to, and managed to provide some supremely disappointing food.

Had the butter chicken where the sauce was thinner than a runway model after a night of purging.  The 7 cubes of chicken was so dry I actually choked on it a bit.  Oh I'm not quite sure exactly what the literally two table spoons of salad was.  The corn was actually shriveled like me after a cold shower or watching episodes of golden girl followed by Rita McNeil (I'm sorry that was mean.. but not as much as the damn salad).

Won't somebody think of the children?
