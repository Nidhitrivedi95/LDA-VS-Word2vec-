S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA I wasn't looking for Indian food, I was looking for CVS, so I could get some Excedrin for my headache.  But I turned into the wrong stripmall, and passed Gandhi.  No, not that Gandhi, he's dead.  Gandhi the restaurant.

What caught my attention were the people.  Dozens of Indian people headed into the restaurant.  Hmm.  "Best of Las Vegas" proclaimed the banner.  In this place?  What the heck, my last Vegas review was Fatburger, let's diversify a bit.

The restaurant itself is well appointed, clean, comfy.  Check.
Lots of people on the buffet line.  Is there a buffet tonight?  No, they said, that's just for the private party.  Which turned out to be a BUSLOAD of Indian people.  

No matter.  I looked at the menu, and ordered one of their combo dishes, along with a large Flying Horse.

Within minutes, complimentary papadum arrived, along with a tamarind sauce and a cilantro sauce.  To my surprise, the papadum were awesome.  Hot, crisp, tasty.  The sauces were excellent as well.

The combo arrived and the food continued to impress.  I haven't had Indian food this tasty and authentic since I was back in NY.  One thing I disliked was the dish - a metal plate with compartments which reminded me of a TV dinner.  I would have preferred to see several small plates, but I guess that would be more work.

The combo included a choice of dessert, and I passed up my usual kheer in favor of a pistachio kulfi ice cream recommended by my server.  It was AMAZING, except for the spoon (see below).

Reading the other reviews, either they have improved dramatically, or perhaps I was the beneficiary of stumbling on this place on a night where they knew they had to have their A game on (or risk upsetting said busload of people).

I would award 4 stars, except that my napkin was slightly dirty, and the spoon accompanying my dessert was clearly dirty as well (as in the dishwasher didn't do a good job).

I left stuffed and content, aka, feeling very un-Gandhi-like.
