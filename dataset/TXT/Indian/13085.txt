b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q This is my FAVORITE Indian food place. I never thought to write about it before, not until I tried another place I really did not like. So here I am to review my favorite, I have been going here for over 16 years.

Now the selection isn't as good as some places as far as the buffet...the decor is a little weird...the service is...well it is what it is, it's OK, don't get me wrong but if you like lots and lots of attention this isn't the place for you. They fill your glass when it's empty, bring naan when you glance around...I swear they hide in the kitchen and watch through the window to who needs service so they don't bother you. LOL...but I don't mind :)

There was  a period of time they went cheap and oily...they finally pulled out of it and are back on track. I prefer this place because the kitchen is always clean...yes, I will absolutely ask to see the kitchen before I eat somewhere, it's common sense. They have returned to putting out palak paneer once again...thank you! The price has always been the same $8 and another $2-5 for beer. The Tandoori is good, the lamb is delicious...yes I fell off the vegetarian wagon...sorry :( 

Like I said this is my favorite place just don't show up on Tuesdays, for some reason they are closed on Tuesdays.
