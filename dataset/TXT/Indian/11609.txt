ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ After ice skating and tobaganning, we were hesitant on entering a nice restaurant with a tablecloth.  But the host, with his soft voice, unassuming nature and knowledge of everything indian, was delightful, and the extensive menu had us salivating.

Within moments, we were chipping off pappadum and dipping it into perfect coriander sauce and tamarind chutney. 

we ordered:

- Pani puri-- Indian street food that's hard to find. Pastry wafers filled with tamarind chutney and coriander water, that you "pop" in your mouth

- Idli-- sourdough rice and lentil cakes served with masala and chutneys. Tangy and chewy and light.

- Dosas of many kinds. Masala dosas, Spinach dosas, cheese doasas- - all with thick coconut chutney, tomato chutney and some other new flavors

It was just as good as homemade dosa and thali meals in Chennai!
