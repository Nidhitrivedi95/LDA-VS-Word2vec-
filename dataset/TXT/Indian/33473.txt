LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw Quite good.  I was here with a group of amigos for the Sat. evening buffet.  Good and wide selection but marked down for not-too-fresh veggies at 7 pm: this should be the prime time!  On the other hand the breads (amazing) were as fresh as could be.  overall this is a solid, though not outstanding, choice for Indian.
