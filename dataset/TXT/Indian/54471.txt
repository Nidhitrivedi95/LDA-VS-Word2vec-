W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg A little out of the way in a strip mall, but Minerva has really good food.  In particular, they had an Indo-Chinese type chicken (chicken 65 maybe?  The name is escaping me.) on the buffet line that was really enjoyable.

The buffet selection is a little on the small side, but it's all well done and tasty.  Also a little bit on the expensive side for the lunch buffet.

I agree with some of the comments here that sometimes it feels a little bit like you're imposing when you come in the door and that the staff is a little...tentative?  Is that the word?  I dunno.

Enjoyable place, will definitely come back from time to time, but it's not at the top of my list.
