Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA Went here last night after seeing reviews and everyone raving about how great it was. 

So it was a reasonably quiet night from a patron perspective, quiet it was not though. The music was so loud the person taking our order couldn't hear us and even admitted it needed turning down. We ordered battered bangers and mash and the fish and chips with Welsh Rarebit to start. The toast on the rarebit was burnt and it was okay but nothing to write home about. Entrees arrived. Bangers and mash were less than average, the mushy peas were excellent but mashed potatoes were pretty tasteless. The bangers were dry and the flavour over powered by either thyme or sage. 

Fish and chips were dismal. I'm not sure what happened with the fish but the two pieces I had were the size of sardines! The thick cut chips were fine, cooked too much But passable. Batter on the fish was light and tasted okay. Overall we felt like we were not getting value for money. Small portions for the price, compared to other places locally of similar style. Service was ok but these places really need to decide whether loud music isn't more suited to a dance club rather than what they are trying to sell as the local pub. 

Won't be going back.
