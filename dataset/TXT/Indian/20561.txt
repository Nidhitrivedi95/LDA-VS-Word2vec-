fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw So I ordered some samoas, poori, and the fish curry from here. The samosas were stale, as if they've been sitting around for a day.  

This would have been okay, sometimes take out gets the food sitting around all day. But what irked me was that the poori was not a poori! It was an oily, gross, and most importantly - a FLAT - roti. A poori, by definition, puffs. It is puffed bread. When I called the restaurant about this, the person who picked up tried to mansplain to me what a poori is. Sorry, I guess in my 30 years of life, I've been eating pooris wrong the whole time; my mother, my grandmother, and every other Bengali person I know with whom I've had pooris are also wrong- I will be sure to let them know they've been eating the wrong thing their lives too and calling it a poori mistakenly. 

Now, the fish curry, it's $10, that's fine, but giving me only HALF a piece of fish for $10 is NOT fine. In fact, it is highway robbery. 

Needless to say, I will not be coming back here.
