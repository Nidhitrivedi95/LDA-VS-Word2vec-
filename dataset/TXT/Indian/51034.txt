UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I hope the quality of the food at this place has not decreased. I no longer live in Cleveland, yet I still crave the Indian food at Indian flame. My favorite is the mahli kofta. For a meat dish I've heard the lamb curry/vindaloo are amazing! Although this place is a hole in the wall and not exactly sanitary, it is still my favorite Indian place in all of Ohio,  saffron patch in Shaker Heights would come in a close second
