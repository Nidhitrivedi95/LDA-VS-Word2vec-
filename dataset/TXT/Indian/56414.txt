XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw This review is very much overdue but I visited this gem with a couple of friends after reading the stellar reviews and wanting to check out the patio/backyard oasis.

The food overall was really, REALLY yummy. Because I came with a larger crew, we ordered probably over 9 different things on the menu. The highlights for me were: the veggie momos (we gottem steamed), the chilli chicken (I literally did a dance after the first bite - ask any of my friends who went with me and they will verify), the chow mein (not at all like the uninspired kind from the run down Chinese restaurant in your block) and the HOT SAUCE (will have you sweating and maybe even crying). 

One thing I definitely don't wanna forget to add is the SUPERB service we received from a man who I believe was the owner. The food was definitely amazing but his hospitality is what blew me away the most. Need to go back ASAP!!!!!!
