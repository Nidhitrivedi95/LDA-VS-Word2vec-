gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Today is my birthday dinner and my lovely main squeeze brought me to Mount Everest!!!   Always fantastic.  The Owner, Prakash ensured our order was perfect and even surprised us with a wonderful dessert.  

The service was and always is impeccable.   I will never go to another Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas! 

What a wonderful meal and a perfect surprise!!!

Thank you Mount Everest for making my special day more meaningful.
