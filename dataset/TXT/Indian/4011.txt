112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA I decided to try out Chutney Rolls after always walking by on my walks to Little Italy. I was excited by the idea of an Indian restaurant being so closeby but was sadly disappointed by what I experienced. I ordered the shakkar kand (sweet potato and black eyed peas) over rice. The taste of such a normally delicious Indian dish were masked by a level of spice that made eating it almost impossible. In an effort to assuage my taste buds I looked at the water dispenser but there were no cups. Honestly, I'm almost sad that this can be qualified as Indian food to the public - the taste and flavors so well-loved in Indian food are completely missing. The prices are good but the food is definitely missable.
