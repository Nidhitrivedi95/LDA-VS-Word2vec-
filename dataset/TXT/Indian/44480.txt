It is the best South Indian food I have had in North America, and this is coming from a guy who has eaten fair share of Dosas in famous NJ restaurants. Saturday night was jam pack and still manager managed to squeeze us in without a long wait. One small advice - if you are going here for the weekend, make sure u make reservations in advance, coz looks like it gets fully booked. We also stopped in on Sunday, and food was spot on amazing. All different dosas we tried were great. If you like spicy dosa - Manglore mirchi masala dosa is the best you can order from the menu.
