xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg Amazing! Been eagerly awaiting the opening of this place, we live very close and there are no Indian places nearby.
Went to check it out, opened 4 weeks ago.  Not the fanciest place, bit drab decor wise, but clean and tidy.  Were greeted right away and shown to table.  Drinks followed shortly after.  Subtle music playing and traditional Bollywood film showing on the television.
We got vege pakoras and chicken tika which was served sizzling.  Sauces were delicious, very addictive.
Chef owner came to check on us and introduce himself, wanted feedback, we loved everything.
Entrees were chicken curry and chicken tiki masala, yummy best tiki masala have ever had, so creamy and delicious.
Will be back for sure.
