cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Probably the worst I've ever had for dinner in the downtown area. 1 star is being generous. 

Took nearly twenty minutes for the appetizer to arrive (cauliflower and leek soup) and we asked for salt and pepper shakers and, even after leaving the restaurant, we're still waiting on it...

Ordered four main dishes and once they finally arrived they were cold and, for the most part, tasteless. One dish that we ordered (butter chicken) was closer to room temperature than being steaming hot like it should be served. I feel as if all they did to prepare this dish was open a jar of butter chicken base and mix in chicken used for kebabs!

Service was terrible to say the least. We constantly had to ask twice for any requests (water etc) and although they walked past our table several times, not once did they ask how the food was or if they could get us anything. 

Once we were done eating and asked for containers and the bill, I had more than enough time to walk down the street, grab coffee from a timmies (which was the best part of the meal) and walk back before the bill was settled.

Would not recommend and definitely will not be returning.
