A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA The decor is super dated and the strangest kind of tacky but it seemed like there were a lot of late night dates over dinner here. I'd say it's standard vegetarian Indian food; it wasn't amazing but it wasn't awful either. My spice tolerance is pretty high and there were a couple of things that made down a few glasses of water. There were also a few fusion dishes like Manchurian idli and Sichuan dosas. (Didn't get to try those so I'll leave that for next time)  

Things I had: 
-Got a falooda but it came with vanilla ice cream and not kulfi as stated in the menu. :( 
-The Assorted Palace Hor-d'oeuvres is super filling. Definitely needs to be shared and even then it's just a lot of starch to eat. 
-Thali is always my go-to when I was to try a bunch of different things. There were a couple of spicy dishes in there but a yogurt to offset that. Definitely a substantial meal for one person. (I definitely couldn't finish one on my one) It also comes with something sweet to finish on!
