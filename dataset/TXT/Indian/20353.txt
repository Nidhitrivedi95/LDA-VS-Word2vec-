FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA Went to Madras Cafe for the first time tonight. Got the Masala Dosa, Veg Manchurian, and Hakka Noodles. Split the dishes between three people. AMAZING. None of us had ever had Indian food before! Very reasonable prices, everything tastes so unique and delicious. The Manchurian was a bit spicy, but delicious! Our waiter also gave us complimentary Gulab Jamun for dessert! He thoroughly explained the menu, and was very helpful with our questions. We will definitely be coming back! (The dipping sauces with the Dosa were also so yummy, there were three included with the dish)
