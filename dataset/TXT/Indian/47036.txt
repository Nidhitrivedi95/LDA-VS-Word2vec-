t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q I am a huge fan of Fredericks. This place really caught me off guard. After reading bad reviews of service, it was really good. The place filled up after  7 so we got here just in time.

The General Tao Fish wasn't red sweet and sour but more authentic with red chili's.  Flavor was on point. I could have eaten that by itself.

The chicken 88 has  Malay flavor.  Not too spicy so we emptied the chili jar on our table but the flavor was nice.

The Manchurian tofu and veg was just deep fried tofu with broccoli,  baby corn, boc chui , carrots,  onions in a soy base but style tasted bland. The other dishes made it up.

I am eager to explore this place some more. Highly recommended.
