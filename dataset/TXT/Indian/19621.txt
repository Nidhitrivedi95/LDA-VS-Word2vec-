FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg Been here a couple times. Good service and food. Except for the last visit where we ordered the jumbo tandoori chicken wings and when it came out they weren't jumbo but small chicken wings. The times we went before they were big chicken wings but not this recent visit. It was disappointing and it's not like they gave more wings because they were smaller either. The butter chicken is delicious and the veggie samosas. Mango lassi was good too. I would come back but hopefully next time they would have jumbo wings as its stated on the menu.
