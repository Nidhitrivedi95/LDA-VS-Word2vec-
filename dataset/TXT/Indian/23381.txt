gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Best Indian food in Las Vegas! Great food. Great service. Can't go wrong :) 

My Recommendations: 

1. For Appetizers: Vegetarian Samosa, Chicken Momos (spicy). 

2. For Entrees: Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Bhindi Masala (Vegetable - Okra), Garlic & Regular Naan (to dip w/ Curries), Chicken or Mutton Biryani (Indian Jumbalaya), Raita (yogurt sauce to cool you down if you can't handle the spice).

3. For Dessert: Gulab Jamun (Indian donut in sugar syrup), Kheer (Indian tapioca pudding).
