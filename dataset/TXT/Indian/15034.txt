cJLx99fsYPM0SlNfWLb4Ug I've have enjoyed Indian cuisine for many years. This place is the best. While the buffet here is smaller than most, the quality of food is absolutely second to none. I can't say enough good things about this place. If you like Indian food like I do, you must come eat here. The tandoori chicken is perfect as well as everything they choose to serve you. No way will you be disappointed
