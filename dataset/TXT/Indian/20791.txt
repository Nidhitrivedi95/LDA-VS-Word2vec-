g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA My daughter and I were in the area after an appointment. We checked out Yelp to see what was nearby and this popped up.
   Sometimes it's a risk listening to the reviews of fellow Yelpers. Not this time!
  Pastries and Chaat is a tiny little place tucked in a strip mall. Walking in, you are greeted by a clean, minimally decorated dining area. The pastry display is like a slice of heaven! A wide array of cakes and mousses are beautifully displayed.
   My daughter ordered the chicken tikka pizza. It was unexpectedly delicious! I ordered the samosa chaat. It was very tasty. I'm normally not a big fan of chutney, but the spices were spot on and the yogurt sauce helped cut the tang of the green chutney down a bit. The chickpeas were plentiful. 
    We decided to try some dessert. Oh. My. Gosh! I wanted to just bury my face in the slice of cake I ordered. 
  The next time we're in the area we plan on stopping in and trying more of their chaat selections as well as their amazing sweets!
