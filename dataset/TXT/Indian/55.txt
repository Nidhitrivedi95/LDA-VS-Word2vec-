-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g When trying a new restaurant we like order the same thing. We started with
Samosa great flavor and the shell was thin and not doughy. Then we had the 
Alogobi  baggan barta , chicken tikki marshala . All delicious and excellent flavor.
We plan to return . And enjoy some of their tandoori. Friendly and fast
Service. Worth a visit
