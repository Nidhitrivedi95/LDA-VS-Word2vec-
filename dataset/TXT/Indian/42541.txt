r7JM2s-kkcFf47H7yl0PUw The food alone would get 5 stars, but just a couple of things at this quality vegetarian Indian let it down. The service was a bit sketchy, aways friendly, they just weren't quite on top of things. And the coffee at the end of the meal was instant (although on the house, along with my companion's whiskey). 

Thes a great selection of main courses but we opted for the Thali which induced a starter (pakoras), three curries, chapatis, rice and one sweet dish. It was all great, delicious and not stodgy at all. The poppadoms we had were a little on the greasy side but tasted good and were freshly cooked. Good selection of chutneys/dips too.  

They've got Cobra, Kingfisher or Tenants on draught and looks like they do a lunch buffet too though can't comment on that. 

If you enjoy curry, you'll love the food, and it's so tasty if you're not vegetarian you probably won't miss the meat.
