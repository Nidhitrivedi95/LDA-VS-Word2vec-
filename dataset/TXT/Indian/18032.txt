ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ I placed a catering order for about 60 people for a group at Carnegie Mellon University. The ordering process was fantastic. I called and gave all the details of the event and how much I was able to spend. A menu was created based on my budget and preferences. (Heavy vegetarian options needed.)

When the day came, the food arrived hot, on time and was tasty! We had some leftovers and enjoyed them just as much the next day, too.
