OGSWuGLLW_8TBmQ_wWhdEQ I went here to grab some food w my mom for fathers day. Had heard about them from yelp so thought I would check it out myself.

The owner, Lena is very friendly.  She was at the till and hearing I'd been there for the first she offered some doubles (I blurted out " like at tim's - clearly not a coffee but a little of cultural ignorance on my part).  The double is 2 Small flatbreads with curried chickpeas in between.  Not too bad but oily and carby :) which of course makes it tasty.

We got the chicken and goat ( there are bone in options- i opted for boneless) roti, one spicy and one medium.  The spicy is....OHMYGOD spicy but holds enough back that you can taste the food.  The medium is actually just right if you like spicy.

The restaurant itself needs to be redone.  It isn't designed for glamour but is clean.  Has a lot of ads for local items or events that gives it a cheap look, and hand written signs are on the walls outlining rates or sales.

However, the warmth and support of the customers overshadows the physical attributes of the site.  We had customers talking to us about the history and food.  Living in Toronto I never get a small town feel in any place except this one.  People were not customers, they were family.
