eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Brar sweets is one of the most popular buffet places among people of Indian origin, especially vegetarians. The place had humble beginnings with a small restaurant that served set lunches for $5 and their consistency and deliciousness has blown them up to become a large buffet. They serve all types of Indian food - the classical Northern fare (Punjabi) which most people associate with Indian food, as well as Dosa's (savory rice crepes) from the south, to scrumptious Indian street eats (samosas, pani puri, chaat, pav bhaji etc.). They also serve pizza (as it is a family restaurant and kids just love pizza) and "Indian style" chinese food (read deep fried and well spiced -- aka delicious).

They have a good desert selection (Indian classics, pastries, fruits and ice cream) as well and recently added a chocolate fountain! This magnificent buffet for under $20 / person before tax and tip. How can you go wrong???? 

If you are in a rush, they also do take-out. Their sweets are relatively expensive compared to Indian sweet store standards, but you pay for the quality
