RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg This will be your new favorite Indian restaurant. Everything on the menu is absolute perfection. The Blue Taj is the only eating establishment that I would consider myself a true regular of... The servers are very attentive and the food is high quality, always colorful and delicious. If I could only eat at one restaurant for the rest of my life, it'd be this one. Saag Paneer and Paneer Tikka Masala w/ naan forever. Treat your date to a movie in the theater up the elevator, then a meal at the Blue Taj and congratulations, you're already a  professional lover. 

There's also a restaurant closer to uptown called Copper Modern, owned by the same people, so if your up that way, try it. Same deal, equally amazing.
