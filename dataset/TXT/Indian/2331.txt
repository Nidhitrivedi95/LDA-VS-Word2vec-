_PKXarw3GjlbwbXhjdpUMA I FINALLY decided to try this place out after years of seeing tangra featured of the snap stories of my friends.

Tangra is a go-to restaurant for flavourful, spicy, comfort foods. They primarily focus on chicken, beef, fish, and shrimp but also offer a variety of noodle, rice, and vegetarian dishes. Most of the dishes are wet and saucy ie. their chili dishes, mango dishes, sweet and spicy, sweet and sour dishes are heavily marinated with sauces and stir-fried onions. If you are looking for something dry however, I highly recommend the Tangra-Villa Meat dishes. 

To say Tangra is flavourful is an understatement. With every bite I can taste the garlic, the spices, the onions, and the parsley used in the seasoning. This is definitely an upgrade from the typical garlic and soy sauce dressing in other local Chinese restaurants.

The lady manning the phone was polite, the portion sizes were fair, and the overall takeout experience was pretty great. For around $22 tax included, my family of four was stuffed with enough leftovers for lunch the next day. Good deal.

However, do call ahead of time because it takes them 20-30 minutes usually to cook 2-3 take-out dishes, and you will have to wait in the car since the store itself is quite compact.
