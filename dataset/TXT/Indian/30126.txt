JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Amazing Chai - best I have had and I have an Indian sister-in-law that makes chai for me all the time (hers now is in second place). We ordered a Dosa as an appetizer - which was a great idea. All of our entrees were excellent and the naan was great too. One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to anywhere.
