7BIbvCkI7AXQMVC1-DHpCA Priya, I don't want to hurt you, but I give you two stars. 

You know, it didn't have to be this way. But the flavors of your Hyderabadi biryani were strangely more than similar to a biryani paste I cooked with once upon a time back in my college days. And in that giant bowl of rice you gave me? Two hidden pieces of meat. That's it. Just because there's a hard-boiled egg on top doesn't mean I'm going to ignore the fact that your special goat biryani is missing...the frickin' goat!

Then there's the option of having the biryani as part of a thali. Now how does that make sense, Priya? Sambar and biryani, together? Between you and me, that's weird. 

I'll excuse you for tarting yourself up with fake pink roses and blinking Christmas lights, but when your special dish isn't impressing me one iota, then I'm afraid you and I have some issues we need to work out. 

Correction. You need to work out.

2 stars (since you probably didn't believe me when I told you the first time)
