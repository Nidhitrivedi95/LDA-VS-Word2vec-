Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw I have been to several Indian restaurants in several cities/towns and this is about as authentic as you get! My friend, who is from Northern India (where most of the food at this particular restaurant is based on) also loves the food and felt right at home. We went for dinner around 6:30 and the place was quiet. We were served quickly and efficiently, and my friend helped guide me on some of the dishes since she was familiar with them. We grabbed the assorted platter of samosas, pakora and one other item. Then grabbed individual dishes, her the okra, and myself one of the eggplant dishes. We ordered naan to eat them with and easily finished it off, with leftovers of the main dish for take home (Woooo!). We tried each others meals and were definitely satisfied. I would definitely love to visit again for a well cooked and flavourful meal, but explore a bit more with other dishes next time.
