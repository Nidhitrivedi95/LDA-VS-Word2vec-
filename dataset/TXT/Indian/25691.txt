hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw One of the best Indian restaurants that I've been to in Las Vegas . This place is always quite, perhaps it's the location  hidden in a corner of a strip mall  or maybe the prices are higher than the average for Indian food.
However, if you like quality not quantity and respect that quality cost more  than this is the  place for you. Note the chef doesn't use a lot of Oil and Focuses on a healthier version of Indian cooking .
