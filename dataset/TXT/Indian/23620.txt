gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Had dinner during Christmas week. 

1) Extremely poor ambience. When we entered, it was so full of smoke. They had to keep the doors open for 10 min to let smoke out. we could not even sit inside and prefered to wait outside. This itself was a turn off but it was late in night and we were super hungry.

2) Dirty toillets, worn out carpets and dim lighting. Overall looks like a shack.

3) Bad food. I would still have given a good review if the food was ultimately good. But it was pathetic. We tried chicken and paneer and both were distasteful. we could not finish the foosd
