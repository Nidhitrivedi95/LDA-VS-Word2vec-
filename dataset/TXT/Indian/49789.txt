U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw I have tried a lot of Indian restaurants but by far bay leaf is my favorite. The lamb curry and kadhai chicken from MAQSOOD Bhai is very delicious. Also service from JOBAN is outstanding. We love this place and go very often and always get nice service and food. Hope things remain the same unlike other food places....
