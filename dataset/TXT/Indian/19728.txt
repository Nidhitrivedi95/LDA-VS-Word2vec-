The food is quite good and the portion size are decent as well. Their chicken Biryani, chicken korma or veal korma or Achari chicken are quite good. Palak  Paaner is not bad either. I also tried there tandoori chicken which was just right. Over all the food is above average and meat is cooked well, which is good.

The sit in service was good but had to wait a little while as our order was quite big. The serve was good inside the restaurant and place is designed nicely to have separate buckets of people and not over crowding the place.

Parking is not a problem as its in a plaza.

For my Muslim Brother and Sister - They serve halal meat
