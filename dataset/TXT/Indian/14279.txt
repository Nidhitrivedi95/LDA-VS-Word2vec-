c_ZDTkfDlfzLm0a3osk1ow We had a terrible experience at this lunch buffet. The table was not very clean with food in the crevices. The owner assured us that there was plenty of safe food for my son that is allergic to egg and dairy. The tomato soup tasted canned. The vegetarian korma had frozen vegetables. The lentils had kidney beans mixed in which I have never seen at an Indian restaurant before. It all ended with my son puking on the floor. So much for a dairy free meal. Not sure how this place got a four.
