Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ Food was excellent and could easily be given 5 stars. Service however needs to be improved. We were a party of 4. 2 of us ordered the prefix and 2 ordered a la carte. For some reason we were given a drink menu but not the food menu when we first arrived. It is difficult to pick your wine choice when you can't even see the food options you might be closing from. While we given water right away, we were at there for at least 30-40 minutes before our drinks arrived.   I found the wine pours to be on the small side, especially with all glasses of wine being almost $10. 
The server repeatedly went through what we ordered but mumbled through it every-time so we could hardly understand what he was saying.  This was annoying when the bill came and he over charged us and then argued about what we ordered.  We also had one bill and each figured out what we owe but the server wasted a lot of time trying to split the bill and getting it wrong every time.   We also had to remind the server a couple times that 2 of our meals came with dessert since he was plopping the bill down right after our mains were down. 

Food was great. The lamp chop app on the pre fix was excellent with a ton of flavour. The lobster and shrimp dish was lacking lobster because they were out (which was very disappointing) but still excellent.   I have no idea what the dessert was but I took it home and ate it the next day and it was very good.
