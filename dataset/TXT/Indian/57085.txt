XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Maybe not the best Indian food in Toronto, but definitely the best on West Queen West (west of dufferin :). 

Their Rotis are amazing, huge and delicious.  If you don't want to eat all that dough, you can have the meal with rice, very good basamati rice, usually well cooked, though once I had sticky bunches, which usually mean that the rice cooker was left on too long.

The three pages in the menu (I ignore vegetarian options :) are chicken, lamb and seafood (shrimp).  Each style of dish can come with each meat, and is counted as separate dish on the menu.

Some of the styles are Butter (Chicken, Lamb or Shrimp), Madras, Saag, Tika, etc.  I really liked Chicken Saag on rice. 

The ambiance is nothing special, but the food is good and the service is friendly.
