rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA Came here twice. Ordered the butter chicken one time, and got a masor daal the second time. The butter chicken dish comes with naan and salad but you can ask to change the naan for rice if you prefer. The butter chicken was creamy and tasty and had a very distinct tomato soup kind of taste mixed into it (but it wasn't bad!) The masoor dal comes with naan and salad also but I asked to change the naan for rice. The daal had some spice to it and it didn't taste very traditional but the portion was quite large so that was good. Also, be sure to ask for utensils because they don't give it to you even if you order to go.
