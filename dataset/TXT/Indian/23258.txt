gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Our favorite lunch buffet! We were there by chance after driving from Bonnie Springs. As always, Prakash greeted us with a great big welcome. It's been awhile since he saw us. Prakash was helpful, polite and accommodating. It's Full Halal by the way so Mum can eat anything she wants. The Goat curry, Dhaal, Chili Chicken and everything else on the menu was Delicious! Oh by the way, that Garlic Nun was our fave. So soft and yummy!. Thanks Prakash and all the crew for a job well done. Superb customer service. See you all soon!!
