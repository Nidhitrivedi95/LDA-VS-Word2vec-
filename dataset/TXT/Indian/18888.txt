ERX_Dz1prKPk_qXtFhUsAA I came here with a friend for dinner on a Tuesday night.  The place was empty so we had no issues with service.

I ordered the Chetti Chicken.  It is a coconut and onion based chicken curry. I am a sucker for coconut, so I really enjoyed the contrast of flavors in conjunction with the onions.  It came with rice and naan. My friend ordered a vegetarian dish, it looked and smelled delicious.  The server was on top of our water and Naan at all times.

The presentation was clean and simple and the service was pleasant. Nothing amazing, but definitely a good place. I will have to check out the lunch buffet sometime.
