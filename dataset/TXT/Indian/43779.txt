RTCxYW8ovC4BTKGBKOPvrw Good Indian food. Authentic and tasty. The owner is present and she is charming. Quiet for supper. Traditional french neighborhood that probably doesn't appreciate this type of food. Cultural shock if your looking for pizza or subs. Large portions and fresh. Nothing prepared in advance here. Tacky decor but who cares. Reasonably priced. This is our third visit. We are working our way down the menu. Recommend
