ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte, hands down. The place is tiny, but it is packed with goodness. The flavors in this restaurant have me craving it constantly. The price for the lunch boxes is outstanding, but try the buffet and dinners as well. Ridiculously delicious.
