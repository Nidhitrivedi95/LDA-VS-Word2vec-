Our party of 7 dine at Udupi last night and we all thoroughly enjoyed every dish we had.  We started with the Sev puri which I call it "a party in your mouth" because of all the unique different flavours and textures that just explodes in your mouth.  We did family style in which we shared a variety of dishes but my favourite is the vegetarian curry recommended by one of our server.  I also really liked the masala dolsa. Perfect combination of crunchy crepe with tasty potato inside.   The chilli paneer was super spicy for me so eat at your own risk.  

Service was quick and efficient. Our total bill was $127 with taxes and gratuity and we were all stuffed.
