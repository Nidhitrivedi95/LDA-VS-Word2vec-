ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg My husband and I tried Copper tonight for our anniversary. We just recently became vegetarian and have been looking for restaurants that offer  great plant-forward dishes. Copper was AMAZING. We've never tried Indian food before but wanted to try something different and this was the best decision we could've ever made! Great romantic location, warm ambiance, superb service, wonderful menu options, and above all delicious, refined exquisite food anybody would love!
