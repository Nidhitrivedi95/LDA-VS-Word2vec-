Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Excellent Indian cuisine. I have been to many Indian restaurant this is certainly among the best.  The waiters are very friendly and the food is excellent.  Jaspreet is as good as Kumar.  Both were very friendly.  Naan was moist and great.  The pakora are very good appetizers.  Ofcourse Palak Panner is outstanding.   I certainly would go here again.  It's a great find.  Thanks for all the previous reviews that led us to this place.   Very satisfying dinner.
