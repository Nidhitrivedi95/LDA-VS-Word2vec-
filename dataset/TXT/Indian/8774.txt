7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Horrible service, buffet food was cold and seemed like leftovers from a previous day

Had to ask Caucasian waiter for my water and naan after 10 minutes of waiting, while manager just sat at the bar looking at his phone. Don't refer to me as "guy" or "dude" when bringing my water please. 

Would not recommend this Indian restaurant. Bad service and bad food
