kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I took myself out on a date to celebrate the end of the semester teaching at ITT at Maharani last night. Before I switched teams to be a fan of Woodlands, Maharani was my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. 

I enjoyed Maharani last night again. I had the Vegetarian Thali, which kind of gives you the experience of eating buffet even when the buffet isn't open. The whole meal was a little pricey ($25 with tip), but it was more than I could eat. I had leftovers today!

The service was friendly and fast, and the food was delicious (if not quite as fabulous as Woodlands). I prefer to go to Maharani when there's a buffet, so I wish it had been the afternoon. It's great for lunch!
