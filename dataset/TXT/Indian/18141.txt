EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg My sister and I were on the hunt for tacos, but the line was too crazy. 30-45 minute wait! 

So I love my Indian fix and was hanging outside the restaurant with my sister browsing the menu. The owner came out, did some sweet talk, and then we ordered! 

WILL UPDATE MORE LATER.
