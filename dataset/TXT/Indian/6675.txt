49sbCG7F2jvqJsfG6-N8Rw Awesome experience for a first time Indian food eater. Cool outdoor environment and BYOB. But above all else, our waiter was top notch. He made us feel comfortable about the menu, gave recommendations, and made the experience a blast. And there was a nice amount of food at a good price! We will certainly be back to this gem!
