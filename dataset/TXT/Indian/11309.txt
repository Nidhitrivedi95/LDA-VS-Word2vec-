Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w The only place downtown to get a Thali and Choley Bhaturay!!!! I've only gotten delivery from here and I have to say it is so fast!! The food is so AUTHENTIC and delicious, that's being said as an Indian who doesn't like any of the Indian restaurants downtown. The chilli fries are amazing as well, super spicy though. Definitely my go to when I miss home.
