gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Love this place. It's always delicious, and the service is always stellar. Tonight I had veggie korma, which is great because it also comes with paneer chunks. I had a mango lassi and garlic naan, too. My husband and sister in law shared lamb korma and chicken tiki masala, and they loved their meals so much that they had no leftovers. I look forward to my korma later this evening or tomorrow for lunch!
