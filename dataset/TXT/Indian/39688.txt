P4zWgzYzy03D9LeDTpKuDg I've never had a dosa before. Okay - I lied, I've had a dosa, but never an authentic one.  It was 9:30 PM on a Saturday night, and there was STILL a line-up!  This is when you know it's going to be a good place.  My friend recommended this place to us and she really pushed for it.  Service was great - they were very friendly with us, but it was funny because the waiter made us order different things.

Truth be told, I had no idea what I was really eating, but it was delicious.  Not only that, I got to eat with my hands for the first time.  I was not as elegant as those who have eaten there before.

LOVED the place.  If only I came to Mississauga a bit more often.
