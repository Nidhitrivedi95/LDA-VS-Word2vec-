x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ This place is Indo-Chinese. Very nice décor, cool atmosphere.  

If you like Indian, Thai or Chinese food you will probably like this place. The food has a lot of flavor and spice to it. If you are Indian, this is like little India inside with all the clientele, so a great place to take your Indian parent who are SUPER picky. 

One note, their apps are better than their entrees. I think they do dry currys the best but with wet currys they are not as good.
