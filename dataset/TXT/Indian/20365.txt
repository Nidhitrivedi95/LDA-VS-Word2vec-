FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA My craving for dosa took me to this place. Me and one of my American friend came here at around 7.30. It was kind of busy. We were welcomed by a server. First impression of service forced me to give 5*. We placed order for masala dosa and chilly PANEER dosa. It was so yummy that I could not stop myself from ordering other one.. my friend enjoyed it a lot. Definitely the best tiffin place in town.. will go back..
