2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw I am very sad to do this but I'm going to have to downgrade this place to 3 stars (from 5 stars).  I had takeout here recently and the quality of the food has gone downhill and the prices have gone up.

The Chicken Kothu Roti is now $4.99 and the portion is smaller.  There is also less meat.  The Meat Thali has also gone up by a dollar, so it's now ($5.99), and the portions are also stingier.  I got 2 small pieces of chicken curry, a tablespoonful of spinach curry and 2 tablespoonfuls of peas and paneer curry, and a moderate amount of basmati rice.  It still came with a naan (although even the naan is smaller than it used to be) and a Gulab Jamun.    

The Mutton Rolls are still $0.75 but they are now mostly potato, with very little mutton.  The meat samosas are still 2 for $1 but they are smaller with less meat than they used to have.

So all in all, the food is ok, but since they are skimping on the protein, it's even more dense in carbs now and doesn't taste as good as it used to.  Also with the price increases and the portion-size decreases, it's not as much of a bargain as it used to be.  It's still pretty cheap to eat here, but it's not as awesome as a deal as it used to be.  Sad face.
