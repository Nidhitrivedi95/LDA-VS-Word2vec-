TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ 50 minute wait was unacceptable. I get that you had two big parties of people dining in but we put our order in before they arrived and were told it would only take 30 minutes. It was our fault for taking a walk for our "30 minute" wait, I guess they forgot about us...unacceptable. 
The food once we got it was very hot and in large serving sizes. The crispy beef wasn't the best but the Singapore noodles were tasty.
We also had the general Tao chicken and chilli fish. Tasty but have had better! 

We might go back but would probably explore other Hakka restaurants first. The seating area is small and outdated but if you want food fast, dine-in & opt out of take-out!
