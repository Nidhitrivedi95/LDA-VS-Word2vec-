ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ The dosas here are absolutely delicious. They look really big but they're smaller than they look since they're so flat, eating the whole thing is doable.

I had the mutton dosa and I tried a few bites of the chili cheese dosa, and both tasted great. The chili cheese dosa was particularly tasty, know that you can also get it with meat instead of potatoes if you wish. The tomato chutney that comes with the dosa was a great sauce to dip with, though I hear from my friends that it was quite spicy.... "it builds up"? I have a high tolerance, so I couldn't really tell.

There was also some deep fried paneer appetizer that was really good. Heck, everything I tried here was really good. I'll definitely be a regular for those post-workout meals :)

P.S. Music is great.
