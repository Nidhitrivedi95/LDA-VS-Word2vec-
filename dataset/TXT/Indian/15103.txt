CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw We enjoyed our experience immensely. Greeted at the front door (very welcoming) and had no problems confirming our third party reservation. Were seated within 5 minutes. 
Service was top notch. We chose a Valentines Day Special that provided a full course meal for each. Great combination of foods. Excellent value for money. 
Although busy, we were not rushed. 
Recommended.
