gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Really fresh, fancy and tasty lunch buffet. Loved the sweet rice, plus best galub jamun ever. Rich, sweet, moist. Friendly and attentive staff. Samosas, pakora, saag paneer - rich and nutty veggie sauce choices. $10.99 weekdays. Perfect alternative away from the crappy food on the Strip.
