ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ This is the only Indian place I've ever seen with a patio. On a gorgeous day it was so nice! 

For an appetizer we got the onion badji with tamarind and cilantro sauces. It was very good. The other appetizer we got was something with whole chick peas in it and covered with yogurt, tamarind sauce, and cilantro sauce. It was served cold and I didn't care for it that much.

We got some soft drinks and they were charmingly served in glasses with a bowl of ice and a spoon on the side. 

For our main courses we got the chicken kothu paratha, and two lamb curries, one tender. All were good. We had it served with paratha and rice. 

Overall a great evening.
