Ydo_fjixKeEmPtgHs8IPMQ Dreadful, offensively bad! Soggy naan, tough chicken, soggy pakora! Just total crap! 

It was a quiet Friday night and i decided a curry would be nice. I went on just eat and near the top was this place. So ordered I did.

Was told it was be 45 minutes....ok, 90 minutes later the god arrived. And well it was crap, waste of money!
