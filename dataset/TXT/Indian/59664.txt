Zcd2yYA5ck-38duDOg6dww Well i had more expectations from the place than what was served on the plate. The portions are really small. The mushroom starters were sort of cold with few drops of chutneys. Chilli paneer was more of paneer ki sabzi in onion n tomato gravy with really hard paneer chunks. Tiffin and friendly service were the only good part about the place. It's a below average counterpart of host and I would much rather prefer host to this place.
