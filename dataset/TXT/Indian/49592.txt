tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Tasteless dinner. I would never go back to this place. They had buffet for Sunday dinner. Although they had a lot of food choices but none had good taste to it except their desserts. You see paneer was so watery. It annoys me that a restaurant in business can't serve good food to their customers. 2 stars for chat and dessert only!
