gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Kabob Korner is definitely not fine dining but for what it is, it's awesome.     We were downtown after visiting the Mob Museum and consulted Yelp for help with lunch and found Kabob Korner.

The place is pretty small and not anything fancy but the food was terrific.    I had the beef kabob and my husband had the Super Gyro.    Mine was really good, his was fantastic!     Mine came with a couple sauces that were very tasty - not sure what they are but they are really good.     Only other place I've had anything similar is at the Afghan Kebob House in NYC so it must be a "kabob thing".

My kabob came with rice so I didn't get fries but they looked really tasty with some kind of spices on top.     Next visit I'll go for the Super Gyro and a side of fries as I'm sure we'll be back on our next trip to Vegas.
