I have tried other Indian restaurants in town and found them to be either too expensive or catering more to the Indian customers at not giving me very much attention. Mt. Everest was recommended by my Indian doctor (not for health reasons) and it is everything for which I could have hoped. You can expect all the usual fare prepared well and to order. I am vegetarian and my girlfriend is vegan. We were guided through the menu very kindly to support our dietary needs and a couple dishes were altered to further that cause. Can't wait to return. 

#2-Wonderful food and they really work hard to make things right. My girlfriend is vegan and "assumed" the vegetarian dishes were vegan. Nope. Many of those contain yogurt or are served with a dollop of butter. The owner quickly took care of this and made something special that was completely vegan. It is much appreciated and after our second visit we are even more impressed than after the first wonderful visit. We will be returning and telling our friends.
