jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg My husband and I have been to JOTC a bunch of times. The food are always delicious, the service is spotty at times but not bad enough to make us not comeback. Now according to my Australian husband this isn't exactly the best Indian food he's ever have but until Phoenix comes up with better Indian food they got our business.
