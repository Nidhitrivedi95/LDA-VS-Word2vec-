UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I wish we would've just gone to our old standby Tamba which was not even a block from the hotel, but the wife (who NEVER wants to try anything new) wanted to try a new Indian restaurant.  The service was somewhat inattentive.  We had hot supposedly Chai tea, but no one brought out any kind of sweetener until we requested some.  (I should've had a nice cold Taj Mahal beer.)  The food was just fair with the standout being the malai kofta.  The tandoori mixed grill (lamb and swordfish) and saag paneer were pretty bland.  I've had way better food back home in Maryland.  They spoiled me rotten apparently.  Next time we're in Vegas and want Indian we know where NOT to go.
