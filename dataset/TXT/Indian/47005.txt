t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Delicious hakka chinese food.

We had Chili chicken, fish pakoras, singapore rice noodles.  The fish pakoras were light and crispy, singapore rice noodles were delicious, chili chicken was nice also although I thought the batter coating on the chicken was a bit hard.  The spice was perfect.

Overall we enjoyed the food even more than Fredericks.  Staff was friendly and since we went for early lunch it wasn't busy.  Will come again!
