-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Gave it a shot! Phoenix has some decent buffet style Indian restaurants, this is not one of them. This is an ordinary a la carte Indian restaurant at least for dinner service where each dish can probably feed a person or leave just enough room for dessert after. Food quality was somewhat authentic, a bit westernized but hey it's Phoenix and people here judge food based on their trashy idea of what they think butter chicken and tikka are supposed to taste like. Vindaloo sauce was near perfect and the tikka wasn't bad. 

If you're in the area and craving Indian food, it's probably one of the best Indian places you'll be able to find.

8/10 for food.
7/10 for service and speed.
