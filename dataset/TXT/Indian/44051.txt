RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w now i dont have much experience with pakistani food, but this place met all expectations surrounding it.  we'd pass by all the time, seeing people on this makeshift patio, sitting around simple white tables, eating on paper plates, looking generally quite festive.

so finally on a hot summer day we strolled in, were cordially ushered to a table, given menus and asked whether wed like veggie or meat samosas.  those were the apps.  those were great.  the food had a nice spicy kick to it that was not overwhelming, and everything was fresh and flavourful.

i had the Karahi Gosht (Lamb) and we shared the combo sizzler which is a combo of the following different vegetable dishes: Tarka Dal (lentils), Aloo Gobi (Cauliflower & Potato), Chana Masala (Chick Peas) and Palak (Spinach).  

it was that type of thing where you are enjoying yourself so much, and the food is so good, youll go against your better judgement and contine stuffing your face when you already can feel that your full.

if you are particular about ambiance, then take a hike, and far away from this place, so i can enjoy my meal in simple pleasure.
