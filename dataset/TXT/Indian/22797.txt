grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg I was told that I have not lived until I've eaten food from Babu's - WRONG!
The guy behind the counter was very nice and even gave me a meat samosa to try as I was curious if they were good. They were not bad but I prefer Indian/Pakistani style better. The Kottu Roti which came highly recommended to me was a huge disappointment. I don't think there was anything wrong with it per say, however as per most Tamil style food, It has way too many curry leaves in it. This gives a really overpowering taste (to me) and just turns me off the food altogether. I'm Indian from Mumbai (WEST COAST RULES!) so Im not anti curry leaves at all. Just too much for my taste. But if you like Tamil style food - you probably want to come to Babu's. They must be doing something right based on the line ups out the door!
