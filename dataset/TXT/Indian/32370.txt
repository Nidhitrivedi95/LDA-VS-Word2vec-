LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw I've been here twice since I started working in the strip.  Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.  First time I had a gyro and fries, the gyro was massive, and came with a load of fries.  Everyone I talk to loves their fries..

Today, I tried their BBQ chicken, with basmati rice and chick peas.  Awesome flavors all day, huge portions.  I can say I will be coming back a lot more, and I'm looking forward to trying the rest of their menu!!
