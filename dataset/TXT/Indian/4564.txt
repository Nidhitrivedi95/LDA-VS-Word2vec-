2-Y-kNEbrP_m1U9Hc2xH7A I've just read several glowing reviews of this restaurant.  I have to say I disagree. Perhaps the food was poor because I went mid-afternoon, mid-week and was the only patron there at the time. I had bought a Groupon for the meal. That's what brought me there. The outside appearance is shabby, but the interior is interesting: strangely sloped wood-paneled ceilings, stone work, murals, etc. Very nice. I ordered the lamb kebab. You'd think with a name that includes the word "kebab" the lamb would have been good. But no: It was just awful. It was overdone, dry and tasteless. The chickpea side was okay, and the bread, pan, was excellent. But I couldn't enjoy it. I would have sent the lamb back, but for some reason I didn't. I asked that it be wrapped up; I through it out when I got home.
