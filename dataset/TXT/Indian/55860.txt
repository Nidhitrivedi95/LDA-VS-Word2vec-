xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Didn't even realize there was an Indian restaurant so close to us! We ordered the chicken tikka and lamb biryani and a slice of their death my chocolate cake. Couldn't have been happier! Everything was moist, flavorful and delicious. Even though we ordered for pick up the waiters were still so nice courteous. We will definitely we going back :)
