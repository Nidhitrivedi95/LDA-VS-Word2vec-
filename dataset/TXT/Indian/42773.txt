RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I ended up on the south side for lunch and since Cafe Nirvana does not open on Mondays, I decided to see if all the hype of Blue Taj was legit. I would suggest just parking and asking someone where the restaurant is because you will never find it just driving around.....it's around the corner from Terrace Cafe. I loved the decor of this place and the service was grand. I started out with samosas which were good but I felt that there was an ingredient missing from the actual turnover pastry itself(not that I'm an expert on Indian food:-). I tried the Kerala Style Seafood which was very good, with naan and a salad......again, I felt there was something missing from the naan......I dunno, but I would like to try the Sunday buffet or dinner at some point. Overall, I think I like Copper better.
