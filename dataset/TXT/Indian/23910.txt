gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Stopped by this unassuming little Indian joint before going to a show a while ago and I found it to be a great find. The restaurant is actually an old Burger King, but the decor inside hides its tragic past. 

The food was well made and came out quickly. The service was great; the waiter was attentive but never hovered. He even made sure my table knew we ordered both vegetarian and meaty dishes so as to avoid confusion. 

I would recommend this place and happily go back again.
