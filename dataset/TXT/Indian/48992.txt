TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw We were visiting Vegas from out of town for the weekend and Yelp reviews point us to Namaste! This place is great! The food, service and owner/singer are absolutely fabulous! The owner and staff are happy to recommend items on the menu for those that aren't so familiar with Indian food. All recommendations were DELICIOUS! 

Every time we are in town, we will dine at Namaste!
