UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw Thes is my go to place for great Indian cuisine around the Chandler area. The buffet is the way to go because you get all different varieties for a low price of $10.00 (wkdays). Your meal comes with fresh small dosas which is a crepe like item stuffed with a little bit of curry potato. On top of the dosas the waiter also serves fresh naan, you can get regular or garlic. Some of my favorites I choose from the buffet are butter chicken, goat curry, chicken biriyani and on Fridays they serve complimentary lassi. I also golet down with the vegetarian dishes as well. I've never tasted vegetables cooked so right with the perfect mixtire of spices. The spices used in these dishes are used so well you would never miss meat..... well....not that good. LOL 
The pickles and chutney they serve on the buffet are also a different sensation. The added sourness, bitterness and spice really compliments the whole meal. When in the Chandler area you should try this place out.
