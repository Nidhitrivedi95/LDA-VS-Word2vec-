67-W33G-nihf5UtOj5Mivw I don't understand why there aren't more reviews on this excellent Indian fast-food. I came across this place by accident and decided to try it out ,being a fan of Indian food.

Even though the mall (Les Faubourgs) looks sketchy, don't be fooled, this might be the best quality food you can have for the price you will pay. We ordered two full plates that included salads, rice and potatoes, one plate was a mix of vegetarian curries and the other one was butter chicken, one Naan bread ( for us it was made right on the spot in an authentic Tandoor oven), and one samosa. The total was of 20$. I was very skeptical but once I had my first bite, I knew I had to come back for more. 

The food wasn't too spicy but you had the choice to add very spicy sauce if you are a fan of hot food. The food and sauces were fresh and the Naan is hands down the best I have ever had (no kidding).

In conclusion, if you are looking for fast Indian food for a good price, you need to try this out.
