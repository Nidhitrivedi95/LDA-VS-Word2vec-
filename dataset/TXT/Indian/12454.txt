aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ This was my first experience with kathi rolls, which are a type of street-food popular in Kolkata. They're kind of like a cross between a kabab and a burrito. I'm very excited that more interesting restaurants such as this are opening on this stretch of Yonge. 

In general, I was very impressed with Kathi Roll Express. I had the lamb seekh kabab with "jumbo meat." I used quotations there because even with extra meat it wasn't all that filling. I really enjoyed it though! The bits of kabab were very falvourful and under the wrap was cooked egg and some very tasty spices.

The restaurant itself has a great vibe. There's a projector playing Bollywood music videos non-stop, lots of old Bollywood posters on the exposed-brick walls, and wooden bench-like seating. They really went all out with the Indian streetfood theme. It's also a bit hipsterish for Yonge street with its edison bulbs and plastic crate chandelier. 

I plan to return to try some of the fusion dishes, such as the Mexican and Korean-style rolls. There's a lot on this menu that looks really interesting. Since my only complaint was the serving size was a bit small, I'll order a side next time.
