VuW81oFt6-X9-vMYFYJY6Q Cream Chicken is well known in the Western World.
From the pedestrian Campbell's to classic Bechamel.
It was more than interesting to find an Indian inspired.

A well franchised Indian brand landing in Brampton.
Not a bad place to dine by any means but be patient.
Takes time to freshly prepare the Food as noted.

Chawla Cream Chicken is the obvious choice to explore here.
I expected lots for the price point but not as impressed in the end.
I was lucky to get Naan complimentary on Weekdays(Mon-Thu).
I tried not to think about Campbell's Cream Soups too much.
But at the end it's only different by "      " that much unfortunately.

Hyderabadi Goat Biryani($11.99) wasn't half bad.
Just got it to have something additional and filling.
Yeah, it looks different served with Jap-style plastic Boat dish.
That's what I call new fusion and inspiring.
