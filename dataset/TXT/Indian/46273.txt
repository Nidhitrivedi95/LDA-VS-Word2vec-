sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Not getting a 5 star because I have had rotis that were ordered by others and not picked up, I was always disappointed with them.
However, ordering my own roti has always been perfect.  I started going to Ghandi's when they first opened up and I have been going ever since.  Huge portions, enough for two but if I am really hungry, I can eat the whole thing.  I usually get the saag with potatoes bc I try to aviod dairy and they always comply.  Everything is so good there.
