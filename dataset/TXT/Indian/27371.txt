IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Stumbled across this place one night by chance and I have to say i have not received better service by a wait staff in years. The price is on par with most Indian buffets in the area. $9.99 for lunch and $13.99 for dinner. Their spread includes the usual fixings (butter chicken, masala, salad, cooked to order naan, rice pudding, tandoori, etc.) Their goat was especially delicious and their butter chicken was moist into the center which I look for whenever I have it. 

No complaints about this place although not the most prominent easy finding location, their cozy family style ambiance and cheery staff made it a very pleasant dining experience. 

I left a huge tip which I never do because I'm a cheapskate but they deserved every penny.
