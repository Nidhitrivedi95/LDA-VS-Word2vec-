iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw one of the best indian restaurants i have been to, i had the butter chicken and the chicken korma, both were well cooked and with the right amount of spice, and we had the bread and rice with them and they were perfect together.

downside, the restaurant is pricey, the main meal does not come with the rice or the bread, and you have to order that separately.

location is perfect and its very close to Osgood subway station.

the atmosphere is great and its a bit intimate, its great for dates too. Overall good atmosphere minus the priciness
