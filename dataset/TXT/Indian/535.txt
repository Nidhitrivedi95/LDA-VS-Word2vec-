-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g Food was good, atmosphere was nice, "Food service" was also good... only thing that bothered me was when it was time to pay... We waited 15 minutes before the owner made eye contact with us and we asked for the check, he told the waitress to give us the check and no acknowledgement was made... After 20 minutes the owner looked our way and signaled to the waitress to give us our check which she did. When the credit card was given to the waitress she threw the credit card on the bar and walked to the back to get someone's order, 3 workers picked up the card and threw it back on the bar. My card went into to many hands for my liking. Because of this situation I would not be returning.
