f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg This review is for WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET ONLY! 
Food is Not too spicy. The taste is not like your typical India restaurant curry and biriyani,although it's too oily. Number of dishes in the buffet is too few. The biriyani is to die for, far better than your typical South Indian biriyani. The owner is a very nice and friendly man. The neighborhood is a little shady though. They have only paper plates and plastic silverware to eat with, but some days, they have China and metal silverware instead . The place is really clean though. Worth a try for weekday lunch... Dinner however is a completely different story (in a good way :) ).
