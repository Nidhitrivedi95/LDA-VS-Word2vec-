LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA One of the best dosa/South Indian restaurants in the GTA. It's so good - I crave this food. I get hungry just even thinking about it. Seriously - come here. 

Quick tips: CALL AND MAKE A RESERVATIONS ON FRI/SAT/SUN - it is mandatory.

This place is packed, you will have to wait even with a reservation if it's later on. But the food is worth it. They may rush you towards the end and rush to take your order but that's only because there are people waiting. This isn't the place to sit and chat with friends for 2 hours. It's a place to have a quick catch up and delish food!  It's so good I don't mind the wait. Just clear your evening. 

If you've never tried a dosa before you're missing out- you should try it here. It's a vegetarian restaurant so you won't get meat here, but I promise it's so flavourful you will NOT even miss it.

Amazing dosa - crispy yet soft. They also have creative options for fillings (cheese, pay bhaji, tofu, spring vegetable, spicy coconut etc), tasty chutney with good quantities offered, the sambar (lentil spicy soup) was also sooooo good! Fabulous food and flavours overall. They gave good portions of the sides/chutneys, which in my opinion, is amazing.

We also tried the sambar vada which was fab. Service was good- better than the rival dosa place we all know.

Service is good. Friendly, quick, prompt. You gotta kinda know the menu and have your questions ready during busy times but everyone I've encountered is polite!
