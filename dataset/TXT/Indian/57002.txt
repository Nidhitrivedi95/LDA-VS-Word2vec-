Normally I look forward to state fairs or festival type gatherings to get fry bread, but ever since I had this fry bread there is no need to wait! In fact, the Fry Bread House is much better than any other I have tried, so I skip it unless I am here. I usually get the Indian Taco, which is fry bread with beans, cheese, and lettuce. Big serving..  you will be more than satisfied. Do not forget to try the honey and powder sugar! Amazing and worth the extra calories.
