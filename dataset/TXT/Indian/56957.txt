xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw When I think of Arizona and food I think of Indian Fry Bread. I'm so happy that this full service restaurant exists and that I don't have to go to a stand on a dirt road alongside an Indian tourist attraction to indulge in my fry bread cravings. 

This is a big open restaurant. Service is a bit slow but very kind and friendly. It's definitely a family run operation. 


Alongside their fry bead they also have an American Indian style flour tortilla type bread that they had as a special wrapped around hot dogs. Very unique. 

Green chile. Red chile stews with hominy. Delicious tacos made with the fry bread as a shell. One taco is a pretty substantial order. 

Dessert also features the frybread. You can have it simply dusted with powdered sugar or drizzles with honey and melted butter among many other creative combinations. 

Ahh the versatile and delicious Indian fry bread.
