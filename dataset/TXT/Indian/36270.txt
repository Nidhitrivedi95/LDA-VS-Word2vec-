NwLIEaqEz-9kcHkseLsfiQ After giving up on the wait at Guu ended up at this spot as right next to this busy Izakaya. 
Initial idea was to just get a snack to and then go some place else but the consistent flow of people made me try this spot.
I ordered a veggie samosa and Chicken Tikka Masala with a naan. 
The service was prompt and my food was served nice and warm within a few minutes (not surprising as they seem to cater to a lot of cabbies) 
The main course was greasy and was spiced OK. I was expecting a lot more spice at this spot. Meat was tender. Overall an average dish to fill up on.
The veggie samosa was nuked at my request. Had a OK filling not spiced well again (surprised me as their clientele is not western) at buck a piece can;t complain much. 
I didn't touch the salad. 
Total damage a tad over 10$ so quick way to fill up in wee hours of the morning. 
2.5 stars.
