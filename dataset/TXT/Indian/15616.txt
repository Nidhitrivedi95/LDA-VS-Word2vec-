cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w First time giving 5 stars to any restaurant. This place is amazing, they do such a good job of bringing together the different flavors of Indian Street food. The portion sizes are very large as well. We only got 2 appetizers, the chaat papri and aloo tikki, and it was definitely enough to feel two hungry people. Loved it so much that I can still taste it!! The service is also amazing and their decor is super nice. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to venture out to a new type of food.
