3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Wow! What an experience. 

Will be calling Toronto Public Health department about this. 

We went to the Groupon sponsored buffet on Oct 26th, and my son discovered a buffet of cockroaches on top of the dessert bar.  

Yes, cockroaches with newly hatched babies!  When confronted, the waiter did nothing. I called for the owner, and the manager - Ken Clark - showed up apologizing, and blaming a fumigation of the building next door as the reason for cockroaches.  

The fact is - the place is dirty as hell. He offered a free meal and a come back voucher...what the heck! Why would anyone come back to a place filled with cockroaches?  

Ban Kama from Toronto! DO NOT EAT Here!!!
