Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ Ordered delivery. Service was nice. Delivery was fast- about 45 mins. Food was hot and good.

Was not as good as my favourite Indian restaurant (which is not in TO.) My husband didn't love the butter chicken but I thought it was pretty good. He doesn't want to order it again and I'm happy to keep looking for better options for us and our preferences. Still thought it deserved 4 stars, but it won't be a regular place for us. Husband didn't think it was great.

If you've never been I'd still say it's worth a try! Lots of good reviews so it depends on your preferences. Hope to find an Indian delivery restaurant that we love!
