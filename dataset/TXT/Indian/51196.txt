The entire decor is nice and the ambiance is very pleasant. A complimentary papadam appetizer with an assortment of chutneys is provided, along with complimentary rice with the meal, and finally some  complimentary mango ice cream at the end of the meal. The tikka masala is one the best that I have ever had and the meal portions are perfectly sized! The staff was polite, attentive, helpful, and warm! Would recommend to anyone passing through or living in the area! I can not rave enough!
