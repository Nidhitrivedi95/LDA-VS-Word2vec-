B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Small little place that was very clean and modern. Ordered the lamb vindaloo extra spicy and it wasn't very spicy. Service was a little slow and they only gave us one serving of rice for two dishes. Had to ask for another, but it took a while to get the attention of our server. Food was good, but not spicy like requested and like it says on the menu.
