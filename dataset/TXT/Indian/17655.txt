dy2yHbFhA-wtF71tEQ_gGQ Eat here at lunch and you'll get a huge course of tasty salad with great light dressing, chick pea masala, rice and a Dahl soup along with your choice of meat dish for a totally reasonable price. The staff are extremely nice and helpful. They also take the Band Card which is good for us Rez folk. 

My fav is the Chicken Madras. Nice n spicey. 

Be nice to the staff. They're great.
