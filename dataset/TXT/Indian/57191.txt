XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw I ate here today and had a fantastic experience! The portions were plenty to share between two hungry people.  In fact I cannot imagine getting through more than half on my own... 

We got the chicken roti, medium spice.  While it was really hot temperature-wise, it was just enough heat spice-wise. The sauce itself was very good and I was happy that it wasn't overpowered by onions! 

For $10 I will definitely go back again...
