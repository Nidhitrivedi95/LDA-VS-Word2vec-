rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg This was my first introduction to the type of cuisine Thanjai specializes in, although we got a number of dishes. To be fair, some of the flavor profiles I wasn't really used to, even though I've eaten at my fair share of Indian/Pakistani restaurants over the years. We ordered a number of things to share: appetizer plate, Chicken 65, butter chicken, shrimp curry, vegetable korma, plain dosa, potato and ghee dosa, and some basmati rice for those sauces. Some of us liked the flavors more than others, but we all had some items we thought were really good. They specialize in dosa, so be sure to try at least one kind!

Please be aware that they advertise delivery, but they only do it Monday-Friday, so you're out of luck on the weekend (at least at the time of this review)!
