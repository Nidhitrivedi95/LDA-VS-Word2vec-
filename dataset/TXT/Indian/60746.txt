ZqmUmrXkwihgPFjMCYh_Mg We ordered Express lunch. It took so time but trust me it was worth a wait.  Express lunch menu was Biryani , Andhra Chicken, Chicken 65 and apricot for dessert and bread.  The food was cooked to perfection. I would really prefer this lunch rather than going to a buffet.  The quantity is optimal for lunch and taste yumm. Definitely going next time when k crave for yummy Indian food.
