K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw On 4th December I went to the restaurant to order biryani to take out.When I open parcel to serve at home I saw they had mix some rice in gravy and sold as biryani.
I don't recommend this restaurant at all as it show that they even don't know difference between gravy and biryani.its just waste of money
