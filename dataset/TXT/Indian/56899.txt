xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw What happens when you take bad Mexican food, and replace all the tortillas with delectable fry bread?  You get The Fry Bread House.

I stopped in FBH after a long time hearing about how great this place is.  After all, it is a James Beard award winner.  The menu left me immediately underwhelmed.  I went with the chorizo combo, which has sausage, beans, lettuce, and cheese inside of a folded piece of succulent fry bread.

The chorizo was OK.  All the other toppings were mediocre - the lettuce and cheese didn't exactly seem like the freshest lettuce and cheese I've tasted. 

The drink selection was weak.  They only offer fountain drinks, for which you have to pay $0.80 for a refill. (I don't care about paying an extra $0.80 for some cheap liquid, but it's awfully inconvenient!)  How about offering some Mexican Coke or something?

I believe I've already mentioned how delicious the fry bread is.  But it's fry bread.  I haven't had *disgusting* fry bread yet.  Food trucks and various off-the-food-inspector-radar sidewalk stands in the ghetto have awesome fry bread, too.

Go here for awesome fry bread.  Just don't try to make a meal out of it, or you may find yourself severely underwhelmed.
