jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Before coming to Pure Indian Cuisine, Indian food was not my first choice.  This food is amazing, this is my 3rd time here actually 2nd time this week.  I must say the service and the food is the best.  The waiter Mani is so helpful and nice.  It feels good to go to a restaurant that provides this level of service.
