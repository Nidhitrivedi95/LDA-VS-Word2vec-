6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w Yeah so for some reason we had a horrible experience here and spontaneously decided to try this place again because the patio looked poppin while driving by.

Ordered a bunch of stuff like beef curry, samosas, kebab, fake tandoori chicken , lamb racks, biriyani.

Nothing was authentic, im almost 100% sure they dont have a real tandoor oven, the chicken and kebab had no flavour.

The samosa was supposed to be chicken but it was mixed with so much potato you would never know.

I got a pretty strong stomach but i had to vomit after i came home, and this is the second time after eating here this happened.

They have really good service though if you wAnt to hang out on the patio and have a drink, and if you want to test your immune system try the food!
