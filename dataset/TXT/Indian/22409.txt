gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA I thought the food here was actually quite decent given its mall food court status. I got the butter chicken with rice and naan, and the flavors were quite good. The chicken was a tad bit stringy and dry, but the curry itself was flavorful and tasty. Both my dad and sister liked it. The naan was so fluffy and slathered in butter. 

I thought the service could have been better. The girl was a bit disinterested and sounded annoyed that I was asking her really basic questions about the menu ("What's in the thali?"). Also, if you want water, they will give you a cup and direct you to fill it in the water fountain around the corner. I would almost rather they just say no, no water. Filling it at the water fountain was weird, especially since the water didn't taste that great.
