Nothing really tasted like Indian food.  Menu items way overpriced.  This is in comparison to equivalent competition near by.  Even after informing them of this and trying something else, we were asked if we would pay the difference.  That's poor business sense!  No matter how convenient this was, we will travel further to eat elsewhere.
