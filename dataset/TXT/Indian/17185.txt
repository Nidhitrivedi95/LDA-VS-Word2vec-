DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I am so happy to have found this place and I will definitely be back...many times.  I spotted this place on my way to get my haircut and decided to drop in for Lunch.  My plan was to grab food to go, but once I took a look at the beautiful decor inside I decided to stay, and I'm glad that I did.  The service was excellent and the food was so flavourful that I almost lost my self respect and licked the plates.  I had the Vegetable Samosas appetizer and the Chicken Saag with plain rice and garlic naan.  The Chef/Owner was very sincere and welcoming.  I thanked him for the wonderful meal and wished him much success for the future.   If you are a fan of Indian food then you are in for a real treat here.
