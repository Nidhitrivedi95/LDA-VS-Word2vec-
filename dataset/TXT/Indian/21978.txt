GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw The bad. No samosas during the week, why? The lamb chops, which our server recommended, were crap. The tiny quarter sized piece of meat was oh-so-good but they were full of fat and bones, so it was about $12  for 5 bites of lamb and a plate of bones. 

The good. Nicely styled restaurant, bright colors and modern open layout. The appetizer we ordered was a veggie patty on a bed of spicy chickpeas. The lamb vindaloos was one of the best I've had. The garlic naan was perfect.  Complementary chai is available, I thought is was a bit week but good none the less.

PS: No belly dancers here on a Wed evening. Maybe they have them here on the weekends like they do in Scottsdale.
