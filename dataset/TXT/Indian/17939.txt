ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ Food is Ok. Food is fresh as well.

But these people have no idea about Hospitality. Ambiance is cheap. It is in a strip plaza opp a south Indian temple.

We go there for good family time. And they are bound to spoil it.

Their Brampton location is even worse. Terrible service over shadows any good quality food they might have. People are very arrogant and rude.

They are cheap though, and that is the only reason they are crowded.

Will not recommend it, Rather spend few extra bucks and get a quality time with your family.
