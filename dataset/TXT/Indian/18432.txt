Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ The food here is phenomenal!! We had the tandoori platter, Biryani, butter chicken and Naan. Everything was just amazing. This is a real hidden gem in Mimico. The ambience and service is also top notch. This place is a must try. The food wasn't oily at all and the quantity was great as well.
