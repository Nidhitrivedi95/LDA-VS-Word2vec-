CGYI4z9g-bHXHCFoZoZmTQ Ordered takeout at 9pm. Almost an hour before closing, was told it would take 15 to 20 min and my order wouldnt start until I come down and pay. I was fine and was there in 5 min. Waited for over an hour, dal was watered down, some naans missing some soggy kulchas and lacha parantha was packed(didnt know until I came back home). The guy there apologized for the delay and said will provide raita but was given plain curd. Still was ok until, I came home and disappointed over and over... never coming back!

Such a waste of money!
