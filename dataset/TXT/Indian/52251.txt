UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Told fiancé I been wanting Indian food for a while! We decided to head this way after the gym considering it was just down the street!

Service was great! At no time did they try to
rush us and was helpful & patient when we were deciding on what to order. Refilling our waters and even offering more basmati rice when we were out.

As far as food, we ordered Lamb Samosas to start with, a bit dry and needed some type of sauce but still good. Our entrees were Chicken Breast Tandoori for me and Lamb Korma for my date. We also ordered their infamous Garlic Naan! I love anything on a sizzling plate! The chicken was moist and tender! My dish was not spicy at all, which is a plus for me because I can't handle TOOO spicy! Paired perfectly with the basmati rice and I even made a little sandwich bite with the Naan, grilled onions, cut the chicken up and topped with yogurt sauce! DELISH! 

The Korma was a "7" and I guess it wasn't too spicy either but he likes spice so ¯\_(<U+30C4>)_/¯ , he said he might go "10" next time. They also have an inferno menu where you have to sign waivers! I wonder how serious that is! Lol

Overall a great experience! Wish we had room for dessert! Until next time...
