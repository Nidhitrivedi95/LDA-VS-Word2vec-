VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw We went on a Thursday night and we were the only customers.  I imagine there are more on the weekend, but still, this is a new place and I don't think many people know about it.  If you like Indian food, definitely give this place a try.  I've only been to a couple other Indian places, so I don't have too much to compare it to, but it was good food.  The people there were friendly.  You can tell them how spicy you want your food on a 1-10 scale.  You would especially like this place if you like Indian music videos, which are all from movies, cause that's all they show on the TV.  It really motivated me to make one of my own music videos similar to the ones we saw.  For me this place was just mediocre, and if the business doesn't pick up soon I can see it going out of business, so go try it before it's gone!
