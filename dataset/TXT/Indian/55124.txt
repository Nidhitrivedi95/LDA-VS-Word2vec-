Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Nice lunch buffet... tasty, not spicy... not super extensive, but enough to be full for sure.  It looks like a dive from the outside, but try it!  Complimentary Naan which was REALLY good.   It's VERY dark inside... no natural light which was sort of a bummer for lunch.  Great service- they are very serious, but tend to customers well.
