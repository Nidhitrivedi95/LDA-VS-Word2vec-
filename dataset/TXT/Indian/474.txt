-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g We love this place!  We had the Mushroom Mutter, the Paneer Butter Masala and the Mutter Paneer and enjoyed all three.  I always have rice pudding and their's is one of the best I've had.  The happy hour drinks are great and only $5.00, we get the lemon drops that are fantastic.
