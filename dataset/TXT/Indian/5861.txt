3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Very much disappointed with the quality of food. I ordered for kardhai paneer. They give us kardhai paneer in a simple bowl instead of kardhai and the taste was horrible. Also ordered for kulcha, but it looks like something else. I am very disappointed with the quality of food. HORRIBLE#
