gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Try the Lunch buffet special , I really like how I get to try many dif kinds of Indean food and feel out what I like out of all of it. The mango selassie is nice( mango yogurt drink )  , helps with the spice if you don't handle it well. Great place for lunch I'd say. Indian   cuisine done the right way
