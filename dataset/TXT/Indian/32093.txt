LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg I am glad we found this spot! 
It was recommended from an Indian friend of ours and he is just about the most pickiest man alive. So we called them up and placed a big ass feast phone order. Service was great and helpful even though I cannot pronounce many of the menu items correctly.

Lots of vegi options and everything was really flavorful. The pricing is totally reasonable too. I have been back twice in 3 weeks.

I would recommend this place for great take out, a date night, lunch and more.
