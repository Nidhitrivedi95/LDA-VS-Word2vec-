rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ Summerlicious 2016 ended with a bang.

memories of the Rogan Lam josh is still drilling holes in my memory. Honestly the best $28 I spent. i tried the halibut curry as well. Really Good. 

I am going to be back in order to try the steak vindaloo. I will give a more detailed review then.

However Pukka has amazing service- attentive waiters and food that is like no other. I eat a lot. This is an advanced take on Indian food which is already a pretty advanced method of cooking- with the various spices and stages it takes to make these dishes. 

Pukka makes it an effort to make food both an art and a science. Which results in the person who eats their food to go on a trip where they both get to discover and also appreciate the presentation.

Enjoyed it
