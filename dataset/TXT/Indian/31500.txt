KvRh-exPg_KegOM_HXeskw Mixing Indian food and ice cream is the best idea ever! Made in house mango ice cream was out of this world! I had paneer tikka and chicken curry, both of which were delicious. The staff was incredibly friendly, and even pulled out my chair for me to be seated when my food arrived. I will definitely be back!
