MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Probably one the best Samosa's in town. Hate the fact they are always busy but understandably so. The 5 samosa's for a dollar is a fantastic deal and their gulab jamuns are good as well. Id try their other stuff too but like to stick to their "Samosa only" lines and they move faster.
