tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Good food for a good price. The waiter was very nice and attentive. The curry chicken was our favorite. The tandoori chicken was also very good, and spicy. The basmati rice was seasoned lightly and complimented the different sauces. The Kheer was also a hit. The Mango Lasse is part of the buffet and is a great palette cleanser between dishes. We had a craving for chicken tikka masala, drove 30 minutes to eat here and ended up favoring the curry chicken here.  This place is very easy to find and worth checking out.
