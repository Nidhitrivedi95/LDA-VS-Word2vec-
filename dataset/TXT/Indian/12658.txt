B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg This was our first time visiting and it definitely won't be our last. Very nice dining area, modern and clean. Our waiter was very attentive and took good care of us. We appreciate the hospitality. 

Great selection of drinks and the food menu was extensive. Everything looked good, so it was hard to decide. We started with the lamb samosas. Really delicious. I think next time we'll get the traditional and lamb together. Ordered some cheese naan, which came along with our meals. The shrimp curry and lamb masala were absolutely amazing. The flavor of all the sauces were so complex and tasty. We decided on a "3" level for heat. The basmati rice was so light and perfect. 

Everything was perfect. I have no complaints what so ever. Thank you.
