Hz6pXloEBWboBaJuEpk0JQ Excellent consistent food. The only item I would note is not well made is the Navrattan Korma. I find it lacking in flavor, and seems to be made with canned green beans, you know, the kind your grandmother serves. The service IS slow and non-responsive, but we have come to terms with the fact that it will be a 90 minute meal. The food is well-worth the snail pace. It is expensive, but well worth it. 
Try to make the buffet for a much cheaper meal. Be sure and try the delicious Mango Lassi. They have perfected the balance of spices, which can be hard to find if you are a fan of Mango Lassi. 
I highly recommend giving Gaylord's a chance, maybe you will come to love them as well!
