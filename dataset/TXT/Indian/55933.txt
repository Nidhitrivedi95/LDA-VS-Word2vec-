xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Was there last Saturday and believe me it was wonderful delight. After long time we had so tasteful Indian food. Being Veggie we ordered all vegetarian dishes like Navratan, paneer tikka and they were tasty. Loved daal fry.
Please note this review is for Vegetarian options.
Experienced delayed service but good thing is person who takes order lets you know before hand how much time it will take, so no surprises.
