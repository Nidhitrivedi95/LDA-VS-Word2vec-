B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg The stellar reviews for this place have to be fake. DO NOT go to this place! Mediocre food, and worst of all, mean/petty owner.

I treated my in laws here to their first Indian food (I am Indian), and to their last dinner in Madison. We ordered a lot of food and were supposed to get 5 salads, but only got 4. Then we were just $5 short of the cash discount and the front girl was so mean/unhelpful; she sent us to walk to an atm so far away that we paid in cash after a failed 10 minute walk/run. We were embarrassed in front of my in laws and I was sad that the service was so bad for a place I've been to many times. No special treatment for a regular here!

Dining out at the end of the day is about people, and these folks don't make you feel welcome. It's all about the last penny, and worst of all, by mean/uncaring staff. I wouldn't have been upset if I had to pay the same amount but to a nice and apologetic staff member.

Also: Food is not good. Lots of creamy curry and very, very little meat.  Could not even order a plain lassi, suggesting everything is premade. Naan was okay but too oily. Soup was way too salty and lukewarm. And place is always almost empty (tonight was Saturday at 7-9pm, only one other family) with no music etc.

I was a regular and even considered making them my businesses' regular caterer but won't be back.
