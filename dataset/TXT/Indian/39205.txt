oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw There were no mad Greeks around, but definitely a mad Asian girl right here. 

The food was really just boring and not that great. I don't even have that many words to describe it other than to say it was "blah". 

To top it off, the place is incredibly expensive! My boyfriend and I came here one night for a snack and left with a 50 dollar bill! I ordered pita and hummus for goodness sake. If I had known this place was so expensive, I would have gone across the street to the smoothie place and gotten my late night fix there. 

Mad greek is definitely not one my list of places to revisit.
