2) when our order finally came out, she only
gave us one salad despite the fact that we ordered TWO SEPARATE combos. 
3) the salad was so disgusting and old. It looked reused (See photo)
4) i am a huge fan of butter chicken and have went to numerous restaurants and I have to say this was one of the worst places I've ever been to.
5) naan bread was so oily and burnt. And the lady making the naan bread with her bare hands walked out to get something from another store and didn't even wash her hands when she came back and started making more naan bread
