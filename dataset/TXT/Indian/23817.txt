gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I was practically raised on Indian food, and this is the best Ive ever had in a restaurant. I have went there during the buffet and for dinner ordering off the menu several times and you can't go wrong either way. The workers are all very nice and I get great service every time. This place never disappoints and is just as delicious as the last time I went there.
