axGUBM5mgmFZQn85bMTVPA I was here a month ago with some of my colleagues. Being a vegetarian, I went with the paneer tikka, which I should say was excellent. The dal makhani however left a lot to be desired and would probably give a single star. My other colleagues who ordered some chicken dishes, said that the fare was excellent.
The ambience was great, the soft lighting and the light music almost give a candle light type of effect. The service was generally good and prompt. 
I went here last week along with my family and I came back much disappointed. Am slowly beginning to realize that this might be a great place for non-veg fare and probably a three star fare for vegetarian options. Like one of the yelper pointed out, we missed this place when we drove by somewhat late in the night, it is easy to miss the entrance to this center.
