Z8oHDvZR-IfTry_9ke-0jQ Dosa! and Kulfi across from a park..

came back for some kulfi ( icecream like) to walk across the park with on a hot day. traditional flavors, my favorite is pistachio.. no cardamom today..

i havent yet tried their take out, (due to an unexpected run in with alibabas see my review), but this trendy , commute decor inspired indian dosa hut conveniently located beside chippys give an alternative to 7-11 and fish and chips.. a great addition to the south of trinity strip..
