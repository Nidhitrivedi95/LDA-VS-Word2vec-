tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Terrible Indian food. I'm Indian, so by my standards, this place is terrible.

First, the selection is very skewed. Only chicken? The owner's religious preference is pretty apparent here, and mine probably is too, but c'mon, can I get some beef? I'll be honest though, the chicken dishes that were there were pretty decent. naan is good, and they actually have some good dessert available for their buffet. the food isn't that bad. mango lassi is decent as well, but it wasn't cold, and that was a big turn off. 

if there is one dish that exemplifies indian food it is the tandoori chicken. this place failed with that dish. ok, you can bring it to me on a sizzling plate, that's cool and all, but it better be tasty. the tandoori wasn't spicy and it was VERY lemony. huge turn off. tandoori has a distinct flavor that can be ruined by too much lemon. i thought this was a one time thing, so i ordered another...

FAIL. owner who was taking our order said we couldn't order more than 1 round of chicken. hmm...i thought i came for the buffet? this was a HUGE fail. sorry, but if you aren't going to give me unlimited tandoori chicken, don't call this a buffet. "we usually don't do reorders on tandoori chicken for buffet, but i will let you this time". what kind of service is that?

the servers are kind and nice, naan is brought out fairly promptly.

all in all, this place has some huge flaws that give it the 1 star rating. first off, i've never been to an indian food place that didn't have all you can eat tandoori chicken. i just can't stress this enough, i was SO shocked when i heard this. then, the way the owner told me really turned me off. second, the mango lassi wasn't cold. if you're mango lassi isn't cold, its like getting a warm milk shake or a warm smoothie. third, the all chicken dishes really isn't very appealing. some beef qorma or something would be a great addition. there is much better stuff in phoenix, keep looking, stay away.
