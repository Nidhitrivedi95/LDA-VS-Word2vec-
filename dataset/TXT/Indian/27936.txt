IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA We used to come here years ago when Mike and his wife owned and operated it. We continued visiting this place even after they sold it but it was never the same. Service was not as warm and friendly and the food was not the same. We stopped eating here and chose to drive quite a bit farther because we really like Persian food. A while back my wife insisted we try it again to avoid the long drive. The service was just barely OK at best. They had a very young wait staff that lacked training on how to treat guests. The food lacked flavor and the chicken was dry. Halfway through the meal my wife agreed with me that it had not gotten any better and we would continue to drive to The Persian Room or Pars in Scottsdale as we know the food and service is always consistently good and the entrees are almost the same price as Tasty Kabob. It's too bad this place changed things. When we first started coming here there was always a wait for a table because it really was great food.
