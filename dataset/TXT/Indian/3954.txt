0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Well if you dont like crowds this place is for you. Rand H.and I went to this place at lunch hour and never seen one other customer the entire time we were there. As far as the food goes it was not bad the selection was limited.I am a fan of samosas and theirs were good other then that the food was average east indian .The decor is one star and needs work .Oh yes you can get a can of pepsi out of one of the buffet trays a first for myself.So if you like to eat alone kohinoor is the place.
