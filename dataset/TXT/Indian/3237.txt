0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I visited the place twice and ordered different types of dishes. The first time it was chat which was excellent and the next time was a horrible
Experience. I ordered mendu vada from the menu and what i get is stale vada from maybe afternoon and i had to talk to them and have it taken back and ordered gobi which was not great either. The veg noodles were not up to mark. Either the service and the quality reduced between my two visits or something else was wrong. I am not going back to this place.
