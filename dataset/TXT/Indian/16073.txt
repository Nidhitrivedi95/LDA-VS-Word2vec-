DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Ok the food is amazing but please update your hours!!! I've had trouble TWICE ordering food because the kitchen is closed from 2:30pm-5pm which is fine but if I call ahead on Saturday at 2 and ask if you are serving food and you tell me yes, only to get there at 2:15 to be informed I have to eat what's leftover on the buffet and you won't be bringing anything else out because your kitchen is closed! For $13 a person? No thank you. You couldn't have warned me about that over the phone? It's kind of an important detail. That being said the food is too amazing for me to even want to give them less stars, but sheesh people.
