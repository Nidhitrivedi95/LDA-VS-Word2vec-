This is the best Indian Buffet I have been to so far. 

Their selection varies every time and sometimes they don't have the exact combo of stuff on the buffet that I like, but regardless, i haven't been to another Indian buffet that has been able to match the quality of their offerings.

I'm sure one might be upset that I have given them 5 stars, but I am giving this rating for their weekend dinner buffet. You likely can go somewhere and get better individual dishes, but as far as buffets go, they currently win in my book.

I recommend their Garlic Naan, vegetable Pakora, Paneer Tikka Masala, and their Butter Chicken is the Bee's Knees! SOMF!
