gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Been here the past two Fridays and I'm a fan now.  My first time, I ordered the chicken tikka, which I found VERY flavorful and delicious!  It came with rice, pita bread and a small salad.  The cucumber dressing and chili sauce is very good as well.  Today, i wanted to try something different so I ordered the chili chicken.  This dish is gooooood!  If you like spicy, then you'll love this.  It was a bit spicier than I'm used to, but the pita bread helped with that. LOL!  It's a big portion too, so I had to ask for a to-go box for my leftovers. 

What I liked is that the chicken was not dry like I've had at other kabob or halal places.  It's very flavorful and juicy. 

If you plan on eating there, call ahead.  It can take about 15 minutes for your order.  There's not a lot of seating, either.
