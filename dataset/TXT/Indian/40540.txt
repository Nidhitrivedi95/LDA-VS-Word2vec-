PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ Best Indian food I've had in Montreal...(so far)...

This place is not at all in the running for decor or ambiance.  It's a big room, industrial type floor tiles, cafeteria style tables...but come here for the food!  Wow, it was great.  I went for lunch on a Saturday and there was no line up so I am not sure how busy it gets for dinner, but the food will not disappoint.
Service was fine, nothing great but what you would expect in the atmosphere.  Again, it's all about the food here!

I ordered the Vindaloo Chicken, but also tried butter chicken and a thali dish.  All good.
