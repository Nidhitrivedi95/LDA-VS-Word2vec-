UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw This is probably the worst service I have ever had. They forgot to place our order and we ended up waiting more than an hour. The staff was very rude to us claiming that the dish was coming until they realized that they never placed the order. Despite this, they were serving others who had just walked in before they attended to us. They never apologized for their mistake.
