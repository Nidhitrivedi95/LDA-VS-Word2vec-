UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg My first time here was on one of my last days living in this neighbourhood, and as far as Indian food goes, I must say that I was thoroughly impressed.  We had a fairly large table (8 or 9 people I believe) but the waiter was perfectly able to handle our orders and questions as if we were a table of 2.  The food came out quickly, and it tasted like they'd been preparing it for days.  Really an A+ on service and quality.

My one thing to point out is that one of my friends found a piece of tin foil in her dish.  Obviously this impressed no one, but when we showed the server, he was embarrassed (as opposed to annoyed) and offered to comp the meal for our friend.  It was very responsible of him, and the fact that none of the rest of our meals had anything wrong with them makes me thing that this sort of thing doesn't happen often.

They have a nice sized patio and a parking lot, the latter of which is a true rarity in this area.
