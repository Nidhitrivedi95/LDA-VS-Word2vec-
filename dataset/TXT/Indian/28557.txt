J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I liked this place a lot. It was busy and we went on a Wednesday night around 830, which was a good sign. The service was great, and the food came really quickly. I've tried a lot of Indian in Toronto and I'm comparison the food was ready faster the most Indian places. We ordered butter chicken, chicken tiki masala, mater paneer, lamb vindaloo, eggplant Bharta, naan and rice. The naan was really nice, chewy and crispy and fresh. The standout was the eggplant, best I've had in Toronto. The butter chicken was a bit too sweet and reminded me of canned tomato soup so it wasn't the best, the tikka masala was nice but the mater paneer was really good. The vindaloo had a good kick. Overall I enjoyed it and would return, it definitely satisfied our Indian food craving very nicely!!
