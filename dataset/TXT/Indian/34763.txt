Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Given that we were hella drunk and hella hungry, but the food was awesome.  We got 3-4 appetizers and each of them were good, dont remembr what we got though.  For dinner, we got Bhindi, totally awesome, Daal was great, Malai Kofta was good but a very small helping and we got some chicken.  The food was served in exactly 5-7 minutes after we ordered.  The good is it was before time, the bad is, it was all prepared in advance.  The rotis and the paranthas were very good.  We had Kheer and Gajar Ka Halwa.  I highly recommend this place on the strip.  Food was heavy so we walked to our condo at the Signature next to MGM.
