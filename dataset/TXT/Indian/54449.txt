W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg Oh, no -- I hate to downgrade these guys because the staff is so friendly, it's a clean place and they work hard and do so much the right way. However, there are other Indian places that sell my favorite dish for about the same price, but use tender chunks of white meat chicken. My vindaloo here had what I assume is dark meat, with what many of what I consider to be inedible pieces (tough, grisly, veiny, fatty). I'm not going to rule out returning here, but if the price of an entree is going to be comparable to the competition, I would suggest to match their quality as well. For the aforementioned reasons, I wish these guys the best and I will be back. I hope my suggestion helps.
