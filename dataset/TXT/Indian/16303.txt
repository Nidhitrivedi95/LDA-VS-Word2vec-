DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA Amazing place! I love that feeling of a "family owned" business off the strip and not a franchise. The owner, Richard , is amazing. He is very interactive with the customer and remembered my friend's order from last time he was there. That just shows you how amazingly attentive he is. 

We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Spinach, Shrimp Curry, and tons of their Garlic Naan. I also ordered their Mango Lassi for my drink and it was just amazing! I could not stop drinking it! 

If you like Indian food, this is a great great great place to try out. They also have a vegan menu too!!!!
