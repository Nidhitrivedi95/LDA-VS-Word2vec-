afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w Hoppers here are much better than Kottu, since they are a little "stingy" on the meat. So get the hoppers only!!:) they are well made, and I give them a 5/5. 

Overall, this place is a bit dated, but its Legit for good Sri Lankan food. 

They also have a nice selection of "short eats" as we natives call! haha! 

Definitely recommended if your new to Sri Lankan food, although if your in the Toronto area, there are places now even better than this ol'place! 

Nevertheless, be adventurous and try some Sri Lankan Food.
