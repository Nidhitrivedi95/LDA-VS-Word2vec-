2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw I love Samosa king for a variety of reasons.

#1 - 5 samosas for $1. This is the reason I originally discovered this place. While it's not the best samosa in toronto, it's a very good one in my opinion and the long long LONG lines on any given afternoon (especially Fridays) will prove it to you. 
#2 - daily specials. $1 for 3 rotis? WOW! Curry Fridays! Yum!
#3 - variety - SO........... MANY.......... THINGS........ TO........... CHOOSE.......... FROM.....!!!!!
desserts / curries / breads / samosas / sauces / hot dishes / and a lot of other things that I don't know what they're called but they all look good! And I must add, good quality too! 

and lastly #4 - awesome prices! The best place for cheap indian takeout!
