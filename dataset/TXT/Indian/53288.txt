VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Yes please.  Nice interior, casual yet elegant.  Well priced menu with many options!  Food is delicious!  Really wonderful naan (FYI bread).   Tandori chicken is great & available in all white meat.  Vindaloo chicken almost the best Cesars had ;)  make sure use the green chutney!!!  if Indian cuisine is new to you the staff was also r eally good with menu suggestions and serving size.
