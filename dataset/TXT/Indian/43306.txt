RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg We went to the $14 (11AM to 4PM) Lunch Buffet.  

We had been there twice before for dinner when it was Gaylord and both experiences were quite similar; nice ambiance, good, but overpriced food, lousy service.  So I was excited they were back (same owners, new name) and could do a major affordable chow down and not have to worry about the service because it was a buffet.  Really, what could possibly go wrong?

So there we are-nobody to seat us-so I poke my head into the dining area and someone comes and ushers us to a table in a near empty room.  I look around; WOW design fallout!  The Gaylord to India Bistro remodel is more of a demodel. What was once a rather upscale and attractively appointed space has been dehabbed with cheesy booths and a tacky over bright chandelier. Oh well, moving on...

The buffet consisted of: 

Dal Maharani,  Baingan Pakoras (eggplant), Aloo Baingan (think it was potato and eggplant), Palak Paneer,  Basmati Rice, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Curry, and some expired salad.

A little heavy on the chicken and eggplant, but I was still OK with that...until I discovered that every chicken dish was a contender for the food despair jackpot.  The one commonality they all shared was their Styrofoam taste and consistency.  It was the worst rice I have ever had and we debated if it was old or undercooked, settling on the notion that it was probably both.  Everything else pretty much sucked as well.  There are people starving in (fill in the blank) and they would probably choose hunger over that buffet.  


The only plus:

Our server kept us attentively stocked with the only palatable things we had:Garlic Naan & water.
