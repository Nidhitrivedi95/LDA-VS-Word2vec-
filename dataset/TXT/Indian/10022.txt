9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g I seriously never had Indian food this good except when I visited India! Although the place is simple it offers all what I love about Indian cuisine: their vegetable pakora are to die for, their garlic naan is delicious and their chicken tikka masala is cooked to perfection.
I love that this close is open 7-days a week, and their well packed lunch buffet is also available during the weekend.

This is my go to place when I don't know what to cook and I am craving Indian food. The flavors are off the chart.
