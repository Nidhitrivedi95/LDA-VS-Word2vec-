DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg My family and I have been to this restaurant 5 times since our first visit which was back in 2012. This year itself, we have been here 3 times. This shows that the service, and taste of food meets our expectations.

Being Indians, and vegetarians we enjoy the quality of food, and can easily spot if something is wrong in terms of taste, especially if a short cut method has been applied. 

Sure it gets busy inside, and there is a wait, but its always good to make a reservation on weekends. We normally order the paneer tikka skewers, a gravy dish such as Dhal Makhani and a dry vegetable dish such as Gobi or Bhaingan Bharta (spelling). The quality of food has been consistent throughout for the most part, except for the naan. Usually we ask that the naan have some butter applied to make it not dry, but even doing so, it still is semi dry. 

The staff are very friendly, and we have had no issues with the orders taking longer than usual. The food is always piping hot, and therefore there is no need to complain about the temperature of the food. The spice level is perfect. 

Definitely recommend this place to locals and to those who want to venture out a little bit.
