cVdBHFoDjJZX9JOh-1GWHw I don't think I will ever visit this restaurant again. We ordered the assorted platter and because we are vegetarians, we requested to replace the chicken with samosas. The samosas were way too oily and so were the pakoras. The samosas lacked flavour. We then ordered paneer (cottage cheese) chilli and paneer korma. Small portions and flavourless....the paneer chilly surprisingly had a few chickpeas in it which got me thinking about the common curry they probably used for Chana masala. The food was oily for sure. And we found hair in the food! We ordered a bread basket and the only thing that was good was the lachha paratha (flaky paratha) that was made from whole wheat and well cooked. Stay away from this restaurant!!
