ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ Not great ..... Service was not friendly or fast....waiters cologne was overwhelming and unpleasant samosas were salty and didn't have the curry flavor that I'm used to...,chicken saag didn't have enough sauce and under seasoned I tasted the heat but once again lacked that Indian curry flavor.....I'm really angry at the people who recommended this place.
