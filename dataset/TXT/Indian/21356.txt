GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I have been here twice and both the times my experience has been decent.
We tried their Mediterranean thali. Which is essentially called Mediterranean because they serve hummus with it. The chicken curries are decent. Not too bad but not great either.
Food-Their thalis are decent. I dislike the use of food color though. They certainly serve some of the better indian food in town.
Service- I believe they could really improve in terms of service. Sometimes the guy serving here comes off as straight off rude. Some of my friends have also faced similar situations with their staff.

Strictly food-wise it would be a 3.5/5 but service stands at 2/5 for me.
