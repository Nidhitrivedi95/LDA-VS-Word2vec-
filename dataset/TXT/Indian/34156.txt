md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA I came here with my wife and decided to get take out rather than eating inside. We had ordered before we came bus still had to wait for the food to get ready in the parking lot. The place was totally empty with the exception of a couple dinning at a booth. We ordered your typical order for two people. Now I don't know where they get the ingredients to make the food but this was the most I ever paid for Indian food. I was so shocked when I saw the bill I almost did not pay. WOW!! I mean come on that was really bad. Now I have no complainants about the food which was ok but was not worth the money we paid. I will not go back if these are the prices!!
