auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I visited last night with some friends and had some nice cold Indian Beer and really awesome Chili Chicken.  Please try it when you are there.... you will not be disappointed.  We also ordered other food and that was great too.  Nice Place, Reasonable Price, Good Quality Food,  Great Service & Very Clean Bathrooms.  Binoo, Elvis & the rest of the crew....you guys ROCK !!!
