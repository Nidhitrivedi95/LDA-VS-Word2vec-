DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I found out about Samosa Factory through a Groupon special. We arrive 45mins before closing time.  We ordered delicious spice fries, lamb, soup and chicken. All were well presented and tasty. By far the best Indian restaurants in Vegas. Our server gave us a full size rice to take home with our leftovers...very thoughful. You do not need to be on the Strip to get GREAT personal service.
