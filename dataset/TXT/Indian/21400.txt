GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA This Indian food is amazing. So authentic and tasty. I constantly crave Curry Corner. If you like Indian food this is definitely the place to go. Great for college students because it isn't too expensive, but it is a great and filling meal. Would recommend to anyone who lives in the area or is just visiting.
