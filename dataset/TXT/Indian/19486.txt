I ordered the Idli Sambar which is a blended lentil soup with lentil based patties. It was extremely delicious and comforting. They have non-Indian dishes as well, but everything is vegetarian and healthy. 

The best thing about Annapurna is the extremely hospitable service. Our server was so humble and hilarious. On a stressful, unhappy day I'm glad I stepped into Annapurna. 

I will return for more meals on a cloud.
