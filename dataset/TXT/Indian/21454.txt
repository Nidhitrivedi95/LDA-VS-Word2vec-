GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Been sitting here for 5 mins. No one came to us, I had to call the waiter to take our order. Within that a family of 3  just walked out after no one came to take their order. Terrible service. Very slow. The kitchen staff is so loud. They were screaming making us not concentrate on our conversation I was having with my family. The food was okay. Water was just nasty. Beware don't order there water! Last time we are coming here. 
Came here thinking Guy came here, wanted to give it a shot but no way.
