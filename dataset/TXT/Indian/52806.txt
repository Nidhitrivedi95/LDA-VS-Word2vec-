V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w I'm a newly acquired regular at this take-away Indian joint. It's delicious food with a rotating menu and ginormous portions for a meager 7 bucks. Add a veggie samosa for 75 cents, don't miss the bone-in chicken spinach dish they have on Tuesdays and grab a lunch card if you go often... after 9 visits your 10th is free!
