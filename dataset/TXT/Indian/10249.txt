9N7VAcNFqjHptX3vRWqgnw Ordered delivery for here
Everything was so good!
We got the dinner combo - pick 2 meats, 1 veggie, 2 samosas or pakoras, 1 naan, 1 rice
For the meat, we got the butter chicken and beef curry
Both were really good (loved the butter chicken!)
The samosas were good too
The naan was fresh and delicious and a great texture (I also added a second naan - garlic naan, which was awesome)
The delivery was also very quick and the food was hot and fresh
We'll definitely order from here again 
The combo is also a very good deal but I'd recommend to add another rice or naan
