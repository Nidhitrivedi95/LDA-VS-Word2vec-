9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w This place has been here for quite some time. I remember when I first came to this restaurant. They have upgraded and remodeled the inside. Their staff is friendly and courteous. The food is just amazing. From the first time until now when I visit, the taste of the food has not changed a bit. It is still just as tasty and fresh. I love the idea that it is HALAL and that just makes it so much more because then I can eat the chicken tikka which is mouth-watering. The bhel puri and sev puri are such tasty appetizers.

This is a must-try for anyone that has not yet been here. Love this place!
