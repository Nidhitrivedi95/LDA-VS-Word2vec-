jpYAApi_w1bR50EJ71LBHg I was in Brampton craving Kothu Roti (usually buy from Markham). I just happened to be in the area of this restaurant, and was definitely not disappointed. 

I ordered their Chicken Kothu Roti. AMAZING!
Was not oily, had all the right flavours I know Sri Lankan food to have, chicken was tender. Spicy, but anyone can handle this level of spice. I can't wait to return here.

Personally was impressed with the customer service. They were very friendly and accommodating. The lady that helped me asked if I had any dietary restrictions so that left a good impression in my mind. Appreciated the thoughtfulness (don't have any dietary restrictions), but at least you know that they've got you in mind.

VERY GOOD prices.
