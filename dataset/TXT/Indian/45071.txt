S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Decided to try this new place out, and find out we have been to one of their previous establishments a few years back.  Same great food.  This time it seems like the Sons are running the show, so you get some great customer service and conversation, not always what you say about Indian Dining.  

Had a bunch of stuff, took home some leftovers.  We had a goat dish (off menu) and some of the cauliflower (forgot the name of the vegetarian dish) and some tandoori chicken.  Chicken was very juicy, everything was great.  

Will absolutely go back.  We were the last one there and were not rushed.  We don't like keeping people so we made it quick :)  Very clean and modern.  If anything like their other place the lunch buffet will be fantastic.
