DPsbhgdHty--Jegj_yNaUQ We had the buffet lunch there today.  I love Indian food ... this was so-so.

There were 16 choices, which included rice, buttered chicken, curried beef, naan, curried goat, veggies, etc. plus salad items and dessert.

The buttered chicken wasn't bad ... the naan was cold and kind of crunchy.

The service was great ... they were always refilling our glasses and taking our plates away.

I doubt I'd go back again.
