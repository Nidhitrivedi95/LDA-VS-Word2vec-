pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Location not bad. 
Ambience great with nice decor. 
Price is reasonable. 
Food was nice, flavorful. Not really "fusion" however you can see attempts at that in some of the dishes. Butter chicken was a bit loose. Onion Bhaji, California Naan, and goat vindaloo were great choices. 

As you may have noticed in previous reviews there is issues with service. Our waiter was not very helpful and at times flat out rude.
