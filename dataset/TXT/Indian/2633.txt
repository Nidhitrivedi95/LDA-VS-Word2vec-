02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I have a love/ hate relationship with this restaurant where take away is concerned but the lunch buffet has taken me by surprise.

This review is for the Buffet Lunch which is priced at $13

Naan, Rice, Goat curry, Goat keema, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, fish tikka, Saag curry, mix vegetable, veg fritters, salad bar, kheer, gulab jamun, mango custard.
(that's all I can remember)

Buffet typically has these options.  
The taste and quality have been consistently good.
Fresh Naan bread is brought to the table.
The restaurant has great ambience.
Service is quick and attentive.

I definitely recommend the lunch buffet it's one of the best in the valley.
Only thing I would say is the dessert section could use some improvement.

Cheers!
