Anvs3S2S4rYbAzzUKIVg7w The people are friendly. The rotis are big fat and juicy. It's hard to eat a whole one but you'll do it because it's so delicious. The doubles are delicious and you'll find other Trinidad stuff like current rolls and delicious curry mango. I have also had the awesome eggplant choka. Love the food here.
