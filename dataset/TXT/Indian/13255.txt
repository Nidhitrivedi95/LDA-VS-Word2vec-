BA13Ogw1hQV8hx376j-B-w Was in the neighbourhood and daughter was looking for something not fast food. Had been to Longo's nearby and seen this sign a week ago. Decided to give it a try, but wanted something to take home. 

The inside is still not ready as of yet. The decor inside seems incomplete and does not seem to be a place where you can still eat in. When inquired found out that the restaurant had opened less than three weeks ago. Once complete would surely give it a try. 

Picked up a Veggie Manchurian and a Vegetarian Fried Rice. No waiters just the owner/manager busy with some big takeout order. The Manchurian comes with an order of steamed rice. 

The Manchurian was spot on. Perfectly spiced, good flavour. The pakoras was a bit soggy for us, but perhaps it was take out. The Fried Rice was amazing. The rice was long grain rice and not sticky rice kind. The rice not at all greasy which we like. The spices used was different and came out authentic Hakka taste; Indian Style. Not too spicy and perfect blend of rice and spices. The veggies couldn't have been a bit more. 

The plain rice was good. 

All in all, good food, averagely priced. But the taste was amazing. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes and perhaps do a sit in.
