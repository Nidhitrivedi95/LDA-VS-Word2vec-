TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Love this restaurant off the strip in Las Vegas. We've been going here a few years now and have never been disappointed. Naan is always perfectly cooked and served piping hot. Onion Bahji and vegetable pakora are very well prepared.  The chutney's should come in buckets as we could not get enough of these.  So yummy. Chicken tikka masala was spiced perfectly and the chicken was moist and tasty. We'll continue to make this a must stop every time we are in town and you should too.
