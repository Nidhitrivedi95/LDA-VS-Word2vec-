XAKZ6ADzAvK_IaFojW4wpA After reading all the great reviews I decided to give la Jawab a visit. I ordered Reshami kabob and seekh kabob off of their menu which came with rice and a small salad. I found the meat to be really bland and the dips did nothing to add to the flavor. Reshami kabob when made properly is supposed to be marinated for so long that when you eat it it melts in your mouth, this kabob was completely dry and tasteless, a total disappointment. The only highlight of my experience was the naan. 
If your looking for something similar to La Jawab in terms of kabobs and wraps try Bamyan Kabob, every single item on their menu is absolutely delicious, and none of these restaurants can even come close to competing.
