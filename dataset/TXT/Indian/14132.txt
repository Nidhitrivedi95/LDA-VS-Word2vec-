BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ I've been to this place a few times, and I'm not impressed. The food is overpriced, isn't that great, and the portions tend to be quite small for the meat dishes. For example the chicken korma is $15, and is about the size of an appetizer. I had the paneer makhani, which is a vegetarian dish, and the portion was more generous than the meat dishes. However, although the paneer itself was good, the sauce tasted sort of like canned tomato soup with some Indian spices.

The only good I can really say about Jaipur Grille is that the naan is tasty, and that the restaurant is physically very nice. The staff is also nice, although service can sometimes be slow.
