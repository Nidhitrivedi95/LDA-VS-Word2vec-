daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ Sorry to say. Really expected something nice looking at the menu. Unfortunately nothing tastes good. Chaat served was soggy. Dum biryani is definitely not authentic. Service could also be improved. Gulab jamun served cold. 
I just wish they could improve as they have a unique menu.
