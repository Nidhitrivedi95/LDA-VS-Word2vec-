AgnnYOtOmSr3W_vUmSIeaw We went here because our daughter had enjoyed Bay Leaf. We had no idea there were new owners. What nice people! The food was really good and when you ask for heat, you get heat! I ordered a mutton dish at a 3 of 5 spice level and it was darn spicy. Worked for me. Only knock is that food came out to my wife 5 minutes before mine. I'm sure they'll get that worked out, it was only their second day in operation. Oh, and the garlic Naan is just delicious.
