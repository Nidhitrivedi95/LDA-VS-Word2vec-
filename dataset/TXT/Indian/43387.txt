rLmUtrlEZO4BkyaAH_jQCQ Guru is right down the street from my flat for the summer, and I've passed it on many occasions without stopping in. My mistake! I adore Indian food and feel very lucky that this one is in my neighborhood. I ordered takeaway and it was ready to go so quickly. The portions are huge. I got the vegetarian platter for 2, and we have enough leftovers for another full dinner tomorrow. Their Benghan Bharta and Saag Paneer are very different than what I get in the San Francisco area, but I love both styles. The naan (I ordered plain and garlic) is amazing, but I wish I had read previous reviews that mention how large they are. The size is honestly impressive. I have never seen naan that big in my life, and the quality is great. The samosas are really delicious too. The highlight for me was the Guru chutney selection and the raita. I love chutneys and I love raita, and Guru does a fantastic job on both. I'll be ordering from here again.
