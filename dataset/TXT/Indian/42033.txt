qCTuGaciae73u7C57s2_0Q We live really close to this place, and it is definitely a jem.  This place is definitely one of the best spots for Indian food in the city.  Tikka masala, korma, butter chicken, vindaloo, and madrassi are all delicious. I am continually looking for places that have better Indian, every where else falls short.
