F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Been here a few times and its a pure gem. The food and service is very consistent. We order the hot and sour soup and its so flavourful with a perfect spiciness to it. Followed by the chilli chicken, crispy beef, and the Hakka fried rice. The chilli chicken is amazing, Nice and spicy. The crispy beef is delicious with a bit of sweetness to it. They do a great job cooking the food, and great service too. This is a frequent hangout for me. Highly recommend the chilli chicken.
