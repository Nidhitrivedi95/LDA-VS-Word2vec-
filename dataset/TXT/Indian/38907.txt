OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g The food was delicious!! The buffet is definitely the way to go to try a little bit of everything. The food was fresh and just the right amount of spice. The best thing about this place was the service. I will be back just because of the service! The manager helped us narrow down what we wanted to order and he checked up on us a few times. This place was really busy and now I know why....perfection!
