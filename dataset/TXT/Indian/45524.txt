ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Very disappointing. Lovely space and nice staff but I didn't enjoy the food at the lunch buffet. It was mostly bland and all tended to taste similar. I didn't think it had enough of the distinctive spices that I've enjoyed at other indian restaurants in other parts of the country.
