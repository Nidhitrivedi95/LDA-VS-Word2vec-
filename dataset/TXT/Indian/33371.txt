lO-IY5X36bLI8vnQR4O18A I would rather eat fast food before enduring through this experience again. I ordered a masala dosa and what came was a soggy crust with watery masala and a poor attempt with serving store bought chatni. As soon as you enter the place on the left is a pile of trash with happy flies scavenging while the area smells like spices. Between all of that they are trying to sell pastries so even though the cake was edible the environment takes all the joy out for me. Only redeeming factor may be perhaps that they do not overcharge on most items on menu.  I doubt even kitchen nightmares would be able to help. No thanks, moving right along.
