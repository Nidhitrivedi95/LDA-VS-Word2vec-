TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We've been looking for a good Indian restaurant in Vegas since we moved from NYC and read about India Palace so decided to check it out for dinner.  It was pretty quiet on a Sunday night.  There were only a few other patrons, which is a shame because our experience at India Palace was great.  As other Yelpers mention, they are located near the Strip but on the border of a crappy neighborhood.  I wonder if they were in a better location if they would have more diners, but I digress.
They served papadum and 3 different dipping sauces when we sat down, which was very nice.
We started with the kheema samosas for an appetizer.  The shell was nice and crispy and not greasy at all.  They were filled with delicious ground lamb and green peas.  I thought it was wonderful with the date sauce (the dark brown one) on it.
We ordered the chicken korma and chicken tikka masala for entrees.  Both were very good.  The chicken was very tender.  The entrees didn't come with rice, as has been our experience at most Indian restaurants, so we had ordered a side of peas pulao rice and garlic naan.  I loved the rice with peas and nuts in it.  The garlic naan was also very good and not greasy at all.
Service was attentive and all the staff very friendly.  The restaurant was neat and clean.  There were TVs playing Bollywood which was fun.  They weren't on too loud and I always find it hard to not watch!  Our waiter provided us with containers to pack our leftovers.  If we weren't so full, I would have liked to try their dessert menu.
Our dinner came out to about $60, including tax and tip.  Indian food is always a little pricey, so I thought it was good value for what we got.
We enjoyed our experience here and will definitely be back to try other menu items, the dosas in particular.
They honored the free mango lassi for checking in, which was delicious with my meal. Thanks Yelp!
