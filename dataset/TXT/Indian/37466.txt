OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Centrally located and a very decent place for dinner. Please note that entry is closed by 2130 hours so plan accordingly. Would suggest that one should go with good 1 - 1.5 hours in hand to enjoy the full course meal. We had ordered one vegetarian and one chicken Thali. Thali offers a combination of different dishes. It takes some time for it to be served but trust me its worth the wait.  Loved the taste of each vegetable and chicken dish as it was authentically Indian style cooked food in true sense. Owner of this place is very courteous and customer friendly. He personally talks to each customer to check feedback about the food. Highly recommended. Bon appetite
