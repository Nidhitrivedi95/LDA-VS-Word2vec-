Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg This is not your typical Indian restaurant. Gone are the red velvet chairs, the bright lights, and the tacky decorations all over the walls that so many of us have come to expect. Atma is the trendiest Indian restaurant I have ever been to. I love the decor. The service is proper. And the food has always been divine.

They have a fantastic upper section that can easily accommodate large groups.

Atma is an experience. Go!
