muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw Total ripoff. Ordered nihari beef and got a bowl of broth with three tiny pieces of meat in it. When I asked where is the meat I was told that is all you get and that is what everyone does. I have had nihari at many places but never with so little meat in it. Worst food deal I ever had.
