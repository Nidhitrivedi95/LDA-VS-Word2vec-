-qdbWrCU8Ktg80dk458BAw Chat Hut is located just North of the International Centre, along a strip of Airport Rd. which has quite a few 2-storey buildings with primarily Indian take-out restaurants all along side of the street.

(Honestly, I don't know how all these places stay afloat because they seem to offer similar food items and they're right next to each other.)

Anyway, stopped by this place based on Yelp reviews.  Otherwise, Chat Hut could be interchangeable with one of the other units offering Indian fast food.

Out of all the things that I tried, my favourite was the Pav Bhaji.  Pav/Pao (bread) tasted like a straight up, toasted hamburger bun with garlic butter spread on top.  Although I liked the mix of spices in the Bhaji, my Indian friend said that it didn't taste authentic.

Chat Papri ($4.99) was alright, but not the best that I've tasted.

Food was served on plastic, disposable dishes and styro cups.  Hallway leading to washroom was jammed with boxes of supplies which leads me to believe the restaurant wasn't the cleanest.
