yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I have been here a few times and have never had a bad experience, whether there were 3 of us or 16.

The food is amazing. The vindaloo will make you cry. The korma is like velvet. The naan is crispy on the outside, pillowy on the inside and melts in your mouth. 

But what really makes this place special is the service. The servers treat you like family, and are happy to make recommendations. They are always happy and bend over backwards to make sure your experience is a good one.
