A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA After you read this review you might wonder why I ate here. 

My wife moved her napkin with silverware wrapped inside and an earwig ran from under the napkin across the table.  Yuck!

Her knife was dirty ugg!

Restaurant was dirty

Food was a 4-5 but wife said she would not go back
