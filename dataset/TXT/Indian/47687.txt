TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw 4 star ratings for such awful food is what makes me doubt yelp ratings. Leaving the dated and dirty atmosphere aside, I had the worst masala dosa ever at this place. The sambar was bad, masala had no taste and the chutneys were horrible. I walked a mile from the Wynn going by its 4 star rating but highly disappointed. I've tried Tamba a few times I've been to vegas before. Go there instead for a much better ambience and food for probably the same price.
