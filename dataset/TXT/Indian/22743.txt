GRIRHR35knxFo0qySwIysw Best Indian Food on the Plateau. Very Affordable, too!

Try the Dosas or the Thali. Both are a great value, and as tasty as Indian good gets.

The Plateau is challenged for Indian food. There are some really decent places if you want to sit down for a family or date meal, but very little that's quick and affordable. Curry Mahal is both of these things.

Whether you're veggie or omnivore, they have plenty of great option. If you haven't had a Dosa (hard to find in Montreal), I'd urge you to try these first. However, if you're looking for something that you're more familiar with, give the thalis a try. And, of course, if you want to go a-la-carte, you can't go wrong.
