v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug One of the worst Indian restaurants I have been to. And as an Indian traveling so much, I have had a lot of tastings in a lot of towns.

I gave it two chances. First time, I ordered North Indian food. One out of three entrees was decent, one bad and one horrible. In one spice level way too high and the other two completely bland (NO it was not indicated as such on the menu). Vegetables tasted stale and daal seemed as if from yesterday or even day before. It was just bad.

Next time, I ordered South Indian dish. The sambhar and coconut chatni were stale and absolutely horrible tasting.

Will never go to this place again...
