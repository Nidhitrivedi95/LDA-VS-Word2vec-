X9sDrd6Uia0uQFFKwwQcJg WOW, just had some great Indian food. I had the dinner plate, which was an amazing three course meal, which included mughlai soup, followed up by chicken tikka masala, chicken makhni and basmati rice. The flavors were amazing and all of the ingredients tasted very fresh. For desert we had kheer,a type of rice pudding which acted as a great balance after the spice. Overall a great find, I can't wait to eat there again....
