WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA i came here because i saw bourdain eat here on his short layover series. i gotta admit the curry was not bad. i had the goat with eggplant and my girl had the chicken. the roti is wrapped around it like a burrito. its a huge thing to eat. for the price its on the expensive side. but my main complaint is that the roti wasnt flaky enough. having lived in malaysia for a short period ive had some really great indian roti. this was just ok for a store with the word roti in it. if youre around the area give it a try but not worth it just to come here if its out of the way
