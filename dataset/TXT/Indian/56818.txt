I have never been to a restaurant that wouldn't fix a wrong order. This establishment charged me 7.25 for a tortilla with melted cheddar cheese on it. Then asked for an additional 1.60 for sour cream. This product was not what I ordered yet the supervisor refused to refund or replace it with the correct item. I love getting fry breads at the fair and thought this place would be awesome. I will not be back.
