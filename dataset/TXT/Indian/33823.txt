LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng Great food, we enjoyed the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Bhuna Gosht, and the Pistachio Chicken. Really nice restaurant with nice decorations and good location in downtown Champaign.
The reasons why I am only giving it 3 stars? TERRIBLE service. Host and waiter were not nice not accommodating. They even kicked us out at 3:00 because they were done with the lunch shift.
