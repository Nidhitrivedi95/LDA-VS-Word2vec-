nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ I went here for a small lunch function this summer.  They had a set menu for us.  I had a watermelon soup which was very refreshing considering the hot day and how hot this place gets.  I also had a fresh roll which was tasty.  The main course was a bone-in grilled pork chop.  This thing was a big cut.  I was surprised by this lunch portion and I'm a big eater.  The plate came beautifully (artistically) decorated with fresh vegetables.  A lot of people in our group took pictures of their meal.  The price was very reasonable for what we got.

The restaurant itself is really small, with the open kitchen alongside the tables.  This makes the place very warm/hot in the summer.  It's probably very comfortable in the winter.

The wait staff was very friendly.  I suggest trying this place.
