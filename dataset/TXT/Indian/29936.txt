jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Brief Overview:
This is a simple Mediterranean and Indian restaurant that provides a good variety of menu options at a reasonable price.

Pros:
- I like the simple yet stylish decor of the interior
-The owner and staff are very friendly
- The food has good flavor and I love their vegan and vegetarian options
- They have a nice private room for hosting parties and entertaining guests

Cons:
- They use styrofoam and plastic utensils for their food. I know this is cheaper for them (and maybe for customers), but I would like ceramic bowls and silverwear to be used from an environmental impact and home feel standpoint.

Final Verdict:
Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice environment and good Indian and Mediterranean food. I've been here countless times for the classes that I teach and recommend them if you are on the fence.
