JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ My Wife and I were recently guided to this place by searching for and reading reviews for good indian places in CLT on yelp.  Neither of us are vegetarian, but it doesn't even matter at this place.  The food is fantastic, and is very hearty.  You don't even realize that what you are consuming lacks some form of animal protein!!

Each time I've visted the restaurant, I've tried a different dish....and I haven't had one thing that I didn't like.  If you like spicy cuisine, I highly recommend the Baigon Bartha or the Veg Vindaloo (listed in the Curry section of the menu.)  I also suggest getting a couple orders of the Garlic naan to go along with your meal.  

All in all, great Indian food, good prices, and friendly staff.
