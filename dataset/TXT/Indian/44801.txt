S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Truly disappointing lunch buffet. I've been to Gandhi a few times and its been pretty good. This is the first time I tried the lunch buffet and, the fact that I felt compelled to leave a review, should be an indicator of how I felt my meal went. First of all, no one at the front when I came in, i came in and looked at the buffet line and then waited for roughly 2-3 minutes to even see an employee, they finally sat me and I got my first round of food. The tandoori chicken was nearly cold and hard as a rock, the side that was on the chafing dish was charred to a crisp (not always a bad thing). I informed the young waiter that the tandoori chicken was cold, he went and took the temperature of the chicken, said something to his, what looked to be his boss, then closed the lid. Clearly it was under temperature and he tried to reheat it in this way... huge health hazard that could get them closed in of itself. No biryani, only 3 meat dishes and all were chicken, no naan or rice on the buffet line so it had to be brought out which seemed to be difficult to even find someone to help. My drink remained empty for the majority of my meal even though a waiter kept walking by. I finally asked for a refill and it took him about 8 minutes to bring me my refill. Sweet rice for dessert? what the hell is that? Literally their basmati rice that they serve to everyone, mixed with milk and sugar. It was disgusting and the rice was under cooked. I'm Indian... I have never heard of this recipe before.... for 11.95... its a rip off. Enjoy GOOD indian food and drive a block up to Delhi Indian Cuisine.
