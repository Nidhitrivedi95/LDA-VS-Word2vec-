U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg First time takeaway from here,  good menu but quite limited. Flavour for roti was very nice... didn't taste like ingredients were dropped in the pan and flashed quick like alot of places. Be wary though, medium spice is still pretty hot by North American standards. Would definitely go back!
