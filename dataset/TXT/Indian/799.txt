-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I originally came here years ago for black salt. It's the cheapest best value. The place on Maryland although nice, just wasn't the quality I was looking for. I also got tired of paying $8 for two ounces for the stuff on Amazon. 

Since my black salt findings I have also bought lots of:
Chickpea flour. Yes it's not organic, but it's really good quality. Great for those gluten free fans. I personally just like it better and love the way it binds and coats. 

Turmeric. You can get it in a huge container here. In smoothies, scrambles, entrees, we each eat at least 1/4tsp a day. We use it everyday so it can add up quick. Did you know you can use is as a tooth whitener?!?! Nope I haven't tried it yet. 

Incense. I buy my incense here. Great quality and good selection. I don't burn it hardly ever, but I like to have a vase of it sitting around and smelling yummy.  

Music. I love the music and they play it kinda loud and I like that. Great energy.

Produce. Meh I'm not a fan! Most visits it doesn't look fresh to me. Maybe I'm just used to the obnoxious carefully plucked perfect overpriced organics at Whole Foods. I should give them another glance...

Tapioca starch, potato starch, and allllll the spices are here.

Snacks. The random crunchy snacks isle is always tempting but I love roasting my own chickpeas and crunchies so I try to stay away from that isle.

The Cafe. My veg friends say you can get really good lunches and veggie pocket yummies....oh and free chai tea. I haven't tried these in house made items yet. I will defiantly update this when I do.

Oh and the customer service is great. Very nice and helpful. Always answering my odd questions that I have with a smile :)
