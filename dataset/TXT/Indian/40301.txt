plXrGjtnDxYjHdpZ3wNMZQ Great food and great environment! However, the location is a little inconvenient. It is located in a little pit that is slightly dirty and underground from the main roads. 

The customer service is not the best but they are very efficient and seemingly fairly busy most of the time. 

I'm rating 5 stars because the food is the best Indian food that I could find in durham / the GTA.
