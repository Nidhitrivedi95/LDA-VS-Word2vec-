I came here on my first night in Edinburgh in search of vegetarian fare - two other veggie places right down the street didn't pan out for various reasons, and Indian food is always a safe bet. I had an excellent Kafta Makahi dish, and when ordered with the spice level "as you would have it, please - I like spicy foods" - I was not dissatisfied. It was perfectly spicy without being overwhelming, and the flavor was excellent all around. Service was quick and pleasant, and the cook checked to see how everything was.

Price paid for a main dish, drink (Irn-Bru), and garlic nann was 13,00£

If you're looking for great Indian food at a reasonable price, and/or a wide selection of vegetarian options (including veggie haggis fritters.. what!) then give Suruchi a shot.
