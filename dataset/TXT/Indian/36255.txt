NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ A friend and I grabbed dinner here on a beautiful night in Edinburgh. 
We ordered a chicken appetizer which we thought was slightly bland, so we asked them to turn up the heat on our entrees. And they definitely turned it up!
The Chicken Biryani and Madras Chicken were delicious and we had enough for leftovers as well. 
They are not exactly cheap, but hey, we got two meals out of it, so I guess it's okay.
