eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg I have eaten here many times but I wasn't so impressed when I ate there for lunch the other day.  I guess the thing to remember about this place is to get there early.  If you don't, you will be waiting for food and nan.  My wife and I got there at 12:30 and every container was at the bottom or empty.  Asked the lady what was up and she said that everyone came in at once. Uhm, yeah, it is called a lunch rush.  Really pissed me off that she said that.  Waited for food and waited even longer for the nan.  Even though the service was really lacking this day, I will be back because the food is good.
