h2cPIifmtPD029q4sthRSQ Great spot! I came here with a friend yesterday and sat on the patio..

We ordered the mango beers and a papri chat appetizer to start. We absolutely loved the yogurt, tamarind sauce and the chip-like wafers it had!

We also ordered the chicken madras curry and loved the sauce. Perfect for dipping with the roti. Delicious! The waiter was knowledgable and the owner made us feel welcome. 

We'll be back!
