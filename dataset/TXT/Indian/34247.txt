MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ For a place that sells butter chicken for $16 and describes it in their menu as "Taste the ORIGINAL - Feel the Difference," I was expecting the dish to be authentic and amazing. It fell completely flat and was not authentic at all-- it simply tasted like tomato sauce with no hint of spices.

Saag paneer was decent, but nothing to write home about.

I love my naan thin and crispy on the outside but the naan that came to my table was too thick and bready. It tasted like something I could get at the grocery store.

Waiters were friendly but service was slow. This was one of the most disappointing (and expensive) Indian places I've been to in Toronto.
