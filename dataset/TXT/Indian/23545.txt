gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I'm a indian food lover and had a indian craving while on mini vacay in Vegas. Stumbled upon this place on yelp and due to the great reviews I decided to give this place a shot. We were greeted and sat immediately. The food on the buffet looked pretty good so we went with that. Oh boy, what a good life decision that was! Just about everything I put on my plate was above average in flavor. Usually at an indian buffet there are at least 2 items that get left on my plate...Not here, the only thing I didn't care for was the potato samosas, and that's strictly due to the too thick, not crispy pastry surrounding the well spiced potato filling. The butter chicken was good,made with a mix of white and dark meat,and had a nice deep flavor throughout the chicken and sauce.  The paneer palak was wonderful and flavorful with a kick of chilies, My partner in crime enjoyed the veggie Korma greatly, as did I, it was creamy, with well rounded flavors and tasted very unique compared to other veggie kormas I've had. Heck it put mine to shame! They didn't shy away from spice or heat as some indian places do to adapt to American palates and I dig them for it. Service was a bit slow, plates weren't cleared as fast as I would've liked them to be, and my water glass was parched a few times but I'll cut them some slack for being a bit short staffed the day we went. Overall it was great!
