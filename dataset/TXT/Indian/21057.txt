GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I will start by saying we drove almost an hour to go there. We saw a rerun episode of Diners, drive-ins and Dives and they were talking about the fabulous food at Curry Corner! 
I cannot say how disappointed we are about the experience. The food was awful! 
The plates are served institution style, aluminum plates with dividers. I am assuming for portion control. 
We ordered two plates; The tikka masala was watered down and the riata looked like skim milk. It came with a small piece old lettuce and tomato, by far this is the worst Indian food I have ever had.
The other plate was goat curry, it was a little better, at least it was not watered down, but it was hard and chewy. 
Do not get fooled by the Food Network Hype, I am sure they prepared days in advance for the visit. This is not the case for the regular customers. The place was packed with mostly Anglo clients, I am sure they were there for same reason we went. 
The service was not great either, too busy for 1 server.
Very disappointed!
