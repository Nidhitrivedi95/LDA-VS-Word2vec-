a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g Motimahal rocks, went in for a mid afternoon snack, ordered a spicy green chili pakora and a vegetable samosa. Items are made fresh while you wait; let me tell you straight up worth every second of the 8 minute wait.
Chili pakora was spicy hot and excellent; the Samosa had a light flakey fried exterior dough with a nicely spiced potato/pea stuffing, this was without question some of the very best pakoras/samosas I've had. I wouldn't hesitate to return in the future as this place is just plain awesome!
