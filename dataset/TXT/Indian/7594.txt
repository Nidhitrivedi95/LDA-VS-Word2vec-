5yaEPRR_BZALSqJPVMzL0w I have been ordering food from Zeerah ever since they opened. Best naans in Mississauga, hands down. Their mutton biryani (which they only make on Saturdays, and run out way before closing time) is to die for. My family loves their Haleem, Nihari, Chicken Biryani and Chicken Bun kebab. Their Brain Masala is also delicious. Excellent , authentic, reasonably priced, home cooked food.
