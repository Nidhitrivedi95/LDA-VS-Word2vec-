lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw Veggie platter is very decent size. Gunpowder fries is very dry. But the ketchup is delicious because there is mixed spices within the ketchup.

Masala shrimp appetizer is extremely salty for some strange reason. There is so much salt that I'm confused on what other flavours that I was suppose to be tasting. 

The interior decor is great. Very eccentric and hip. The service was very quick for a Thursday afternoon at 5pm. 

The menu is designed as newspaper. It's a bit hard to understand due to the mixed font sizes and I just don't know where to focus my eyes. But very cool to look at.
