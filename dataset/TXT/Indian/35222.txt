MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg The food is  not good it is delicous. This really is a great Punjabi resturant. Just a fair warning there are no chairs inside, so you will end up eating in your car or at home. But that does not stop the BILLIONS of people that go there. The food is amazing. Be careful coming in around Indian lunch time (1-2 pm) since it is packed, we have gone to canada twice and both times we end up taking pounds mithai.  This resturant is the place to go!!!
