tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA First time in: Saturday lunch time. Good impression, the place was packed. We took the Buffet. Usual variety of dishes. Everything was perfectly cooked, very flavorful and piping hot. Only negative remark, the lady tried to take my dish away, while I was still eating... However there were six people waiting for a table as we were waiting... We will be back and we will eat À La Carte the next time.
