The food is pricey.  The ambience is pleasant. 

I ordered the Malai Kofta. The spice is a bit bland. The dumplings were pretty tasty, even if the sp car is bland. 

Another person in my party Tandori Sampler. It was also bland and expensive 

The third person ordered the Makhana. This person likes bland food much more than the rest of the party and raved about it. 

We had garlic naan and paneer naan and a veggie Samosa. The best part of the dinner was the naan. But I prefer Indian restaurants that keep the naan coming with meals. 

It isn't bad to eat here considering you are in PV, and there really isn't much culture there. No shortage of upper middle class white people lining up to eat here.
