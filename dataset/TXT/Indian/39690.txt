P4zWgzYzy03D9LeDTpKuDg Being an avid lover of dosa I had to try this place. Friends in Mississauga raved about this place. Being a frequent customer of various South Indian restaurants around the city, my palate is very familiar with this cuisine, so Guru Lukshmi had better measure up. In my opinion some of the best South Indian food still resides in Scarboro..but let's give sauga a chance :p

My first impression of this place was that it wasn't really much to look at, but who came here for looks? Surely I didn't. I mean you could tell they did try to give it that sophisticated look, but with the table arrangement, it doesn't work.

First and foremost, this place is small!  I mean really small. So don't invite a big gang or show up with a party of 10. The place was busy, we got seated quite promptly. Maybe its just me, but I found the seating not comfortable at all. It was like I was kinda leaning forward! The service was excellent, organized mayhem is what I would call it. When it looks like everyone is confused and doesn't know what is going on, the place still hums along..and they get your orders right.

All that aside, the food is what brought me here and I was not disappointed. I absolutely loved the vada sambar, in fact to this day I still think about that. It was very authentic. Since this place has so many different dosas to choose from, the owner recommended we try a bit of each! So we ordered about 4 dosas, and they cut it up for us so that we could have one piece of each dosa! That was simple but it went a long way in me giving a thumbs up to this place! 

This place is the real deal, the best in Mississauga. The owner did mention that they are opening a new location, so if I were you, wait. Once the new location is open, then check this place out, I'm sure the overall experience will be better.
