TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I am an indian, so I can tell you exactly how the food is.
So at first, the service was friendly and good.
The food was not good, the taste was not authentic. I ordered f.e. Paneer Tikka and the Paneer Tikka Masala. The Tikka was tasting like Chinese food and the other was to sweet. 
Everything else was also not authentic and not good tastin

I give two stars because it was clean and a good service. My opinion is not to recommend that restaurant.
