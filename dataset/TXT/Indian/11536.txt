ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Not even worth a star but because yelp requires atleast one hence giving it. My family and I went for dinner on Boxing Day and the food was PATHETIC. My entire family fell sick. Each and everyone vomited the whole night with stomach flu for 3 days until we felt better.

Even if you are starving and these guys give you free food please AVOID!!
