gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We found this place after our previous favorite Indian go to place shut down, and I have no regrets, it is amazing.
I've been here for the lunch buffet with my husband, dad, and one of my sons(other was at school), a couple of times, and even when the 2 year old got a little louder they were very great to us and have been kind and familiar in a good way.
The food is all amazing, and usually not too spicy but not plain either, it's all great, and in general not too loud, or overly bright or dark.
