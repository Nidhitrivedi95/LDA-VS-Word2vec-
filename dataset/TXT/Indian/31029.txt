kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w Solid Indian fare. I was high from all the butter fat I consumed at dinner for, oh, three hours. These guys use a LOT of ghee in their preparations.

Samosas - really, really good. Extremely flavorful. Even the dough is spiced.

Bajii/Pakora - good, a little bland. 

Naan - also stellar. Perfectly prepared, garlic and plain alike.

Thali - overpriced. This is a smaller thali than I'm used to, as it includes only three dishes, no lemon pickle, no daal. Rice is pretty bland (where's ma cardamom!). Vegetable Masala was the stand out here, although if I ate an entire entree of it, I think my heart would explode (WHOA butter). $18.

Mushroom Mutter - solid, nothing exciting. $12. Despite the flavors in this dish being subtle to the point of bland, it was neon orange. Hmm.

There's a short Indo-Chinese menu here that I'd like to sample from - maybe next time.

Would I come back for the much-more-reasonably priced lunch buffet? Possibly. Will I continue to drive way out to Woodlands when I'm craving Indian? Most definitely.
