YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw I have been to this restaurant  twice after reading the reviews but all of them
Are total lies  .. Once for lunch buffet and once for dinner .. Neither of them satisfied me . Buffet has very limited items and is just avg.. Dinner is the worst one I have in USA. I ordered a chicken 555 and a chicken boneless byani..  Chicken 555, I did not even touch a second piece after tasting. First one .. And have no words to say about byani..
