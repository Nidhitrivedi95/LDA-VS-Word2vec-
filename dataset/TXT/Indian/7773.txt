6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A I've dined at numerous Indian restaurants and this has been a delight.  From Dallas to Reno to Salt Lake City to Sacramento to Portland to Orlando and now Cleveland... This is number two on my list.  Definitely number one in the Cleveland area.

The weekend buffet @11.99 is worth the price (Visited on Saturday).  All the food was fresh and there were tons of options for both vegetarians and carnivores.  

Here are a couple of the items I tried.

Tandoori chicken - tender and flavorful.  Excellent and probably the best I've had at a buffet.

Chicken tikka masala -  an Indian food staple.  Delicious nonetheless here as well.

Chicken 65 -  flavorful with a kick

Lamb curry -  tender meat and well seasoned and spiced

Chicken curry -  tons of flavor that won't disappoint.

Rice dishes (steamed, veggie biryani, chicken biryani) - good

My wife ate the vegetable items and she was impressed as well.

Deserts -   Can't go wrong with Gulab Jamun and they make it well.

Overall - nice atmosphere, family friendly and great food.  

Recommendation -  a definite fave that I will be returning to.
