OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA By far the most overrated place in this part of the city.  They were one of the first Haka places and are still big for people that find on place and never move on.

The food is good which is the only reason I give the two stars.  Standard Haka stuff chili chicken...

The worst thing about this place is that if you call ahead for pickup, they won't start it until you get their ad pay which saves you no time.  It'd also do rude like you are a prank caller or something.  But it fits with their total lack of customer service, I'm getting really tired of all the Asian places getting a pass on rude staff, its kind of racist.

Parking lot is small busy with additional parking in the poorly lit back.
