LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw We had the Sunday Buffet.  It was terrible. The food was terrible and there was one guy running the place who kept going outside.  So much Incense burning as you walk in too.  One of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten at. My husband liked the lamb curry so it got one star for that.
