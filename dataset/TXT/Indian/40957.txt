PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA Read the reviews before I went and thought it would be a great experience. But should have paid closer attention to what they really said. 

Had the chicken tikka masala with a mango lassi. The mango lassi was good. The masala was over priced for the quality it was. It is in a food court and should be evaluated as fast food. Not the greatest, but okay when you are hungry and anything will do. Not the best if you are looking for good Indian food. Though the naan was pretty good. The question I had to ask was "where's the chicken?"  Too much sauce for the amount of meat. 

So, in the end, the value to quality did not justify the price. But if you get that late night craving for Indian food in the city that never sleeps, this would be an okay stop as they are open 24 hours, but for a great meal of Indian food, find somewhere else.
