FCe3qJGTbKJTMAljvziuoA Samosas ordered for funeral reception. 75 beef @.90/piece and 75 veg @.60/piece. Definitely not inexpensive but they were large. 
Vegetable were hot and tasty. Unfortunately the beef ones were fridge cold inside. Apparently it is my duty to advise them that I need HOT samosas. I called the first time to order and was not  asked as Kay rushed through order. Called again on morning of pickup and was told "yeah yeah yeah they will be ready". I called to find out why samosas were cold and was told "next time tell us you want them hot" , "bring them back if you want a refund or we can make them for tomorrow...", "you want a refund for 75 samosas?"  I didn't ask for a full refund but would have been happy being offered a partial credit of even a dozen samosas in the form of voucher for the future. Instead I got a long lecture from Kay (owner and manager)about how they cook the beef samosas early in the morning and then put them in the fridge because of the health inspector but the veg ones are cooked all day and that's why they are hot. I was also told by her "that if I was a vegetarian like her, I would appreciate the fact that they are cooked separately". I told her that I had no problem with that but that when they take orders they should advise their customers as well as have the right information on their website. Customer service is non existent as no credit or solution was offered just an apology and a directive to make sure I tell them I need them hot for next time...like that is going to happen. 
Samosas were okay even if cold but the attitude from both Kay and her brother left a VERY bad taste in my mouth.
Best samosas are at Sultan of Samosa!
