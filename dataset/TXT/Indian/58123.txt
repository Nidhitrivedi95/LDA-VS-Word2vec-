yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg It's been almost two years since I last visited Star of India, and my absence is due to other reasons and not bec. of the food.  Some good eats I've tried here are the chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, and chicken naan, the latter of which was overflowing with chunks of tender, marinated chicken.  Add a side salad and you've a delicious meal.
