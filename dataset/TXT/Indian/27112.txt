Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag I dropped in here with a group of work colleagues on whim since the Thai place across the street had a long wait. We were all very glad we did. This is top notch Indian food.

It is not a traditional Indian restaurant, it is modern meets Indian. The decor, food and bar reflect that. The food is more appropriately portioned to share a bit and try different things. Not like your traditional huge plates of food that leave you absolutely stuffed, although if you want to, you can always ask for more "gravy and rice". You can eat nicely here and still feel like you can grab cocktails after. Speaking of cocktails, they have a decent bar with a good selection of specialty cocktails, beer and wine.

The service was very good and the chef came out to greet us after our meal. You can tell he really cares that he creates something unique and enjoyable.

Honestly, this is some of the best Indian food I have had, better than I've had in London. I'll recommending this place to anyone I know heading to Vegas.
