2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw A total letdown!

Food - 
Basmati rice was inferior - seemingly microwaved and re-heated, brought to us after an inordinate amount of time (for serving rice). Dried up and tasteless. 

"Samosas" were a "modern" take on the classic - but fell flat, being less than enough and mostly potato! Intensely disappointing! 
The amount of tamarind sauce was puny and dollhouse sized! Not enough. 

Customer Service - 
Utterly clueless. Although I understand her relative newness (recent hire), the server could not answer basic questions, leaving us to consult the kitchen multiple times - and even asked -us- to tell -her- what was on the menu. A sign of lackluster training. 

We found a hair in our "Chicken Platter" and promptly informed the staff. Instead of listening to the claim or abiding by the "customer is always right" phrase (the hair did not match any of the customers!), the plate was taken to the kitchen and another staff member returned to inform us that there was actually NO hair on the plate! (the hair had been removed). Instead of offering us a remedy or acknowledging the situation, we were asked "so what do you want?" And "replaced" the dish, as in - reheated it and brought it back. No protocol for this type of situation and completely unprofessional. 

Overall, not going back! - very disappointing, overpriced, and underwhelming.
