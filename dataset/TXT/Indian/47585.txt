TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We happened to be on chrismas day there and buffet was 20$ for a very small selection. Somehow we heard it as $9.95( it looked like that), but when the bill came, it was 86$ for 2 adults and 2 kids. Most expensive indian buffet I ever had. To me it was not worth it. To order all items are very pricey. I will not visit again.
