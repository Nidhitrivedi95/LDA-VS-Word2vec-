2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Great atmosphere, a bit pricy. Service was great. The Managolore coconut chicken was amazing. The palak paneer was tasty, thick uniform sauce and the paneers were prepared to perfection. Man chow soup was very fresh and full of flavor. Raita was too salty. 
Will be back again....
