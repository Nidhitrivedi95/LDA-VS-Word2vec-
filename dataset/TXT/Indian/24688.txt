They had no taste in them. The chicken biryani was basically uncooked rice with small pieces of unsavory chicken. And the Tandoori chicken had an unusual smell to it. 

Coming to the main course: The chicken tikka masala had a rubber-like texture. The saag and the malai kofta, even though had rich gravy, had practically the same taste (too buttery). The chicken curry was good. 
The only thing I really liked about the food was the dessert. They had mango ice cream, kheer and gulab jamun. 

Conclusion: If you guys want to taste authentic Indian food, avoid this place! This will leave a bad taste in your mouth. It does not justify the $12 ($10 on student ID) price tag. I would not go there again. Also, my two stars for this place is solely because of the desserts.
