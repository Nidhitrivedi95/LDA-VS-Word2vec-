jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I first walked in and was surprised that this is a self-serve place. I guess I just assumed an Indian Food place would include service. It makes more sense when you get to the menu/ordering area and see half of the menu is comprised of different kinds of burgers. I didn't discount them just for the fusion menu,  but it was my first point of concern. I was looking for some Korma specifically and they don't have that. So, as the pictures I'm gonna upload will show, I got the lamb Shawarma,  chicken samosa,  a mango lassi. My boyfriend got chicken boti, a drink and fries. 

Our bill came out to $37 for me and my boyfriend which I think is ridiculous for a self-serve indian/American fusion diner (basically). They call your number and you go to pick up your food.  After you eat you throw away your trash and put your plates away. I don't mind going to self-serve places but the amount you pay for Indian food I think it's silly not to serve us. Especially because the place isn't busy! Why are there signs everywhere trying to get customers to serve themselves and clean up after themselves when it takes 30 seconds for an empty restaurant staff member to walk it over. I'll say right here if this restaurant doesn't succeed it's at least 50% because of their idea to make it self-serve. 

I was happy with my lamb Shawarma. The
 samosa was really spicy,  would not recommend. The lasse did not have the bubbly texture I'm used to. My boyfriend was pretty upset with his boti - only because for 11 dollars at a place you serve yourself he thought the portions were too small. He had like five chunks of chicken and bunch of rice and lettuce. They call it a salad but it really is just lettuce. 

However, the lamb was good and I may be back for a lamb gyro if I'm in the mood one day. The food isn't bad just some execution issues I think. If you serve restaurant priced food, serve your customers. Especially if your portion sizes aren't commendable.
