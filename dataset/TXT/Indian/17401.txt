DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ My wife and I ate the luncheon buffet today.  We had lived in New Delhi for four and half years in the 1990s and welcome the opportunity to enjoy Indian cuisine.  The "all you can eat" buffet consisted of a wide range of traditional North Indian dishes including pakoras, tandoori chicken, naan, basmati rice, lentils, rice pudding, etc. All the items were tasty and prepared well. The server and manager were personable and professional. The dining area was clean, neat, and tidy with areas for large groups, families, couples, or individual diners.  A nice touch was the colorful mukhwas or after-dinner digestive snack by the door on the way out.
