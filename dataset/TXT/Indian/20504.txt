fWV88qIVhFR5fFg76Nh0Kw Sunday afternoon brunch in Mississauga's Azuba was not the best experience.
The location of this area should give you an indication as to what to expect.
Located near the airport south of Dixie and 407 the exterior doesn't look much.

The interior is actually nice and elegant, and quite up to date.  However the service was very slow when we ordered NAAN, which never came.  Also ordering india chai, which took forever.  We had to ask two servers about our tea, and only then did it finally arrive.  The choices of foods for its price was not bad at all, ranging between $10 lunch and dinner which is $12.99.  The place was overall clean, and there were a hand full of choices for foods, but overall I have had better.  This is no where incomparable to India's Taste, nor Tandoori Flame which are on the upper echelons of Indian buffets!
