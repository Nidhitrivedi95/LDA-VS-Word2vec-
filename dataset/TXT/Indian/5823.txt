3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I was very excited to get Indian food while in Vegas as Phoenix's Indian food scene.... how can I say this nicely.... leaves something to be desired. After seeing the great reviews, I knew we had to check Delhi out. We came for the lunch buffet on a weekday and it was not overly crowded (which was nice). The buffet was large with an extensive selection of dishes. Most of the food was quite good, with the spicy chicken curry being the tastiest option (in my opinion). They also had a large variety of vegetarian options if that is something you are looking for. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have chai tea on the buffet, nor did they have my favorite Indian dessert (the rice pudding... yum)... but apparently the selection changes from day to day, so maybe we came on an off day. The price is good for all that you get (about 11$). I must admit that I have had a better Indian buffet experience in Vegas (Evergreen... yum), but this is another great option, especially if you are a local. Happy eating, Vegas!
