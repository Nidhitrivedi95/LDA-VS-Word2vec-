e8_Xt-ldpDgWHn92s3rBaQ They always say don't judge a book by it's cover! It might sit at the edge of the strip mall, and as you walk in it may not give you the fill of prosperity, but when the Food hits the table and the aroma tickles your noise, and the fresh, spicy East India flavor illuminate your pallet you will know your in the right place !!! I enjoyed the Goat Masala with the Paneer, and the chicken Samosa ! ALL fabulously prepared well. I shall return !!!
