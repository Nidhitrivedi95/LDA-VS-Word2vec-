TBHpa0OX9WnWdlrti-KBxQ I loved this new Indian place in Strongsville! And Strongsville certainly needed one! We had the weekend buffet, and there was a surprising number of options! Most of the Indian buffets I have gone to only offer 1-2 main meat entrees and 1 rice option... this place had 3-4 meat entrees (a few chicken and 1 lamb) and 2 different kinds of rice! Everything was delicious... even my boyfriend enjoyed it all, and he doesn't eat Indian very often. I was certain that the buffet was going to be at least $15-20 with all the varieties they provided... it was a pleasant surprise when the bill came to only $10 per person! I even asked for hot sauce, and although it took awhile to arrive, it was obvious that it was homemade, fresh and hot in spice and temperature! We will definitely be coming here again... if the buffet stays this good, it's going to be hard to try anything else off the menu! Great value!
