jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I feel bad writing a negative review because this place and the staff were so nice. It's beautifully decorated inside. When you go in, you go up to the counter and order your food. The owner even helped me decide what I wanted to order. Yet, when the food came out, it was a huge disappointment. This is Mediterranean food fused with Indian food. There was nothing special about the food at all!!!!

Maybe this kind of fusion is not for me.
