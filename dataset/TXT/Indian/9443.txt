8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I just wonder why Sitara gets so much crowd and a 4 star rating on yelp. This is a very average restaurant and none of their food has any correlation to how the actual dish tastes.

positives
  - Ambience is decent.
  - Taste of food isn't awful unlike the other Indian restaurants in Champaign.
  - Their yellow dal is probably the only food which is good. Sometimes their samosas are ok.

negatives
  - The food prepared though named after indian dishes, do not taste anything like that. Especially the Biryani is laughable since its just some masala rice. It tastes ok but please don't call it Biryani. The same goes for most of their dishes. This is the only place that gives Biryani without Raita. Also their rice that comes with other accompaniments is so poor in quality.
 - Too much artificial color in the food.
 - The various entrees with Paneer are just messed up.
 - The chicken and lamb mostly taste stale and only fish hasn't been that bad. 
 
If you want to eat something which tastes like Indian food go to bloomington and there are some good restaurants there, hope they would start one here.
