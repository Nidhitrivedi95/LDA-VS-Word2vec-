Walked into the restaurant for dinner and we got seated right away! Once we were seated our server brought over water and a complimentary snack; 3 pieces of pita-size crackers baked with fennel seeds, yum! She notified us about the service button for when we were ready to order. Service here is prompt just the way I like it!

We ordered the Butter Chicken (since it was recommended by many yelpers!), Pulao and Cauliflower Pakora. The Butter Chicken was served in a small circular pot; didn't anticipate it to be such a small portion but, there is the option to upsize! Chicken was kind of dry however, the creamy sauce complimented it and it also went well with the Pulao. The Pulao is cooked with various spices already and it's just as tasty on its own. As for the Cauliflowrr Pakora, I was not much of a fan. It's pretty much like tempura you'd get at a Japanese restaurant however, fried with a chickpea batter. I found it to be quite dry but, hey, if you enjoy cauliflower and chickpea then this is the appetizer for you! 

The goodness of this place does not stop here. Another AMAZING thing about this place is that it's affordable. When the bill came we were surprised to find the total to be around $23! Pulao for only $3.50?!?!  And the Cauliflower Pakora was around 4 bucks..?!(Even though the price of cauliflower nowadays has skyrocketed!) The most expensive item we had was the Butter Chicken, it was around $13 but even then, it's all worth it! Both of us shared the items and it was plentiful BUT, if you're a big eater then sharing won't do you well. 

Definitely will return to try the other items on the menu!
