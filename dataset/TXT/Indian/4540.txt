1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg Another go-to lunch place.  Their butter chicken lunch special is the ultimate comfort food for me after a long morning at work.  For an easy $9 (after-tax!), you get a main meat dish (butter chicken ftw!), two side vegetable curries (e.g. eggplant, cauliflower, or potato and okra), rice with lentils, and a rice pudding for dessert.  Leaves me full and satisfied every time :D

On other days of the week, they have other lunch specials, including curry chicken, tandoori chicken, sag chicken, chicken masala, and lamb curry.  Butter chicken is still my favourite, but there are a ton of other choices.  Extremely fast, efficient, and friendly service.  Highly recommended!
