UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ The chicken tikka masala deserves 5 star because it's on point but the garlic naan, not so much....

But then again today is their soft opening so maybe in 2 weeks things will change for their grand opening. 

Garlic naan was a little on the thick side but it had a weird taste to it. Also the garlic wasn't cooked all the way.
