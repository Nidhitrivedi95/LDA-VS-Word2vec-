vOdFaWm5VgenJODzk_nIQg Let me start by saying that I have been to cleaner nicer places while traveling through India and places I trusted the food more as well. I will be amazed if I don't get Dheli Belly from this place. 
The food was just horrible and really not worth trying, I recommend you not waste your time and try any of the other good restaurants that Kensington has to offer.
