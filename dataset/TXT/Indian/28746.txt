Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ This was the first time we used this restaurant. Nice little dining room but we had takeout that night. The Chili chicken and rice were fabulous. We also had a tasty beef and vegetable dish, but I can't recall the name of it. All the food was delicious. Prices were very reasonable . It's great to have another great restaurant in the neighbourhood. Highly recommend it.
