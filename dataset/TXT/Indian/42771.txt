RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg We went to Blue Taj after a movie, and I'm glad. 
First, there is clever usage of heavy curtains to partition off sections- it creates a very intimate setting to not see the entire restaurant from your seat. I have no idea if there were 20 tables or 200. 
The host and hostess at the door were warm and friendly, and our server was engaged as well. 
There is an extensive wine list which surprised me, but I just ordered a glass, and my friend ordered a Kingfisher beer. My wine was a generous pour. 
We started with a cauliflower app. It was a little more tomato-pasty than I liked, but the textures were varied and it still was pretty good. We also ordered the Cod, Saag Paneer, and garlic naan. We ordered everything medium heat, but it was not really hot at all, so next time I might try at least one dish hotter. 
The naan was very good- warm and garlicky...yum!
Unfortunately, the cod was quite overcooked and dry, which is why I didn't give 4 stars. Even the sauce it was served with couldn't save it. 
I dont get to Ballantyne that often, but I'll keep Blue Taj in mind when I do. I'd like to try some other menu items.
