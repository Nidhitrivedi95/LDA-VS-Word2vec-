xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg I don't know why this place receives such rave reviews. The service is terrible, the food sucks - at least during their buffet times. Sure, they have a chicken tikka masala dish but there was no chicken in it. They bring you one naan out at a time during the buffet and for three people that doesn't go very far. They bring out one napkin per person at a time and for a place you're mostly eating with your hands, that's just being cheap. For the price, go to the Mt Everest buffet instead.
