FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Excellent food, the waiter provided suggestions and the food he suggested was awesome. Very flavorful and the fish appetizer paired well with my Heineken as he said it would!  I will surely be back, next time I will be checking out the weekend lunch buffet. The waiter mentioned that on the weekends they have the best selection of deserts, pastries, and entrees and that would be the idea time to sample the many dishes they offer!
