iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA This is seriously the best Indian food I've ever had. Everything we ave tried is absolutely delicious!!  The lamb vindaloo is unreal, spicy and so flavorful. I also love the chicken tikka masala and the seared eggplant is a delicious appetizer. You really can't go wrong here!!
