s8N66BJ9P-sqhisX47o1Sg Well I've been ordering here for a while now and I personally love the butter chicken. The prices are pretty high but the food is kind of "meh" for what you are paying for. BUT the last time I ordered there, my mom, brother and I decided to eat there. We ordered two dishes, the butter chicken, and a roti. First, we were ordering at the counter, and the phone would ring and the guy would spend massive times on the phone, not talking to a customer. Second, he wasnt very friendly, he seemed clueless and tired. We came there expecting to take less than an hour to eat. But it took over a half an hour to get our food! It was empty at the time and the kitchen was quiet. Having this much time to sit, bored, I noticed that the place is super out dated and old. But besides all that, I give 5 stars for the food and 1 star for service, I recomend calling and eating at home.
