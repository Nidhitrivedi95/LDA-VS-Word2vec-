Interesting atmosphere - more of a lounge style.

- Biryani lamb has lots of spices (and more than I can handle) with tender lamb pieces. 
- Butter chicken was average, but it contained lots of meat in it which I liked
- Chicken tikka (I enjoyed the most) was grilled and flavourful. Tender and moist that came on a hot sizzling plate

The naan we ordered was a bit burnt that lost the fluffiness and became hard
Overall, the food was good but on the pricier side. Service was attentive.
