B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog My bff swears that Gandhi is the best Indian food in North America, so this was our first meal stop when we got to Montreal. Despite the generic name, the food is excellent as was the service, and the restaurant is very pretty and bright. 

We were starving and ordered several dishes to share: chicken jalfreezi, chicken tikka masala (my favorite), plain naan, and samosas. We asked for spicy levels for the two chicken entrees, and unlike their American counterparts they did NOT disappoint with the spice levels. I also noticed that American chicken tikka masala has always seemed cream-based to me, but at Gandhi it was definitely onion-and-tomato-based. While I lovelovelove and am more accustomed to the creamy-rich deliciousness of chicken tikka masala in the States, Gandhi's was very delicious. I also liked the jalfreezi. The samosas were good and I loved drizzling their array of sauces on the deep-fried lovelies. The naan was a little  too sweet for my preference, but the fluffy texture was wonderful.

I don't know when I will be back in Montreal again but I would definitely make Gandhi a sure stop and highly recommend it to any local or tourist.
