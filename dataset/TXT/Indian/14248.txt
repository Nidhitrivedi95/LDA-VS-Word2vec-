c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Possibly the best BBQ for bihari kebab in Canada.  Try the bihari kebab which is a super tender tenderloin meat BBQ in the tanoor. Comes with naan.   The rest of the food is very good, albeit VERY spicy and I am used to heat.  Ask for plain yogurt on the side to sooth the heat.  The place is a bit dirty on that the tables don't get cleaned often, sometimes the wait is unreasonable,but the food is fantastic.
