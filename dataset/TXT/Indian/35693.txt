Most memorable dish was probably the okra fries, how do they get that texture? Crispy outside and tender inside with excellent flavour. House black daal was okay but not that memorable. Chicken ruby was delicious, and texture was good on the chicken. The Edinburgh chef's special was also very good and roti was thin and buttery (or greasy depending on how you look at it). 
Would definitely come back or check out their other locations!
