ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Over priced, low grade food with poor service. I am from out of town and was craving Indian food. This place had great reviews. Waited for 5mins at the front before I was greeted. Sat at bar. Nice bar tender. The food was soul less. If you want authentic yet intelligent modern cuisine do not go to this place. It's NYC prices without the taste or quality. Very dissapointing. Dont waste your money/time.
