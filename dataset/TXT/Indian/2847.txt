Our orders were delivered timely and explained well.

The dinner was ala carte and quite expensive, $30 per person, though we know they have a booming daily buffet at $9.99 a person which is said to be quite good, which we shall return for. They also cater and do takeout. We got a menu for later ;)

Music was modern yet tasteful, Indian influenced stuff that accompanied the meal well. 

Bathrooms and decor were clean, well cared for. Parking was easy, nice access to Dysart, the place is easy to spot from the road.

The wifey can't handle spice so they dumbed it down for her. My lamb dish was adequately spiced for me though. Drink choices were plentiful. Rice options and side dishes all what you would expect though I didn't notice saffron rice, maybe they don't do it or I just missed it? They have a huge menu. I will venture into more flavorful choices on our next visit.

Portion sizes were good, though maybe a bit skimpy on meat and naan considering price per plate, still had plenty of food left over which they helped us carefully pack, so can not really complain. I imagine they do vegan dishes very well.

Everything presented well, our waters were kept full and we were checked on often to ensure we enjoyed the meal and all was in order.

On the way out, the waiter even rushed half way across the restaurant to hold the door open for us and personally thank us for coming, a nice touch, and their thankfulness quite sincere. That kind of care goes a long way in my book, and sets them apart from many Indian places I've been before.

So there you have it, the India Garden. Give it a go, one of the few if not only restaurant in the West Valley of its kind and caliber.
