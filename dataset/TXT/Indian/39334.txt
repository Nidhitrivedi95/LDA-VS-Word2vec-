oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q We were here about three years ago and had an amazing time. I have to seriously wonder if there's new management as this place has really gone downhill. 

Our table was sticky (even though it was wiped down) and our plates had food particles on them. We had to get new ones. 

There is a thick layer of dust in the dining area. The whole place could use a good scrubbing. 

The food took forever to arrive. The taste just wasn't great. It was drowning in sauce. It had a lot of oil & fillers in it. Food in a food court is better. 
 
My husband and daughter insisted that I give a review. My daughter has a good appetite and was starving when we got there but was only able to eat a few bites. 

If you've read this far it's correct to assume we didn't order dessert.
