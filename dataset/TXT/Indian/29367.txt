JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ We ordered many dishes and two dishes were tasting too spicy , so we requested for an exchange but there was the owner who was an Indian lady and she refused to alter the dish for us.. she really had some attitude problem, she never came with the next dish and literally hit the utensils on the table while serving.
