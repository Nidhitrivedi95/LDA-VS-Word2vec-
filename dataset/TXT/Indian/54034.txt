vrAZ6qenlYwHfgzSSlmkiQ I come here quite q bit for their buffet. The food is always fresh and delicious and excellent value for Toronto standards.
My favourites are the Lamb Vindaloo and the Saag Paneer. The rice is lovely and he naan is always freshly made to order. 
Looking forward to the next time.
