abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg If you like south and east Asian food there may not be a better restaurant in the city for creative small plate street food. We started with the cardamom gin cocktail - great aroma and balanced flavor. If you like cardamom, don't pass this one up. 

The fish of the day was Salmon and the chili fish was spectacular. Well balanced dish with just the right amount of heat. Don't miss the beef or the chicken tacos, served on small paranthas. Both the flatbreads were lovely - the kebab is great for meatlovers, but my mouth still salivates for the eggplant one. Can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu. 

The chef/owner came by and we had a great chat with her. A great personality and fun to talk to - we discussed cooking techniques and her inspiration for the menu. She (and the restaurant) will surely do well.
