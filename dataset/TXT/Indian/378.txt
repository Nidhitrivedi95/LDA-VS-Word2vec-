-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g We visited here for dinner, and while the dinner meat dishes were a bit expensive (the veggie stuff was much more reasonable) the food was really good and the service was very attentive and polite. I need to go check out their lunch buffet one of these days soon as it was recommended to me.
