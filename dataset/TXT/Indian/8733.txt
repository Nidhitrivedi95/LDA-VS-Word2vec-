We were greeted by a server within a minute, immediately shown to a table, (we did make a reservation about a week prior).  Our drink order was taken and quickly delivered to our table along with a basket of crackers and dip, (both were delicious). Our food arrived within 10 minutes of being ordered. My girlfriend, recently returned from a tour of India, said it was the best she had had in Canada. Me, it was better than any I'd had in my 12 years working in Brampton. After we had eaten, we sat and enjoyed our wine with no pressure to pay our bill and leave. In fact had to ask the waiter for our bill. It arrived promptly. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone that wishes to experience true Indian food.
