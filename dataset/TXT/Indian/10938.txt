I tried to order butter chicken with a side of naan, but the cashier insisted that I had to order a #7 combo even though the option to order just butter chicken was on their menu...

So, I went with the #7 combo since I really didn't have a choice. The combo allows you to choose 1 meat dish and 2 veggie dishes, plus you get some rice and two pieces of naan. Well, basically all you get is naan and rice. You get one, maybe two if you're lucky, little pieces of chicken for the butter chicken. You basically get 1/4 cup of each of your meat and veggie options. So, don't expect to get full unless you want basically just have bread for dinner. 

Considering all the food food is prepared already it takes a long time to actually get your order.

For another 2$, it's well worth it to go to an Indian buffet and actually get full off of meat and vegetables instead of just naan and rice.
