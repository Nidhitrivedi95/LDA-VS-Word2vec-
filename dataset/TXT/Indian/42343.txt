qMw7mFHAjgG7qN82aXmeZg Really good Tali,  with the best naan and kebab. Affordable and attentive service.  A tiny bit spicy for me but then again I'm not a local so this can be expected.Great stop for those getting their cars repaired at one of the many nearby mechanics (I recommend Devinder at Bharj Bros. in the same Plaza)
