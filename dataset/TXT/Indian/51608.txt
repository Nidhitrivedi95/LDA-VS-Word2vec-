UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Buffets are meant to be this good! I don't like buffets and I prefer quality over quantity so this buffet is the best of both worlds. The many Indian buffets we have gone to have a tendency to flavor each dish the same and so you get a lot of the same dish just in different colors. NOT here! Each dish was fabulous! So distinctly, flavorful and without a doubt made with excellent and fresh ingredients. I recommend you arrive early for lunch as it gets packed! The garlic nahn was perfect! Service was friendly and I'd go once a week if I lived around the block. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Mint Indian Bistro!
