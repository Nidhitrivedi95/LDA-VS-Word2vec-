4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Bribing for reviews with coupons ..
Mothers day lunch for ten people. 45 minutes to get water to our table. There were 2 servers for.about 150 people sitting in our section.  The food was bland or sweet... not well made authentic. The sambar and dosa were terrible. The biryani rice were all broken grains.$25 per person for poor food plus drinks and slow service. Plus they came and offered a 25%discount off the next visit if we gave them a review on yelp right then that they could see.. so bribing for reviews. Floors by the kitchen and food were slippery with food and oil... saw three people almost slip. We arent going back again.
