DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ What happened to flavor?

My wife and I have been visiting nearly every Indian place in and around Charlotte (along with other areas) and while there are still a few we've not gone to I must say this place has been the worst.  

I cannot put my finger on what is wrong nor why there are so many great reviews.  I'm not a hater... I love Indian food and wanted them to be great.  The buffet was limited and nothing had flavor.  Things that should have been soft were hard and things that should have been hard were soggy.

In every way it was less than par and cannot recommend it.
