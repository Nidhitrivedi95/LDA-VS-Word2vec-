45fMwU6aolShQ-B0mTwglg I'VE DIED AND GONE TO DOSA HEAVEN!!!!!!  A friend of mine took me here, and I ordered the Rava Dosa with Onion and Potato - SO DELICIOUS.  The portion sizes were massive and really tasty.  Prices were super reasonable.  No hipsters in sight, just people there to enjoy great food.  Service was a bit slow and the waiter was sassy, but it/he wasn't awful.  I will come here again!
