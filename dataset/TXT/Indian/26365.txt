Granted the location is in a old house, it is far from a take it lightly place. 

I am from NYC, Indian and love food. And this place in Charlotte blew my mind. I loved everything i ate. I ordered from the moden menu and the dish tasted amazing. My coworker oredered off the classic menu and was raving too. We took a indian food virgin with us and he liked it so much he tried all the dishes we ordered. The restaurant got his seal of approval. 

The waiter was helpful, served us dessert even after the kitchen closed. Which would make me give them the 6th star for high standard in customer service (but Yelp limits me to 5!). 

I'm going back tonight as i dont think i will be able to find such Indian food back in NYC.
