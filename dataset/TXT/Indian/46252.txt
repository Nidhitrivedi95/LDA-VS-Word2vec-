sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Which came first?  The Butter Chicken or the Roti?

It doesn't matter - because Gandhi's has mastered the mix!

Varied to your individual spice tolerance (spice options have narrowed in recent months - but I will not hold it against them!), Gandhi's offers you a fusion of fresh, chewy, aromatic rotis filled with a full and flavourful stuffing of your choice.

My choice?  The Butter Chicken Roti hands down!

Anytime I'm feeling sad or lonely... Gandhi's has definitely become my without-a-doubt comfort food.

It's unfortunate that they aren't open on Saturdays, but I will not hold that against them either.  

***Caution - As other yelpers have mentioned, err to the low side of the spice scale if you are unsure as 'Hot' is pretty crazy HOT.
