TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA So I'll start by saying I had a terrible experience at the flagship location in Chennai, India in 2005. Since then, I swore off coming to this place ever again (no matter what corner of the world). 
So after successfully boycotting this restaurant for 12 years, I was forced into going on a recent family dinner. 

Now I'll tell you why I will not go back again:

1. They sat us directly next to the cash and a waiter just hovered outside of the register directly behind my seat. Table was not clean! 

2. We were a party of 6 and received 3 menus. When I asked for an additional 3 menus, I was handed one without a word and the waiter walked away. Another one walked by and I asked for an additional two menus and was asked why I couldn't share and rolled her eyes?! (Ummm ok)

3. Six people, 5 spoons. It was a mission to get another spoon. 

4. One of our appetizers came after our mains because we asked if it was coming (I'm guessing they forgot to put in the order)? 

5. Not enough napkins. We asked for more and got 2. (Maybe they're saving money by reducing napkin waste?!) 

6. Had to ask four times for extra sambhar before getting any. 

Overall, the food was not anything special. There are many other dosa places that serve far better quality food and actually care about their customers. The service is horrendous. We went on a Monday evening around 6pm. They were not busy and many servers were just hanging around chatting with each other. When interacting with customers they behave in a manner that leads me to believe that the customer is a burden and they are not interested in ensuring a positive experience.

Thank you for reminding me why I had not eaten here since 2005 and why I should never eat here again.
