ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Prior to my visit, the only Indian food that I've tried was a handful of frozen meals from the supermarket. I came for the lunch buffet and was pleasantly surprised. The real deal is much better. My only complaint is that there wasn't any dessert options at the time I showed up (the buffet must have run out). I'm sure I'll be back!
