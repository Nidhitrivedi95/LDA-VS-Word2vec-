Quantity of curry and biriyani is very less compared to their competitors. The store is a dubba wala and behave as Taj. If you really want to dine there are better place avoid this over priced crap for highly priced chat

Chat is $6+ its highly priced u can buy all chat items readymade nowadays from indian grocery. Good lesson learnt
