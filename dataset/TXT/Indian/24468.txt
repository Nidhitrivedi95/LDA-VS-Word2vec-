h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Horrible service - I went there for a pickup after a very poor experience with the buffet. I was hoping the evenings would be better - but to my dismay they made me wait for a very long time after I reached there... I had ordered on the phone before hand and reached there after the alloyed time ... After being made to wait I again went and enquired and I think then they started on my order- again a wait at the counter for 15 mins with me checking with every of the several there on the status.. And after all these once they give the order they dont even care to apologize 
Food was ok but I think it was the built up of the hunger which made it taste better
Very unhappy with the service!! By the way just to add there was hardly any rush which would explain the delay
