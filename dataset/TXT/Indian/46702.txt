t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Got their take out Lunch Buffet for $12.99 and was really happy about the quality, efficiency, and affordability of a lunch buffet. I think it's amazing that they do take out for a buffet, and it was much appreciated! I got more than enough for for lunch for it, and it was a great deal compared to buying individual plates and having a lot of left overs. Will be coming back in the near future!
