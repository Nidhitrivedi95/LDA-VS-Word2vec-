MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ I love this restaurant for the food, but tonight our service was so bad that we will probably only do take-out in the future.  We had the Chicken Naan, the Chicken Tandoori, and the Lamb Masala, and everything was terrific.  I also thought the quality justified the prices.  On the downside, our waitress treated us so shabbily that it colored the entire evening.  We felt truly insulted and condescended to during the entire visit, and what started out as "jokey" behavior towards our table deteriorated to the point that we finally had to go to the bar just to get our checks so we could leave.  Sadly, our below average tips will probably be written off as being from "cheap women diners" rather than a show of our extreme dissatisfaction.  A truly disappointing experience.
