MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg I have zero knowledge about Indian sweets, except for the fact that they are soooo delicious! I was only familiar with Soan Papdi, which they unfortunately didn't have! But it was okay because I tried a box of assorted Indian sweets that I wish I knew the names of because they were all waaaaay too good! It was pretty busy the time I came around lunch time. I wasn't sure how to order so I got whatever looked good. It was my first time here, ordered the box of sweets and then decided to also order thali. I personally didn't like how veg. thali tasted, but obviously I was eating with my eyes first, so I ordered one of everything, got all the colours of the rainbow and tried most of them. It wasn't what I was expecting, I kind of thought I was just eating dipping sauce with rice and bread (the bread was soo good tho!!), I wished for meat the entire time. But overall it was a great experience and will definitely come back at an earlier time for some more Indian sweets!!!
