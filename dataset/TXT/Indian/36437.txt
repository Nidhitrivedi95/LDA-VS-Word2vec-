NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg We love it. I have a three and 6 year old who are not risky with their food, so we rarely get to go out for anything remotely exciting. Thank goodness for Choolah, now we can get some good Indian (for fast food) that is quick and reasonably priced. Best of all, the kids can get pizza or pb&js, so we can still go out as a family. 

Staff is super friendly, the decor is interesting and a sophisticated.
