F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w Owners daughter is the hostess and compared to the next door competitor (other hostess is old lady), their food is more tasty!

Reasonably priced.

Liked all non-veg dishes and Chicken Makhni is specially smooth & nice. Veg dishes like Saag-chole (spinach-chick-pea), kari-pakoda is worth mentioning. 

Sometimes they have Biriyani which is nice.

But in desert they loose a star  ' * ' as  they do not feature 'Gulab Jamun' as often as they should. Instead it's always kheer, every time I went.
