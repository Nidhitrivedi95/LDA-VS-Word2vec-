gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A For my sister's 18th birthday, I suggested we skip the overdone Italian option and try Indian. Everybody was down, and I got to give the teenagers a decent intro to the cuisine.

As a party of seven, we ordered so many dishes.

Vegetable and keema (lamb) samosas were a good introduction and came out piping hot. Kachumber Salad, I could eat this forever. Such simple ingredients (lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and a dressing), with a nice clean flavor.

And then the barrage of flavor with Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Aloo Palak, Lamb Korma, Dal Tarka,  Chicken Biriyani, Garlic Naan.

Service was excellent and attentive. They brought our dinner to a close with a complimentary rice pudding.

I look forward to returning and trying the Thali, which is a special made up of a little bit of everything.
