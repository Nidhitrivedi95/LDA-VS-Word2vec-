XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw We split a mixed vegetable roti and a lamb roti between the two of us, and it was a fantastic meal. We ordered it medium-spicy and that was perfect, I'm not sure how hot their hot is. The waiter provides customers with a jug of water which is fantastic thing to do for this type of lunch. I'll go again the next time I'm in Parkdale. Don't be discouraged by the bleak entranceway, once you start to eat you'll be satisfied.
