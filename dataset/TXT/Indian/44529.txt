rxR93KtNb5vxGA17wiHd2w In yet another incarnation Khushi's is now on the site of what was previously an Italian called Massimo's whilst the burnt out branch on Victoria Street is on the market. Having only ever eaten in the defunct one once about 6 years ago comparisons are probably pointless but one thing that did strike me was that the range of dishes available seems to be smaller nowadays. I imagine you could get a vindaloo if you asked for one but that and a few other types of curry don't feature on the menu it seems so you might want to try elsewhere if in search of something particularly hot. Possibly that's a sign of authenticity. Either way the party of 6 I was in with on Saturday past had no complaints about our respective dishes, the knowledgeable & speedy service or the highly sensible policy of not charging for corkage. Not maybe the place to go for a quiet and intimate tete a tete but you could do a lot worse in most other aspects.
