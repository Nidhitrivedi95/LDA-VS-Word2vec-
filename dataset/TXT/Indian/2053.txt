_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg This will be my go-to place for Indian in central Phoenix. I am pleasantly delighted with the flavors and textures- the chicken in the butter chicken is tender and the samosa's outer shell is firm yet flaky to hold the mildly spiced vegetables, namely potatoes and peas. I have identified that one of my guilty pleasures in the carb family is garlic naan. Man, it's good here. The dining room is bright and colorful- it backs up to the classy Bandaids club. I suppose it adds to the "exotic ness" of the experience. All in all, I would love to come back and try ordering off the menu. The buffet is $8.99 on weekends and I got to try lots of wonderful things.
