We hit rooftop/patio this last Saturday around 1am , and the DJ and his crew were putting out mixes and beats that were simply sublime.   Best damn dj crew I've ever heard.  

The drinks were a bit pricey, but well worth the price considering there was no cover for this great music.

People jamming on the dance floor, and plenty of heavy duty misters to keep everyone cool.    

When we left we got the DJ's card and it pointed us to this:  https://twitter.com/DwnTwnFunktion

Definitely check it out.
