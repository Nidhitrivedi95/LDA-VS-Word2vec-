N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg Guy at register ignored me until I asked if they were open. He then failed to say thank you when I paid, just silently handed me the receipt. With dozens of other food options within 50 feet, it seems this place would make an effort to welcome customers. Vegetable biryani was decent, and very spicy, but I knocked off a star because I cannot stand rudeness like that!
