nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Great quality and price! As others have mentioned, they serve a 3 course meal priced at 20 for lunch and 25 for dinner.

For appetizers we ordered the chicken lollipops and tomato bisque. The chicken was very juicy and had a nice crisp to it. The peach coleslaw that it came with was also delicious. They used fresh nectarines and tomatoes. The soup was just as good. It was very rich and flavorful - definitely the best tomato soup that I've ever had so far.

For entrees my bf ordered the spicy shrimp and calamari pasta and I went with the vegetarian special, which was a three mushroom pasta with cream sauce. Portions were huge and I loved how much vegetables they include! I'm a pretty health eater loved that aspect in all of their dishes. 

For dessert we got the pistachios ice cream and mango pana cotte. The mango was delicious! They top it off with freshly shaved white chocolate. I was in a happy place.

Overall great service and food. Since their menu changes I'd definitely come back if I'm ever in Toronto again.
