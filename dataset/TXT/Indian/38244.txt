OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ This location seems to be a bad omen for new restaurants as everything that has been here ended up closing in a very short amount of time but I'm hoping for a better outcome for Tulips as I really enjoyed the different options offered on their buffet and the price was pretty awesome for what I received.  Keeping my fingers crossed for the newest Indian spot in the University area.....
