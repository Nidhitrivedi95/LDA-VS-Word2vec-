Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ Not impressed. I ordered takeout: Mulligatawny Soup, Baingan Ka Bhartha and Bhindi Bhaji. First of all, the soup tasted like water crackers.  The eggplant was okay but a bit lackluster in flavour. Texture was much to be desired. It was really quite indistinguishable from Iams. Ugh. The okra was just okay. I enjoyed that it was not complete mush on my basmati rice.
I might give Utsav another shot.
