JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg Being from the US I don't get here often, but the three times I've been have been fabulous.   I get on a plane every Monday and off every Friday...in between there is always Indian food and I must say this is one of the best places I've eaten in all of North America!    

Weekend buffet was great as well!!!
