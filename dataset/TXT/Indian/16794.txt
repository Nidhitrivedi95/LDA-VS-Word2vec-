DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I love this place! I've tried several different things here but my favorites are the Gobi Manchurian and the Palak Paneer. It's all vegetarian which was awesome when I was a vegetarian but it's just as good now even when I'm not one. Portions are pretty big so expect to have leftovers or split something. I still have yet to make it to the lunch buffet,  but I'll make it one day. Sometimes they run a Groupon, which I've bought before but the prices are pretty cheap without it. I wish they delivered.
