He never came to refill our drinks, he never came to ask if we needed anything. What little he did say to us was said with an attitude. He was disrespectful and seemed irritated. The restaurant was not very busy, yet we waited nearly an hour for our food to arrive. The food itself was not very good, either. Usually, I love Indian food. The food here was bland and had way too much ginger. There were huge chunks of it in everything we ordered, and there seemed to be no other flavor. When I ordered my food, I specifically requested that they make it spicy. However, there was absolutely no spice to it. Nothing tasted good. We agreed that we will not be returning, as every aspect of our experience here was absolutely dreadful.

If you are looking for good Indian food, I suggest going to Ambar India instead. They are always friendly and the food is always amazing. We thought we would try Sitara, and we ended up regretting it. We left feeling like we had wasted our time and money by eating at Sitara.
