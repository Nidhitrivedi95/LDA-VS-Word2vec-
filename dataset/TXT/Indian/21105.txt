GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Food is amazing, each and every time I have gone.  The lamb curry had a good amount of meat and plenty of rice and curry.  I really hope to try the goat next time, last time they were out.  The chicken tikka is juicy, tender and perfectly prepared.  GET THE CHEESE NAN BREAD, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! If you want something to help with some of the spicier dishes, I recommend the lassi, especially if they still have strawberry.  This place is my favorite Indian restaurant, and you can't beat the prices

The only issue I have is the servers.  Some are better than others but I feel like the staff spends more time in the back than up in the front (this could be due to a lack of staffing.). Also the less professional servers are not very friendly and are very lackadaisical.  Don't let this divert you from the stellar food.
