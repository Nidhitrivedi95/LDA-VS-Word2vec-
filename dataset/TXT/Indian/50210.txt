UaMq3DUhtkoZ5WCEQm2T9g I went with some of my friends. The interior is actually just a small place but it's nice. I liked the chicken biryani although I wanted the goat biryani but they ran out at the time. We asked for spicy and it was kind of spicy so that's good. I do like their naan, but the chicken tikka masala we ordered was not spicy at all even though we requested it to be spicy. But I was hungry so I ate it without complaints. I think I would come again for the goat biryani next time, but I would be fine with the chicken biryani since now I know it's good.

I've been here multiple times since I wrote the paragraph above. They just never, ever have goat biyani, ever. Because every time I ask if there are any goat biryani, they say no. But still, I enjoy their chicken biryani and naan. Their butter chicken was unfortunately not good. But biryani and naan are worth coming back for.
