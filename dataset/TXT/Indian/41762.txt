Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw My experience at Chef of India was mediocre at best. The service was good, but the quality of the food left much to be desired.

The complimentary popadoms we were given at the beginning of the evening were somewhat stale and a bit chewy; not crisp as they should be.

My girlfriend ordered their Saag Paneer. What she got was a bright, radioactive green with an extremely bland taste.

I ordered a lamb vinadloo, which while being sufficiently spicy, the meat was dry and over cooked. Probably reheated.

I ordered gulab jamans for desert, and they were cold in the center, and the outside was thick, while the inside was quite mushy. I couldn't finish these.

The masala chai they served was also tasteless and very milky.

The only highlight of the evening was the paneer pakoras, we ordered as an appetizer.

Unfortunately, this was a disappointment, and for those looking for good indian cuisine, you can do a lot better in Toronto than this place.
