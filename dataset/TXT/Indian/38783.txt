OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Place was dead empty, but we Had a certificate from restaurant.com so we gave it a try,  but were told we could not use it because we ate from the buffet.....hmmm so what about the beer and extra items we ordered. Nevertheless food was warm & not fresh, rice hard & presentation awful. Loud vulgar music. Place sucks, many other options available in the area. Two thumbs down.
