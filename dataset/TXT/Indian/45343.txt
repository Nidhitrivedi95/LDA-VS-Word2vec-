S6pZkoM41a2GWbaxR5bYHw We decided to go there for lunch on a Saturday after reading a positive review in the local newspaper.  The experience was certainly mixed.  

The sign on the door said they were open from 11:00 AM and we arrived at about 11:30 AM.  The hostess said they just had the buffet on Saturday for lunch and that it was not quite ready, hmm 11:00 ... 11:30, but that it would be ready in a few minutes.  My wife reminded the hostess that the sign on the door said 11:00 AM and she agreed.    We opted to stay.  The server came for our drink order, and we ordered iced tea.  A few minutes later she returned with water and said they were in the process of making the tea.  We watched as the hostess labeled items for the buffet as they were brought out by the chef.  This went on for 30 minutes.  It's now about noon.  Then someone, apparently the owner, came and walked us down the buffet telling us about each item.  I asked about anything with mango because of allergies and she thought I was interested in being served an item with mango.  We got our food and everything was quite good compared to other Indian food in the area, but by then the problems with the service had become sufficiently annoying to make the food secondary.  Then finally our iced tea arrived.  We had ordered unsweetened tea, I know a problem in NC, but the unsweetened tea was certainly okay.  There was no artificial sweetener on the table so I asked the apparent owner for some.  Ten minutes later she emerged with a single packet of pink sweetener on a plate.  I think she may have gone next door to another restaurant to get it.  By that time we gave up and made the best of the above average food.

This restaurant definitely needs to improve their service.  The service my be better in the evening so we may give it a try again.
