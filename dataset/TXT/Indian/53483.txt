Its a shame, having good Indian close to home would be awesome, and maybe the reason why there is never anyone in this place.

The food is pretty bland - order something extra spicy, and there is no heat.  Even their garlic naan is pretty blah - they managed to even make garlic taste like nothing.  There is much better indian food in Cleveland, it is just a longer drive.  If they lowered prices, and found a way to add some flavors to their bland food this place could be great.
