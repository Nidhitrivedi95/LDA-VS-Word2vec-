xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw We went there and got excellent foods.....malai kofta and aloo paratha are the best. We also got the biryani with maximum level of spicy...for me personally i can tolerate the spicy but it marks the favor of other herbs which i think biryani is the delicious because of favor of herbs. 

As everyone mentioned, this place takes sooooo longgggggg for preparing since they made them fresh dish by dish. You really need to consider ordering by phone at least an hour ahead before you are hungry. Anyway, worth to wait.
