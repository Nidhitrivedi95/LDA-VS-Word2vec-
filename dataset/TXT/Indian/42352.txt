QNhXQmriL6r2W_VrsUmEMg Keenly priced (based on one visit sitting in) range of pakoras (10 or so types), dhal soups and other such items with friendly service, occasional DJ sets and late opening for the post-club crowd this is a good local addition to the city's quality fast food outlets.

No toilet though so keep that in mind if planning to sit in.
