x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ We had food here served years ago and the food was really good then . Not sure if the management changed but they are rude, when they mess up an order they argued and we had to talk to the guy for 20 mins to convince him he messed up . Coming to the food , very very average , we asked for spicy and nothing was spicy. The food seemed like it was made a while ago , tasted quite awful. Overall a bad experience with both the management and the food . Would not recommend this place anymore .
