RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Maybe we were there on a bad night?  Our first time there, and it was so highly recommended.  It was crazy busy, no problem.  We sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks while waiting for our table.  When our table was ready we closed our bar tab and went to the table.  It was insanely warm...like sweat dripping down our backs warm.  Our waiter was very nice and made recommendations. The waiter kept stopping by our table and apologizing and saying "only 5 more minutes...".  It took well over an hour to get our food.   Finally it arrived and while it was not bad, it certainly was not great.  Definitely not better than the much cheaper take out we usually order.

Then came the bill.  My husband noticed the drinks we had at the bar were on our table bill, even though we paid the tab at the bar.  My husband explained this to the waiter.  He then comes back with the manager who demands to see the receipt.  My husband pulls out the receipt to show him...it was very embarrassing.  Finally he agrees to take it off the bill.  

Then, my husband hands the waiter his credit card to pay.  The guy comes back and hands it to my husband.  There is no place to sign.  When asked, he said it was because it was a "reprint" due to the drinks mistake.  My husband asked "ok, but it's paid right?" He says yes.  We leave.  We get halfway to our car and get chased by the waiter who says we have not paid our bill!  Granted...there is some language barrier here...but was hugely embarrassing.  The waiter was very polite and apologized over and over but the whole experience was pretty awful.  

Between the heat, the mediocre food, and being embarrassed not once, but twice...I doubt we go back.  Two stars because the waiter was friendly and the appetizer was good.
