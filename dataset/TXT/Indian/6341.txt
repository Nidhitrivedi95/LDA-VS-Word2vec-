3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Before I start, I must admit this review is late, very late in fact. I half wrote this when I first went to Curry Twist in September 09, then edited more in October, repeated in November and decided to fully rewrite now.

So really, this is an entirely new review about a restaurant I've come to love after living in the Junction for the past few months. A restaurant I've been to at least 5 times now, sharing dishes with gleeful abandon with my dining companions and comparing our dishes.

Quick reviews: The Butter Chicken is divine, with flavourful mouthfuls of a buttery, savoury chicken that is full of sweet spice and flavour. The Lamb Madras is thick, hearty and spicy, perfect for a bitter cold Canadian winter. The Fish Magic is a simple, flaky fillet in one of the most succulent sauces I could imagine, what sauce did not soak up the fillets went directly onto my naan bread and was devoured. The Haandi Chicken Twist is one of the spicier things on the menu and is also a favourite of mine. 

Their specials are often quite fantastic and the next time I see a biryiani on the board I will just stop in for dinner whether I was planning to or not.

Top it off with a gigantic Naan bread or a generous dish of vegetable pulao rice and a bottle of Blanche de Chambly and/or the Hardy's Gewurztraminer from Australia and you will be as hooked as I am.

I promise.
