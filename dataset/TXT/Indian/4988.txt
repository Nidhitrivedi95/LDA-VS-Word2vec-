We were excited about having dinner there as we'd heard good things, but from the minute we walked in the Host who brought us to our table had a very disinterested attitude. We then proceeded to wait 15 mins before we flagged down a passing waiter to ask if someone could come to our table. This despite the fact that the restaurant was more than half empty.  
We eventually had dinner almost 1.5 hour after first walking in. The food was good, however I'm not sure it was worth the wait.
