h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA Good-quality food and very consistent.  My group enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, lamb karahi, mutter paneer (peas and homemade cheese in a coconut curry sauce), with basmati rice and aloo paratha (naan with potatoes and peas).  Their vegetable samosas are pretty tasty, too!

Service could be much better.  We had to wait awhile to order the food, dessert, and then again for the ticket.  BTW, portions are pretty slim, but the flavors all but make up for the small portions.
