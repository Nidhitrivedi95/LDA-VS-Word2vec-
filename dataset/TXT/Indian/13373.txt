bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug I'm here a lot because it's only a 2 minute drive away from my house!

I can't really give a good review for a dine in experience, because I always call in to pick up at Fredericks. 

I call in with an order, they give you a time to pick up, and it's never failed! If they say 10 minutes, it actually is 10 minutes! The take out entrance has it's own separate door (thank god) making the process quick and painless.

The food is fantastic here, the fried rices are to die for. And the pakoras are super spicy (i cant take spicyness at all) but super delicious, packed with tons of flavour!

If you're looking for a fail proof hakka place, I highly suggest Fredericks.

I once ordered sweet and sour chicken to go, yeah, don't get it. It's terrible. Other than that, I recommend this place!
