qCTuGaciae73u7C57s2_0Q First visit on January 20th. I ordered few take out dishes for dinner. I've heard great things about this place but  I have to say I was a little disappointed. The butter chicken too sweet, it was spicy and (too) sweet the same time. The Chana Masala wasn't the greatest either. 

But the staff were very friendly and fast. I won't say I will never go there again, maybe yesterday was just an off day.
