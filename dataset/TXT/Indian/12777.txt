B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg I really enjoyed the lunch special (meat platter), and I'll definitely come back for it again. For the price ($9.95) it is great value - three meats, four slices of naan, awesome yogurt sauce and dessert. After all that food it is pretty much impossible to still be hungry.

My friend ordered the chicken biryani ($8.95) which we both agreed was quite good.

The only thing that was average was the mango lassi - nothing to write home about.

Very friendly staff. Clean and spacious. Ample parking. Right next to Greenway Station to walk off the calories. What's not to like?
