0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Nothing better to pig out on some hakka chinese after long hard week of work. haha. 

And this is the best hakka place I've been to in the GTA... and I've been quite a few.  Everything tastes so good! Portions are big as well... I don't think I could ever finish all the food. (the staff always packs them up for me lol). 

My favorite dishes have to be: ginger fish, chili calamari and the hakka chowmein.
