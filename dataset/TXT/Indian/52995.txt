V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg I wish I had seen these reviews before choosing to  eat Amaya Express.

Service: AWFUL. The people working at Amaya were very rude. The man I ordered from was impatient and curt, and the cashier was rude - I paid with an AMEX card (which didn't tap when we both tried, leading her to tell me to insert it into the machine), and once it went through, she waved a little sign placed at the side of the cash register saying that they don't accept AMEX. Um, I didn't see it, AND she even held my card and tried to tap it giving her the opportunity to see it was an AMEX. 

Food: Okay. As others have said, nothing special. 

Avoid this place altogether.
