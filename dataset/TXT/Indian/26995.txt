I went in with a friend a couple weeks ago and Chef Sunil came to the table, greeted us and gave us a very warm welcome.  Pushpa made wonderful food suggestions as well as some great wine pairings. We ordered a feast, including gol guppa, mango salad, chicken tikka masala, lamb chops, lamb saag and garlic naan.  I've been here a couple more times since then and their wild-caught salmon tikka masala and masala dosa (Indian crepes) are to die for. Chef Sunil mentioned they are the hardest thing on their menu to make, but he loves sharing a piece of his culture. I've also stopped by for happy hour and they have an AMAZING happy hour. I'm a fan!
