-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Nandinis is hands down the best Indian Buffett in the valley. 
the rice is perfect, mango lassi and chai come with the meal (and they are both delicious), and all the food is spectacular. I love the tandoori chicken, spinach (paneer I think?) and the paneer masala. Oh an the naan, it is uncomparable. So hot and so garlicky, it might be worth the trip just for the naan. The buffet also has dessert. I am a massive fan of their rice pudding. 
So food is 5 stars. 
Service is also 5 stars. We were given plenty of attention and rarely had a dirty dish on the table. The Buffett has a nice ambience and is very clean. At around $11-12 for weekends and $9-10 on weekdays, this place it is affordable but I wish it were a bit cheaper so I could come more often. That being said it is probably some of the best Indian food you will ever eat in Arizona.
