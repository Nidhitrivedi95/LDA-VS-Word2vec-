S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Wow! Driving down flamingo and saw a couple of Indian food joints. Ghandi had an authentic feel.

After going inside and seeing a buffet style set up, I was a little thrown off. After asking the lady, she explained you can either do the buffet or order off the menu. 

I decided to stay because there were so many people there.......the food was so good. So good that I went back for dinner the same night. For dinner I ordered off the menu (there is no buffet at night anyways.) and I cannot believe the results. 

The food off the menu was even better than the buffet (which was already some of the best Indian food I've had.) I will be eating here every chance I get every time i'm in vegas.

Favs: Chicken Masala, Lentil Soup, Basmati Rice, Garlic Naan, the dessert @ Buffet  ;-) (make sure to combine them!)
