82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA I've been meaning to try this place for ages, and finally got around to reserving for two on a Friday night. 

First of all, this place makes Ghandi in the Old Port look like a piece of shit.

The ambience is very elegant but restrained at the same time - tall ceilings, wine tower in the middle of the restaurant, tablecloths, and cutaway windows to the kitchen framed in patterned metals. Beautiful! There's even a bar near the entrance you can relax at before or after eating. 

Service is first rate. The waiters are professional, attentive, and friendly. So polite, just like in India! Food comes out quickly and it's bloody good. We tried the lamb vindaloo (excellent), chicken xacutti (never tried it before and loved it), a few vegetarian dishes (all excellent). The dishes, on their own, are on the pricy side - the average meat, chicken, or lamb dish is around $20 or even more, but the quality and presentation is top-notch. The best bet is the table d'hote - $38 a person gets you a soup, appetizer, main, vegetable dish, dessert, and coffee. You can't finish it and have to roll out of there. Absolutely worth it.

The wine list, as someone alluded to, is limited but all the staples are represented. Furthermore, it's dirt cheap. Half of them are in the low $30 range, so what's the problem? 

Dessert, by the way, is phenomenal. The gulab jamuns are the best I've ever tasted.

A new favorite for high-end Indian - definitely the high-water mark.
