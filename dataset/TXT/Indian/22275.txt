GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Been looking for a good Indian restaurant around town and decided to give Bombay a try. I went in on a weekday during lunch and asked for a menu, but was told that only the buffet was available. I didn't really want to have the buffet at first, but since I was already there I figured why not. I also noticed that I was the only non-Indian person in the restaurant and everyone was having the buffet and enjoying themselves.

The buffet was fairly small and consisted of about 8 entree items, 2 different kinds of rice, a minimal salad bar and 2 kinds of dessert. I'm not too familiar with Indian food so I am not sure what everything is called (although most had signs above it), nor did I try everything. Some of the items looked a little old (like it had been sitting in the warming tray a while), but the items I tasted were warm and tasted fine. It's worth noting that the tandoori chicken and chili chicken were pretty tasty. I was a little disappointed that they did not have chicken curry, which is what I usually order. The waiter was friendly and came by to pick up my plates each time I got up to go back to the buffet and also refilled my water when it ran low. He also brought me a basket of naan during my meal that was warm and tasted fresh.

The restaurant itself was decorated nicely, although it felt a bit warm and stuffy while I was eating. Perhaps they  need to turn on the a/c? Just a thought. Also service is slow because they only have 1 waiter during lunch, who also doubles at the host/greeter. But this really wasn't a problem until it came time for me to pay because there were only 4 tables seated while I was there. I was never brought a check, and just handed the waiter a $20 bill and asked to pay for my meal. The waiter returned with $6 in change so I assume the lunch buffet costs about $14.
