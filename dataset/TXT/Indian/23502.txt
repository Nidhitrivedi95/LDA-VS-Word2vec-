gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Great place all around. Have enjoyed everything I've tried here. The Chicken Kadai is my go to main dish, though the butter chicken is excellent as well. Garlic naan is very good but the star of the place is the Chicken Momo's. I am huge fan of all different kinds of dumplings but have to say these are amongst my favorite. Many times I just get 2 orders to go on my way home. Overall fantastic place that I highly recommend
