B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg What a great little find!! I was pleased to stumble upon this place!!  When I walked in I was greeted immediately.  Service was outstanding... the little things they did that may go unnoticed was amazing for me.  Simply saying please and thank you... excuse me when they came to a table to serve food or ask questions... I was in absolute awe.  The food was outstanding!! I got the extra spicy Tandoori Chicken Spinach and yes... I was sweating!! The garlic naan bread went extremely well with it. I would love to bring my wife here if we are in the area.  And on a nice day, I bet the outdoor seating is amazing.
