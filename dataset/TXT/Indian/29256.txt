jpYAApi_w1bR50EJ71LBHg This place is a little hole in the wall, hard to find unless someone tells you about it.  A Sri Lankan friend always brought me spicy noodles with crispy
Fried chicken in it and was craving them for the longest time, but wasn't willing to sit on the 401 all day to make the journey to Scarborough, so, when I found out there was a sri-lanken place near my work I had to try it.  The noodle dish is delicious! Very similar to the Scarborough resto, and only 7$ tax in! The wraps are very good as well, lots of filling and huge, 5$! Why would u go to a chain restaurant these days?  Support local family owned, they are more deserving of my hard earned dough, 4 out of 5, only because it's not something I could eat everyday
