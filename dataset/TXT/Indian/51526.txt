UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We visited this place twice during our stay at Vegas. They have a variety of options on their menu. We ordered Masala Papad, Schezwan fried rice, and dosa. Everything was freshly cooked, spice was perfect as per our request and the dosa was very crisp just the way I like it. Based on our first experience, wanted to give the food another try and went for their lunch buffet next time. We were not disappointed on our second visit too. They have a good number of choices on both veg and non-veg dishes. The food tastes delicious, the ambiance is very quite and comfortable. The service was great too! I would definitely visit this place on my next trip to vegas.
