AgnnYOtOmSr3W_vUmSIeaw Ate sad lunch buffet for NINE DOLLARS!!!!!  Dried out biryani, drier tandoori, dry and tasteless butter chicken, ok chai, barely warm veg korma.  After I made the mistake of commenting on temperature and quality of food got chewed out for showing up at 1pm.  Why did I expect quality food at that hour?  Well, because you are open for business, because the food was out, because you dared brag about all your other restaurants.  $9!!!!  No signs showing price, guess I should have asked.  Pitiful.  Those positive reviews must have been left by owners.
