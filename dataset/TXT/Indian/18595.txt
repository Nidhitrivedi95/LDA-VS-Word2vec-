eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg This appears to be a family owned restaurant.  The food is very very good.  I had the lunch buffet.  It didn't have as much variety as some, but everything I tasted was fantastic.

They could make my review a 5 star review by communicating a little better.  Two suggestions:  1.  When you seat someone, ask them if they are there for the buffet.  If they are, tell them to pick up a plate and start.  2.  Sometime during the lunch, let the customer know that they just need to pay at the register when they are done.  I waited for a check that wasn't coming.
