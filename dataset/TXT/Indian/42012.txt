qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA This place has been one of my favorites hangout spots for a while now. Food and drinks are ok but price is better than most places and I usually always enjoy the ambiance. Good music, fun servers/bartenders. 

I am not sure if today was just a bad day for the servers  or maybe its their first time in the industry but service was horrible.  When we were trying to get the servers attention, to ask for the napkins they did not bring, she kept trying to look away. Not very subtlety.  Finally she brings us 1 see through napkin! We are 2 people eating nachos. Next servers walks by grabs our plate of food without asking if we are done or even if we need anything else. 

I will honestly not be going back.
