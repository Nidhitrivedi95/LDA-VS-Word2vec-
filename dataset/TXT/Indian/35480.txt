MVLQkoWx-uHFVyOBBFfvyQ Did a quick takeaway for a veggie curry and was surprised by a fairly Indian taste. Right amount of spices, well made curry ticked all the right boxes. I am reserving my rating to four stars and would soon go back to have lunch. I am hopeful that it turns to a five star. Definitely recommended.
