yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw My husband and I decided to celebrate my birthday a little early. We had received a Groupon for the Dhaba as a Christmas gift and decided to use it on 01-01-13. 
  Upon walking into to nearly empty restaurant, we were seated and told our server would be with us. Once she discovered we had the Groupon, she told us they didn't accept them on this day because it was a holiday. We promptly left.
  Once in our car we checked the Groupon and discovered that New Year's Day was not one of the days listed as a day the coupon would not be accepted. So what the heck?
  This is our second time at the Dhaba. After receiving shoe-leather lamb and being told it was always cooked that way, we almost didn't want to give it a second chance. After not being able to use a perfectly good coupon on day not listed in the fine print, we will not be returning to the Dhaba. 
  We'll eat at Star of India on Chandler Blvd. instead. The lamb there is cooked to perfection.
