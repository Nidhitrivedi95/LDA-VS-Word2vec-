Bu1SgnZblQhE345j3GlzUg We ordered the popcorn chicken tikka, saag paneer, chicken vindaloo, and lamb, along with garlic naan and potato kulcha. Food came out quickly and tasted amazing. The server was attentive and friendly. They also have a good selection of wine and liquor, and a separate dessert menu with dishes you wouldnt expect at an Indian restaurant (I recommend the sizzling brownie). Overall, it was great.
Ps. Be careful when asking for the chicken vindaloo to be spicy. It's WAY spicier than you would think.
