xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w I've ordered here on Grubhub a few times and always enjoyed it, but today we finally went to the restaurant and it was Awesome! Everything that we have ever ordered has been top notch, and the experience at the restaurant was even better then we had expected it to be. The Garlic Naan is a must, we like to dip it in the Tomato soup which is amazing. We also love the Fried spicy cauliflower, ginger chicken, dosa, and of course the staples like Biryani and Tikka Masala. Another nice thing about this place is that they have a full bar, which is rare for an Indian restaurant. They have a weekend buffet which is next on our list! Anyways, prices are very reasonable, service is great, and food can't be beat! Check it out!!!
