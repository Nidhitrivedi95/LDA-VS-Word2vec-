ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA First time dining here and we were not disappointed. We tried this place out bc of the total number of reviews which were mostly positive. We ordered the garlic naan and the Kashmiri naan. Both were very tasty! Entrees included chicken tikki masala and the lamb rogan josh with medium spice for both. The dishes had just the right amount of heat. Service was very good too. We will definitely come back again.
