LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This is so far the best place for dosa .... we drove an hour to get to this place .. and it was extremely worth it . 
Loved all the dishes it was so fresh ... which was way way better than the other south indian dishes I had in for example sarvana bhawan those guys suck .... 
Keep up the good work guys...
