uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA We were really hungry and called ahead. After making sure it was open, we reached there to find a restaurant with a nice ambience and a very pleasant hostess. Order taken quickly and food arrived quickly. Most everything we ordered was delicious. The schezewan fried rice, chana batura, gobi manchurian were great. Dosa not too great. Very attentive hostess who came and chatted with us and kept checking on us. Great experience. Will definitely go again.
