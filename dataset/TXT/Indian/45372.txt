s8N66BJ9P-sqhisX47o1Sg Ordered a whole spread for a group of us for takeaway. 

They claim to make Indian food. They do not. 

Every meal plate was 90% rice, 10% order. Told me it would be 45 minutes to ready... Took just shy of two hours, not to mention luke warm upon arrival. 

Food was bland. Wouldn't save it for leftovers - and I love leftovers. 

Total disappointment, would find it very hard to go back.
