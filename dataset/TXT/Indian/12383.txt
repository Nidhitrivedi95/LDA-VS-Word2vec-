I've been a regular at this place simple because of the lack of indian options in the area, and everytime I go, I've found myself promising never to go again. The staff has the worst attitude I've seen in any restaurant at Charlotte. The buffet timings keep changing everyday - and the staff will heckle you consistently to speed up your eating. 

The absolute last straw was last weekend - when I was told be a staff member, that the buffet closes at in half an hour, but the entire buffet spread was already exhausted! On requesting that the spread be refill - I was told the kitchen is already closed! Serving an empty buffet? 

On another date, I was served Dosas instead of Naans, since the Tandoor was broken down. And the staff didn't bother informing customers that they cannot supply 'bread' on the buffet, before they rudely find out themselves! 

This place is best avoided. The only thing I can thank Nirvana is about is pushing me to join Yelp and post a review. Bad service, Below Average food. Thumbs down!
