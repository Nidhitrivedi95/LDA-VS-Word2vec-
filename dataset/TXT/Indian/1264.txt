-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg t serves one of the worst south Indian food in USA. It used to be good few years ago but now it has become really bad both in quality of food and service. 

One can smell the stink from the restrooms as one enters the restaurant. Yes, it literally stinks.  The place has poor hygiene standards and the food inspectors should really pay a visit here and place a hefty fine / shut down the place. 

The vadas feel like they have been re-fried 10 times and are about 10 days old.  Dosas are full of soda bicarb and leave a horrible aftertaste. The potatoes inside were stale. The place is badly in need of renovation. 

Orders are often messed up and the waiters are "ruthless" as they literally throw the food on the table. They are unclean. If you get a peep into the kitchen behind the cash counter, I assure you you will never reenter just as like we wont ever go back. 

There are better Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Look elsewhere.
