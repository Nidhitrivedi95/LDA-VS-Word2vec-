Positives:
The buffet menu is reasonably priced.
The location is excellent, in the "restaurant row" on King St W., close to theatres and concert venues. 
They have a food assortment of vegetarian and non-vegeratian dishes, some of them are quite good. 

Negatives: The space is crammed with tables, no space to move, no space to walk; there is only one foot or so between the buffet and the first row of tables. I was not seated at one of the tables next to the buffet, otherwise my review would have been 2 stars... 
The food is not the best, lamb is mostly bones, cheese (paneer) not creamy, naan not fresh, too much mayo in the coleslaw salad.
The staff not very friendly (or too busy), they don't refill dishes half an hour before the buffet closes (even if they take new guests). Nobody asked me if I want something from the bar. 
Only few options for cold starters and deserts. (I am comparing with Kama, which is not far away).
The restaurant looks like a foodcourt, a big room with lots of light and square tables. Not much Indian decor, no booths, no soft chairs. 
It is quite hard to find parking. If you find it will cost you at least $4/hour.

I will probably try the dinner menu one day and update my review.
