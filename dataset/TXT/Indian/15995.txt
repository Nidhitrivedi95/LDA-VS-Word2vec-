dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q Yeah not bad. The buffet was quite fresh. The salads were yummy. The food was a bit watered down and lack the spice you might expect from an Indian place. But for the lighter at heart Indian food lovers this is the place for you. The servers were super sweet. The atmosphere is lovely. And the patio was like a cottage dock. 
All in all a good place to come back to
