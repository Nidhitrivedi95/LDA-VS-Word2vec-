LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Today was our first visit and it was prompted by all of the positive reviews.  Sunday evening it was not crowded at all and the server told us that evenings are not nearly as busy as lunchtime.  We ordered buttered naan bread, samosas, chicken vindaloo with basmati rice and lamb biryani.  Everything was excellent!  Just the right amount of spice, generous servings and unlimited refills of our diet cokes.  The service was prompt and pleasant and the chef even came out to say hello and ask if everything was to our liking.  No issues at all.  Will definitely go back.  Didn't give a 5 star simply because the restaurant itself lacks a bit of ambiance, but other than that 5 stars for the food and service!
