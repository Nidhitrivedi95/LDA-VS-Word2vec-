JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Amazing buffet, one of the best Indian ones I've been to. Most Indian buffets I've been to are fairly small and feature ok food, but the selection here is not only bigger, but also much tastier and an excellent value for the quality and price they charged. The crisp bread, a fried spongy dessert, and several of the curries were among my favorites, along with a refreshing drink at the buffet with spices in it. The waiter also gave us complimentary naan and dosa.
