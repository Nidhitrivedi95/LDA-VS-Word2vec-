-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw This place is great. I didn't realize there was a food stand inside, but glad I found out. This is right next to Zia Records and they sell all types of indian spices you usually can't find anywhere else. 

The lady behind the food counter is very nice and after 1 visit they recognized me and even knew what I liked to eat. The food is all made fresh and has the home feel taste to it. This place is better than most restaurants out there and much cheaper too. We bought a large sized portion of the beans and it lasted for 3 days. They also provide free tea which usually cost $2 in restaurants.

The good thing is it's very close to Mt. Everest, our favorite indian restaurant, if you wanted to eat out. 

9/10 good, friendly service.
