BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ My husband and I went to this restaurant for a prix fixe groupon.  We had veg samosas, which were a little dry, but okay. For entrees, we had butter chicken and aloo gobi.  Both were very good. You have the option to choose how spicy you want your meal.  We went with medium, but next time, we'll probably go for spicy. We were entitled to dessert, but we were SO FULL we skipped it this time.

We will go back - especially since they offered to let us do the prix fixe option again next time for the same Groupon price. Pretty clever of them. We went for standard Indian fare this round - I'd like to try some of the Nepalese specialties next time.
