GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Went here and got the Prawn Vindaloo. It packs a decent punch and the flavor is wonderful. I paired it up with a pesto naan and could not be happier. Everything I've tried here has been amazing and I will keep coming back every now and then to dine! Their chicken tikka masala and lamb is always great as well. If you're a fan of curry I would definitely give this place a try! Their mango ice cream had a very subtle flavor and was a pleasure to try as well.
