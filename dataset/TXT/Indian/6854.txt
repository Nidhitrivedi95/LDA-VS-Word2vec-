4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw Place is little old may be thats the reason most people get negative feelings before they try the food. Only thing me and my family care about the quality and most vegas indian restaurant dont have modern decorations. They all look indian to me.. But this place as much as i want to give them 4star, taste of their food change my mind to 5. Love their Goat (mutton) Biriani and Lamb vidaloo. I know even you turn on the air condition in vegas, most places still hot inside and this place has the same problem. we always try this place.
