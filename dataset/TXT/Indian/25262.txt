hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q Went  for the second time, food is excellent and the menu is large. Had the medium level of spice and it was great, although some in our party of four felt it very spicy. Had the specialty dishes which are served with rice and can be shared with others in your party. As far as price, maybe a little high, but go to the website and get a half off second entrée coupon to print! Very clean, great parking and good service.
