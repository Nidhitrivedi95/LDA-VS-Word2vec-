YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA The place looks nice, ambience is good but the staff and food is worse. We ordered some food and a mango lassi,  totalled upto some $87 which already had an additional surcharge.

So here is where they are bad: The mango lassi was just mango puree with water, when I said that this doesn't taste like make lassi, just after a sip as there was no yogurt in it and it was very thin in consistency I was given a lecture n argument that this how its been made for 16 years. So I told them to please take it back as I dont like it n they did (looking at me in rage). Then they brought us the food, which first of all is like not worth the money coz there is no justifiable quality or quantity. Plus to take revenge the staff added so much red chilli powder on top that we had stomach burns right from the very first bite, so requested them to change it n they said it will still be charged n to taunt us one of thier other servers kept commenting I hope you are enjoying the food (when u can taste the difference that whether the food is cooked with or has chilli powder added just on top) 

Its not at all good for Indian people as you would straight away know how they are fooling people.

Will never go back there even if I was given free food.
