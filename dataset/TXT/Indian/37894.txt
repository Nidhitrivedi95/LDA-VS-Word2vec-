The food here is good... if you are expecting classic Indian food, you will be a bit surprised with this menu!  I found the dishes to be a bit more playful and modern compared to the classics I have eaten tons of times.  Kebab menu was a treat!

I thought the flavor of the food to be good, but both times I ordered a dish spicy it came out rather bland for my tastes.  The Samosas were great as were the chutneys.  

In terms of service, we had a pretty lackluster experience... and they were out of a lot of the beer selections--definitely not cool.
