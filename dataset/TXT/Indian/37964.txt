ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I really don't understand where all the hype is coming from, while it was decent, it is nowhere near 4 star status.  

I thought that the prices were pretty expensive during lunch.  We went on a Saturday lunch and they didn't offer any specials, except for the $30 Prix fixe meal for two.  

The food was okay, but I expected a fuller, richer flavor as the items seemed a bit bland to me for Indian food.  One of the chicken items tasted like Orange chicken from panda express and the other chicken dish used so much yogurt in it that it completely drowned out the spices, not to mention the impending bloating (dang Asian lactose intolerance genes!).  The rice wasn't aromatic like other basmati rice that I've had and the naan was a bit too thick for my tastes as I like 'em thin and crispy.

I checked in on yelp and received a free appetizer, but the waiter gave me a little bit of flak for it because they said it wasn't on their system.  I was NOT about to pay $15 for 3 small pieces of dry lamb chop.  He finally conceded after tasting some of my Chinese haggling skills.

I probably wouldn't come back, there's a whole bunch of other options in Vegas to eat at.
