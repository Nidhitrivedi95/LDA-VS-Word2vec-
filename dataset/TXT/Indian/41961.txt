qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Red room is what it is. An extremely affordable, University student hang-out with an eclectic menu to please everyone's palate. 

For less than $15, you can find yourself with an entree and beer/rail. The food is tasty enough, and mostly Asian influenced with sandwiches, and pastas sprinkled through.

I still visit occasionally because of the relaxed environment personally. It's dim and relaxed, a great first or last point of destination for any time of day
(Great for breakfast as well).
