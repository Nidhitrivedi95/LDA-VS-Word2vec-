xMhpJZaj4QT1Soh76-E2CA I'm new to the world of indian food, but I'm super excited to try everything on the menu here at feast of dilli. The chicken 65 was my favourite of the 4 dishes we've had so far - and the apps have all been great too! I can't speak to the authenticity, but I can speak to how friendly and inviting the owner is, and how delicious the food was! Awesome to have on the Browns line strip, best of luck from a new regular customer!
