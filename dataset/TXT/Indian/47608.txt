TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I can't say I'm an expert on Indian cuisine but this is my fav spot in Las Vegas. I know the location is questionable at best but the food is worth it. Best Naan in town. Saag Paneer, Chicken Tiki Masala and Vegetable Korma are great. Lunch buffet is $10 but it's a great way to try an assortment of what they have to offer. The place is small but it adds to the ambiance.
