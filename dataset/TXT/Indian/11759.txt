aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q I am definitely a fan of Indies for a quick lunch... Their schedule is sporadic, but Kabob House is right there if they are closed.  They are incredibly sweet, and I love that they'll make fresh naan for you!  

Yes, the food is pre-cooked, but it's a healthy portion for a great price!
