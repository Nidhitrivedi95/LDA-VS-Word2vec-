auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ This was the WORST dining experience I've ever had in my life. Service was BEYOND shitty and the place wasn't even busy at all! I'm a patient diner. I understand what it's like to be in the service industry but there was just no excuse for the way this place was run. Number one we stood there for five minutes waiting to even be greeted, finally got a table and looked over the menu. 

We ordered tandoori chicken, goat curry and a side of rice. Oh and a bottle of wine that we never got. Our waiter asked if we wanted our chicken first or with the meal, we asked for it with the meal but guess what? We got it first. The chicken was really good I'll give them that. But the curry? Oh my god. So disgusting. There were chopped up bones in it which was NOT indicated on the menu. I almost threw up. Our waiter never even came back our entire meal. We had to literally flag him down to get our check. 

Sooooo disappointed. Would NEVER return here. Seriously wish I could give zero stars.
