9MpWhQOYziJ38EB7MctxcA When I was prego I was craving indian food so my husband and I went here! This did not fulfill my craving at all!  The food was bland and The portions were so small and it was super expensive for what you got!! I wish it was better Bc if it was I would be there all the time! Also the reasturant looked like a ghost town!
