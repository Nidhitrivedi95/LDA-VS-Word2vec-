TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We had dinner here a few weeks ago. The taste of the food was excellent. However, what was very disappointing was the portion size of the dishes. We had garlic naan which was good and an eggplant dish and chicken tikka masala. The chicken was cut in chunks and there were barely enough pieces to equal one chicken breast. No exaggeration! Same with the eggplant--barely enough to share with another person. Buffet lunch may be a better deal. Extremely disappointing for such good food and high ratings. No future visits here.
