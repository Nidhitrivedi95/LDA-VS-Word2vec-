uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Sher-E-Punjab is an underrated, somewhat upscale Indian restaurant on Toronto's Danforth strip. Recently renovated and re-opened for about 2 months now, this classic mainstay has been located at 351 Danforth Ave since the 1990s.

IMG_4375The Good: They make a mean cocktail with homemade chili-infused vodka that has marinated at least 4 hours. The beverage, mixed with lime juice, soda, and mint leaves, took a good ten minutes to make but was served with utmost care. A lot of time and effort went into making this drink, and it was probably the best alcoholic beverage I've had out in a while. The sizzling tikka ($13) came out super hot, with perfectly moist and spiced chicken paired with sizzling, crispy peppers and onions that had an ideal amount of crunch. The naan was a warm and comforting side dish as we sat in a comfortable booth looking out at quaint shops along the Danforth.

The Bad: Our favourite Indian dish and the cuisine's staple, butter chicken, was thoroughly delicious, but did not quite top of list as the best we've ever had. We think Eglinton's Mount Everest restaurant beats them on this dish marginally.

Overall: Sher-E-Punjab is an unexpected, yet delightful Indian dining experience. Though seemingly unassuming from the outside, its trendy atmosphere, delicious handcrafted cocktails, and the slow-cooked homestyle food is simply amazing. I don't give many places stellar reviews, but this is truly a hidden gem in Toronto's multi-cultural food scene.

The Crowd: Kind of dead on a Sunday evening at 8:30pm, but 3 other 30-something couples.

Pricing: $5-9 for appetizers, $6-11 for alcoholic beverages, and $9-13 for entrees, except for a $28 lamb chops dish
