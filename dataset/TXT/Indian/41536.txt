q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw I went there last night and had the chicken biryani and a chicken appetizer that both were excellent. I ordered my biryani spicy, and it was done just right for my tastes. There was plenty for two people to share, but it was too good to do so. The waitress and the cook both spoke with me and treated me like a king. I will happily go back and try everything else on the menu.
