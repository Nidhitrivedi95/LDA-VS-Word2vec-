bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug I had beef with black bean and green pepper, sweet and sour chicken, and egg fried rice. It was all tasty, especially the chicken. We were ordering to take away and even though they were very busy we waited less than 10 min. The portions are enormous. We paid 21 dollars for the two of us and we have enough leftovers for another 2 or 3 meals!
