NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Great chipotle model applied to Indian food. Good selection of meats and sides. Food is flavorful though less spicy than a more traditional ethnic restaurant. Service is prompt and cafeteria style. Decor is modern, comfortable and family friendly. Prices were similar to other higher end fast food places. Parking was ample and free.
