GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw I tried the lunch buffet, and it exceeded my expectations. I kinda stumbled upon it while walking from Encore on my way to Jack in the Box to try the famous deep fried tacos.  Since Jack in the Box was farther away than I thought, I'm sure glad I opted for this instead.

Great value, ambiance, service, selection, and taste.  There were only a few of us there, including tourists from India who seemed very satisfied.  

The buffet included fresh naan, which was the best I've had in a very long time; a salad bar; deserts; soup; spring rolls; mini bhaji, pakora, and samosas; great vegetarian and chicken options; and curried goat. 

Completely satisfying and will go again.
