zd4UKCoCc6P1305dummwyQ Update- Indian Curry bowl has decreased the quantity and quality of their menu over the past five months. I'm sure it is because they are having a difficult time staying afloat. I've started making my own Indian food now because it's cheaper, faster, and I can control the quality of the ingredients. This is  really sad to write, but I have to be honest.
