m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw I've had the pleasure of eating at Kohinoor a few times now and it's all been exceptional. The restaurant is so close to my office that sometimes I can smell the curry. 

The service has always been great. The very first time we stopped to give it a try was the day after winter's first big snow. Town was slushy and crazy and we wanted something warm and comforting for lunch. So we parked and proceeded in, but noticed they were closing soon (they take a break between lunch and dinner rushes). We didn't want to be a pain for the staff so we got back in the car. As we were driving off a waitress ran us down and insisted we come inside for lunch. She said, "If you're hungry, we'll feed you!" I was so impressed. I've waited tables for years and I don't think I ever insisted someone stay past my shift (haha). It was a little awkward because we were the only table in there, but the food was great and they kept us happy. 

The third time I went was a Friday night and they were absolutely packed. The kitchen was much slower than normal getting the food out, but the staff went table to table offering complimentary appetizers to help ease the waiting period. It was very generous and brilliant damage control. But the wait was well worth it because when the food got to our table it was delicious. 

Yea the menu is almost identical to Sitara, but Kohinoor just feels different to me. I much prefer the dinning atmosphere and the close proximity to downtown. The staff at Sitara was always helpful, but Kohinoor workers seem more genuine - if that makes sense.
