7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA I had lunch buffet today along with a group of 15 from work. The food selection was decent where you could at least try the most popular or familiar ones. Tandoori chicken was the best I've tried. Very flavourful and juicy. Others like mutton, paneer, were at par with other buffet places nearby like Kama. Food is spicier that Kama but only mild so need not worry. Naan is very good too. Service was a bit slower in terms of taking our used plates but I don't mind taking them near to their kitchen. Perhaps selection would be quite limited for vegetarians. Below $20 so pretty good. Mango lassi drink highly recommended.
