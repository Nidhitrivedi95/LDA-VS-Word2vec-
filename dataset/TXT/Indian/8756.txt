Sure, you'll find better options elsewhere in the city, but if you're seeing a movie or happen to be downtown around lunch time and you're craving some butter chicken, rogan joshi, or saag paneer, you could do much worse than Aroma.

If I have any one complaint, it's that the seating is a bit tight; given how popular it tends to be, they would do well to lose the traditional, over-the-top, 1940s style "fine dining" veneer, get some better tables, and modern up the space.
