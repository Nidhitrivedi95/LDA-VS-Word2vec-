qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA Have only come here on weekdays for their specials - 4$ drinks! Located on Spadina very close to the University of Toronto campus - it's kind of grungy but it definitely has charm. They also serve some Vietnamese food, in contrast to their pub decor. Lots of character, personable staff!
