8PZGCtgG5MZKvz9i3B9gCA I came her for the first time and to be honest I was very disappointed with this place, food was awful, the new menu is nothing great. I had the chilly dog and to be honest i never had something as bad as that, the seasoning was overpowering and super greasy,i also got a chic-pea rap which was horrible, i don't understand how this place has such good reviews !! Come on people do you know what good food is ??
