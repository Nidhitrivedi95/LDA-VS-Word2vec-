a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g We had the Pani Puri plate which was $5.00 and some mithai sweets for which were pretty great. Portion of pani puris was pretty low for the price. Tamarind chutney was on point, however the coriander chutney extremely watery. Prices have gone up significantly I notice than years back when I was here with family. 

Gerrard Street East has significantly changed and not for the better. Ages ago it was so lively! Indian music playing on street corners, almost half a dozen vendors grilling corn on the sidewalks. I saw a pub and a Hakka Chinese place tonight that have set up shop, on the street full of Indian restaurants it's very out of place. Good news, Lahore was filled to the masses at least.
