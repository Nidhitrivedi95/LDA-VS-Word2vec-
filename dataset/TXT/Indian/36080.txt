NSaTps4xn23kPyGzjrMa4Q Okay folks this is the place where you can get Pakistani samosas at its best. I was hoping for a place to open up near heartland. Indian samosas are good but they are not the same, the only other location in mississauga used to be Pak sweets but that is too far. I was told the owner of Bismillah used to to work with Pak sweets and then split up and opened up this place in Heartland.

I have been coming here for quiet a while you get both the veg and non veg samosas. The samosas are nice, crispy, crunchy and have a nice kick to it. They also sell various sweets/ Methae, Namak para (Namak para is a crunchy savoury snack of Pakistan) and Pakoras. All goodness!!!

This place is always super busy, has few seats  and they only accept cash or debit. 

For my Muslim folks - the non veg samosas are halal
