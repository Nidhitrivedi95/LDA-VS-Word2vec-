Vp8Dkam_Hv204Or0hul1NQ One of the better Indian restaurants in the city. The Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Tandoori Kulfi (dessert) and Lassi (drink) in this restaurant are very unique and authentic in this place. The popular Indian dishes like Matar Paneer, etc. are all available in the restaurant and are pretty good too.

The servers are a nice family who are very attentive and friendly.
