Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg This place has the best Indian food that I have had in town. The flavors are amazing. I appreciate the small restaurant setting. The service is super great, with the owner of the place often being there and checking on your table. The cauliflower appetizer, Dahl, and all the other vegetarian options I've had are great! Lunch was reasonably priced. Dinner is more expensive, but there's plenty to take home. #hopefulregular
