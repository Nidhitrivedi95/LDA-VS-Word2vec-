s6IPjR2nSJqhXcGJ49Ckiw I had high hopes - as a lover of hakka food - this was not close to being decent.  In fact, the noodles might as well have been spaghetti noodles.  The beef had a ton of fat.

As for the Indian food - I tried the rasmalai - clearly they have bought frozen pre-made deserts and are not making it themselves.

That said - I am still missing Lucky Chinese - and I am on the hunt for a good Hakka restaurant downtown.  

I wish Sutra the best - as it must be hard to start a new restaurant - but get a new chef and take more pride in the ingredients you choose.

Best of luck
