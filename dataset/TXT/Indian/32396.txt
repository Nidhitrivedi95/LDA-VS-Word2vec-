LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw A hole in wall place for Indian and Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh. I walked into this place when exploring the strip district.

I got the chicken Tikka masala meal with the rice pudding as desert. 
- big portion size
- loved the butter Nan
- Chicken was a bit hard 
- loved the rice pudding. 


If you are in Pittsburgh strip district give this place a shot.
