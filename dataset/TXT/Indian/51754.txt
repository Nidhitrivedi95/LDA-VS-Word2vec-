UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA After a long day at a convention at the Las Vegas Convention Center, my husband and I we looking for a nearby restaurant off-the-Strip (we needed to decompress from an excited, yet stressful day).  Fortunately, we found Mint Indian Bistro, a mile south of the LVCC.  We shared the Indian Sampler (around $30), which was incredibly flavorful and delicious.  Our friendly servers, Rajeev and Biru (who are from Nepal), gave us a lesson on the similarities and differences between Nepalese and Indian cuisines...something we found intriguing!  When we're traveling, we typically like to try different restaurants during our stay.  However, we made an exception and came back to try Mint Indian Bistro's all-you-can-eat buffet the next day...Rajeev's and Biru's hospitality coupled with the food we enjoyed made that an easy choice.

When I return to Vegas, I'll definitely come back to Mint Indian Bistro! :-)
