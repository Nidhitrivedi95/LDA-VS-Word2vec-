3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA People who say that this is a good Indian restaurant have never eaten Indian before!! Seriously! I have eaten at Indian restaurants all over the U.S. I get it if the food is lil less spicy and all but the food here is completely tasteless. As if you are eating some kind of mashed taste less stuff. We tried the buffet and seriously we didn't like a single item. And not only that we had severe stomach ache after few minutes, maybe it was the baking soda or something I have no clue. I would say do yourself a favor and don't go to this place!
