MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw Amazing food, amazing ambiance, amazing service, amazing layout and decor. One of the finest Indian cuisines with first-class quality in food and appearance. We ordered the Bharwan Aloo Potohari as an appetizer which was absolutely delicious. Definitely recommended for anyone. For the main course we ordered the Shahi Kadhi Paneer and Malai Kofta with Tandoori and Roomali Roti. The curries were finger-licking worthy and you could taste the freshness in the ingredients. Nothing like the generic Punjabi food in other restaurants. The Roomali Roti was very soft but too buttery for my taste and I could do without it next time. The serving sizes were moderate, good enough for my family of three. There were 4 Rotis / basket. Price was slightly expensive however you don't feel the guilt once you taste the food. Overall, an amazing place with a very classy feel and outstanding food. Nice to see such original Indian food here.
