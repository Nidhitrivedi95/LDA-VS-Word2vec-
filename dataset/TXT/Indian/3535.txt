0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ This place is my go to Hakka chinese place. I love love love their food so much that 9/10 times I get take out, its from here. 

The owner is very friendly and involved in the business, and you can definitely taste this in the food. We usually order the manchurian noodles, the manchurian pokara style with gravy and the paneer chilli with gravy. The dishes with gravy come with alot of plain rice. If you arent a spice lover like me , they're very accommodating and can tone the heat down. The portions are average sized, can feed up to 4 people. 

The only complain I have about this place is the size of the restaurant itself. It is a very small place, and is often packed. Sometimes the waits are long, and I have had to wait (impatiently) for almost half an hour to an hour depending on the day. However, once seated the service is fast and the servers are all very friendly. And the crispiness of the manchurian (which you wont get with the takeout) is totally worth it! 

10/10 would recommend this place to anyone who loves the flavour bomb that is Hakka chinese food.
