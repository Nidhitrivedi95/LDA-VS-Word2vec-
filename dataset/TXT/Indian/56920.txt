xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I order the green chli taco. Still as good as I remember. I do miss the old location on 7th ave. the new place has an awkward layout and  the tables are all mismatched. Also the fry bread taco did seam a bit smaller than I had before at the old location.  The food is great though and it you don't mind a weird dining area then I recommend
