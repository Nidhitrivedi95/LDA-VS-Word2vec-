SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Went here for dinner with the boyfriend last night. We've been a little underwhelmed by the food choices in Vegas during our trip, especially for the inflated price. So, I looked up places a little off the beaten path and found this. It was definitely worth it! I got the Chicken Makhani dinner and he got the Non-vegetarian Thali, both were delicious and came with a huge piece of naan. For about $20 a person it was the best dinner we've had so far and more food than we could finish. Our waiter was very attentive and the food came out quickly. The good news is it's only half a block from the SLS station on the monorail so it's easy to get to. The semi-bad news is that the area is a little sketchier than you might like. Either way i'd happily visit again!
