02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Three words: chicken tikka masala. I've been to many Indian restaurants before and after eating here and no one even COMPARES to the chicken tikka here. We go for the buffet pretty much only for tikka masala! We ALWAYS receive extraordinary service, and the waiters always bring fresh, hot naan to us within minutes of arriving. ONLY complaint is that when we first started coming here years ago, there was actual cheese in the palak paneer. No more. There also used to be pistachios on the rice dessert. No more. I understand they may be trying to keep the price low, but I'd rather pay a little more and have the palak paneer made correctly. We will keep coming back and driving from Chandler because this place is always on point. Support your local businesses!
