2ph-6k3mXY93TLDCteC6IQ We got a lot more food than we were expecting based on the prices; be prepared for super sized portions for surprisingly few dollars!

That said, service was very friendly and quick (although I would have appreciated a heads up on the quantity of food that we unwittingly ordered instead of a good humored laugh when we asked for a to-go box). 

The food was solidly good & appreciated that they have a variety of Indian desserts.
