RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Royal Indian Bistro is located within Rio All Suites Hotel & Casino, just west of "the Strip" in southern Las Vegas.  I had the pleasure of enjoying some chicken tikka masala for dinner during a recent trip for a convention.

The restaurant is clean, the service is attentive, and the food is quite good.  Like most Indian cuisine establishments, you can select your level of spice.  I asked for a "shade" under "medium."  The dish was very flavorful, but I probably could have tolerated a shade above medium.  Every chef is different, so I usually ask for just under a medium spice level when testing an Indian or Thai restaurant that is new to me.

The chicken was perfectly done, and very tender.  The tikka masala sauce had great consistency and flavor - not too creamy, as it sometimes can be encountered.  The Basmati rice was perfectly cooked, and had some fresh peas atop, but lacked diced carrot.  The buttered naan was good, and not overly done, as I've found some places leave it on one side a tad too long, and it gets burnt - I didn't experience that here.

I had bottled water with my meal, which was a bit pricey; but food in Las Vegas isn't cheap anymore if you're on or anywhere close to the strip.  

Everything at this restaurant is a la carte.  With tip, my meal was a tad over $40.

Would I come back?  Absolutely, if I'm staying at the Rio, I'll definitely drop in for dinner again; and maybe even lunch too.
