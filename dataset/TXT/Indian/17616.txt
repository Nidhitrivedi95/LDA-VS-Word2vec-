DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ Butter Chicken for just around $5 is the lunch special on Friday.
it's the best! (I even go there after work to bring it home for Dinner.)
fast service, great food, low low prices: for $4 to $5 you can get rice and a bhatura, pickled onion, and a main (meat or veg) which sure to fill you up. 
(instead of getting fast food and paying $7 to $8 and filled up with soft drinks.)

I love the Mix-Veg, or Aloo-Gobi as my main dish, you won't miss the meat.
if you are meat eater, butter chicken, or the goat curry would be a great dish to try.
