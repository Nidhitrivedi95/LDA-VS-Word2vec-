I3YOFwPRQB_bSY3NDUyJNw A wonderful restaurant for fresh dosas!  My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting this restaurant.  We were warmly greeted by the owner, and he made recommendations based on our preferences.  The dosas were freshly made and tasted delicious.  

I have been to Guru Lukshmi many times, and I must say that the dosas at Kalpataru were superior!  

Strongly recommend that you visit this restaurant, and try the dosas!  The lassi drinks are delicious too.  

Enjoy!!
