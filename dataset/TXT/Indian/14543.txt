c65l1HepL-5Zqh_2fJ7ezw The Baigan Bharta Roti described as "Chargrilled eggplant tempered with Indian spices" is not as advertised. I love love love baigan bharta, it's one of my favorite dishes. What I got was a weird yellow super creamy gravy with potoaes and peas and no trace (in flavour or colour) of eggplant. So heavy on the cream that for me it was not edible.(disclosure I'm not at all a fan of cream heavy dishes). I called to complain and they just told me that the 'eggplant is pureed'. Yes I know this. I've eaten variations of this dish literally a thousand times in every Indian restaurant in the city and surrounding area. I did not enjoy this variation. The description on the menu needs to be revised. The roti was also a bit underdone and the filling very liquidy causing the roti to be slimey. 

The cauliflower appetizer was good. The the dal roti and mixed veg korma roti were also good.
