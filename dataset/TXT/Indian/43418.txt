rnEsf4rD5a_BuaJysOezCQ Food: Decent. Nothing that you'd call excellent. Does have some non-typical Indian food, with paninis and wraps. The paneer tikka and chicken tikka paninis are good, but I personally have never liked the wraps or the puffs. Didn't taste as if they were too fresh.

Desserts: Awesome! if you're coming here, you have to try out the tiramisu. Don't expect it to be as good as an upscale joint, but it is still pretty good, and worth the price. Had it not been for the cakes and desserts, I'd have rated this place 3 stars instead of 4.

Overall: One of the decent places in the University City area, but might end up being kinda hit-or-miss.
