jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Oh so delicious! Rich, complex, subtle, colorful Indian flavors. YUMMM.

And such wonderful, cheerful, gracious service from Nikita. Everything she recommended was spot on great.

The one criticism I have is that it's a little hard to locate, being on the second floor, next to a hookah lounge, and the signage could be much clearer.

But once we arrived it was wonderful all the way.

The menu is a little overwhelming with so many delicious choices. [Nice problem to have!] I literally could eat here 3 times a week for 6 months and never have the same thing. 

I ended up getting the spinach paneer and a lamb curry. Wifey, a picky  vegetarian, got something just as delicious. And she was able to enjoy the paneer, too. I'm carnivorrific, but I could eat Indian  vegetarian forever and be happy.

And THE VIEW! It's really cool being across from the airport on the second floor. I couldn't stop watching the big ol' jet airliners landing and taking off.

Even the ToGo containers are the best, those little Tupperware bins that won't leak on the way home and can be used again and again.

Go to this place!!!! It's great!
