3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Have ordered take out twice, butter chicken looks and tastes different more like what your grand ma will make in the kitchen with her authentic recipe. The spices in chicken biryani were over powering, tasted good the next day.
Garlic naan is huge, keep that in mind before ordering :) 
Take out service is quick and courteous.
