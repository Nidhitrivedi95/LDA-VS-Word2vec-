3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw I remember this place from a visit in 2011 and I remember the food being great.  Now it is just average.  For $22 per person the buffet is not cheap.  They have three stations: salads, vegetarian and meat.  There aren't too many items in each.  You won't go hungry - what's there is enough, but don't expect a huge variety. 

The butter chicken was overly sweet.  The fish curry was very good.  I liked their garlic naan (not all you can eat).  That's pretty much it.  The rest was unremarkable. The place is large and never full.  Service is good.
