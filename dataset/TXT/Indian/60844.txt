zvtkeghW0Px5HY9QkJ4INw We stopped here late last night. It was really cheap, especially with a student discount but I wasn't impressed when the guy there slopped my food in styrofoam and tossed it in the microwave. Also, my chai tea had lumps and crap in it. The samosas weren't too bad just really oily like everything else. We will never go here again.
