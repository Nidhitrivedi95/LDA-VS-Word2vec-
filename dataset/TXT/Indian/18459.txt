Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ The fam took me to Tich (what drama, figuring out how to pronounce it) last night for my birthday, and damn, I was not disappointed. Oh, and the parental units were concerned that they could not spy anyone who looked Indian working there, but their authenticity fears were quickly put to rest. 

Not only do they have a delicious veg section on their menu, they also have a veg 3 course option, which is nice. We opted to share many (oh, so many) dishes, and across the board, everyone was thrilled with every dish. For me, the evening's true hero was the garlic naan, but I'm weirdly devoted to white carbs and empty calories, so that's just me. 

I also loved the decor....rustic lighting and reclaimed wood feature walls get me right *here*. Kind of hipster-y I suppose, but we all secretly love that vibe. 

The service was excellent, if not a little formal at times (our server took himself very seriously), but overall beyond reproach. He really knew the menu, and was attentive and friendly. 5 stars for him, even though he forgot to take our drink order twice. So I had a dry birthday, which meant no hangover this morning - BONUS!

Side note: I brought my 13 month old daughter, and they had a high chair waiting for us at the table. It's not a kiddie restaurant, but it was surprisingly child-friendly. The music was a little loud, which muffled any complaining from the ankle-biter. ***sorry about all the pappadum bits on the floor, Tich!***

Highly recommend, and will defo return to this little Mimico treasure.
