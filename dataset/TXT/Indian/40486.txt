PQTtKaBK_WdvLm-zp4fQ1g So driving down Elliott I saw this  place  and decided to stop.  We sat down, and the guy was so nice and attentive. We shared the chicken tikka masala. It was sooooo delicious! The service was incredible, and wasn't to pricey. The spices were perfect, not too spicy. I will definitely be back to try their buffet!
