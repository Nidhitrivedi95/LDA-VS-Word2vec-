gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A So, we are in Vegas and wondering which is the best place to have some Indian food. We check Yelp and see the ratings and say sure.. Why not ? We reach there and as we try to push the door open, the door pushes back !! After a couple of minutes of intense trying and my worst Hulk imitation the door yields and we see a huge crowd in front of us. Just like back in India:( 

We wait for a few min to see if there is a chance to give our name to someone and then decide to order takeout. We suspected that the take out would be sooner than waiting to be seated. It's a small place not equipped to handle the crowd. People ended up waiting next to others table mentally wishing them to Finish soon so we can grab their seat!

We placed our order and got it about 90 min later. The chili chicken was average. The samosa had the distinct flavor of being refried. The oil from the veg noodles dripped out in the plastic and the chicken biryani was palatable.. Barely. For good measure they threw in some cut onions and lemon just before we left that was previously refused by a customer!

Now I understand why they call it Mount Everest. The effort needed to get in and eat the food with the ambiance provided makes the name quite apt. Wish Yelp had a no star option :/
