UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw We visited this restaurant on their opening day, and since then have been going again and again !!
Being vegetarians, their menu has a wide spread choice for us and everything tastes yummy yummy !
Lunch buffet has a many choices for appetizers, curries and desserts. they generally have a central piece special dish like Poori - Bhaji or Pav bhaji. Naan and Dosa served onto the table will be hot.

Nothing more to say.. Currently this ranks #1 in Taste, ambiance, service etc.. Thumbs up to this restaurant!!
