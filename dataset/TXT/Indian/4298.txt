1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw Found my new Indian place!! Affordable and delicious ! Very authentic !! I got the butter chicken garlic naan and samosa chaat  the bread was soooo good esp dipped into the utter chicken! Samosa chaat was to die for I just loved all the flavors!! Def coming here again ! And I love that everything was halal! The only down side is they don't know fluent English. We got by but I asked for extra cilantro on the side and they didn't understand but if that' the price I got to pay for delicious food I'm good !! The restaurant was clean which is also a big plus !! Def coming here again !
