pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I wish I could give this 2.5 stars. Anyway, I thought the curry was a little...watery? Runny?? Couldn't quite put my finger on it but it wasn't the creamy, scrumptious curry I am used to. It beats most other Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh but that doesn't say much. There's a lot to be desired. The naan was pretty good and my lassi was okay if a little thick for my liking. Not outstanding but not terrible either. (We did not do the buffet)
