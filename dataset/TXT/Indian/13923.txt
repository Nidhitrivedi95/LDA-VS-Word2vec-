BuC5gidaUkXs0YPZmvQexA When I'm missing South African pies I come here. They have a broad range of different flavours. They have an interesting Indian twist on some of the pies, such as tandoori chicken and butter chicken. My favorite is the steak and kidney pie. 

I've tried quite a few pies in Canada and gave up hope that I would find decent pies until I tried out this place. While this isn't quite as good as King pies or the local pies in South Africa, it is definitely worth a try. I'd recommended trying a few different flavours out to see which one you like the best.
