7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Had a bad experience in this restaurant. The Gobi Manchuria we had was over salted amd then we asked for the change of the dish, they did some changes to the same dish and gave us which had no change in it. Same agin bad experience with chicken 555, looked like the chicken was old stock which I sensed it when eating. Followed by, chicken fried rice and veg. Biriyani which were really dry, did not feel like eating biriyani. Think twice when going to this restaurant, the service is really bad!!!
