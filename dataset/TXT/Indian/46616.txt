svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w Ok I have to start with the fact that the food is awesome and cheap! and for that only I would rate this place as 5+ but the design and the look from outside is terrible and would hardly get a highest mark of 2....
honestly why is it soooo pink and sparkly? so cheesy? it doesn't carry indian spirit.... argh!

but oh the food! I've been to this place many times and will come again just to have the yummy dosas!
