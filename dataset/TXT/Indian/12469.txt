aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Tried the butter chicken burrito and it did not disappoint! 
Standard sized burrito stuffed with seasoned basmati rice, chick peas, bell peppers, and tender chicken, it was a quick and filling meal. I have a very low spice tolerance so I was sniffling away with my runny nose as I ate this, but it was worth it! The staff member who served me was also super friendly.
