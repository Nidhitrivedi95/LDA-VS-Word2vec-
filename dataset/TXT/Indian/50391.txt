UBv8heCQR0RPnUQG0zkXIQ My Greatgrandparents  were from India,so I grew up with this type of cuisine, and I must say,, this food is Exceptional!
My delicate palate was treated to a whirlwind of taste, spices and flavor
Boy am I glad I decided to give this fairly new spot a try, I have tried all the Indian Restaurants in Tempe and Scottsdale and a few in Phoenix, this is THE BEST food ever.
Attentive and Friendly Staff, I had the chicken Tika Masala, was better than ZAM ZAM in central phoneix, , they held the title for the last few years, the basmati rice was perfect,each rice grain separate and perfectly cooked,the dahl ( curried Lentil ) amazing and flavorful
This will be my go to from now, on for Chicken Tika Masala....
I was introduced to the chef, who is a 5 star restaurant chef from Hyderabad.
The Price on right on target, perfect location with a light rail stop, right there.
There will be lines out the door,once this place is discovered by the ASU faculty and students
YUM!
