BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ I have found the best Naan in town people!

I love the naan made in Delhi and made my peace with the fact that I could never find it here, until... I found Jaipur Grille!

The naan here is so good and I've tried it along with the Butter Chicken which is good, the Palak Paneer which is amazing and a Lamb dish whose name I'm forgetting. But trust me, this is one of the better Indian Restaurants and I find myself hardly disappointed with the choices. They also have the best Mango Lassi in town ;)

The service is great and the staff goes out of their way even if you order take out. Would definitely recommend this place!
