vwVoksbTKehDP8ZGUQaVfQ Every so often, we like to check out a different casual mom 'n pop Indian cafe in search of our favorite comfort food... channa bhatura! So, last Sunday, we were in the area and checked out Sweet Mahal, located in a strip mall in Rexdale.

For those of you who don't know what channa bhatura is... channa is your typical "channa masala" dish made of chick peas in a spicy, tangy gravy and bhatura is a fried bread made from white flour. The dish is served with onions and carrot pickles... 

First , the prices were very reasonable (4$ for a bowl of channa and 2 bhatura). Remember you are not paying for ambiance or downtown rent! 

Second, the food was good. The bhatura was very nice, light and fluffy. The channa was missing some of the usual tanginess but we covered that up by eating all of the pickles and onions! Overall, good but our quest for the best continues.  

We also ordered sarson ka saag (mustard greens) and makki ki roti to take home with us and we enjoyed them and our leftover channa bhatura the next day. The channa tasted better the day after, the spices having settled in. The sarson ka saag was very flavourful, quite (spicy) hot and very salty, so I couldn't eat it on its own. The roti was made from corn which I had never tried before. The roti went well with the sarson ka saag but personally I wasn't a fan of its thick texture. I like my Indian breads on the lighter side. 

Overall, we will eat here again if we're in the neighborhood! We will try some of the large selection of sweets they had on display and the samosas that others have raved about in their reviews.
