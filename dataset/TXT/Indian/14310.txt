c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg Had our work lunch here on this fine sunny April Wednesday!  Recommended by our south Indian co-worker.  If you are coming from down from 401, the building is a bit angle to the south on your left side behind a parking lot (try not to miss it =P).  

I had high hopes.  I knew south Indian cuisine would be super Spicy!  But was hoping to have some variety of other non spicy dishes / options.  Unfortunately, even the fried rice where mildly spicy :(  I had the butter chicken, it looks dry and actually over cooked.  Even on the second batch. So sad ... definitely for $12.99/pp I'd have expected more.

Highlight of the visit: 
Co-Worker ordered us a paper dosa each.  It's like a thin crepe made with rice, coconut and etc.  The dipping sauce was yogurt ish and very tasty.   

Food (Taste): 2/5
Food (Presentation): 3/5
Kitchen (Delivery Speed): (N/A)/5 - it's a buffet :) the paper dosa took a few mins.
Service: 1/5 - no one came to grab our dirty / finished plates.  
Ambiance: 4/5 - nice quiet place to have some chats with friends / co-workers
Fun Factor: 2/5
