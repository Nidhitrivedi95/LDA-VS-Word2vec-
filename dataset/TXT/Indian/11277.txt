aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q Never would of thought passing this place for years that New York Subway would of  been worth a visit. The place looks like a crappy dive inside and out. But I was so wrong. 

I had the large lamb burrito and it was fantastic. Possibly the best burrito I've ever had. Tons of fillings, great sauce and the lamb was great.

The only issue I had was it can be a little pricey. My large burrito was $10.00
