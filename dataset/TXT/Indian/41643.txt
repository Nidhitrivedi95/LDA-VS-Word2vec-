Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g We walked in with great expectation as we were craving Indian Chinese. However, if you're looking for authentic Indian-Chinese this isn't the place for you. The lollipop chicken was missing a basic ingredient-salt. The rice was cooked with too much water and lumpy. The manchurian fish was soggy rather than crispy!
