FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg I ordered butter chicken, naan, and chicken biryani. 
Service: 5/5 (friendly staff and fast service) 
Clean: 3/5 (dining area looks clean but not much washroom is OK clean. I don't know about kitchen) 
Price: 2/5 ( $35 is pricey based on chicken legs dishes) 
Amount: 3/5 (it is enough for 2 with a bit extra remaining )
Taste: 4/5 (I don't like chicken legs but it was reach taste and well prepared, but it lacks white meat served in the dish.
Overall: 3.6 /5 (I actually like it. I recommend to try it.  Even though it is not my first choice but I feel satisfied to eat there. I enjoyed it and I will go and try something else there and I will update my review if need it.
