lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw This place has a lot going for it - the food is above average, the decor is awesome and the location is great. We had the Pau Bhaji, gunpowder fries, adrak chai and gulab Jaman soft serve. Everything was good. The Pau Bhaji could have used more buns (the buns are tiny). 

Unfortunately, the service is pretty bad. Where do I start? 
-  if someone orders chai, bring them milk with it. We were told to go the front to get milk. We couldn't find it?
- the gulab jaman soft serve was made in front of us. They weren't fresh gulab jamans!
- don't swear behind the till, that's not good etiquette
- don't wash / gurgle your mouth in front of your customers. Doesn't look sanitary.
