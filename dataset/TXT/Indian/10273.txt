9N7VAcNFqjHptX3vRWqgnw Ordered delivery through Uber Eats. Got Chicken Tikka, Tandoori chicken and naan and one of the platters that came with a samosa and some other stuff. The platter stuff all tasted like it was really old and just reheated. The chicken Tikka was mostly just sauce and the chicken in it tasted dry and not fresh. The tandoori chicken was the only thing worth eating. Waste of $43 though, won't order from there again.
