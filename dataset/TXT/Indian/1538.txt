Most fry fish will fall apart without battering which is a rare innovation upon fryer.  The lamb briyani was tender and garnished with yogert, mint, and one other spice sauce.  The mango lassi was crisp instead of thick amd griddy.  In many ways, this restaurant never stopped to impress me since I was trained as a chef/restauranteur.  Slight problem with redemption of Entertainment offer.  The owner claimed he didn't sign the 25% contract with the publication so 5% discount were offered.  I didn't want to argue so I just paid was asked.  Will return soon.
