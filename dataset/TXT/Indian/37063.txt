o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw We ate here when it first opened and service was very slow and food was okay but the dishes all came out at different times.  Nobody got to eat at the same time.  Tonight we wanted Indian food and saw reviews were pretty good so we thought we would give another try.    We called to place a take out order and nobody answered the phone.  Looks like nothing's changed.
