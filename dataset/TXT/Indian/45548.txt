ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw This is a local favorite for me and especially my girlfriend. The food is very flavorful and most orders leave enough to take home for a second meal. They can crank up the spiciness as hot as you want, and then some. The staff are attentive and I've never wanted even for a water refill. The crackers and spicy sauces they provide are a good starter, but the garlic naan is even better. It costs up to maybe $16/entree (for the tandoori options) but considering you'll probably have leftovers it's really not bad at all. Yum yum.
