VqNqJeYvNSv8lkH2EAnLAQ Great indian/pakistanese food for take out! A good selection of all your favorites including Thali, Curry and Byriani. Prices are also unbeatable for the CEGEP students or local businesses in need for a quick fix lunch. What stands out at Maison Samosa Express is... well you've guessed it their Samosa. Definitely try the Lamb or Chicken Samosa. Congratulations to the young chef/owner for opening this joint in ol' Ville St-Laurent.
