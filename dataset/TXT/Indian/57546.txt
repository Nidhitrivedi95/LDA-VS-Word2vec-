ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ I went there cause I bought their groupon. The place is clean and well maintained, their staff is okay but the food was yucky. I ordered mango lassi, it was more of mango syrup and less buttermilk, and their Malai Koftas was still frozen inside which I could tell it came out of freezer and warmed up in microwave. Rest of the food didn't taste good.
