vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Pushap is a real hole in the wall kinda place. There is no store sign or banner outside, if you can't find them call them. This is a gem and a must try. 
Food is authentic and best I have had in years. And all indian looking for indian spicy food, this is the place. 
Everything is served fresh and flavors are just the right proportion. I wish I could drive to Montreal every weekend to have their food. 
Sweets are so fresh and delicious, that we bought a months supply before leaving.
