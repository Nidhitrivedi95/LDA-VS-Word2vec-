GskcqN5ie6xi0fzTI_4YTw I usually order a few dishes off their regular and catering menu. It's always been fast and delicious. I usually call in a large order to last us a few days and they have it ready for me when I get there.  It's inexpensive, delicious and the portions sizes are large. Their food is not as rich and fattening as most Indian restaurants.  

I recommend the mixed vegetable curry, chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, shish kabab, tandoori chicken, naan and gulab jamun.  Those are the dishes I've tried and loved! 

Now this is not an eat in place, although there is one table there that you could eat in if you chose. It's one of those hole in the wall gems! The staff are also very courteous and even help to bring my orders out to my car.
