fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw I almost cannot believe the price of this meal for what you get from it. Every dish, every single day is incredible. I love the tandoori chicken, chicken roast, and everything that they have to offer. If you're looking for an Indian/Bangal style buffet in Pittsburgh this is the one. The service is amazing also.
