PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Again & Again we find ourselves going to Indian restaurants with a buffet. Personally the whole system is faulty (where are we, in a wedding?) and buffet system doesn't work for any Indian restaurant. They can't even get the Tandoori chicken right, why bother with other Indian dishes and destroying the beautiful cuisine. Chicken has been over done in such ways I thought they marinated the chicken to death. Dishes sitting for a long time lose their taste and freshness therefore destroying any flavour if it had any in the first place. No real food lover such as myself would dine here again because it is an insult to a tradition that is food.
