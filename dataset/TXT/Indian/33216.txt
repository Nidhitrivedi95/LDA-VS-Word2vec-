When we walked in the atmosphere was so comfortable and inviting that we decided to stay. We both ordered the chicken curry, and the very nice waitress (owner? This place is clearly family owned) recommended either the Chicken Korma or the Chicken Tikka Masala. We decided to get one of each and share. They were both incredibly good. Service was very good, restaurant was clean and all of the staff was friendly. I would definitely recommend!
