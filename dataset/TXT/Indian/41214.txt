PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Tandoori Flame has a pretty great selection for an Indian buffet but everything tastes kind of... meh. From the salads to the curries to the Indian sweets, I can't say I particularly enjoyed anything though I don't exactly feel like my money was wasted. It was just ok.

The decor is beautiful and they create a nice atmosphere. The bathrooms are really nice! But yeah, that's not exactly the reason I go to most restaurants unfortunately...
