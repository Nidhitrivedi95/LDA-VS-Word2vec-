I got a rather lengthy and confusing story when I asked about this. It was something like they don't get any payments or aren't getting their money back or something. It sounded strange. 

We were there already, so we decided to give it a shot. The lunch buffet was sparse, but what was there was quite good. It was also very rich and very filling. The hostess came out with a basket of fresh naan which were super tasty. There was a feeling of, if I were to try and order more naan, they'd get testy with me. 

There were a lot of vegetarian dishes. The tofu was especially tasty. I usually don't eat chicken, but I tried a bite of the chicken tikka masala and it was not the best. I would definitely stick to the biryani rice and the chana masala and tofu curry. 

Weekdays the lunch buffet is $6.99 and on Saturdays it is $12.99. Hmph. Not accepting Groupon. Hmph. If I do come back, it probably won't be for a long while.
