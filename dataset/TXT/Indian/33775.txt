LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw Walking in I felt like I was back in California eating delicious cheap Indian food. They have serving trays full of items but we stuck with our usual items to compare to other places in Vegas. 

We ordered the chicken masala, lamb vindalo, cauliflower, samosas, garlic naan, pakora, and kofta. 

The kofta was my favorite. I was really impressed how much flavor it had and it was made with chicken instead of ground beef. The lamb vindalo was my next favorite. The lamb was falling apart as I was putting it on my plate which was a great sign to see that it was actually slow cooked. The sauce was on point too. 

Overall we had a great meal between the 4 of us, left with a couple of to-go containers and didn't spend a lot of money. 

I can't wait to go back and try other dishes that we missed!
