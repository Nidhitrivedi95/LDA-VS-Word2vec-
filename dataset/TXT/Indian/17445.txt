DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Went in for wine and appetizer and was not disappointed.  Service was quick and the staff was pleasant. The glass of Shiraz was delightful and went well with the appetizers. Ordered the vegetable spring rolls and the assorted appetizer for two.  Both were delicious.  Great place for a quiet intimate atmosphere.  Buffet is available for some meals.  I can't wait to return for dinner!
