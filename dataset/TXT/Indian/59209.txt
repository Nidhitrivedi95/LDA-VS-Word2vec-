yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug What a gem in the middle of hustle bustle and fat burgers in Vegas. Ordered Gobhi Manchurian and masala Chai as appetizers and Chicken Biryani, Malai Kofta, Butter & Garlic Naan, the food was delicious and our server greeted us with a smile and checked on us again to make sure we enjoyed our food and if needed anything else. The ambience of the restaurant was also really nice and not some shabby take away place. Malai kofta was simply delicious. Overall a great meal and I will definitely visit again when in Vegas next time.
