UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Finding Mint Indian Bistro is like finding an oasis in the desert. Where the oasis would be a really good Indian restaurant and the desert, well, is Las Vegas. My experiences are based on dinner and not the lunch buffet. Their staff is very accommodating here and are experienced in dealing with large families and groups with small children. On busy evenings, you can flag down any of their waitstaff for assistance. I've never made a reservation here and have not waited more than 15 minutes during my last few visits. 

I love the extensive and almost daunting menu filled with northern and southern Indian dishes. We usually start off with some samosas and the Bhel Puri, which is an Indian snack food made of puffed rice. I always have to get garlic naan with my meals. The naan is an Indian flat bread that's served hot out of the oven and has a wonderful texture. The bread is great for sopping up the sweet curry sauce of their Tikka Masala. Another dish to try is the smoky and aromatic lamb dish called Rogan Josh. If you're adventurous, they have plenty of other delicious dishes to choose from and also serve vegetarian fare.
