-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg It's a gem in Mississauga. I found this place by chance and we planned suddenly to visit this place. And our experience was wonderful. We enjoyed our meal! We ordered Bemisal Paneer Tikka, Shajahani Baadal Jaam as starters ( I was so happy to try Baadal Jaam as it was a new thing to try) and it was yum! Then we ordered Subz Miloni which was seriously damn good! And then with Subz Miloni we ordered 2 Butter naan (or Naan-i-Makhan). I was not sure about the dessert section so we ordered only one Rasmalai which was above my expectations! So we again asked for one more Rasmalai. As I love to eat sweets so I wanted to eat more and more... The Rasmalai was an awesome treat! The taste was same as we get in India! Later we ordered Veg Biryani for takeaway and it was tasty too. Will make our visit once again as soon as possible.
