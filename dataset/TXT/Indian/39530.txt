One can't tell how long the food has been sitting.  I found several of the dishes to be greasy, but at least there was a lot it.The north indian dishes seemed a bit better than the south indian ones.

Overall, this place is about quantity, not quality. This is not the place for good indian food, just a lot of mediocre stuff. It is pan-indian for sure.. dishes you would almost never find side by side but I can't recommend this place for anyone but hungry college students with large appetites than budgets.
