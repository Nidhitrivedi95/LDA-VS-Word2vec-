ToU2fHhYJ6_7AVc_MojMRg The food was fantastic. We ordered take out and got the butter chicken, chicken tikka and chana masala. All of which were absolutely delicious. They serve tasty basmati rice with their dishes and the butter chicken was awesome, normally places serve it with more sauce than actual chicken but this place did a fantastic job with the portions. Will definitely order again
