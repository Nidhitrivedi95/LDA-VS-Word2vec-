Went to this place to pick up marinated chicken for a bbq. After reading the reviews I was a bit weary. But went anyway. This review is based solely on marinated chicken, chicken Briyani and fish pakora.

The poultry was marinated in a variety of flavours- tandoori, non spicy tandoori, afghani tikka, lemon spicy, jalapeño, mint chicken and etc. the price for each flavour varied but was at 3.99-4.99 a pound. It was reasonable and tasted good when grilled.

Chicken Briyani was okay - big chicken pieces. Fish pakora was okay too.

I wouldn't come here to get curries and take out though. However it seems reasonable priced for that and the flavours are decent. 

It's worth checking it out for chicken and things you want to put on the grill! It's not really just a restaurant - it's a meat and take out place too!!
