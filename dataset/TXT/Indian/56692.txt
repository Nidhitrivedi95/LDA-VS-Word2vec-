xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I am staying at a hotel on Indian School, and this place caught my eye. I know AZ has a fixation with Fry Bread, and felt like giving it a shot. A lady had a table set up, she was hawking jewelry and knick-nacks. Once inside, the atmosphere was like a traditional burrito place, but with a Native American flair to it. I ordered a Carne Asada taco and a "Chief" size soda. I helped myself to some complimentary water, and sat at the fast food-style benched table. The meat was great, and tasty, but the whole idea is the Fry Bread that it is served on. Pretty good, flaky, and huge portions. I would recommend for a lunch if you are in the area and feeling a bit adventurous.
