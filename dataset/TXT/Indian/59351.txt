z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA Thoroughly enjoyed my bowl. I got brown rice, chicken, the spicy curry sauce, cilantro, and lettuce. Fairly simple but so good. I'm looking forward to coming back and ordering it again! 

Update: beware of what time you come in. Later in the evening, food can sometimes look and taste dry/old.
