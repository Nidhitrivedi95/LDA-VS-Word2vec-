02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ In my mind, there are two types of Indian restaurants in the Valley that I can afford to eat at.  There's the ones in strip malls that typically feature a grouchy old man behind the counter and a huge TV displaying Indian MTV or soap operas, and largely do-it-yourself service. (See: Kohinoor)

If I'm feeling like spoiling myself, I'll take the next jump up to the places with painted walls, friendly waitstaff, and a-la-carte style menus instead of "specials."

After a long day at work and in hippy progressive meetings, me and my beyonce decided to try Indian Delhi Palace, which is an excellent example of the latter.

The waiters were attentive without  being overbearing, and the complimentary appetizer - I always forget the name - the crispy, slightly sweet cracker thingamajig with the green sauce? - was yummy.  And the samosas we started off with were also great.  Not overly greasy or soggy or stale like a lot of Indian places.

The palak paneer is wonderful!  Ask for it spicy if you are a fan of spicy foods.  The creamy spinach flavor doesn't become overbearingly hot, but has a pleasant spicy aftertaste that mixes perfectly with their garlic naan, served fresh, of the soft and chewy variety that I prefer.

RE: The people who miss paneer... The paneer was definitely on the skimpy side, but I didn't mind.  The taste was definitely still there - perhaps they blend it in more than other restaurants?  Anyway, if you are a huge fan of blocks of paneer in your food, you might want to mention as such to your server.

The lady ordered vegetable bhriyani, which is sort of our Indian comfort food, and it didn't disappoint.  Flavorful rice with tons of veggies.

Indian Delhi Palace has good food, good service, and an atmosphere that will embrace you like a vampire who feeds off of stress instead of blood.
