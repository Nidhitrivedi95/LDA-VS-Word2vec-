S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA My wife and I stopped in for the lunch buffet, today. The buffet was hot and well stocked, with a dozen main dishes, plus salads and sweets. 

My wife had paneer tika masala (very tasty), saag planner (really good, flavorful and spicy), and daal maharani (very good). I had the chicken curry (nicely spicy with big pieces of chicken), tandoori chicken (perfectly cooked, moist, and yummy), and chicken dum biryani (medium spicy and very tasty). 

We talked with both father and son, co-owners, that opened this spot just three weeks ago. They are very friendly and attentive to the guests, even when it is just the buffet.
