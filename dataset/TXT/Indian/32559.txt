LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA We got 4 dosas and two orders of samosas and it was an enormous amount of food! 
Everything was extremely flavorful, we tried the buttered dosa, chaat dosa, and paneer dosa! They all had aloo masala (made from potatoes) in between the dosas, and came with various chutneys. The mango lassi was also delicious, went well with the dosas! Btw, one spice level is not spicy at all in my opinion, a stronger kick would have even tastier!
