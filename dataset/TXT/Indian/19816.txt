FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw This is one of the best lunch buffets that I have ever been to! Don't be afraid to try dishes that you haven't tried yet. You don't even have to know what the dish is; every dish is great! The chicken tikka masala was excellent, and the daals were good. 

I live in Minneapolis, but I often consider driving all the way to Madison to get some Swagat!
