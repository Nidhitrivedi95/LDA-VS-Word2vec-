ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw If your looking for Indian food with flair, this is the spot! The decor was beautiful and plush, the service was excellent, the background music was soothing and the food...Delicious!  I ordered the tasting menu which gives u a variety of meats and veggie dishes, curries, etc. It also comes with a gorgeous naan basket and traditional accompaniments. 
The price is a little high but well worth it!
