yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg Very delicious! And really great prices! I had the Tandoori Shrimp Masala (Medium) and it was absolutely amazing. Hubby ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and he really enjoyed it. His only complaint was that he went to order it "Hot" and after an "Are you sure?" from the server he changed it to "Med-Hot" and he wished it was hotter. My medium was flavorful and I was very pleased with it though. Everyone has a different take on heat level, so he will try it Hot next time and I am sure it will be great. We split an order of Garlic Naan which was absolutely delicious! Overall, a quiet little place, with good service and great prices. We have finally found a restaurant in Awhatukee where we were not disappointed! We will definitely be back.
