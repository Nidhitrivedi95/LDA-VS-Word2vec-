FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ I live too close to Curry in Box to have only just recently been here.  I was here recently and am definitely looking forward to going back.  When I walked in I was initially surprised at how big it was and how friendly the host was.  My first request was directions to the restroom, long day, and the host graciously showed me the way.  On my way to the bathroom not to be too dramatic but I was hit by the most aromatic smells I have ever smelled; what a great start!

The menu is vast and the host/cashier patiently and thoroughly answered all the questions that I had and even offered some suggestions.  The menu is very organized and it is easy to narrow down what you want by spiciness, meat and sauce.  I finally settled on the squash curry but it was definitely hard not to get the sweet potato curry because that sounded amazing too!

I got the home and immediately dove into my food!  The curry was simply amazing and the rice was cooked perfectly.  I do have a couple of qualms about the food however.  I could have done with a lot more curry for my dollar.   The food was delicious but the portion size is definitely on the small side.  I also could have done with a bit more chicken in the curry as well.  With that said however I still feel comfortable giving this place 4 stars because the curry itself was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I am looking forward to trying many other things on the menu!
