sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I'm not sure that there is anything I can say that hasn't already been said about this place in previous reviews. 

I've always been reasonably ambivalent about roti's in general and would only ever get them if I was out with a friend but after eating Gandhi's I have been converted. Not necessarily on roti's in general but on Gandhi's roti. I will continue to come back.
