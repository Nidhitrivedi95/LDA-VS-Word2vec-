Qrz20jCLqVSixe53_McCMQ To the folks giving this place 3stars+ do you even know what real North Indian food is? Food is bland, meats are dry, and service is misleading with all those stupid add ons. If you're charging for naan and pickle - at least visibly print it! 

This place has no business serving food in the name of a country that delivers cuisine based on diversity in spices, flavors, colors, heritage, and culture!
