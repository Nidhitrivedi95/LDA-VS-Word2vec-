GmMZG6dsDqGVC275ZwD-cw Ordered take-out from this place twice in the last week. The first time around, the food wasn't packaged properly - the items were flipped over in the bag. The food itself was passable. The second time around I ordered a Lahori chicken - much to my surprise, it was just a rotisserie chicken with a bunch of fries haphazardly thrown on top. Food was cold, and as before, flipped over with grease everywhere. 
Would not recommend.
