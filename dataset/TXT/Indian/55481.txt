x1GM1mzeDx4ARUGKV8n98Q I love the style of cooking they have it feels just like home! I always say I hate eating Mexican out because I always compare it to the delicious home cooking I'm used to, but this is one place I love. Their fry bread with honey and Powdered sugar is delicious I always get it. Today I had the enchiladas and they were so cheesy and great! I understand why some people say the chicken lacks flavor but when the salsa and cheese is so flavorful adding more flavor to the chicken would make the meal too heavy, and if there is one thing I hate is heavy food. This meal was just right! The service is always amazing the gals are always so nice and you can tell they work extra hard! The shop in the front always has really cool items! 5 stars all around!
