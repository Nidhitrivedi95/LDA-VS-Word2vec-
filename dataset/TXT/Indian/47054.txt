Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Food was ok. Staff were creepers. Just stood there and kinda watched us eat, didn't have any music playing in the restaurant at all, and the food was just ok. Not friendly just a meh attitude. 

If you ar ehard up for some indian food, go here but don't expect to feel like anyone cares you are there.
