utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw Came for dinner at 8:30 on a Friday. Only a couple other tables in the place. Good service, excellent food- we tried the tandoori combination platter and a paneer dish, as well as some nan bread- the garlic nan is fantastic. I would love to go back and try the buffet to try different things. However, there is something to be said for ordering off of the menu, mainly: you actually get some spice! Generally Indian buffets are too bland for me as they don't want to make anything too spicy for someone. All in all, a great place for dinner. The bill was $40 for two of us. They were also playing some really funky Indian dance music.
