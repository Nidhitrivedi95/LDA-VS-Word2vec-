ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Oh my lord.  Where do I start.  We were on our way from Red Rock to Las Vegas strip.  Told the wife I wanted Indian, and this place had great reviews.  It did not disappoint...at...all.  Phenomenal.  Not only was it the best Indian I ever had it was the best food I've ever had.  10/10 friendliness, decor, service, food, prices. Every year I come to Vegas I will come here.
