cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg Came here on a Friday night with my brother. Based on the store front, we probably wouldn't have entered. Don't let the decor or lack of customers throw you off but the food was pretty good!

Neither of us were very familiar with Indian or Nepalese cuisine aside from samosas, pakoras, butter chicken, biryani, momo, etc so we ordered samosas ($4.49/2) and the everest non vegetable thali ($14.99).

I got the curry chicken and my brother got the lamb. Both came on a segmented metal tray with seasonal vegetables, plain basmati rice, curry chicken, raita, pickled veggies, tandoori naan, lentil curry and rice pudding which was the dessert.

The samosas are about the size of a fist and were so delicious! Crunchy on the outside and filled with steaming spiced potatoes and peas!
The rice didn't have any flavour like the kind I'm used to eating: fragrant and slightly chewy. It did however complement the heavy spices and seasoning of each curry very well. The chicken was slightly overcooked but the creamy sauces helped with the moisture. Both of us agreed that the tandoori naan was the best part! Perfectly warm, slightly crisp and had an amazing chewy and fluffy texture. Great for soaking up the curry with! 

Overall, staff were very friendly and food came fast. The dishes were so full of flavour and complemented each other so well. The naan is a must!... even on its own. It may not look like a lot of food at first but we definitely left feeling stuffed. Again, decor could use a makeover but the food speaks for itself.
