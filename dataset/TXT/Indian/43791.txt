RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg Experienced Bombay Indian Grill for the first time this evening for dinner! 

Things to note:
*Service was prompt! 
*The portion sizes were generous, especially the naan!
*Prices were very reasonable. 

I ordered Chicken Curry, Plain Lassi, Raita, and Naan. The Lassi was a bit too thick, but still very enjoyable in the sweltering weather of Champaign.

The Naan was humongous, well-buttered, fresh, and delicious! Chicken Curry was excellent too! 

Overall, a great first visit! Look forward to many more!
