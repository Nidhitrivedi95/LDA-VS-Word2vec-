zzCsh8Rx40ZXcyDrzFnfOQ Our cousin was visiting from California and we decided to take him here for his first Indian cuisine experience.  I didn't really know what to expect as I haven't been here myself.  I just got a couple of recommendations from friends.

Atmosphere:  casual, dim, good for groups because they can put tables together.  I think there was a little holiday party going on in one corner of the restaurant.

Food:  we ordered butter chicken, beef vindaloo, panak paneer as well as cheese and garlic naan.  Aside from the panak paneer (spinach and cottage cheese dish) which lacked a little flavor, everything was delicious!  Beef was tender, the butter chicken was flavorful and the cheese naan was unlike anything I've ever tried!  The portions were good for sharing and we were at a comfortable 'full' level once we were done.

Service:  great!  Our glasses of water were constantly refilled and our orders came out promptly.  It wasn't very busy when we went (Saturday night) so I can't comment on the service during peak hours.

I would definitely visit again!
