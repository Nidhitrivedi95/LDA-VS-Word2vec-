Jr2qi4Nq3xrfNTa_jTVtYg Ok to re-iterate other reviewers, the owner(s) are very nice people... the food is sometimes average but sometimes great - but because it is a little expensive - and Indian food generally is - it remains a gamble.  The atmosphere is generally nice though - and I do wish them luck because they along with all the other ìndie`businesses along Roncy are suffering due to the on-going construction.  Seriously, is anyone keeping count of the number of businesses that have gone under since the renovation process began?  Quite disgraceful - the local council should be ashamed of themselves.

Oops I digress.  Sorry - back to Indian food... If you truly want a good one, then you have to get over to  its` native home to find a good restaurant or take-away; yep... that would be England.  Home of many Indian dishes that for some strange reason don`t make it on to 99% of menus over here (Canada).  Boo
