UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Yeah spicy is spicy.  I thought I could take spicy and then we ordered spicy.  Had to order a raita just to calm the waters.  

Overall, everything we ordered was good:  

-Onion bhajias were perfectly round veggie patties instead of the expected exploded fritters but still good.
-Butter chicken, chicken tikka masala were as expected.  
-Shrimp dopiaza was a miss.  We all agreed it smelled and tasted too fishy.  Although the shrimp was huge, the scent was too kooky for us to enjoy the dish.  

Lots and lots of selection, you'll definitely find something you like.
