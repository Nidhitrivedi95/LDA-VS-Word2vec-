h8bJb1dIwPmUGiqstCy7lw Absolute best Indian Restaurant in the City!  I have posted a number of reviews, am of South Asian decent, and have to say these guys have the best food in the City!  I used to live downtown but since moved uptown.  Anytime I am near the Queen area, I MUST get take out to go home at the minimum.  There is a super busy chef in the back named Ricky who used to literally do it all.  I would laugh my face off as he would take your order, run to the back, cook, AND take your bill.... Thank God the man hired some help, which appears to be his brother or something from India.  

Portions are not huge, but the man can really cook!!!!!  Must go!  I almost feel like I am writing this to send him more people so he can stay open.  

My vote as best hidden Gem in Toronto.....
