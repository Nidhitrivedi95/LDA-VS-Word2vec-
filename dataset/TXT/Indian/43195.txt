Rk82QHtWp268GM93qWj3dQ The food here is awful. This place has worsened over the last two years.
Service is slow and lackluster. We had to wait ten minutes for the naan. Also the naan was not at all authentic. It was undercooked and doughy. The curries were terrible. One curry looked like a mix of old, stale curries and was totally unappetizing. None of the curries looked good or tasted good.
Dessert consisted of over-fried items. Service was poor. We had to ask before getting the water glasses refilled. There was only one other customer in the restaurant, on a saturday. That should have been a clue for us.
Very very pricey too. 20 dollars per person. 
NOT recommended at all!
