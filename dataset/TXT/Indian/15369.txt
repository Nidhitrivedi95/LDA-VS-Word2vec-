ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ Tried this place after the Pride parade in 2010, and were disappointed.  We've been to a dozen or more Indian Restaurants in the city, and this ranks amont the bottom third.  Food was acceptable, but just, and nothing stood out.  The second floor windows looking out over Hayden Street are nice, but the food doesn't make up for it.

Can't even recommend this place for buffet lunch.  Go to Aroma or Dhaba on King Street instead.
