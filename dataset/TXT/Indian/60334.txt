ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA (Where is The Buffet)

I ate at Passage To India for the first time two weeks ago. I would say the food is ok but not much to try because the buffet is tiny. The chicken was delicious, but the staff did not want to bring any more out because they were 30 minutes for closing. The dessert that Yelp advertised as being a part of the check-in was a fake because one of the waiters told me that the offer would only work for dinner time. Overall, it was an ok place to eat, but I felt rushed to get out of their because they were cleaning under my feet while eating, and anyone born in the South knows (that is bad luck). I would like to attempt to eat here again when they are not closing for dinner maybe it is better then. But they were quick to take our money and did not explain that they would not bring out fresh food.
