FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg One of my favourite restaurants of all time! The food has so much flavour and with all the different choices everybody will be happy! The food is always consistent and yummy! The staff is awesome and the owner is so friendly. It's my soul food and the best Indian food around!
