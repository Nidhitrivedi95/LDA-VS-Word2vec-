KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Love this place. Friendly service and great food. The aroma of spices cooking as you enter is alluring. The portions are big and the food is fresh and delicious. The buffet is ok, but I highly recommend ordering from the menu. Veggie korma, saag paneer, and the gobi manchurian are my favs. The naan is good too. Served family style, 2 dishes could easily feed 4 people. The price is right for the quality of food. Take the passage to India and put it in your mouth.
