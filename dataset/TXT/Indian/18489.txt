EIH5pDc75v4haOcww-SEJg My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick bite that didn't break the bank. This food stand was a nice surprise! The menu was limited but considering that the location is on the Strip and it was unique made it worth trying. We love a good butter chicken and Tikka Masala and I think this place delivered. For about 7 or 8 dollars we got a normal paper plate sized tin of bazmati rice topped with sauced chicken. We enjoyed that the sauce was slightly tomatoey and had a kick, but definitely would recommend a bottle of water next to you if you're  sensitive to heat. The portion and price was great for the Strip and was good quality. I wish our plate got more chicken, but the sauce was so good with the rice that we didn't mind that much. I would definitely go back!
