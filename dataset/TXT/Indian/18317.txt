EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg This food was trash. We orders chili chicken and chicken wrap. Chili chicken was so gross. It was old you could tell that this chicken had been sitting in the sauce for days. It was so salty and just super dry from inside. Rice were under cooked no salad or water was offered. Now the chicken wrap was also gross. Chicken was same chicken used as the chili chicken but without the sauce. It was so dry. Wrap had no sauce on it. I asked for water and server says "we only had bottle water" they want to charge for every little thing and rip you off. After this I decided to have chai which was super cold and just not good. This place is way over priced for it's trash food. I do not recommend this to anyone. Please do not waste your money. If you eat halal just go have a pizza instead or something. This is not Pakistani food.
