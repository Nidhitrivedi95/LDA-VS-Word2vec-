KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I have found my new favorite Indian restaurant!  I travel a lot and have had good and bad Indian food.  Passage to India hits a home run.  The restaurant is very clean and "Happy" is happy to greet you.  Whatever you order, get the naan. Try a couple.  I love the butter, onion and cheese naans.  This is some of the best naan out there. 

The dishes can be ordered spicy, which I prefer. There is enough heat that you feel it but it doesn't drown out the flavor. The flavors are amazing!  I tried the Chicken Andhra Curry for the first time and it is full of different flavors that had my head spinning it was so good.  The goat and lamb dishes are delicious.  

**But if you can only get one dish, get the Chicken Tikka Masala, you will thank me. I don't know how they do it, but the chicken is some of the most tender white meat I've ever had.  I'm drooling thinking about it.

I've turned several friends onto Passage to India and they LOVE IT!  Go now, thank me later.
