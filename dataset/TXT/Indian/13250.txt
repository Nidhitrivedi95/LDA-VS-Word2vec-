BA13Ogw1hQV8hx376j-B-w We decided to try this place and ordered the Crispy Beef and Hakka Chicken Chowmein. When it arrived, I thought it appeared darker than usual. Tasted it and it tasted like burnt meat. While it was crispy, the beef was charred badly and covered up with a sweet honey sauce.  Every piece thoroughly burned and coated in sauce. It tasted awful and was inedible! The Chowmein had traces of burnt crumbs on the noodles and included literally 3 pieces of chicken. Each dish was $10.50 for which we expected a decent proportion of chicken to noodles. Otherwise, the place appeared clean with friendly service.
