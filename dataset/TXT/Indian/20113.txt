FN7aVgmb81RY6WHmSOV2cw We had an amazing time at Bindi on Friday night, and it was easily the best vegetarian Indian food I've had in a long while. Their selection of dishes is truly unique and the restaurant is a very welcome addition to Edinburgh's already colourful Indian scene. I'm already planning my next visit :D
