PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw The food isn't necessarily bad, it's just not that good.  I was highly disappointed by the size of the lamb Korma it had 5 small pieces of lamb in a very thin curry sauce, while the flavor itself wasn't bad, it was not enough to share even though we got biryani also. The biryani was not my favorite either. There's better options in the area so unfortunately I don't think I'm planning on going back which is a shame as it's so close to home. For $30 for dinner for 2, you should expect to feel pretty satisfied which we just werent.
