plXrGjtnDxYjHdpZ3wNMZQ We went here with another couple and family, the food was great and flavourful.

They have a lot of authentic tasting north Indian food on their menu, with some dishes that you might not be able to order at other indian restaurants.

I had the Bagara Baingan which is an eggplant based dish and it was wonderful, my g/f ordered the Malai Kofta which wasn't as good, which is why they get 4 stars instead of 5.

In all there was 6 of us and we had 6 meals, plus rice, naan, two drinks, everyone else had water and the bill came up to $90, we will go here again.

If you are in the area and craving some indian food, please stop by here.

Be patient, service is slow, which makes be believe they make everything fresh.
