a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g As seems to be typical of restaurants in Little India, Motimahal earns no points for decor - once inside it could easily be mistaken for a Mr. Sub, what with its swinging door garbage cans, red melamine booths and garish lighting. However, as you make your way to the back you'll notice a logjam of people hovering around the menu items. The menu is long but most of the food is already prepared - this is great, great Indian fast food at great value.

I ordered a vegetarian "thali" (a stainless steel with separate, dipped compartments for food not unlike the kind you used to eat your peas, carrots and squash puree from as an infant) for $6.95. The addition of a meat thali ($7.95), extra naan (we didn't need it) and samosas brought the total bill to $20.

The thali came with my choice of three vegetable dishes (I chose Dal Makhani, Chana Masala and Malai Kofta) with Pulao rice, naan and an onion salad with a neon green relish ladled over top. I didn't touch the onion salad but was instead focused on the Malai Kofta...mashed cheese and veggie balls in a thick tomato curry sauce and the yummy dal dish. The chana masala was OK but not tomato/tamarind-y enough for me. The sauce was green-ish instead of red or burgundy. Water is self-serve in giant steel carafes that keep it cold. 

I was far too stuffed from the eating contest-esque portions but I'd be eager to try the vegetable cutlets with channa ($1.50) and mango or banana lassis ($2.50) next time. Samosas were a mere $0.70-0.85.

This would be really great for party takeout or a cheap stuffed night in.
