GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw HORRIBLE experience with this place.  Took more than an hour for them to get our order.  And we didn't order anything out of the ordinary just dhal, roties and rice.  Pathetic service by the staffs.  No reason given on what the delay was.  However, others who came after us were given their orders!!!  We finally had to walk out without having food in this sick place.  When we did, the staffs were smiling, not something that I will tip for.  Someone suggested these people were serving beyond their capacity -  are you kidding???? There were hardly 15 people.  Good that we didn't have food from here, I am sure their food is also as disgusting as their attitude.
