xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw "I like it so much I'd like to eat here everyday for forever." That was the comment from a four year old when I last ate at the former location of The Fry Bread House. Fortunately, the food remains as good as ever, not harmed at all when the capacity to serve customers expanded.

A great place for visitors to Arizona who want to sample some genuinely regional cuisine, specifically derived from the traditions of the Tohono O'odham. The Native American craft booths are a fun bonus. 

Just don't expect much in the way of ambience. You can sense that the building was once a cheap Mexican food cafeteria. Oh well. Just convince yourself it adds to the charm of the establishment.

I must admit that I do miss the sketchy and cramped confines of the old location, but having a little extra room to dine is nice. It must also be great for the Native American craft vendors to have space inside in air conditioning.

The staff has always been friendly to us. I read some reviews on Yelp that complained of inattentive service... Surprising to me. I'm suspicious that some of those negative comments may be the result of cultural miscommunications. We weren't really greeted when we entered on our most recent visit, but the server who brought our food to the table was very engaging and we were warmly sent on our way as we exited. I'd characterize it as a kind of quiet friendliness that you might miss if you aren't accustomed to it.

Save room for dessert!
