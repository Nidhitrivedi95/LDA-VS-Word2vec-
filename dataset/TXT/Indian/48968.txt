TTFW5vD2i3ylvWaLpv4l6g This place is great!  Me and my boyfriend are vacationing in Niagara Falls this weekend and drove up to Toronto for the day to go to a Blue Jays game.  My friend's cousin has been to Toronto a lot and she said we have to King's Street to eat, lots of great restaurants there.  Well, I didn't get the name of anywhere specific or read any reviews.  We were just walking along and thought Indian food sounded really good and it sooo was!  I got Butter Chicken and he got Channa Masala,  Both really really good.  Samosa appetizers were awesome, too.  So was the Naan.  It was actually the best naan I've had.  Then we were talking with our waiter and told him we're from the states and after our meal he brought out a little dessert for us and said "for our American friends!"  Fully recommend Agra!
