A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA This is by far the best dosa joint in Little India.

Although the best dosa's are in the 'burbs, if you are looking for some quality close to downtown, then head over to this place.  The place has a cafeteria feel to it, with bright lighting and cheap seats, but thankfully that is where the "cheap" stops.   

The service is always friendly, quick, talkative, and informative about the menu.  I usually have the masala dosa, but the last time the waiter suggested the paneer masala dosa.  The food arrives very quickly and the bring out a decent selection of sauces and chutneys for dipping.  The dosas always fresh and crispy are almost comically large, but once you taste them, you are laughing with joy at having so much dosa to eat.

I'm never disappointed with this place, and I highly suggest it.  

p.s. The dosa pizza is actually very good!! (Flat, round dosa topped with veggies and cheese)
