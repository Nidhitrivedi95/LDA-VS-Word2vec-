DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA The serve is exceptional here. The server was very attentive. The food is fantastic. It is bursting with flavor. I highly recommend the naan. Its served hot. I had the chicken tiki masala and it was very good. Their rice really makes it. I enjoyed the mango lassi; but it was honestly a little too sweet. The decor is very cool, and the seating is comfortable. The manager was kind enough to come over fora chat and ensure everything was fine. The only suggestion I have is they need music. The place is deafeningly quite.
