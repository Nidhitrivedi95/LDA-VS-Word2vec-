lmjl4G9lDvADF9T_oegWIA A quick prawn patia delicously spicy and fragrant and a lamb malabar, orange and almondy and saucy.  Not bad, we forsook the rice and just took the protein with a cheetah beer and a glass of red.  Dark, quiet and A-OK with pleasant service.  I wish the lamb had been more cooked, like for a few days, tasty but not melt in your mouth.
