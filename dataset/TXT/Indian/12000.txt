auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Now, I love Indian food and basically will order it every where I travel to because I always get a craving for it.  I had been thinking about Taj Palace for some time now and finally got the family to try it out.....

a.  Ambiance - strip mall setting, plenty of seating arrangements and for various size. Perhaps you can fit up to about 85 people, so it was decent size.  Good lighting, nice bar, buffet area, tables and booths.  I say 4 star.

b.  Service - It was not busy, so we got pretty darn good service from everyone there. Although it seemed to take like forever for the food to come out and the natives were getting a bit restless.  4 star

c.  Food -3 star

a.  Chicken Tikka Marsala - OK, so this is really an English invented Indian dish and not popular in India.  I get it. Just like Chop Suey and Fortune cookies in Chinese cooking, these were things invented not in the original country.  I get it.  But man was this dish uninspired!!!!!!!  The chicken was cut in huge cubes.  The best way to slice is to take the breasts and cut at angles to get thin against the grain meat that when cooked, produce an aromatic and tender chicken.  Eating these chunks, was like eating chunks.  We asked for 2 out of 10 spice due to the kids and this thing was more spicy than the 5/10 spice I ordered for the Lamb.  2 Star

b.  Lamb Bhuna - i was a looking for the Lamb Roghan Josh.  The spice was mild, perhaps they messed this up with the miles Tikka I ordered?  The lamb was a bit tough, however the gravy sauce was awesome and quite tasty.  I give this a 3 star.  Great taste, terrible texture.

c.  Garlic Naan - Kids loved it, we had to order another servicing.  4 star


d. Tandoori Chicken - Hmmm good color, bit dry, on a bed of peppers, very tasty, if not overly cooked.  2 star.

To me, a family of four and it cost about 85.00 including tip. Way too expensive and not enough to warrant a return visit.  1 Star.
