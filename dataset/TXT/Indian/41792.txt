Q8GdWF9qLNf0aOBXaKUEPg I've visited here two times with my boyfriend. First time we was just on our way down the metro and was craving some indian food. We ordered the thali plates, with butter chicken and curry chicken. It was really good so we had to come back on this trip to montreal as well. Can't really speak of the other dishes, since we had the same thali plates both times but at least we can assure you that those were really good.
