Great stuff~ The rice dishes were as spicy hot as I'd hoped they were, and the Tandoori Shrimp were more like Tandoori Prawns (REAL sized prawns). Portions were huge!  That's always awesome! 

Service was great; just what I expected. Answered questions, brought us more water on a regular basis, check came quickly, food came quickly, etc.

This place is WAY better than Mount Everest India's Cuisine!  I don't know understand why that place gets more stars than Taj Palace; this place has better portions, comparable prices and better service.  And the food comes out faster!!!

After my first visit here, I came back the very next night for takeout; more Tandoori Shrimp, Basmati Rice, and the usual Chicken Masala.  Can't go wrong.

If you want great Indian food at reasonable prices, and you have a big stomach, definitely visit Taj Palace!~

Criticisms:
- Lighting could have been better, seemed kind of dingy
- Decor could use an upgrade


---Overall---

Service: A.  Servers were friendly and answered questions I had about the food

Food: A+, great selection, BIG portions

Atmosphere: B-, chill and relaxed, but could use an upgrade in lighting and decor
