KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I love this place.
I usually sit at the bar and chat away with the bartender who could be part owner Im not sure. He is very friendly and taught me all about where IPA's come from. there basically a rotten ale that was soured to make the trip to India. take that you crafty bastards, lol..
The food is always fresh and is priced fairly. The chicken curry is bomb . it puzzles me why it is not busier. I wish passage to India the best and hope they are around for a long time
