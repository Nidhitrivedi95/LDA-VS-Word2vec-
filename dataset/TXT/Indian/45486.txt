ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw What a refreshing find!! Food was legit, well seasoned, flavorful and as spicy as we wanted. Real deal food, authentic cooking styles and owners/staff were fantastic! !
Had curry goat, tandoori chicken, garlic naan...all great. Looking forward to trying more menu items many more times.
