The ambiance is cafeteria, as other reviewers have noted. However, the food more than makes up for the unassuming digs. If you are lucky enough to come down on the right day, you can get their saag paneer, which is creamy, tasty and full of paneer cheese. If not, do yourself a favor and order the shwarma (my husband's fave) or the chicken tikka. 

An interesting side note about this place- we originally heard about Salem's when we were discussing urban chicken rearing with a friend. This is one of the few places in the city limits that will process your chickens for you for a very reasonable price. What this means for you, the restaurant-goer, is that your meat is guaranteed VERY FRESH. Like, processed on the premises fresh.

Also, if you have extra time, check out their market. They have an excellent selection of meats, as well as a great array of middle eastern spices, fruits, candies, and so on. Check out their Ramadaan break-fast meals in the evening around August-October - it's basically an all-you-can-eat meat buffet for under 20$/person.

I've taken pretty much all of my extended family here at one point or another, and everyone has loved it! You have to be a bit adventurous, and don't come here dressed to the nines on your way down to a play or evening downtown - you'll definitely get some weird looks.
