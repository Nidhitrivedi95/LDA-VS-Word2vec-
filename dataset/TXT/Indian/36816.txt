nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Loved the food. It was clean, fresh, and simple. Just a note to families with young children, this place is not kid friendly even though the Yelp App says it is. They did not have high chairs nor kids menus. However it has great food. The quality of food and fair price make up for lack of ambiance and wait staff. Just leave the kids with a baby sitter.
