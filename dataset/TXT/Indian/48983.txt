TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Fantastic food. After reading the reviews I thought I would give this restaurant a try. What a gem! This has to be one of the best Indian food dining experiences I've  had.  All dishes ordered were delicious. 
We missed the lunch buffe where we could have tasted more dishes but we did experience 5 different entrees.

Service was attentive and friendly.  

Melque, the owner and entertainer (She has a lovely voice) made our dinner quite memorable.  We will go back.
