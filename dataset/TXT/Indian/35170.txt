MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw Went to Adrak tonight to celebrate my mother's birthday. The restaurant is modern with lovely decor and atmosphere. The food was delicious, not overly spiced but very flavourful. We ordered the tandoori platter which had an assortment of meats including lamb, chicken and shrimp grilled to perfection in their tandoor oven. We were seated right in front of the kitchen and watching the chef cook was such a highlight. He took such care in preparing the food, naans were made fresh to order and all meats were cooked in the tandoor. Lee also ordered chicken tikka and a vegetable curry. All delicious. The biriyani was also plated beautiful in a black pot that looked small but there was plenty.  The service made the dining experience over the top. Our waiter was informative and attentive. They also do this great magic trick at the end of the meal to provide you with a wet wipe that appears and grows as water is added. It was a nice finishing touch. Overall, it was a great dining experience, yes, it is more than your average Indian restaurant but the service is what made a difference for me. If you are looking for Indian fine dining, this place is a great choice!
