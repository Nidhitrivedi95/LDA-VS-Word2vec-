Xl2zyEFXHSHS4Xpo6ja4BQ Worst Indian food I've had. Prawns are flavorless, Rogan Josh and Masala are essentially tasteless.

The place has a bait and switch 2 for 1 deal outside. Don't trust it. It's actually a terrible deal that requires you to buy about £50 more.

Another swindle, they told us the papadum was complimentary and charged us around £11.

Don't waste your time, money, or sanity here. Go to the black cat across the street or the pizza place down rose st. Literally anything else.

We should have checked Yelp before going. Damn.
