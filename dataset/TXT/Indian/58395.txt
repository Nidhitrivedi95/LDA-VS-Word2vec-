I love Indian food so I was happy to hear an Indian Buffet was opening up right by where I work.  

The lunch buffet was $9.50 which is pretty reasonable.

The food was good, except it was buffet style and only a few things were labled so  I couldn't tell you what I had beyond Nan, Rice, and Chicken Tikka Masala.  The tikka masala was NOT SPICY AT ALL.  It also wasn't very oily which is good.  I liked the food.

The only thing I didn't like is that it is HOT AS HELL in the restaurant.  When we walked in we thought it wasn't air conditioned.  The thermostat read 85 inside, so it was still a few degrees cooler than outside, but they've got to get their AC upgraded or fixed, or I  cant become a regular until the fall when its cooler!
