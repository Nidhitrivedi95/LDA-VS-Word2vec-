02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ This is an exception Indian restaurant! My fiance use to deliver clay ovens to all the Indian restaurants in the valley and said this place had the cleanest back of house! The service and food are great! I've been here for dinner several times and my go to meal is shrimp korma, basmati rice, garlic naan, and a mango lassi to drink. I can't wait to try the lunch buffet sometime!
