I ordered the Salli Chicken Bowl. The portion size was okay, but the curry was served at a good temperature (for me at least). However, the roti was small relative to the amount of curry being served, and was piping hot. I could barely hold it for more than 2 seconds. I could've also used more chicken than the amount that was served. The food tasted good, but it wasn't mind blowing.

I also ordered a Mango Lassi for a drink. I was told to take one out of this bin that had a layer of ice in it. The drink tasted good and sweet, just like I had hoped, but it was a bit warmer than I had wanted.
