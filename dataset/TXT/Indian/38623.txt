If you think this is just another Indian restaurant, you couldn't be more wrong. 

Being an Indian I can tell this is a very niche cuisine. Urban turban brings the taste from the streets of Mumbai with the modest presentation that goes with it. 


And that's coming from someone who grew up in Mumbai. If you are looking to try new cuisines you have struck jackpot as no other place in Vegas offers authentic Mumbai street food kind of taste as this place. 

My personal favorites here: Pav Bhaji and Vada Pav. 

Kudos to the Chef Tarun for the great food!
