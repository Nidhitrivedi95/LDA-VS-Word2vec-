pU7L-CQpl4syUwfEGAlb8g The food is quite good and the staff are very friendly. (Every time I order, they thank me for my business which isn't something you hear too often) Not much to the look of the place and agree with other reviewers that this place is for take out. 
We've had a few dishes including the fish and chips, BLT, burgers. They have a super cheap breakfast for around 3 or 4 bucks.  It's a little small but it's under 5 dollars, so can't really complain about the size. If you're in that area and looking for some good diner style take out, I would really recommend.
