ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I've been to this restaurant 6 or 7 times over the past 2 years and it keeps getting better and better.  They have a new menu and possibly a new chef.

Our most recent visit in Jan was unbelievably good! If we were in town one more night, we would have gone back!

If you like Indian food...this is the spot!
