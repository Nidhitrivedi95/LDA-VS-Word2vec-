RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg on our way back from Wisconsin Dells and we felt like some Indian chai. I called the restaurant to see if we can get some and if they were close to the interstate....was promptly informed yes and its only a 5 mile detour. Well worth it!! The owner Nancy was very pleasant understood that we were in a rush, got our chai ready in togo cups and our order of Samosas packed up with plasticware and napkins. The only disappointment was that the lamb samosas actually had potato filling as well..... which is atypical.

Will definitely stop in check out other menu items if we are in the area again!!!
