x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ We were visiting friends in AZ and went here for lunch on a weekday  as well as dinner on a weekend. The ambience is very nice and the décor is classy and the place is kept very neat and tidy. The staff was very friendly and attended to our needs. 

There sure was a faster response time when it was less crowded during the weekday lunch compared to the fully packed weekend evening. Nonetheless, we were blown away by the food when it came. My favourites were the Chicken 65 and the Paneer in the Appetizers section. There were enough quantities and the presentation and the taste were excellent. I would definitely eat from here again on my next visit.
