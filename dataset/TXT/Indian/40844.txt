PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g Funny, I was just going there to pick up food, really. The server seemed to have an attitude, and when I presented my voucher for the food, his response to me was, "your name's not on there, bro".  Here's a tip: in a restaurant where you have tablecloth... don't call your customers "bro".  I found my name in 5 seconds, learn to read, bro.

I've been here a couple times before.  Food's solid, but after that experience, not sure if I want to go back.
