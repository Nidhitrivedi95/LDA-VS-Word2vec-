FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q We stopped by at this restaurant on way from Wisconsin dells to chicago.
Food was disgusting, pricey and very small quantity. We ordered chicken biryani which had only two small pieces of chicken and had no taste. Service was also dicriminatory for white and non white people. White oeople will get great service and also a hot towel to wash hands athe end of dinner. Non white will not get that service.
to sum up bad food and pricey. You could get better food  for that price. We strongly donot recomnend this place to anyone.
