2-Y-kNEbrP_m1U9Hc2xH7A What an unexpected find in strip-mall infected Monroeville this is. Kay and I came here for lunch while waiting for nearby NTB to replace a tire on the Kaymobile on New Year's Eve no less. 

Having not one clue as to what to order, we went with Vegetable Pakora for a starter. I had for myself the Chicken Achari, and Kay had Goat Kahari, which I didn't sample. 

The Vegetable Pakora was an expertly fried and starchy success that went on famously with the green and brown chutneys we were given for dipping. Sadly, I cannot identify those sauces. My Googling isn't helping much. 

The only thing I didn't like about my Chicken Achari was that the chicken, which came on the bone, wasn't plentiful enough. Only one piece had an ample amount of meat on it, and I really had to scrape to find more of it. Sammy's offers a boneless version of this very dish, and I regretted not ordering it for the chicken I did have was sublimely tender and spiced. Nonetheless, it was exotic, tasty, generously-portioned overall, and vacated my sinuses but good. The slightly charred naan acted as a fine picker-upper for the excess gravy. 

The atmosphere is akin to an upscale diner and thus is very laid back. We were surprised to find that our server was a born-and-raised local with a Pittsburgh accent and streetwise demeanor. She took the time to get to know us, her eyes  widening with shock and later sympathy when we recounted our rough day to her. 

She asked me while Kay was in the bathroom, "After all that, yinz still goin' to her grandma's? I think yinz should. It ain't THAT late!" 

We're a "nebby" lot y'know? God love her. 

Nope, we weren't at Eggs N At but a kebab house/Indian/Pakistani/Halal kind of joint. 

Only in the Pittsburgh metro area...
