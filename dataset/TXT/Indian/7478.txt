It looks like a struggling business, The owner was very nice. I gave the food away to a lady in the parking lot who told me she wrecked her car and asked for a ride to Walmart to get her insulin and I told her I couldn't but here's a free dinner.......she said GOD BLESS YOU.....it was then I realized I gave her the food because I didn't feel comfortable eating it and it was selfish of me to not be politically correct.....get over it....Trumps Pres . Off to city BBQ. (I didn't feel safe eating because I saw raw chicken sitting out, he was probably just prepping but I didn't want to take any chances....he also has a 504 area code.....again, just weird)
