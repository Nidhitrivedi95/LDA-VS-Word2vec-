FfA7BYSEc46Y3lKHOiqn4g Came here for their dinner on a Tuesday night.  It wasn't busy at all.  The service was pleasant and friendly.  Loved the decor and ambience of the place.  

We ordered the pani puri and chat puri for appetizer. For the mains, we ordered Chicken vindaloo, tandoori chicken, eggplant curry and a lamb curry ( can't remember the name).  Loved their garlic and mint naan.  Out of these dishes,  I'd recommend ordering the chat puri, lamb curry and tandoori chicken.   I will definitely come back and try out their lunch buffet.
