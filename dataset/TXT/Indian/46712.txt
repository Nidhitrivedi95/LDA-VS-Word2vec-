t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Went to this place with a friend last night. We got their mixed tikka platter appetizer, which comes with a selection of chicken tikka, lamb kabobs, and shrimp, and then split a mutton biryani and some plain naan. Everything was extremely tasty, with a good balance of flavor and spice. If you live in the northwest part of town, you need to go here, period dot.

Pros:
* Very friendly staff, courteous and helpful with menu choices

* Large, family-style portion sizes and no skimping on ingredients - the lamb biryani had a ton of tender lamb chunks in it

* Naan is extremely fresh - come basically from the oven to your table

Cons:
* A tad pricey, but given the portion sizes it's feasible to split an entrée if you're budget conscious. We took home leftovers.
