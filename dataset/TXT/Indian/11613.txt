ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Went there after a while, late at night around 9 ish, since its close by. Had forgotten how much the place reeks of masala. Just cuz you make Indian food you do not have to announce it to the world, MM (Neighboring Banjara is equally guilty of this)

The food is pretty pedestrian. The flavors felt brazenly out of a packaged spice box. Started off with some chicken appetizers, and ordered some naan, lamb chettinadu and dosa for the group. Dosa wasn't super great, prefer Udupi Palace. The lamb was spicy enough and the naan was fresh and fluffy.The food was very filling. So far so good.

However, service was pretty bad despite the fact that our server seemed like a nice guy. There were no napkins/silverware on our table when we sat down and it proceeded that way until the food came out. Even then we had to ask for silverware before our server finally brought some out. We had ordered wine, which we never got but were still charged for! There was a fruit fly buzzing over our food during the entire time we were there! The table next to us was dirty from the moment we were seated till we left about an hour later. I understand that it was almost closing time but that's no excuse to be so sloppy.

There's better Indian food to be had in the city.
