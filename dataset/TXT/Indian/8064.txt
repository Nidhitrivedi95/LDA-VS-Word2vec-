7bKDFnTkYzlYEfU7hJ9UtA I finally went here after a recommendation by Farheen and I was not disapointed!! 

The behari and seekh kabab rolls were totally fantastic. See Farheen's review for what a kabab roll is. But  basically its a spicy kabab with chutney and onions and salad all wrapped up in the best fresh hot naan. 
I need to add that the naan it comes in is made super fresh (not the frozen kind, but actually made in a tandoor!!) 

Totally quality food for only 5-6$ a person! Oh, its totally Halal for those that are looking!
