1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg Note that there are two businesses named Biryani House, this is the hole-in-the-wall no frills thali place on Hayden St, the other is a more lavish institution near Wellesley. This review pertains to the former.

Biryani House is not bad.  Its not great Indian food, but it has its charms.

Its Indian-style Thali, meaning, you get a tin "lunch tray" with a Simple salad with yogurt and cumin dressing, a sweet rice desert, some rice with daal and your choice of three other dishes  -- three vegetarian or two vegetarian and one meat. They vary depending on the day, but usually there is a Baigan Bharta (eggplant) Aloo Gobi (Califlower), Black chickpea Chana, Mutter Paneer (cheese and peas) some potato. Sometimes Saag Paneer. (Spinach). You also get a half of a Papadam (Lentil Cracker) laid out on your cafeteria tray under your disposable plastic fork. (grr)

The place is teeny, seats less than 20 and is a very tight squeeze. Come in, squish your way though the tables towards the food-serving counters and order at the cash. It is always the same two men working. One will take your payment and get you pop or lassi, and the other will scoop your choices from the cafeteria style metal pans. 

The bonus points are that since the food is pre-made (other than naan which is made when you order it)  it is served to you relatively quickly - meaning if you can get a seat, its a fast lunch. The portion is gigantic and will fill you up for certain. Vegetarian Thali with pop is in the $8 range. 

Minus Points 
- the food is NEVER hot, only lukewarm (comes with the territory)
- you are often left watching a single guy and his jacket take up an entire 4 top as you stand there with your tray. 
- Disposable plastic forks
- Not AT ALL SPICY IN THE LEAST. If you are looking for any form of spice or traditional Indian fare, you will not get it here. This place is western-washed to the max.

Take your dirty tray back up to the front, and let people sit down. This is how it goes here, they don't usually buss the tables right away.  And please don't order "take out" and then sit down and unpack your Styrofoam and plastic meal at the table only to eat it there. What a waste. You are not saving any time, this place is fast.
