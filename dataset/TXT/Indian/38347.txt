oMt3FrXtmYiP2ayn46PHtQ We went our for lunch and found the food really tasty. There was a buffet for lunch and I tried all the food in the buffet. Out of many dishes I liked Sheek Kebaab with chicken Tandoori. Chana Masala was another sensentional item there with fresh naan from the oven. The pulau was another typical dish that was little sweet for my taste buds but was amazing. I loved the food there and will soon visit this place.
