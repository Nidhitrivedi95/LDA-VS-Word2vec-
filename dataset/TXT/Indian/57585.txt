ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ 3.5 Stars, The Naan, was great, the paneer tika masala was average, but the mint chutney that had been sitting so long that it fermented and was carbonated really scared me. 

Lunch specials range from $8-10 this is not a lunch buffet. They do include hot chai tea which is nice.

The location is a bit odd as this is the restaurant for the holiday inn which if I were on travel for work I would be happy to find.  The inside is nice clean and modern but service was sub par as we had to ask to get our water refilled, luckily I was not in a rush.

Lunch was oddly slow, with 3 other tables at the peak.
