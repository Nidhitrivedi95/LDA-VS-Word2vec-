Quality is seriously lacking in a lot of Bramton Indian restaurants but that's not an issue here everything is high-quality.  I've tried almost all the vegetarian dishes as well as the fish tikka and fish pakora which are great.  The notable mentions are Achari paneer, chili paneer, fish tikka, gajar halwa, chat papri and Channa bhatura.   I've been going here for years - highly recommended :)

 I only wish they had halal chicken... so I could try the chicken dishes too.
