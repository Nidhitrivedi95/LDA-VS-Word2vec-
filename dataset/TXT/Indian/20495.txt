fVbZptKCH2lIRS56M1zc6g Went for the lunch buffet recently, there weren't a lot of options but the food was decent and fairly fresh.  It was a Indian Chinese buffet and I thought the Indian food was tasty but Chinese food was a little bland.  I enjoyed the butter chicken and cauliflower dish.  Good value for 10.95/ person for lunch.
