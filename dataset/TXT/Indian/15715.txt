CvOxwAhmwwy3sQRKYVAjGg Came in on a Wednesday night, located in a really shoddy strip mall, lighting was really dark, and we were the ONLY persons in the entire place served by a single lonely guy. But good Indian food buffet for only $15 a person! I would say, come here with your buddies if you're hungry for some decent Indian food and don't care about decor or lack of crowd.
