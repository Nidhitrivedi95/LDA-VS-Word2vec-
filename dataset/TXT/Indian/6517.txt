3S8nDh3gK2BmG-_HjDjh6w The ambience and food are good. We ordered the navaratna curry, chicken biryani, masala dosa, and garlic naan as main course. They served us pakoras and papad which were complimentary. It's a small place but simple and neat. I liked the South Indian vibe to the place. The server and chef were very friendly and courteous, they made sure we felt welcome and enjoyed our meals. Unfortunately, the dosa was cold and the sambhar that accompanies dosa was cold and had no salt or flavouring. The biryani was spicy and super delicious. The navaratna curry was a disappointment as it didn't live upto our previous experience. It is supposed to be a little sweet rather it was spicy. We had gulab Jamun with vanilla ice cream, and mango ginger ice cream. They gave us 2 gulab Jamuns with 2 small scoops of vanilla ice cream which was just about perfect. The mango ginger ice cream was unique and the sharp taste of ginger was quite striking. The portions were generous for a couple but not enough for more than that. Overall, the service and the food are good.
