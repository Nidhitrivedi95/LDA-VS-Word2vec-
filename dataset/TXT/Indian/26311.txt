Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw First let me start by saying this is my first time at a Indian food buffet. I was apprehensive because Indian food is quite heavy, and I always have leftovers. But, the quality of the food here was great! And so many options for vegetarians and meat eaters a like! The quality of the food was so good! And having the buffet is exciting because you get a bit of everything. I'm a vegetarian and was so happy to see all the veg options, the servers are super friendly and everything was so great! The down side - my stomach is too small.
