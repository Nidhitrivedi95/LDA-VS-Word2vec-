The buffet was tired. The selection was sparse. The food itself was barely mediocre.
To be truthful I am a bit sceptical as to the freshness of the product. I am a trained certified Chef and did not touch 3 of the items displayed. Which left me with a selection of 3 items to consume which in turn lacked flavor and was greasy.
The service was tolerable but unfortunately I know when a guest is unwanted and they just want to close the place up and watch TV. Perfect recipe for bankruptcy!
Just a matter of time before this location is replaced by a learning center or bank.
