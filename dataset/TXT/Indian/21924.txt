gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw I dream about this! We are from Utah and every time we come in to town we have to make a stop. We have been coming here for four years. We love the Chicken Tikka (dry). Honestly though you cannot go wrong! We have also met the owner of the restaurant and he is such a nice guy. He actually cares about his customers experience.
