S104l3lOcpkX6g98CFrGPw 2nd time ordering delivery from here, 1 word: FANTABULOUS! Amazing Indian food, around 40$ for 2 people to eat it's affordable especially for the portions. (Easily could feed 3 hungry adults with one combo for 2 or 2 main dishes with polao rice which would each add up to about 40$). Delivery took about an hour but so worth it! Absolutely must have their nan bread it is perfect with every dish and every sauce! Can't wait to go eat in-house 'cuz it's byow and the food is fantastic and hot delivery so it can only be better there! So far staff seem pretty polite and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!
