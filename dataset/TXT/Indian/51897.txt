UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA My husband and I went here on a Wednesday evening around 6 p.m.  The restaurant was fairly busy with both dine-in customers and a to-go line.  They also seemed understaffed, and worst of all, the waiters use iPads to take your order, which seemed to be more of a burden for them than a time-saver.  Our waiter seemed like he cared but was overwhelmed.  Some other members of the staff, however, seemed the opposite.

Part of the reason we tried this Indian restaurant was because it has a full bar.  Unfortunately, simple mixed drinks took between 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table.  I would not recommend ordering any of the more elaborate drinks on the menu because the wait time would probably be even longer.

We ordered naan, an appetizer, and two entrees.  They brought out the naan first, then 10-15 minutes later, only one entree.  Then we waited about ten minutes for the second entree.  Thankfully, we were sharing both things, or this would've been way awkward.  At this point, we still hadn't received our appetizer, so we asked the waiter to please cancel it.

The food was actually quite great.  We ordered the Chef's special lamb kabob and the Vertical Vindaloo with chicken thigh, and they were both excellent.  The vindaloo was not saucy enough for my liking, and the "Full" size was rather small for the price.  Other than that, we weren't disappointed by the actual food, despite its strange delivery times.
