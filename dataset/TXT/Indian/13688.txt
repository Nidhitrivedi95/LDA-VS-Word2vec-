bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A Went here for the lunch buffet today -- seemed to be pretty standard fare.  The food was good, including a very tasty raw vegetable salad.  It would have been useful if they marked which of the dishes were vegan versus vegetarian.

It was decorated nicely, but the service was a bit slow, and we had to flag someone down to get refills on our water.  And the actual temperature of the room was pretty warm, and it got uncomfortable towards the end of our lunch.
