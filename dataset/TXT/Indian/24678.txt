h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw I'm VERY picky about Indian food, and I like it spicy! I was initially nervous about ordering from POI after reading the previous (older) reviews, not to mention my failure to find good Indian food so far in da Burgh!  I'm glad I took the chance:) Delivery was as expected through grub hub, about 60 minutes after the delivery was placed. I added a comment to ask if they would "please make (the food) very spicy." And they did not disappoint! Usually my request for very spicy food (a 10 on a spice scale of 10) gets me something more like a 4 or 5 on my personal spice scale. I was so pleasantly surprised that the chole and aloo gobi were made both flavorful AND very spicy. (Literally brought tears to my eyes!) This, however is the kind of spice I like, so for those who can't handle it, be mindful of the spice scale- it's taken seriously! I'm so happy to have found Prince of India delivery and will be trying it again soon.
