auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I am in Las Vegas and on my way home to Arizona. I want to bring Indian food home for a dinner party and the place I go to, the only Indian food within 150 miles of my new house tells me they don't do take out for lunch. I didn't fuss but frowned and told my sad story about missing my favorite foods and chefs back in Wisconsin. The staff was amazing and worked diligently at helping me out. They call the chef in and he makes me everything I wanted and invited me back to cook with him so I can perfect my home cooking. I found my chef!!! Home now and had a chance to try this magical food. Best food and best service. This is the place to go or in my case, Togo.
