auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I was in the east side of the town and trying to find a Indian restaurant that closer to me to get the lunch. i was looking at the yelp and tried this place for the comments they had. i was happy with their interior decoration and the guy who was water is kind and pleasant to make the place likable. food is little spicier and its perfect to my taste and thandor chicken was over painted with the red color. i think they use lots of food colors and they might have to reduce that to make people less curiosity. 
Mango Lassi was perfect and Dosa taste was great!!! i will definetley go back and will recommend to anyone!!
