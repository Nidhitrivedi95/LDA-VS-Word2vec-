I like the naan bread they served, it tastes like it's made within the facility. The naan bread is comparable color to Matzos but the texture is soft when you bite into it. I ate it with the curry dishes and the combination went well. 
The curries and salad bar looks fresh in the buffet line. There are different sauces that you can add with your meal.
The restaurant is clean and wait staff are friendly. I didn't have ask to refill up my water glass. They automatically check on your dining experience and making sure everything is okay. If you are looking for a colorful in your taste palette food this is the place.
