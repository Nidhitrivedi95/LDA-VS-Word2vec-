xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I was at Showcase Honda getting my car fixed and remembered that the Fry Bread House is only a mile away. What an excuse to try this place. I set my expectations low on the place because all the reviews told me it's not the interior but the food. So driving there I noticed it's really sketchy area of town. The outside of the building isn't maintained and neither is the plants or the parking lot but I really wanted to try this place so what the heck. 

I walk in and all I see is a bunch of tables surrounding the place then in the very back I happened to see the counter. Very unusual to be so far back but what the heck. 

Everyone told me the menu is in the wall so I walk up to the counter looking for the menu but the menu is to the right of the counter. All the reviews told me Red Chili taco. Had that in mind and that's what I ordered. I got the choice of retried beans or meat and of course I got the meat. They give you a number and you find your own table. 

Anyways, I found my table and before I know it BOOM. I'm served. Very cool. Let me just tell you first and foremost. It's so dang good. The fry bread is so soft, fresh, and light. The red chili is out of the world. So good. Has a nice little kick to it. If you like it hotter, they bring out home made hot sauce with your meal. I tried eating it like a normal taco but wasn't successful. It's so messy but so good. I really did enjoy it. 

The lady at the counter was so nice and friendly. The person who brought out my food and even the busboy were so friendly.

Like everyone said this is a true blue dive. Dining area is ok but the food is great. Don't come here for the ambiance or atmosphere cause there is none but come here for the food and nice service. I was very surprised by this place and for sure will be back.
