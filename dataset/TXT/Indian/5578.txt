3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Went to Kama again recently and noticed a distinct improvement in the food! Used to be sort of white people Indian fod but now it tastes much more authentic! I actually mentioned it to the manager and was told that they recently got a new head chef.
Any reviews that are more than a month or two old are probably not relevant!! 

Not cheap but the buffet makes it well worth it.

Lots of vegetarian dishes too!!!
