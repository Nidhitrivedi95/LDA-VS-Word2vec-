6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A I came for lunch. It is a buffet. I thought the food was really good and a decent selection. Im rating it a 4 because of the service. This was my first time there. I wasn't sure the flow of the business and would have been helpful for someone to explain the flow since it was my first time. Nobody took a beverage order. They just served water pitchers. I did like that it seemed quiet for the amount of people that were there. I could actually hear the person across the table from me. I also was not sure where we were supposed to pay when we were done.
