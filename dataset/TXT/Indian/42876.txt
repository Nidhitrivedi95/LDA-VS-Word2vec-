RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Coming from DC, I have had my fair share of awesome Indian food. But, Blue Taj knocks all those places out of the water. My hubby and I had a craving and placed a to go order on Doordash. Let me say,  this is hands down the best Indian I have ever had. Chicken tikka masala- divine, cauliflower and potato- amaze, samosas- yum and garlic naan? Yes please!!!  We will for sure be coming back for more. This is a must try!
