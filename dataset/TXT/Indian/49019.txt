TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Sadly, I have to withdraw my previously positive review and add my recent unpleasant experience.  Previously, I had only visited for the lunch buffet, which is good and reasonably priced.  
Dinner is a different story.  I purchased a groupon because I have always enjoyed this place.  (Except, of course, the owner's occasional need to karaoke.  Can someone tell her that she is too loud and not Whitney Houston?)  

We attempted to go there two weeks ago, but the roof had a flood.  We spoke with the owner for a few minutes.  We walked in at 6pm and there was still a three foot by four foot puddle on the floor.  She rents the space, but why not clean it up?  

So, we returned there last night to try again.  The food was good, not great and the rice was sparse.  So, when we asked for our left overs to go, we asked if we could get a little more rice to take home with us.  There was an additional $2 charge on the bill for rice.  

This was the big deal: She wrote in an 18% tip on the overall bill!  Now, I would have completely understood if she wrote a quick note on the side with the calculations for 15%, 18%, and 20% tip on the total bill.  But to write in the tip on a table for two just because we were using a groupon is uncalled for.  My friend, who was paying the difference, was so mad, so crossed it off and gave her a 13% tip.  

Lastly, when the owner is serving me, I feel less bad about the tip considering that is not how she makes her wages, unlike normal wait staff.
