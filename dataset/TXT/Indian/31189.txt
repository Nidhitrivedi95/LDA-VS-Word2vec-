kMgdZVLzAXM1JQwFsPXIlg Don't get me wrong food here is amazing, for the price. I used to get takeout here once every couple weeks. However, on my last trip one of the dishes was wrong and when I brought it to their attention they said that is what I ordered. When I said that I don't want the dish they didn't even offer me a discount on the dish I actually wanted, and I had already paid... Will not return here again.
