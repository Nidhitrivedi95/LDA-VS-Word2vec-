kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g I am an Indian and I have eaten at this place couple of times and the food here is not Indian food but a modernistic type of dishes which uses some Indian spices to give it a very very mild Indian food taste. Dont go there expecting to get your chicken tandoori or spicy chicken tikka fix as it ain't gonna do it for you. Its funny when some of the reviewers are referring it as Indian food... its like comparing Taco Bell food with Mexican food. One of our visits couple of years ago was during their happy hour which I thought was a good concept.
If you want real North or South Indian food, there are plenty of good places in the valley.
