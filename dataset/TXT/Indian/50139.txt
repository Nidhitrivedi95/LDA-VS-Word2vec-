UadX71pjUtIDHaR61qTx3w Dinner was good. The food tasted very nice, but it was a lot more spicy than promised. Ordered my Chicken Tikka Masala "mild" and it was much more than that, in my opinion. My partner's veggie dish was fire-hot. She ordered it "medium". I'd really hate to taste their version of "spicy". 

That being said, the service (Hachim, I think) was top-notch. 5-star quality. He came to check on us after delivering the food. I mentioned it was a little hot. He offered to replace the dish with a milder version (without my having asked) and wouldn't take no for an answer. (Hilarious note: the server who brought the new dish presented it as "Chicken Tikka Masala with almost no spice." Nice.)

Hachim also brought us complimentary Raita in an attempt to cool my tongue. It didn't work, but the gesture was appreciated. 

Finally, worth mentioning that the mango lassis were delicious. Simple, yet excellent. 

The taste of the food (despite the spice) and the excellent service definitely showed me that Tandoor et Grille is doing something right. I'll be back to try something else, with clear spice instructions.
