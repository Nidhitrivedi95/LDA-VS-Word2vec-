Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw I was here for a lunch buffet. It was 13 bucks which with tax and tip makes it a pricey lunch. But I wanted to try it. The best thing was tandoory chicken but unfortunately they didn't have plenty of it. I got a few pieces and when I wanted more there was no more for at least 20 minutes they wouldn't refill the tray, and finally when they did it, it was only around 10 pieces of it there and this is for a lunch time buffet?! I tried also a little bit of butter chicken which was good. The rest of things I tried were not good at all they included palak paneer, rogan josh, daal. Their naan was good. Salad bar was limited but I didn't expect much as Indian cuisine in general doesn't have many salads. Desserts were not good expect for ice-cream, but how can you spoil something you are not making lol. Overall idea I would't go back there for lunch as it is not a good quality-price ratio. Service was good though.
