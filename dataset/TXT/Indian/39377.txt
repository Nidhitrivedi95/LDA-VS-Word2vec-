oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q This is the sibling restaurant of Asian Wok n Roll that's down the road.

Though this place is small without a reservation you'll be waiting for a while, and in general the restaurant gets packed quickly. 
I found the fountain in the centre of the restaurant a bit of a distraction because it can be a nuisance to get around especially during the dinner time rush of people sitting along the sides. 

Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgable of what was recommended.  

In terms of food; what stood out from the rest was their Chicken pakora 5/5: not oily, freshly made, perfect size and great presentation...it was perfection.
Their chili chicken was alright about a 2/5 reason being, the pieces of chicken were huge, and I felt that the chicken could have been stir fried a bit longer.
Crispy beef 4/5 beatiful presentation, taste was pretty good, but most of all it was soft...hence easy on the teeth, and portions were sufficient.
Chicken Hakka noodles was about a 3.5/5, portion was great, taste was ALRIGHT, I still thnk Goodluck Hakka restuarant in Scarborough still makes the best.
Manchurian Eggplant; 2/5, I dont think it was even manchurian, it lacked the manchurian spice...,...... 

not to sound BIAS, but I find there's more competition our EAST where most of the better Hakka restaurants are located.
