45OH7rpeWRzXelgpxs2BRw Disappointed!!! Firstly you have to PAY before you sit... then we are informed our order will take 30 min or so... then they served the vada with watered down sambar n chutney.. the thali did not have anything good... waste of time and money.. the pictures at the front are deceiving... would neither refer or go here again! Utter disappointment! :(
