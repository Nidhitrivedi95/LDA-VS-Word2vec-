5OHW43gqdoWOGWDmUmps6A Had Maja for the first time this past Tuesday - great selection and options, everything was buffet style and smelled delicious! So far there is no "dine-in" menu and is more of an order and sit down type restaurant (IKEA-like). Butter chicken was delicious and naan bread was freshly baked on the spot. Friendly and quick service. Only thing to mention would be the lack of options in terms of mild/medium/hot dishes. Only 1 option for everything and I found it a tad on the medium side if your not a huge spicey  fan! Worth a taste if your in the area!
