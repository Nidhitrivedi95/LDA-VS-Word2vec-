We ordered a bloody mary that tasted like it was made in a salt mine, undrinkable. They charge for rice and we've eaten at literally hundreds of  Indian restaurants and this is the first time we ever had to pay for rice.
The food was good and there were a lot of Indians eating there which is a good sign. Samosas were delicious. Service was friendly.
