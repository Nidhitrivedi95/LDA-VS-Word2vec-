-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ Food is good! Service is pathetic!!! Make sure you visit there at least one and a half hour before their closing time because after that they give damn about how you feel about their service or food, their only concern would be reaching home on time! 
Also, can not believe that they do not accept American Express card in these days! even a small hawker accepts it!
