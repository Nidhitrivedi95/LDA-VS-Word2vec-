cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w The food was amazing and the setting was really good.. relatively small restaurant with great ambiance... not like any authentic indian restaurant ..had a bit of modern upscale feel to it..  I wish the menu had bit more variety. But nonetheless the food  was really great..$60 for two ppl (appetizer, main and 1 drink)
