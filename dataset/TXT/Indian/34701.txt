Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I am an Indian, and I love Indian food, which is why I was quite excited to try this restaurant, after reading all the positive reviews. We went there for their Sunday buffet, which is supposed to be the best. I was fairly disappointed with the food, as it was quite bland and flavorless. The north-Indian food was extremely ordinary. The south-Indian Idlis were good, but there was no coconut chutney to go with it. Also, my wife and I were feeling quite weird after eating the food. I would definitely skip this place...
