7m8MoWuudrxU98fEw7iBIw I am excited to come back to this place! My husband and I went a few Fridays ago and split the mysore masala dosa and the chilli onion uthappam. Our items came with delicious lentil soup, which was very enjoyable in combination with the dosa entrees. My husband had a mango lasse that was very reasonable priced considering how good it was, while I had a chai tea that was quite lovely.

My only complaint is that they seem over-saturated with servers at this point. They seem to stand around waiting overzealously for whatever they need to do next. For me, it is a bit irritating when I want to enjoy my food and not be rushed in some process of theirs. However, I think with time the owners will work this out so hopefully this aspect will be improved.

I really enjoy southern Indian food. In my experience, it tends to be a bit lighter than what one might typically see at an Indian restaurant. Some of the items might catch customers off guard, but go for it! This is a really tasty place serving a tasty type of food.
