Aol8whdcT7BfnhUCnfa1lw I am not an expert on Indian food. What I can say is this, the Naan bread was good. Palou rice not that good... A bit dry.. lamb curry and chicken kashmiri not too spicy... Price is below $40 for two ... A bit cold inside maybe due to open window in the kitchen ... Waiter is friendly .. A bit dark although we can in around noon time ... There is no smell of curry in our clothing after we left the restaurant ... 8 hrs after we had lunch ... I am still feeling bloated .... :(((
