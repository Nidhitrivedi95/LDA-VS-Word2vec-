7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Been here a few times. Food is excellent....if it ever shows up at your table! They need to hire a front of house manager. They are newcomers who don't understand how to run a restaurant. Staff isn't trained. Although owner is a very nice guy, their service is executed miserably. Tandul - a great test of patience.
