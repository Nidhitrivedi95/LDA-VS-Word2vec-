DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Absolutely amazing. There is nothing bad I can say about this place. Clean, friendly service, the place is so perfect. You come in and it smells wonderful. The music was not too loud. I had the tandoori salmon which was just melt in my mouth A-MAZING! Chicken 65 was probably the best chicken I've ever had. Their ice cream and rice pudding were spectacular, as was their Nan. Everything was just full of flavor! The waiter was a little soft spoken for me to hear all the time, but I'm not saying it was a bad thing. They were absolutely Wonderful. Family friendly, they had a high chair immediately when we walked in. I can't say enough amazing things about this place. Highly recommended!
