YJ8Ehqq4Jr2_xmtRe5aXLQ The best Indian store in campus. Previously they used to be a restaurant but for last few years, it's just a grocery store. They have a wide variety of Indian grocery products and few vegetables also. From frozen food, spices, essentials to ready-made food... they have it all! The quality is very good and fresh. Unlike the other Indian stores, Mirsung charges fair amount and genuine. The prices of almost all stuff is at least $2-3 less than other Indian stores. The attendant is also very helpful and efficient. They even offer 10% discount to all UIUC students when they purchase stuff worth more than 20$. To add to this, they provide home delivery for an order of just $30!!! How amazing is this!! Truly this store caters keeping students in mind! Genuine, authentic and fair charges are their huge selling point!
