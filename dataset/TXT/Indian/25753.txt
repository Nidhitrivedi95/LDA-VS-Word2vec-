hXB72crkUuzBH9CDONTmew A guilty pleasure of mine. A nice little Punjabi restaurant in a plaza just off Highway 7. They always have cheesy Punjabi music videos playing on the TV which adds to the charm. I typically get the veggie thali lunch special, which for $7 is great value and is amazing. Tasty, filling and great variety. I would highly recommend if you're looking for quality North Indian cuisine.
