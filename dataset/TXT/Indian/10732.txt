A_05gZ2QwayLb0YeQ_TItQ South Indian food is one of my favorite. I saw Chennai Express thru the Yelp list. Finally, I went to order my food. The place is situated in the middle of downtown. It's a mini food court with three (Lebanese, Asian and South Indian) resto counters. There is bar table with four and five stools. It was lunch time; the place was booming with customers. When we got in; my first issue was the hygiene, but it is so busy, the food must be special, so I try not think about it. 

The lineup was busy and long, I think it took 20 minutes to get to the cash to give my order. Finally I ordered paneer masala dosa, a special of the day. Then it took another 15 minutes to get my food. There is only one cook and one person at the counter. Going back to hygiene. The cook is wearing a hair net but the cashier who serves the sauce on the side, doesn't it. That bothered me a lot. 

Finally, I got my food, I went across to the park, joined my friends, and ate my dosa. Despite the long wait and my concern of hygiene, the food was very delicious.
