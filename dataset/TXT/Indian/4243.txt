1rVolOOpyyqcy5w366lMqw I had a meal here with a few friends and it was a pleasant evening. The service was good and the food was nice enough but I think there are a few indian restaurants in Edinburgh, even in the Morningside area, that are better than here. 
The food was fairly standard fare and one of my friends has a gluten intoloerance and asked what she could eat that was safe. She was told that she could have a chana puri - which she couldn't as the puri is a bread, so we had to step in and tell her to get something else instead. I know that wasn't really a big deal but it would have been better to get the correct information in the first place.
