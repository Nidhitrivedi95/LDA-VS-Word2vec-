RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I ordered take out from Lahore Tikka last night. By far, the worse experience for ethnic food. They don't always pick up the phone, they close earlier than advertised. On the bright side, their voicemail is always on. 

Nevertheless, we ordered and we come back home to find one bug in the inari(beef Stew) walking around without a worry in the world. I was deeply disgusted and we threw the box out immediately. 

I would not recommend going there for food or takeout.
