x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Giving two stars only because the food was good. Not great, but good.

Pros: 
Good food

Cons:
Horrible service
Late food. Took almost an hr to get the food. 
Servers are not even bothered to ask once they take the orders 
Our server took wrong order and then had to replace the food
Server didn't even know how to place the food on the table(slams the plates all the time), chewing gums. No etiquette at all.

Is it worth a second visit? Only when I'm craving for a indo-Chinese food
