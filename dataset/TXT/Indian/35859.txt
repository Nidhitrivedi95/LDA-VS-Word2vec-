Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg We have been ordering Trimurti for years and last night was the first time that I had been in the restaurant. It's not surprising that the food was even better coming out of the kitchen. There were 9 of us and I think that we ordered everything! 

Other than the amazing Butter Chicken & Naan, we had the Tikka Cauliflower as per the suggestion of the waiter. It was a full head that came out sizzling - this would not have worked for delivery. The waiters were great and the restaurant was full. 

**if you on the west end and have a craving for Indian food, go go go! **
