STukQhp01a__zTsHMBiyow Absolutley amazing, delicious food and wonderful service from this mother/son operation. Have tried their Indian-spiced pulled pork and jerk chicken, both with coconut rice and peas.

They also have a small selection of imported Mexican, Indian and Sri Lankan pop at great prices.
