Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag I really wanted to like this place so bad since it's close to where I live and I love to try new places 

Sadly I was extremely disappointed.... they had a game playing and it was BLARING I couldn't even think straight 


The table was dirty some of the tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down at all smh 

The server brought me a menu which was I paper no biggie except there were no drinks on it what so ever I guess I'm suppose to assume what they have????? They had a bar but not sure what they serve since there was no menu 

I ordered the chicken tikka masala and cheese naan 

I'm not sure what was in my naan but it couldn't of been cheese it was horrible and was not cheesy AT ALL 

My chicken tikka which is my favorite I ALWAYS order this was uhhhh blah the chicken tasted like it wasn't cooked all the way I didn't even want to eat it I just packed it up and took it to go 

Maybe they had an off day not sure but I won't be back I will keep going to India oven 

*****the only good thing was the server was nice****
