DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA Went here recently with a bunch of co-workers, mostly to try and expose several of them to Indian for the first time.  The Tadka buffet has an extensive selection of dishes to choose from as well as a chef making fresh-made dosas and other rice-based savory pancakes.

The buffet consisted of many of your favorite items (like tandoori chicken and paneer) along with a few I'd never had before and a (small) selection of Chinese items from the Bamboo Gardens side of the house.  Most of their dishes are on the hotter (i.e., spicier) side of the other buffets I've had around town, but many of my Indian colleagues swear by this place as the most authentic tasting of them all.

A little on the pricier side, but a fine meal with plenty of options to choose from.
