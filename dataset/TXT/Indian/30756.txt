KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Oh yum - this place is just deeeelish! I'm always on the search for really good Indian restaurants and this has quickly become my favorite. It's a nice set-up, with friendly servers and complete with a bar. The food is fantastic. We usually go for dinner and have ordered a number of dishes. The prawns are always large, the chicken tikka masala is divine and the naan is perfect. Tonight we tried the chicken makhani (spl?) and the chicken andhra. They were both just fantastic. You could taste the grilled, chardness of the chicken in the makhani. And the depth of the flavors in the andhra were amazing. The makhani is quite a rich dish and the andhra was served chicken none in (which keep in mind gives you really tender meat). Don't give this place a miss. Josie the server is always super pleasant and very knowledgable about the menu!
