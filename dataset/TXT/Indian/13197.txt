b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA I always look forward to indulging at Sahib from time to time. If I could give 3.5 stars I would.
I can go on and on about how great the food  is!
I have two slight knocks about the restaurant. First is the consistency of the food. What I mean by that is, I will order the same dish a few weeks apart and they will taste completely different.
The second is the attention to detail or lack thereof the staff tends to take from time to time, especially when confirming the contents of a pick up order.
