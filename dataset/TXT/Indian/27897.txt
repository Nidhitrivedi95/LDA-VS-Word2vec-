IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Of all the middle eastern restaurants we have tried this is the best.  The flavors of the food were great.  The meat and chicken were very high quality.  Try the special rice (polo) dishes, especially the one with barberries.  My favorite was the lamb kabobs.  If you get a plate with rice and salad (you can get all rice but it would be a lot of rice) ask for the salad on a separate plate.  It is a very good salad with excellent quality greens and an Italian type of dressing.
The Persian ice cream was great.  Baklava is different from other versions but really good.  The eggplant appetizer was also very good.
This is clearly a family run place and this is a very welcoming and gracious family.  Service was wonderful.  We had a great experience.
