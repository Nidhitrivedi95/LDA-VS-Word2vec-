ERX_Dz1prKPk_qXtFhUsAA I've been here several times now.

However when I went here today it was absolutely terrible. Only one table was occupied when I went in, and there was just one server who was on the phone.

I seated myself after she pointed at a table, when she got off the phone she started counting money after about 5mins of this, I got up and went to the front and realized that there was a buffet.

Had the buffet, everything vegetarian was awful, I've had way better food at this very establishment before. The server was different from the person who normally is around, I wonder if this place has switched ownership?

I'm not going back here again.
