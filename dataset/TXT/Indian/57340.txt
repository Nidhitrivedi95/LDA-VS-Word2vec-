ybawte9OmM1n5z1ouNaIUA My friends and I went to Vinyasa last night and based on the otherwise great reviews, it seems to have been a pretty off night for this place. My food, honestly, was excellent. However, the experience of eating at Vinyasa left much to be desired.
I have never experienced nuts in a tikka masala, and I said as much to a lady in our group who has an allergy. Shortly after receiving her meal, she began to feel the effects of what we think were hidden pine nuts, and had to take Benadryl and go home.
The bill was a disaster; the staff completely forgot a five pound note that we paid with and they refused to give change. It took 15 minutes and multiple trips up to the counter to sort out the bill. The staff continuously apologised because it was a 'busy' night; the restaurant was half full. Even if it had been completely booked, I don't think that is an acceptable excuse for poor service and an accidental poisoning.
The food, while very good, was ruined by a completely unacceptable dining experience and we will not return.
