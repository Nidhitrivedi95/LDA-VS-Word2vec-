ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I've had India Garden many times and been satisfied for the most part. However, today my roommate and i ordered food for carryout. It was $32 total, paid with two twenties and received no change. Unsure of whether or not they assumed it was a tip, but $8 for takeout is outrageous. On top of the tip debacle, they only gave us one dish of rice for two entrees, and mixed up the heat of the two dishes. My chicken curry was insanely hot and my roommates tikka masala had zero heat. I'm extremely disappointed and will probably not be giving India Garden my business anymore.
