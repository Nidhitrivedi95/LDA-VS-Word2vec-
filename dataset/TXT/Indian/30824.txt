KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I had a GREAT experience!  It was my 12 year old daughter's first time eating Indian food so I asked the server what she recommended for a 12 year old eating Indian food for the first time and she was VERY helpful.  We ended up ordered Samosas, Tandoori Chicken Makhni and Palak Paneer and a side order of Nan.  The food was excellent and I couldn't have asked for better service.  The gentleman who seated us made sure we had fresh rice for our left overs and brought over some foil for our bread.  Our tea glasses never went empty.  I was very very very happy with my service and food.  I would be back again!
