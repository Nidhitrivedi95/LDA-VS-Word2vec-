We tried their appetizer sample platter. Beware of the deep fried pepper! I thought it was a green bean and bit into it. Oh boy! It's a chili pepper and one of the spiciest yet! Took me a while to be able to taste anything else again that evening.
The butter chicken, which is my favorite Indian dish, is so-so; I've definitely had better. But the shrimp dish was excellent and the naan is very fresh.
I would definitely come back when I feel a craving for Indian food and try the other menu items.
