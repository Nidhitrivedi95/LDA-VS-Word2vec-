OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Came here for birthday dinner with the BF. We made reservations but for 630 on a Tuesday there really was no need. They had patio seating available but we chose to sit inside on the floor seating with pretty cushions! The menu itself is gorgeous as well as the decor. 

Service was speedy although most conversation was referred to the BF as opposed to me - we laughed about it! 

The food was delicious. A lot more filling than it looked with beautiful presentation. We ordered two samosas to start and I had the shrimp korma with naan. Sides don't come with dishes so keep that in mind. The naan was crispy yet fluffy and paired perfectly with the flavourful shrimp (even though the shrimp was a wee bit over cooked). 
We were able to take leftovers home, thankfully so, as we had a lot left on our plate!

I'd reserve Darbar for special occasions since they are a bit pricy in comparison to other delicious Indian spots around town - but the ambience is perfect for dates and celebrations.
