UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA It was my very first time eating Indian food and I am glad that Mint was my first Indian restaurant! We arrived around 10pm and the place was packed, yet the staff found us a table, cleaned it so fast so that we could seat down. 
We had hard times ordering food because Indian cuisine is new to us. The manager was so patient and helpful and we made the best choice we probably could make. We ordered mini portions of some of the main staples of the place, an organic tomato soup as an appetizer and a mini desert which was delicious. I am not sure what it exactly was, it was these two little bakes balls in mango and hot Indian ice cream sauce. Wow! Delicious! We loved the atmosphere as well. Even though we were a little bit late, nobody was rushing us out. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends. 5 stars!!!!
