72KojSHoxp8DissRtcXn-g Ji is the sister restaurant to Pukka, which is just a few minutes walk away from each other. The only difference is the Ji is more of a pub that serves indian-inspired fare, than an actual indian restaurant. Don't let that get in the way of deterring you from a visit though, because the food at Ji is delicious.

Notable dishes for me were the butter chicken mac-and-cheese, which was very comfortable and very yummy. The fish curry (though not everyone's taste) also stood out for me - the fish done just right and was not dry, and the curry it was served in was perfect with the lemon scented rice.

I do feel that Ji could benefit from lowering their prices a dollar or two off their dishes and expand their drinks/beer selection. Having that said, I would not hesitate to eat at Ji again.
