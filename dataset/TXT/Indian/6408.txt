3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA First time dining in at an indian cusine. Kindly greeted at the door and sat at a table for two. A wide variety of beers to keep a yelper like me satisfied. We ordered the curry chicken and veggie brown cheese dish extra spicy which was absolutely delicious. Great service great food! I would suggest anyone in the neighbourhood to drop in if they want a bite of culture.
