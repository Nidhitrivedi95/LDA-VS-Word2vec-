rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Amazing. Indian food and I've never had subpar service here. It's a staple for my boyfriend and I. He claims it is not spicey enough but I've tasted his paneer and it's delicious. I recommend the chicken tikka, goat curry, samosa chat, paneer wraps and malai kafta. 

I've eaten here at least six times and every time the quality and taste of the food is reliable.  I love it and will continue to frequent.
