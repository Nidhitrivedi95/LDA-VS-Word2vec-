Great affordable roti. They tend to have a line up so place your order ahead of time via a phone call. To simplify things put their number in your cellphone as you never know when you'll be walking towards Gandhi's and say... "Mmmmm, I could go for some Gandhi's". If you don't call, then make sure you don't walk past the place because the smell of delicious roti will make you WANT Gandhi's. Then you'll have to wait for being indecisive. 

When they sell you a hot it is very hot. When they sell you a medium it is also kind of hot. If your not used to hot foods then you will be able to feel the hot spice as it travels throughout  your digestive track... all the way to the end (if you catch my drift). Order a Mild.

Everything I've tried here is very tasty. 

Footnote regarding the previous comment about them being closed on weekends. That is only for the summer. I can't say when they consider the summer over though.
