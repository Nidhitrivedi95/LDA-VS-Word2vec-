-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg The food was good, the staff is terrible. We went there and from the moment we stepped in the guy with the beard was being sarcastic. We sat down and ordered. He  came unto me and said" we have a problem, we don't allow texting in the restaurant." He then TOOK MY phone and put in the the other waiters pocket, and said" your gonna take her phone right" and I said NO give me my phone back. He said" a no from a girl means yes", which I thought was completely rude and disrespectful. Trying not to make a scene I asked for it back creeped out at this point. I then asked the waiter for tomato chutney, he looked at me as if I asked him for tiramasu or something and then proceeded to say we don't have chutney but he will bring something. What they brought was sriracha sauce mixed with a tomato,and I can vouch for this because everyone my table tried it and agreed with it. I was really annoyed at this point and told the bald bearded guy that this was not chutney put some weird mix they put together. This is the first bad experience I have had here, but it was bad enough to make me not want to come back for such horrible and rude service.
