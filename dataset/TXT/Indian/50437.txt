UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I am torn whether to give this restaurant two or three stars. The food was alright, but not up to the high standards of Toronto Indian fare. Granted, my meal was inexpensive and the portions were huge, but the taste was lacking. The woman who seated us was wonderful. If she was a host, I hope she will be promoted to a serving position. Our server, however, was terrible. She scoffed at my husband when he said he wanted his meal to be spicy. When his food came, it wasn't what he ordered. We didn't want to bring it up, partially because our server was moody and partially because we'd discussed trying something new anyway. After we received our food, our server continued to act like she detested our presence and didn't speak another word other than when she came to clear our plates. At that time, I asked for a to-go box. After I had cleared my leftovers into the box, our server took all the plates except for my husband's (because he was clearing his food into the to-go box as well) and then stood, watching my husband, with a scowl on her face until he was done. When she brought our cheque, again, she said absolutely nothing. Finally, she glared at me, without saying a word, the entire time my card was running. We're polite customers and since I've spent a lot of time working in the service industry, I'm well aware what it is like to be a server and how customers should act. That said, I'm wholly confident that we did nothing to provoke our server to act like we took a wiz on her parade. The whole experience was weird. It seemed like the other servers were much nicer and I wonder if we just came on an off night for the food. Regardless, I doubt we'll be back, since there are too many other options in this city to justify giving someplace sub-par a second chance.
