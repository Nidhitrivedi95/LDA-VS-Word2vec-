eZw3cZVQzVEdzsAzPswryg Great new Hakka Place in Mississauga.  We had take-out chicken pakoras, manchurian chow mien and manchurian chicken.   We also had hot and sour soup, quick tip, add soy sauce and Siracha sauce....so good!! I will definitely be back, it's nice to have a local Hakka place close to south-west Etobicoke.
