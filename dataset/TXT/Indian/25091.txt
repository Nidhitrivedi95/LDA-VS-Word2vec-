h8bJb1dIwPmUGiqstCy7lw Maybe this review might need a second chance in the future...but as of my last visit there, I'm not planning to return unless I'm conveniently nearby. 

My friend, that lives outside of Toronto, came to visit me and we always go out for Indian food when she comes to visit. It's what we do best. After reading some good reviews from Yelp, I brought her here for early dinner. Since we were hungry after shopping around Queen St. West area, we decided to go for an early dinner here at 5PM. Yes, we knew they just opened, but we saw a table of 4 already seated, so it seemed appropriate to go in right at 5PM. 

The waiter was nice, but the service was quite slow....and do put in consideration, it was only two seated tables at the time - us and one other table. The man gave us the menu, but did not give us any water. We had to ask for it. After ordering, it took 25-30 minutes for them to bring out our food. The waiters didn't come by to check on us or fill up our empty water glasses. My friend had to ask them for more water. It was an awkward dinner throughout considering they were staring at us at the back the whole time. Kind of made dinner very uncomfortable knowing we were being watched...and to make it even more uncomfortable, there were two waiters who were doing that to us! 

The food was average, but pretty bad comparing to other Indian restaurants we've been to. When I go to a new Indian restaurant, I always order butter chicken. (I HAVE TO, that's how I judge the restaurant! :P ) This location butter chicken was not good enough for me to crave for it, not as good as the one from Banjara, which probably the best I ever had. My friend ordered a vegetarian dish and she didn't like it. She was very disappointed. 

Probably not returning back anytime soon, but I will probably give this restaurant another chance in the future (maybe...).
