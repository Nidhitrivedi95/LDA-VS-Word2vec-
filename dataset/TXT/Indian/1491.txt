Have had the buffet lunch several times over the last 6 months. Food has been been consistently very good on our visits with a great selection for vegetarians.

I'd say they are a little on the expensive side for the buffet - so marked them down for that  - otherwise a good choice.

Get's pretty busy after 12 - with a ton of Indian folks coming in for lunch, but they seem to be able to cope ok.

Have not had a chance to try the Dinner menu yet.

Overall the lunch buffet food selection is great. Very tasty - good section of meat and vegetarian options. Probably one of the best Indian buffets around.  Best if you can get there at say 11:30 since buffet can get pretty busy at 12 - though they do seem to handle the people pretty efficiently. I guess it's a good sign that there are so many Indian folks going there for lunch.
