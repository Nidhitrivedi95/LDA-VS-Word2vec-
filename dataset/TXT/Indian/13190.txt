b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA This is my go to place for take-out when i don't feel like cooking. The portions are huge!!! I always have leftovers. I usually get the butter chicker with nan bread. I think just the nan bread is already worth the trip. The sauce for the butter chicken is not very thick, which goes great on rice too.
