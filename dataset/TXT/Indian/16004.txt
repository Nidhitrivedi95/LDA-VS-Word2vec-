dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q Come here for the buffet!

I've walked by this place many of times.  
There is a banner stating "Best Indian Food in Toronto!"
That banner may be a bit outdated.  Definitely not the best Indian food in the city... but not the worst either.

The service was good. The servers were always smiling and refilling our water.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and it's a popular place for locals.  I probably wouldn't venture out of my way to eat here, but if you are in the area and want Indian food, the buffet is great!

Most people are here for the lunch or dinner buffet. ($12.95/$17.95).

The buffet isn't huge, but it covers the basics.

The Saag Paneer was really good, I hunted around for the paneer pieces.  The eggplant was the surprise hit.  It was oily and tasty, delicious!

The Butter chicken had large chunks of fresh chicken but wasn't very flavorful or tomato-y.

Lamb curry was all bones, I gave up.

Tandoori chicken was really dry.  But it's a buffet and it's been sitting for a bit.

The samosas and pekoras were meh.  I wish I didn't put them on my plate at all.

They didn't have any naan replenished while I was eating.
I tasted some from my friend's plate, it was chewy.. I didn't miss much. 

Gulab Jamun is one of my favourite desserts.  I'm so glad they were part of the buffet!  I feel like after having my dessert, I forgot about the other items that were mediorcre.

Overall, it was a good dinner and I'll be back when I need a paneer fix!  ...and Gulab Jamun.
