pns5NH--mhuCC1vK-xbYsA Just came back from Friday lunch buffet. Chef Billu made a new dish today - Chicken Chettinad. This is a spicy chicken recipe from southern India, and chef Billu once again did an AMAZING job! I can barely move right now because I had 4 full helpings of this Chicken Chettinad ... it was so good, made from scratch with fresh roasted spices and garnishing. 
I like everything he cooks, expecially the Kababs, Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer, Goat Curry, Chicken Vindaloo and the fried Catfish. Oh, and the fresh naan's just melt in your mouth.
Have to take a nap now!
