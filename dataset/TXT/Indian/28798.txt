jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q In town for a work conference, and after a string of disappointing hotel buffets and sandwiches that looked far better than they tasted, I found this gem of an Indian restaurant. The veggie simosas and lamb curry had me tearing up a tiny bit (spicy), but it was extremely tasty. One of the best I've had. Very firendly and prompt service. Highly recommend this place.
