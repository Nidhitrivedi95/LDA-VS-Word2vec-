h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ OK, The reviews were rather depressing and we decided on Indian buffet for lunch. We decided on Chennai Chettinaad Palace and was not disappointed in the least. Atmosphere was charming, unlike it predecessor Tokyo Express. Service was wonderful and the food very flavorful and exciting. My only agreement with other reviewers is that most of the dishes, of which there is a great selection, would be that it is just a touch beyond "comfortable spicy". When we left, our table was the only empty table there. It was packed with folks waiting both inside and out. We were the only non-indian patrons. I would love to review all the different foods, like chili fish and chicken, goat and more. Please accept my apology as I hardly know what they were or their ingredients. But the food is wonderful. Try it. Its worth it.
