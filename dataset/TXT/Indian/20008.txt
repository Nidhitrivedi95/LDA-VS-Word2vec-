FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I wish it wasn't so easy to order from Maharani because I'm always happy I ordered and have Indian delivery, but their Indian definitely isn't the best in Madison, and then (personal problem) I always end up eating too much because Indian is addicting and then I am too full.
It is also a bit on a pricey side.
I will say though-  the non-vegetable dinner for 2 ($48) will feed at least 3 people with left overs, and is really great when you're in no decision to choose.
It's a great standby option, but there are likely better options.
