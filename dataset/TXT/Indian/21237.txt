GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Food: Indian Food
Staff: Friendly and helpful
Atmosphere: Small little restaurant, but plenty of seats for everyone.  
Parking: There is plenty of parking because it is located in a strip mall, but if you are coming along Apache from the west you'll have to make a U-turn down the road.

I've been traveling a lot lately and when I do I have a tendency to watch a lot of Food Network shows.  This place was on an episode of Diner, Drive-ins, and Dives the week before I was going to be in town so I decided to drop in.

Whenever I try a new Indian place I go with the standard Chicken Tikka Marsala and garlic naan.  Since I decided to dine in, I also got a mango lassi to cool down the sauce if needed.

When the dish came out, it seemed like there wasn't much chicken in the dish, but it was really hiding under the sauce.  The sauce had a nice spice to it, I would say closer to hot than warm.  The mango lassi came in handy.  The sauce was also extremely smooth, almost as if it had been processed.  I'm also guessing they finished it off with a touch of butter to give it a nice silky texture.

The garlic naan was good, but had a slight after taste of something.  I'm guessing it was the fuel they used in their oven to cook it, but I can't be sure.

The mango lassi was okay.  The texture was good, but I had hoped for a bit more mango flavor.

So, back to the sauce.  The sauce was so good, that I decided to order a cheese naan to dip in it.  It was good (turned it into an Indian pizza), but the cheese naan is bit heavy.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive and alway kept my water full.

Overall it was good and would be in my top three Indian places.  I'll be back and I'll have to dry the garlic naan and mango lassi again to see if it improves, if so, it would be five stars from me.
