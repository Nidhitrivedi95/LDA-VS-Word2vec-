CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA My husband and I stopped  by for lunch.  The food was amazing!  We shared the lamb curry.  The lamb was very tender.  The lunch special had so much for very little price.  We were so full by the time we finished.  The Naan bread,  samosa, tea,  etc was all included.  Very satisfied.  We will definitely be back!  All my friends will be hearing about this wonderful place!  PS: the wait staff was amazing as well. 5 stars all the way!
