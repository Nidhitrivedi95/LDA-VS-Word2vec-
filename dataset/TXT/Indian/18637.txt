eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg I miss this place!

We used to live around the corner from Flavors of India and went here at least a couple times a month.

Favorite dishes were Malai Kofta (sp?) and Palak Paneer. My husband loved their lamb dishes.

Their lunch buffet was just okay. Could have a better selection.

Service was always good. They are sooo nice. One time we ordered takeout and my husband who was sick at the time picked it up. The girl at the counter offered him a little baggie of spices to help with his ailment. How sweet and thoughtful! 

When we eat in for dinner, we enjoy the Indian beer, and my husband REALLY enjoys the Bollywood music videos. Hmmm... could it be the completely gorgeous Indian women dancing around in saris?
