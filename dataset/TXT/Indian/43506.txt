ROUjTKM6H56_hJqIDKrjnw Lunch buffet for $10 is a good deal. However, the rice was really disgusting. I have never had rice with such a disgusting aroma. I don't know what they could have possibly put in it to create such a stench. I tried both types of rice they had, and they are both just as nasty. The curries had what I referred to my friends as "debris" in them. Big chunks of spices and small pieces of chicken bones were everywhere in the food. Professional cooks preparing food for patrons shouldn't be this amateur and have chunks of non-edibles loose throughout their dishes. The butter chicken is sub-par. Everything else is mediocre at best.

Other than these misdemeanors, the staff were great and the setting delightful. The deserts were delicious, especially the goopy flan-type thing. Overall, not bad for $10 but stay far away from the rice.
