P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg This place is no looker, and the service isn't what people come for (that's not to say it's bad, but it's not great). But, it is a great hakka place!

Note: everything here is fried...which I love, but not all do. We ordered the house special chicken, which was like chicken pakoras (they were super hot, still juicy on the inside and well spiced), the spicy tofu (this was great, would definitely recommend this! super flavourful...just yum), the spicy fish (see tofu comment...get this one too!), and the green mango salad (this actually was closer to a mango salad than a green mango salad, which was super delicious...it had nuts, some coriander, riper than green, sprinkled with a little sugar...more dessert adjacent). The whole meal comes with ride too!

And because it's in the suburbs, it's much closer to suburb prices for portions :D.
