5yaEPRR_BZALSqJPVMzL0w If you are a vegetarian, this is not the first option that should cross your mind. If you are looking for low fat / sodium / healthy food this is also not the place that should cross your mind. 

Nevertheless I still ended up there for the second time in almost 11 years. Wanted a quick vegetarian Thali for a senior visiting us and all we had at home was non Asian food. Thinking she might not like non Asian food I went next door to a newly opened restaurant that had a Thali on the menu, but they were still not ready completely. As I had little time I ended up at Zeerah. 

Ordered a Mixed Vegetables Curry a rice and a Paratha. All the three items had excessive grease and were overly seasoned. Not a good experience. 

The vegetables were clearly not fresh cut in the
kitchen - they came from a frozen bag. The flat bread was overly chewy and full of grease.
