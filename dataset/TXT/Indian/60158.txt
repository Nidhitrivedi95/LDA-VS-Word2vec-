zlF2RzJYTgZRbzFbhe3zTA Unfortunately, this franchise location has gone downhill somewhat. I walked in to have lunch one day, and the lights were turned off! My immediate thought was they were trying to save money. The lunch menu was also gone it was a la Carte all the way.

I had dined here several times in the past, and I was very familiar with the broad range of curries and specialty dishes they offered, but the last time I was there quality had gone down hill.

It was also expensive, around $25-30 per person for lunch, and I was surprized when I ordered the nan that it was dry, very strange.

Raising prices and dropping the lunch menu I think will be their downfall. Too bad.
