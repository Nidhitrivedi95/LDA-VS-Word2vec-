OJfFKXx0AHk5VsL5VPvbdA got the chicken shawarma, food was bland, the shawarma started falling apart from the first bite. not a great first impression. kebab sandwich was also very bland, the only flavour came from the hot sauce. restaurant looks run down and dirty, wouldn't recommend coming here and definitely won't be coming back. our total came up to $12, we gave $22 so that we could get a $10 bill back, and they asked for exact change. turns out they didn't have enough in their cash register...
