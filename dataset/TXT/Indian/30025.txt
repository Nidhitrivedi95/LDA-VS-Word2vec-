JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Came out here on Friday night with a group of amazing fellow Yelpers. I knew we were in the right place because the second you walked through the door, you were hit with this amazing smell (dare I saw Aroma haha) of Indian food deliciousness!

Started off with a glass of vino, which was a nice pour. Many people got a popular Indian beer. Tried it and it was super tasty.

Whenever I go to Indian restaurants with Yelpers, I always let Tonya P. do the ordering! So a group of 4 of us split a ton of stuff. Channa bhatura, paper masla dosa, baby corn manchurian, regular naan, garlic naan, kashmiri naan, dal makhani, aloo gobi fry masala, butter chicken, chicken chettinadu (yes, I copied this from another review. No judgement!). My favorites were the Channa Bhatura as the bread was just so fluffly and fun! The garlic naan....delicious garlic and buttery goodness. The dal was another awesome choice and made delish leftovers the next morning. However, the winner for the evening was the butter chicken. Ya'll, this dish is absolutely incredible! I dipped all the naan in this sauce!

Fantastic service dealing with our large party combined with incredibly delish food is a winner in my book!
