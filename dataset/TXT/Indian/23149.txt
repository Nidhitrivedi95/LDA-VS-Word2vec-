gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I had lunch here, going on the reviews, boy its really poor quality. I am surprised so many good reviews for pretty below avg Indian food - the buffet was were standard and did not really have any thing which stood out. 
I guess high reviews are misleaders sometime, disappointed totally with the presentation, quality and ambience. 
I guess people who put reviews have no or little understanding of Indian food. 
By the way if you ask for Garlic Naan, there is $3 extra charge - which is very uncommon with other Indian restaurants in town. There are many better options.
