ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ I don't understand why it is busy with almost all Indian customers. Today would be my 2nd time visiting and I would say the hype and number of referrals that mentioned this restaurant, didn't really meet my standards when I go there. The first experience was when I ate with my family during a busy lunch hour buffet. I was very disappointed at the food, it was very soggy and quite tasteless. But then again I would hear people mentioning it and telling me that I should go back again, so I did today. Not surprisingly nothing changed. In the safe side I ordered take out. The vegetarian Briyani had a small quantity and was soggy and tasted like fried rice. The masala Idaly served with plain rice was bland and the vegetarian curries that accompanied it was quite watery and tasteless. It is a vegetarian restaurant, that being said there are quite a number of similar restaurants that are better than this. For instance Babu, samosa king, and recently a store opposite to samosa king that does take out (forgot the name) had 100x more better taste than nilgris.  I am highly disappointed at all the hype on this place, I am taking my business elsewhere in this category.
