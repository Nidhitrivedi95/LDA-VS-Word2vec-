LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw This review is just from a Take-out perspective. I had a free voucher from LV Local and used it trying OM. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and flavor of the food. We order two combo-entree's for $8.99 each and I ordered the aloo cauliflower, chicken curry, chili chicken, and naan. The naan was naan bad (not bad). Would have given them a 4-star but not all the entrees were available for the combo meal and the portions were small. I guess I'm spoiled from Panda express. Anyways I will definitely return because it's close by and inexpensive for Indian food. May give an update on review. Hope this helps.
