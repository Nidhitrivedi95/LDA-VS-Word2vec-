ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I'm a true omnivore, but I could be a really happy vegetarian if I only had Indian food to choose from for the rest of my life. My husband and I favor the veggie jalfraizie, korma, and anything involving paneer here. India Garden tailors the spice level to what you request, so don't order a 10 if your favorite spices are salt and pepper. We normally get carryout, which is efficient, but sometimes we'll stay in and enjoy one of their fine Indian lagers with dinner. The food is wonderful and the people who work here are super-friendly.
