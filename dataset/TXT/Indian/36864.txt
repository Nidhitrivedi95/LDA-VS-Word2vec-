nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ The food here is excellent and fantastic quality for money. Everything is fresh, and prepared with care and when ordered.  The portions are very large. 
Though the decor may make this place seem like a hole in the wall, the food tastes like it belongs in a much fancier restaurant, though if you were in a much fancier place, you would probably be paying twice as much for what is offered.

I've eaten here with family and friends and our meals are consistently good every time. The catering is also excellent and I would highly recommend for any size dinner party.

Living in this neighbourhood, all the other cuisine around here is mediocre at best, but I would highly recommend Eat Fresh Be Healthy.
