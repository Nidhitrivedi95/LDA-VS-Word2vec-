Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g This is my favourite hakka near downtown Toronto, albeit best accessed with a car. The chilli chicken is outstanding. The food in general reminded me so much of the flavours of hakka food in India - everything is well seasoned and tasty and not overly breaded/oily/fried as is often found at other hakka establishments. The owner chef was very kind and came out to greet us as we dined. I believe his wife is the main server/front of house person and she also provided us with great service. Highly recommend !
