B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg We visited here on Friday November 4 on a trip to Middleton. We were staying at the Hilton Garden Inn, which is so super close to this restaurant. Mistakenly, we drove to the restaurant when it would have been very easy and pleasant to walk. There is plenty of parking for the restaurant which is also really convenient for people who drive.

The restaurant was really busy when we got there around seven but we were seated immediately. The menu is really expansive and wonderful for vegetarians. We ordered garlic naan, gobi manchurian, vegetable vindaloo, and had a salad and lentil vegetable soup. The soup was delicious- a creamy lentil broth with a delicate flavor. The garlic naan was very delicious and had lots of fresh garlic and cilantro on top. We asked for both entrees to be prepared mild but we found them to be more medium spicy. That made it hard to finish my dish. The gobi Manchurian was really delicious and was freshly prepared. The vindaloo had a lovely vinegar flavor which we loved, but it was a bit too spicy. 

Once we were finished, we waited 30 minutes before going up to get someone to bring our check. That was ok since we weren't in a hurry. It was such a treat to have great Indian food on our trip to Middleton and I would definitely recommend visiting!
