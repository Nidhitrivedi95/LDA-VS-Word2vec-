muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw I've never seen an Indian/Afghan restaurant serving so tasteless, poor quality food to its customer. This place is surely overrated, I went there on 10/11/2017 and ordered Beef Nihari, Goat biriyani. Both the items were nowhere near the actual thing, Nihari had a foul smell in it and Biriyani was tasteless and goat meat was hard. They didn't even use any biriyani masala in it. There was too much cilantro in the biriyani which was disgusting. Totally disgraceful to authentic Indian/Afghan food. I'm an Indian, I know the taste of food, these people are just using the name and fame of Indian/Afghan food to make easy money. Their cook should learn how to cook Indian food.
Also, the place is smelly, not suitable for spending quality time with family/friends. If you don't believe me, please go there at your own risk and see for yourself.
