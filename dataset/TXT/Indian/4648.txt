22nkIQ4BeSYwsyaPOczOeA I don't write many reviews - unless it's exceptionally bad or exceptionally good. I was really looking forward to a good meal at Mother India's but their food and service was totally lacking. The whole tapas idea was nice but everything else falls short after that. First of all, their service is really bad. They had plenty of waitstaff but most of them were just standing around talking or staring off into space at the tables. It was later in the evening and not really busy anymore. It was hard for me to even get their attention. The dosas are thicker than what real dosas are supposed to be, almost like a thinner version of a naan. Also, the flavors of the food really aren't as good as most of the hole in the wall places I've been to. I went to a spot in Inverness called George's and was 10 times better than this, with great attentive service and much tastier food. I would suggest you to skip this place.
