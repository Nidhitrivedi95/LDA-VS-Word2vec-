0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Visited because of the reviews.  All I can say is the owner must be paying for reviews because the quality of the food in no way warrants anything more than a 2.  The portions are large, the food is - words fail me- nasty.  Loads of free rice, - chilli chicken - disappointing in the extreme, crispy beef?  So crispy you can't even get your teeth into it.  Miserable tiny little pieces of hard overcooked beef.  Getting stung like this makes me question yelp and trust reviews less!  This guy even has a notice on his front door about his yelp reviews. Don't believe all the good reviews here!
