xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Fried dough topped with red or green chile beef: that should be enough to make you want to eat here.  There are other menu items but this is what we came for and what the place is named for and it did not disappoint.  I would have been happy with a bowl of either the red or green chile beef on its own, but served on top of the crispy-tender fry bread and topped with creamy shredded cheese and crisp lettuce - the whole thing was great.  It wasn't easy to pick up and eat like a taco so I used fork and knife.  Definitely worth the drive across town.
Order at the counter and they bring it to your table. About $10 for a fry bread with red or green chile beef.  They also have sweet/dessert fry breads, tamales, etc. but we were pretty full from our chile beef fry breads.  If we're back in Phoenix (were in town from Virginia) we would try to visit again.
