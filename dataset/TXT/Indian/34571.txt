Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I went to Gandhi indian restaurant the night before here and Im starting to realize that  Vegas does not offer good indian food.  Anyways, the place is located ON the strip.  You can only access the parking lot from the northbound Las Vegas Blvd.  There is a little parking lot behind mcdonalds.  The restaurant is located upstairs in a little strip mall or whatever  it is.  There is an escalator to get up there.  We sat down on a monday night - not busy, but i dont care.

The waiter took forever to take our order.  I ordered the Meat Thali.  The food was bland and not tasty.  It was better than Gandhi Indian restaurant for sure, but still sucked.  We came here specifically because another yelp review said that the naan melted in your mouth.  I call BS.  No way.  The prices were expensive 15-18 dollars a plate. 

They gave us onions and indian pickle without asking which was nice.

Anyway Bottom line is that I will keep looking for that elusive good indian restaurant in Las Vegas
