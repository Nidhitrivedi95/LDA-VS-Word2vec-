A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ Took my family here for dinner. There was plenty of veg and meat options to please everyone. Probably the largest selection of veg curries I have seen in an Indian buffet (well executed that is - here's looking at you Tandoori Flame). 

For the price point, I don't think you can find a better Indian buffet in the GTA. 

We will definitely return.
