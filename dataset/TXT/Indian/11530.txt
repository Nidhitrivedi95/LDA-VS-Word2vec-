ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ This was my first time getting take out there, and unfortunately, I found a bug in my saag. When I called to let them know, they apologized and delivered another to my home, but my stomach was too unsettled to eat it.

This is unfortunate, because I had heard good things about their food, and there aren't many other quality Indian restaurants in the area. I understand that with large amounts of vegetables, these things occasionally happen. But to me, the bug was large enough to indicate some carelessness in preparation. I will not return.
