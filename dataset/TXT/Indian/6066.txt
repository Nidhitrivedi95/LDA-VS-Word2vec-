Initially, no one was there to greet me but I was noticed quickly. I told them I wanted buffet to go and he said okay. Then proceeded to sit two groups of people, grab them all waters, and then come back and ask me if I wanted a to go box. Obviously I did so he took another 5 minutes or so to grab me so styrofoam containers. This didn't happen the second day I came in as I went straight to a waiter that recognized me and told them I wanted to-go again.

The food is amaze-balls! It's on the spicy side, so for someone who likes their curry mild beware! That's why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 3 for the service. $10 for as much as you can stuff into 3 containers is great to me! Also, I forgot to get dessert so I ask the waiter if I could get a little cup. He gave me a little side sauce cup, but he could have said no so I'll still give credit where it's due!
