22nkIQ4BeSYwsyaPOczOeA I visited here with three friends on Saturday afternoon when it was fairly quiet, it was a lovely sunny day and the interior was bright and airy, I did get the impression the tables were a little cramped (although the 4 of us were sat at a table set for 6), it is possible that if it was busier than it could be a problem.

I've never had an Indian Tapas before and was looking forward to trying it, normally when I go for an Indian meal I choose something I know I'll like and no doubt miss out on lots of interesting dishes. We each picked one dish we wanted and then selected two more, so we had 6 dishes between the four of us plus a couple bowls of rice and a couple Nan breads. This turned out to be about the right amount as there wasn't much left, perhaps one Nan bread would have been enough, those with "healthy appetites" might want to add more dishes (the menu suggests 3-4 dishes between 2 people).

I didn't take note of all the dishes that were ordered but we had a good selection with a couple lamb dishes (crispy lamb with mushrooms and lamb with spinach) , a couple chicken dishes and a couple vegetable dishes, my choice was a Garlic Chili Chicken dish in a pepper sauce which was delicious, although a too spicy/hot for some peoples tastes. All six different dishes we ordered were lovely and well cooked as were the rices & naans. Definitely worth a return visit.
