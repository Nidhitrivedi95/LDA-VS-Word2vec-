tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA We make Indian food at home but we e been hesitant to eat at an Indian restaurant. Today we found ourselves on the east side at lunch time and didn't want to eat the same ol thing so I decided let's try India Oven! I am so glad we did. The atmosphere is nice, clean and inviting. Everyone working was super helpful and had fun with our 1 year old. We tried the buffet which again is a first and again I was really glad we did! Fresh and delicious!
