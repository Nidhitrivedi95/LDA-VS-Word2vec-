gJliACNKY4rK30BTMIzwsQ Everything about Kismot was excellent. Food was outstanding. Great family owned restaurant. You must try Mum's chicken and the massalan chocolate. Incredible and a first for me. I would come back in a heart beat. Staff was great with my young kids and, surprisingly, they enjoyed the good too. Make reservations as it is booked often, we were lucky to be seated without reservations from what we observed. Check it It out if you can.
