_4UyKqVcyO8xajUgMKK-Nw I was in Montreal for the weekend, and being a college student, I was looking to spend as little money as possible. Thankfully, that didn't mean that I had to skimp on absolutely AMAZING food.

This place was excellent. It was clean despite the unassuming storefront, and the decor set a great mood (despite the somewhat unnerving Christian art on the walls). But most importantly, the food was impeccable.

One of my friends didn't like Indian food before he arrived; he left the restaurant with a newfound respect for the cuisine. Their lamb was tender. Their curry was delicious. Even their naan and their Basmati rice, side dishes that came with every meal, were amazing. And our servers were extremely polite.

At the end of the meal we were given scented towels to wipe our hands clean. All in all, this place is excellent. Would do business again.
