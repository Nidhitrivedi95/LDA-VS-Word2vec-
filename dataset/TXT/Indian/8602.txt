7vgWonwfqRt9pxR1c00Ulw I used to come here for their decent food for brossard standard, but the service is so bad that i cannot recommand this restaurant anymore. The waiters are slow and unprofessional. We flagged one down from the cash registered, he just nodded at us, then went to the kitchen, returns at the cash and answers the phone that just rang! Totally ignored us! Will not be returning.
