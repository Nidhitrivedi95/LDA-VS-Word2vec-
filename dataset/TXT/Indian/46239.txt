sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ As a long time customer, I was disappointed tonight as our butter chicken roti's portion size has shrunk considerably and the potato content has swelled. That it all still tastes fine is a consolation, however I am now open to trying out new roti places downtown...something I never thought I'd have to say about Gandhi's.
