yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I have eaten Indian food at several restaurants and I truly believe this is the best I've had. It is very flavorful, authentice cuisine. Everytime I have had Indian food somewhere else after eating here, I have been disappointmed. Although it takes a while to place an order and receive your food, it is clearly family owned and operated so I don't even mind.
