J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ We went to this restaurant because of the great reviews, unfortunately it wasn't as we expected.

we ordered the spring rolls, was a good portion about 6 peaces for 5$ and it was good but I think you cant mess up spring rolls!
For the mains we ordered the prawns tandoori (dry).A lamp karahi tasted like a leaver. vegetable baryani was not fluffy as an indian rice should be.
The service was ok I guess .

The place smelled like some aromatic herbs but I think a restaurant shouldn't smile like any thing but food or clean scent .
