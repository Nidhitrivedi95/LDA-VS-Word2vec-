-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Forget the old Pasanad and HELLO Chutney's!  The owner is bringing what real Indian food should look and taste like directly from the culinary capital of the world: San Francisco!  Order the "Lollipop Chicken" when it is being served and keep going back for more as, compared to Pasand, you have many options for your entree.  The only set-back outside of the new bright and cheery interior is the wait-staff is fairly young and inexperienced.  Ordering a dry martini was a challenge and was sent back as I basically got  a glass of vermouth and vodka-- not shaken, not stirred.  Why have a bar if you don't know how to use it?  Best bet:  stick with the Flying Horse beer.  A delicious way to wash down the spicy European influenced cuisine.  The joy and happiness the owner brings to environment is a welcomed changed form that dreary, drab, processed Indian food serving Pasand was.  Night and day.  Once the staff is up to snuff, this will be a five start rating for sure!
