uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w Food is good but the service was terrible when I ordered carry out. My food was supposed to be ready 20 minuyes after i placed my order but wasnt ready until 40 minutes after I ordered. After I paid, the guy didn't give me my change then gave me an attitude when I asked for it. Service is usually fine but this was a very unpleasant experience, I don't think I'll be back.
