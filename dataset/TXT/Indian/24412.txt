h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Tasty food, but nasty workers and sloooooow service. Surprisingly when you enter this restaurant it's actually a simple,modern decor.  I say that because from the outside it looks like a run of the mill shabby Indian restaurant. It is often dusty inside though. Go here if you're having a desperate craving for South Indian food. Because be prepared to wait at least 30 to 40 minutes for food. Be prepared that they react poorly to any special requests such as please less spicy for my kid or no tomatoes. 3 out of 5 times they get my order wrong. Also, I happened to see the kitchen staff heading in to work and as my husband summed it up...they look like people who might have been living in the slums that were brought over to be paid poorly. Their clothes were LITERALLY COVERED in old and new food stains, one had long hair that wasn't pinned back...a complete turnoff. I wouldn't be surprised if they don't wear gloves back there.
