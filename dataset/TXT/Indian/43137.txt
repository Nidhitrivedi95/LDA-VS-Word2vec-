RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Placed an order at 6:35pm and the order delivered at 9:05pm and i stay 2 milea away. Funny thing when called about status of order the reason - ' we are running late 30 mins for each order' and ' roads are not safe'. What i do not understand is why take orders when we can't fulfill them in a timely fashion. 
Delivery person says was just asked to deliver. Not sure who to believe. Worst wait times ever.
