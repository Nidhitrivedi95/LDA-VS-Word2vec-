-MpXo24qYu4DazQXDrs2oA My Girlfriends and I went to the restaurant, the food was amazing. Didn't know there are so many varieties in Indian food. In love with the Masala dosa n combination of chutneys. 

We got Thali for lunch and it came with gajar ka halwa. Wow!! Loved every bit. 
Again went for dinner n got Aapam veg kurma. Best rice aapam. Other place I went for aapam, they used all purpose flour for making it I guess, so rubbery n elastic. This Rice Aapam made my day. 

Asked the waiter if can meet the cook, and immediately She came with a Bigg smile. 
Also she offered Beet halwa as a compliment!! 
Never knew that we can make halwa and chutney with Beets. Amazing cook n amazing food! 
A recipe has no Soul, only a cook can bring it!! Proved
