0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I can't say enough good things about this place. The menu is authentic, the staff are super friendly, the place is clean, and the food is so, so wonderful. As someone who eats a vegetarian, gluten free diet, this place was very catering to my dietary needs and preferences. 
It is super helpful that they have all the dishes they can prepare gluten free marked on the regular menu.  Just be sure to ask them to prepare dishes gluten free that are marked as such. 
I have been to the restaurant twice, and each time the food has exceeded expectations. I've eaten the malai kofta and the aloo gobi. Go check it out!
