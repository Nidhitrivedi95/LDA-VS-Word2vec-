After years I wanting to check out Banjara, I finally did a couple weekends ago. They have free parking in the front along Bloor (a rarity in Toronto for sure). It might be hard to get a spot during dinner time, but we luckily nabbed one of the last spots. In the restaurant we sat in the space in the front, which has a lot of natural light, and you are close enough to the other tables to spy on what they are eating.

Based on reviews I had read, and just what I like to eat, we ordered four of the different curries. The chicken tikka, the mushroom curry, the palak paneer, and the malai kofta. My favourite of the four was the chicken masala, and not only because it was the only meat dish, but was just the yummiest. The sauce of the malai kofta was pretty great though. I would recommend trying all four though.

We ate all of the food in front of us, and there was no leftovers. I will probably be back, and next time I might do take out and try a few different curries.
