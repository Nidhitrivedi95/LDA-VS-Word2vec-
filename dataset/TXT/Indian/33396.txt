I sat at the bar and had a chicken sandwich with fries.  The Indian spices on the chicken were delicious without being overpowering.  The fries were hot and crispy and the siracha aoli dipping sauce was yummy.

The owner, Rupesh, did a great job taking care of me with friendly and efficient service.

I'd like to come back again and try more menu items because several of them sound particularly interesting.  They also have a good wine and beer selection to pair with the food.
