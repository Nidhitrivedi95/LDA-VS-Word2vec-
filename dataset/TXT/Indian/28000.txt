IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Authentic Persian cuisine at very reasonable prices. After you have their saffron scented basmati rice, you'll realize how lousy the rice is at most middle Eastern restaurants. I love the tadig with a choice of three stews. My ex boyfriend's grandmother translated tadig as "rice in the shape of a pot". Basmati rice is partially cooked, taken out of the pot, then the pot is oiled and cooked at low heat so that the bottom layer of rice gets chewy, crisp and delicious. Pair this with a fragrant pomegranate walnut stew with chicken, or a beef stew with greens cooked with dried limes for just the right amount of tart. Finish it off with their rose water ice cream and tea with hard sugar cubes. Yum.
