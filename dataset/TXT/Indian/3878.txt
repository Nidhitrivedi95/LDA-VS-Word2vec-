0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Went to kohinoor today for the lunch buffet. The service was on the verge of being unbelievable, it was so bad. We were never offered a beverage besides water, and NEVER received water refills (luckily we had a water bottle). Our used plates were never cleared and we had to continually stack them to make room at our table. The lack of service would have been forgivable, if the food was incredible, but it wasn't. The rice was watery, the chicken in the korma did not taste fresh, the tamarind sauce was thick like molasses and they never served the palak paneer, even though there was a marked spot for it. None of the multifaceted, delicate signature flavors we love about Indian food were present here. The best part ofv the experience was the humor we found in the utter ineptitude of the staff. To top off the laughable lack of etiquette, after paying our bill, the cashier (presumably the owner) instructed us to put the change he just handed us into his tip jar. Ha! Hilarious! Tip you for what? Over charging us for less than mediocre food, or ignoring us completely? Never again. I'll just keep going to Delhi Palace. Not sure why this place has such good reviews. If you actually know and love Indian food, then know better than to give this place a second look.
