OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I was thoroughly disappointed with the service and food at Lin Garden. I've been there twice and both times were a total bust. Service was poor and the food was mediocre at best. It didn't help that a member of my party of four got violently ill shortly after. I'm not suggesting it was them but why tempt fate? There are better Hakka places around.
