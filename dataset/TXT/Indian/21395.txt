GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I decided to try this place based on my cravings for Indian food in addition to the yelp reviews. I've only tried the basic korma curry and samosas, but will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu...eventually. haha. The prices were decent and affordable for the college/family budget. I had take away so I can't comment on the service, but the girl who rang up my order was very welcoming and nice. Tip: Grab some craft beer or wine next door and you're good to go! haha
