O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Good and aweful! Several dishes were fabulous. They special made a vegetable manchurian for my daughter, the lamb korma, chicken vindaloo and nan were all delicious.

The noodle dish with chicken was terrible. Salty Raman noodles with some Indian spices. We had several other mediocre dishes, but I can remember what they were. Paneer was scorched and inedible. No onion chutney!

The worst part is their customer service. We called in the order and it took them 45 additional minutes from the pick up time they gave us, to get the order out. My son complained as we had babies at home to feed and get to bed, and the server was flat out RUDE. No apology, no cutesy. He just kept repeating... "Come on Dude". 

Won't be back. Plenty of other Indian Restaurants to check out!
