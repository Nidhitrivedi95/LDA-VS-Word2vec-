I thought the person who took my order was exceptionally polite.  He let me know that the roti spices are pretty spicy and he recommended I get medium spice.  Good thing, too, because medium was plenty spicy for me (and I love spicy food).  The spice was just about right, however a little overpowering over the other flavours.  I can't even imagine how the high spicy level would have tasted.  Next time, I think I will try the mild just to compare.  It was a filling roti and by the end I was pretty stuffed.  I would come here again.
