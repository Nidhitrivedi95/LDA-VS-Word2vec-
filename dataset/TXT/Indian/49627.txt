tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This was my first time trying Indian food, so I cannot really compare the experience here to any place else.  However, I do know when something tastes good, and that was certainly true here.  I echo the sentiments of other reviewers with respect to the service, it is very good and the staff is very welcoming.  There isn't a whole lot of need to into great detail on what was best (you can try it all, after all) but I will say that I found the vegetarian dishes to be better than the meat dishes overall.  The free chai tea and mango drink was a nice touch.  The food was mildly spicy for my taste, but I prefer a lot of spice.  I highly recommend this place.
