XAKZ6ADzAvK_IaFojW4wpA This place gets 3 stars coz the beef nihari was just ok. The gravy was thickened with too much flour or what ever thickener they were using and it was not so great. The lamb chops had a nice crunch and marinade. So that was a win. Dal was satisfying. No lamb biryani. Ambience was nice. The nihari was a disappointment so maybe that overshadowed the food experience!
