xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I am going to have to take the unpopular side on this. 

i was not impressed. I had the fry bread with the green chile. It had lettuce and cheese on it, too. 

so dull and bland. the fried bread was too much and the green chile was totally lacking flavor.  I felt like it needed salt or something.

I had a taste of the dessert fry bread w powdered sugar and honey and well...i don't get it. it tastes like regular old carnival fry bread to me. it's yummy but not worth driving here for. 

I was really hoping the fry bread taco things would be super yummy but not so much :(
