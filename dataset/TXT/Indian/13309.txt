bfR-vJvrjdOJaWsXGJgzPA I tried their snack pack earlier in the week, which had 1 veggie spring roll, 1 chicken samosa, 1 beef empanada and 3 pakora. You can choose vegetarian or meat options. The best part was the dipping sauce. I really enjoyed the mango chutney. Veda told me that it's healthier Indian fare, as they use milk instead of the heavy cream and use lighter oils instead of the usual heavier ones. I can def taste the difference, and it's still packed with flavour... i just prefer the normal indian food i usually get!
