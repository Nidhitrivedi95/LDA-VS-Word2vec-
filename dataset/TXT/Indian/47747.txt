TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Mixed feelings about this hole in the wall, for sure. The dining room and service are nice, and the buffet has a pretty good selection, but if you're getting takeout, be forewarned.

For takeout, I'd give this spot between 2-3 stars. Portions are small for the price and protein is minimal. Our $16 goat curry had a scant amount of meat and I found only four small chunks of cheese in my saag paneer. But the tandoori wings are amazing, with grilled peppers and onions, with lemon. But to spend just under $50 with tip for takeout for two? It's not great.

The buffet is their best deal. Good selection, variety of vegetarian options as well as multiple meat (lamb, goat, chicken) options. Service is attentive and friendly. Naan is included. There's even a small bar area and they appear to have beer and wine. I'm pretty sure you can rent this spot out for special events.

Averaging my experiences together, I can't rave but it's kind of a gem for this neighborhood. Snag a Groupon while they're still up and you can save a bit on dine-in (not valid for buffets) or takeout (minimal discount).
