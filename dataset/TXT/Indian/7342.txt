Only sodas and water 
And the server just stares at people that are eating there food and one of the server just sits down on the table and drinks the coffee and play with her food and they don't come up to the people and ask for more food or other stuff. This restaurant is a fast food place and the samosas are not the regular size and it is the miniature size and they give you only three pieces of samosas and chickpeas
