yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw My wife and I just had a very enjoyable dining experience @ The Dhaba.

We had the tandoori shrimp to start, and chicken tiki masala as our main dish.

This place will not disappoint. I've eaten Indian food my entire life, at many different places, and I can tell you with confidence that this place is legit. 

If you're on the fence about trying it out, give it a go, you will not regret it!
