K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I love this restaurant. My family eats here about once a week. If anything were to be as close to home made this would be it. That being said, recipes vary. One day the dish may be spicy or salty or sour and the next day it's not. It is quite delicious even with the variables. If you are new to this style of Indian food I suggest trying the Spring Veg Dosa, Masala Dosa, Puri Masala, Batata Vada and Paneer Pakora. Even non-vegetarians enjoy what they have to offer. Also, lots of gluten free options.
