CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ Good food , had buffet and prices are good. Place is small and buffett could use more variety but it was tasty for most part. The staff was friendly and thats always refreshing (one extra star just for that).  But otherwise find it similar to other small indo/pak joints in area
