LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Highly recommended spot in North America for excellent Dosa - love the different stuffing's, variety, crispiness and of course top it off with chicory flavored Madras Coffee. We tried the Dahee (Yogurt) based Vada with Boondi toppings for an appetizer, then the Mysore Bhaji Dosa and also a Aloo Dosa as well. Very popular spot. All the Dosas get coconut, cilantro, tomato chutneys as accompaniment plus the savory/tart "sambhar", which a light soup made with lentils and vegetables.
