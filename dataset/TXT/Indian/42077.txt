QEqMHowTTj5GKvpiKheGlQ Thank you yelpers!! Not as much as a hole in the wall as many stated, but far from fine dining.  If you ever wanted to taste the famous Indian food found on road sides in India, now's your chance. The flavours and options are more what grandma used to make rather than what you would find in a restaurant.

Just found my new favorite restaurant.
