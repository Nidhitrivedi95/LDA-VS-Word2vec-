sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Amazingly delicious West Indian-style rotis. Probably best in the city. The butter chicken and saag paneer have both proven fairly addictive. 

Large portions. It's not a bad idea to split a roti with someone - which, at $13.00, is a cheap meal for two.

Nice takeout to enjoy in a nearby park.
