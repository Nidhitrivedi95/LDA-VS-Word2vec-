I had the eggplant from the Afghani Specialty menu with naan, and it was delicious but too much food, which was actually OK because I just boxed up the leftovers in a doggie bag (even if I had a dog, I wouldn't share). I also ordered a veggie samosa, which I had one yummy bite, exclaimed how good it was, and it was finished off in "taste testing" by my dinner mates. 

The naan was really useful, especially at soaking up some of the hot spices in the other dishes that my group ordered.

I'd like to try other items on the menu too, as they have a diverse assortment including gyros! Looking forward to visiting again.
