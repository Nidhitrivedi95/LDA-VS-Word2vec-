ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Saffron is my favorite Indian restaurant in Charlotte. Some of the negative reviews listed involve the lunch buffet which I have not had. Had dinner there last night and loved it. The service is very good and just can't fault the food. 

Here's my summary: 

Cleanliness: Good 
Food: Excellent
Service: Good

Parking is a little challenging, but located a spot around the corner. No bigs. I'm very particular about service and food...thumbs up from me with 5 stars.
