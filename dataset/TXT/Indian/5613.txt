3frFidAcPVYAFB2RxxkIdA Went for the buffet. Had been there before, didn't like it as much before, but wasn't as bad as I thought it was the 2nd time around. Would have liked a bit more choices for 9 and change I paid for the lunch buffet though.

Will update again if I go for actual entrees. If you go to CMU and are craving Indian food with more choices than the stuff at Resnick and don't mind paying a bit more out of pocket, then do go here. If you are looking for a good Indian buffet with a decent number of choices then you might be better off looking for somewhere a bit further.
