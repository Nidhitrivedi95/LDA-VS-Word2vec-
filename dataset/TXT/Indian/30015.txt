JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng All the food was quite good. The Andrah Chicken Curry was just right amount of spicy at the medium level. Prices are reasonable, but service can be a little slow. The wait staff was neither friendly, nor rude... I guess you could say they were indifferent. The gentleman that seemed to be the manager or owner was great though. He made sure we were happy with our food and was a pleasure to deal with. I'll be coming back for more Andrah Chicken Curry that's for sure.
