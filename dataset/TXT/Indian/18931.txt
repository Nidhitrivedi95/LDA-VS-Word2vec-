eViin_sKOZiPYiUNH3gngg I first went to skylark a few months agowith my wife when we were on our way to our usual place next door "The Famous Indian food" and we were happy with the selection and the quality of the food, and for $9.99 you can't really beat the price.

I went back with my father a few week slater and we were both unimpressed. A lot of the meat dishes were over cooked almost to the point of shredding which indicated to me it had been re-heated a few times, and the meat in the butter chicken tasted off to me.

Wanting to give them them the benefit of the doubt I returned here a few days ago for dinner with my sister and again neither of us was impressed. The quality and flavour of the dishes was mediocre and again the some of the chicken dishes tastes and smelled to me as if the chicken was going off.

Unfortunately I won't be returning here to eat again.
