pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ I walked in on a whim with a friend from Toronto after we were given the cold shoulder at the burgundy lion.

Everything was perfect from the start . Rex was an amazing host and the wait staff were attentive and friendly(shout out to Val). 

We loved the food suggested by Rex and will definitely be back for more. Thanks for making my out of town friend feel at home. Great job, great food.
