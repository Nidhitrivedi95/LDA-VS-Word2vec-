yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg This place is absolutely amazing.  The service is incredible, and you can tell that they really care about their customers and the food they provide.  It seems to be family-run, and they are extremely attentive and helpful when a dumb American such as myself is trying to order things he doesn't know about or understand.

The food is awesome.  I like spicy food, and I order a '7' out of '10', which gives me some real heat and keeps me reaching for my Kingfisher beer.  Everything is amazing - perfectly spiced, cooked, and portioned.

The atmosphere is wonderful too.  I don't know what a traditional Indian place is supposed to look like, but it's authentic enough for me.  The last time I was here, there was a large indian family sitting near us, and they kept talking about how wonderful the food was, so apparently it's the real deal too.

I confidently give this place 5 stars.  There is nothing I would change.
