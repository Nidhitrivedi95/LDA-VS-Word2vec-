eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Come here for the buffet every once and a while generally bring a coworker or two as I think this place makes for a pretty good introduction to Indian food.  The naan is always hot and fresh, and I haven't tried anything I haven't like yet.  Just leave room for some rice pudding before you go.
