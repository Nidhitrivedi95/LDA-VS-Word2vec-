Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ What a jewel sitting amongst the ongoing concrete transformation of Yorkville! In a warm inviting ambience Utvan's Goan fish Curry was a nuanced delight. The delicate but distinctive spicing left me wanting more even though the portion was quite abundant for one person. The Chai tea is delicious too. I highly recommend this oasis.
