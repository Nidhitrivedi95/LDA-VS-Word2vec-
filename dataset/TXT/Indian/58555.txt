YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q My boyfriend and I ordered take out from Campus Biryani last night and found the food to be the worst restaurant food we've had in 2 years of living in Madison. Neither of the Indian curry dishes even remotely represented curry. The vegetables in the vegetarian dish had definitely been frozen and did not taste remotely fresh. The curry sauce resembled lumpy, sewer brown cafeteria gravy. The beef dish was not much better. The beef was tender, which was nice, but the flavor was more like a boring Midwest pot roast than any Indian dish I've ever had. Apparently they're not very familiar with Indian spices because we couldn't really taste them in either dish. I ended up dipping my naan in my own olive oil and spices from home, neglecting the other dishes.
