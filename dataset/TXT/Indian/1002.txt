-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw I ordered chicken korma extra spicy with garlic naan. The korma was tasty but wasn't as spicy as I had requested. Despite my informing Bawarchi that I wanted extra spicy and even asked upon pick up if it was spicy was met with a so-so response regarding a spiciness. I'm not very happy with this visit unfortunately which is sad because that usually get my food right.
