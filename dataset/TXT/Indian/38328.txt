oMt3FrXtmYiP2ayn46PHtQ I went to the buffet hours around noon, everything was warm and delicious. I have eaten at a lot of Indian restuarnets so the quality of food here is way better than the ones near the university area - for sure. My only setback is the price, the buffet is overpriced for the variety of food you're getting. It makes it hard for most college students to afford this place, so with that being said I probably won't be coming back very often due to the price. But overall the atmosphere is super friendly and clean.
