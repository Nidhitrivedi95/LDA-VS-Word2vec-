OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I have heard nothing but good things about Lin Garden and upon my first visit I could immediately tell why. I was not aware of Hakka food until I tried this place and I can basically sum up the food here with 3 bullets.

-tasty
-huge servings
-oily

While the food is good, I can't get past amount of oil in every dish. Each plate was literally glistening and while it was a delight at first, eventually the oil gets to you and you cant even finish your meal. Maybe its just me.
