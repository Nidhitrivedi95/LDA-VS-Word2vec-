gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I have eaten at Indian restaurants around the US including Missouri, IL, IN, WI and CA. 

Everest in Las Vegas is probably the finest. It's the food I used to eat at home and not like the restaurant food other restaurants serve. The food at Everest is simple and delicious. You can taste how fresh the ingredients are. The chutneys smell and taste of cilantro - which is only possible if it's made fresh. 

Their naan is the best. Make sure to order it. 

I can't say more about the restaurant other than - if you are in town, give Everest a try. You'll love it.
