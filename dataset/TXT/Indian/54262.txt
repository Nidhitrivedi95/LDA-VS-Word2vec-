vwVoksbTKehDP8ZGUQaVfQ I never make it to this part of town but when I got here  I knew that I can find authentic Indian food in the area so I pulled yelp out and found this restaurant.
Initially i thought this was a sweet dessert only restaurant but then saw lots of locals enjoying their food.
The food is authentic, the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is casual in a lovely Indian fast food way.
