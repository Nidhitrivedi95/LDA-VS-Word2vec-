llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Ryan C and I enjoyed a nice meal here today. It was only the second time ever having Indian food. I thought the place was very clean, the staff helpful and the boofay, good. 

I could eat rice, chicken and bread all day but the rest of it was good too. 

Do not eat the trailmix/spice looking stuff if you hate black licorice.
