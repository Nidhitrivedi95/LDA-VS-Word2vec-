Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ Had a reservation for 6:15. It is now 6:40 and we JUST got waters. When we asked if we could order, the waitress said she had other tables' orders to take (...can you imagine how much longer THEY had been waiting?!) With only 2 employees working a busy Sunday rush, neither of them seem to be in much of a hurry to do anything. In 4 minutes, I will have been waiting to order for HALF AN HOUR. I can't even fathom how long I will have to wait before I get my food. TERRIBLE service, I don't even care how good the food is.
