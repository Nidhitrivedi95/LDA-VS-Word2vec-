WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA Food is standard India cuisine, their butter chicken and vindaloo chicken was delicious, but I wouldn't say it's my top choice for India food. 

I didn't like their lunch buffet that much, other than chicken, both beef and lamb were extremely dry. It's perfect for people who aren't familiar with Indian food and would like to try different dishes tho.
