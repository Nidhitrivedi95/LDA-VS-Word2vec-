RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Good food but overpriced for small servings.

They discontinued my favourite dish; chicken tikka masala. They say its basically butter chicken with a few slight changes.  When I get it, its not the same.   

*chanting* we want chicken tikka masala! We want chicken tikka masala!!

They also changed how they make their garlic naan. It used to be the best in the city, now it's just a stiff flat disc like everywhere else.

We had the Kashmiri tea, and it just tasted like sweetened milk. They have to step up their spice game on the tea.

They also make you write your order on a dollar store whiteboard and walk it over to the cash register to put in your order. So ghetto.

Hey at least they're not serving food in styrofoam plates anymore *smh.
