LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Im giving this place a 5 on its loyalty to and quality of Arabic food, fantastic.  I just moved back from the UAE and this place has all the things I miss at a low price and with a great taste. The dining area looks like a cafeteria from high school...thats the biggest negative...but for lunch this is perfect for middle eastern food
