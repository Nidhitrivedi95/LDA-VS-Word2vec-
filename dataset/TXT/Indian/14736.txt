CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A I found this place on the AA Dining Advantage website. I was the only diner on a Sunday evening, although several people came in for take out. The mild lamb shish kebab was spicy in a delicious way; there was enough for two servings. I also got a fresh side salad; nothing fancy. Service was adequate. Prices are fair.
