auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Very good quality food and great price. Not to mention the service is very attentive and the restaurant is very clean. They have a greta selection of different types of naan bread. It's tucked away in the shopping center that it's in and doesn't seem to be anything special but when you go there and try the food it's unforgettable. They have northern Indian style & Pakistani dishes and it's perfect for vegetarians.
