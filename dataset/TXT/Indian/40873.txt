PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g This was our second time ordering take-out from this restaurant.  The first time, we were quite impressed with the amount and flavour of the food - a little costly but tasty.

When our Indian appetite hit us last night, we ordered again.  Our order consisted of the Chef's Appetizer Platter which was supposed to consist of Chicken pakoras, Brie pakoras, samosa & papadums served with mint and tamarind chutney - cost was 13.95.  The quality and taste of the food was not even worth $5.00 - nothing to do with the fact it was take-out - the flavours (and quantity of food for that price) just weren't there.
The balance of the meal consisted of Chicken Korma - where's the chicken??  Honestly for the price of $15.95, I would expect more than 6 pieces of chicken which is barely enough for two people, never mind the 3 people we thought this take out order should have fed.
Aloo Gobhi Masala - $12.95 - more than enough of this vegetarian dish but lacking in flavour.
Garlic Naan and Saffron Rice and oh, yes...3 CANS OF POP cost over $8.00!!!!!!!!!
Total cost:  $85.00 plus.

We felt completely ripped off in cost, flavour and quantity of food with this order.  Unless things change drastically, we will not be placing any further orders with this restaurant.  Our Toronto perimeter has too many other Indian restaurant options to put up with this crap.
