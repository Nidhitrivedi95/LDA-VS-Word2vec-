Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I know it looks like you are going into a deserted building on the Strip but there really is a restaurant up the escalator! Hubby & I really enjoyed the food. That said, there were problems too. Our server asked us for a spice level and we said mild and one dish came out quite spicy. We were just too hungry to send it back. We enjoyed it despite being too hot for us wimps. The service was lacking, to put it mildly. Our server was friendly enough but after being seated it took a solid 10 minutes before anybody approached our table and 20 to order. And during the course of the meal, more attention from the server would have been nice. If I had a do-over, I would have gone for the lunch buffet which sounds like a better idea.
