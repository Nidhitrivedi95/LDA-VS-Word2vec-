VNOz_tOw_Hz3FAJeEHb_yg This is an Indian restaurant my (Indian) husband and I will keep coming back to in Vegas!  We had dinner here tonight with a friend from out of town.  We ordered a lot of different dishes to share family style.  We started with the papads, which were tasty but didn't come with any chutney (surprising).  The mains followed with saag chicken, fish curry, dal makhni, egg curry, upma, jeera rice, raita and garlic naan.  We felt like everything had been lovingly prepared, it just had that homemade taste.   The stand out dish for me was the egg curry - just fantastic and kind of hard to find on menus at Indian restaurants in the US.   My husband and friend thought the fish curry was number one, with a fresh tomato taste.  Only one downside, the naan was just so-so - kind of tasted like the frozen supermarket naan that they doctored up with garlic and cilantro.  
To drink, we all ordered fresh lime juices, which were a perfect accompaniment to the foods.  The restaurant is working on getting their liquor license within the next few months.   In addition to the great food, there was live entertainment with a jazz trio, and singing done by the owner/chef.   The chef and his wife also came over to chat a few times and make sure everything was ok - lovely people.  Overall, it was a friendly and fun atmosphere and the prices were not ridiculous like at many Indian restaurants in town.
