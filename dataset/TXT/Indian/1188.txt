-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg The best Indian restaurant I've visited anywhere up and down the East Coast.

The service is unremarkable, the decor is plain at best, and the location is out of the way for those living in the 'Burgh.   Those are the "cons."

Here comes the "PRO":  the cuisine is South Indian, which means vegetarian and football-sized dosas (FYI, most Indian restaurants have a more Northern bent, so expect this menu to be different from the norm.)  As an omnivore with strongly carnivorous tendencies, I was skeptical at first (this was years ago), but I am a South Indian cuisine convert, thanks to Udipi.  The helpings are generous, the seasonings are well-balanced.  

For appetizers, I enjoyed the chili pekora.  For the entree, the rava masala dosa was my calling.  (My mouth is watering just writing this...)  I seldom deviated from these items, despite my best intentions, so you can say that the sample size for this review is, ahem, embarrassingly big.

Enjoy this treasure of South Indian cuisine!  Udipi, I salute you!
