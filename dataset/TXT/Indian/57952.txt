yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Best Indian food in the Valley. Great vegan selections as well.  The owner is very friendly as well as the staff.  They are also on Postmates, so I use them frequently for that too!  It was recommended to us by our Indian friend and it has not let us down!!   They also have a store next to the restaurant that you can buy Indian spices to make your own dishes at home.
