sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Admittedly, I don't know much about what makes for good food, but I know what I like.. and I like Gandhi Cuisine's Roti a lot.

The portions are huge, the food is tasty, and the prices are reasonable.  I'm with the others that recommend the butter chicken, but there are definitely good vegetarian alternatives.  

My only complaint is that it is closed on weekends.  What's up with that?

Any way, as other's have mentioned, Ghandi's is an establishment and institution in Toronto.  So, next you're in the neighborhood, do yourself a favour and give it a shot.
