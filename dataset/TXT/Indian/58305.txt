Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g As a native Sri Lankan, the food did not assimilate true Sri Lankan cuisine. We ordered the deviled chicken which the chicken should have a bit of crisp to it and have a nice sauce. Instead the chicken was just normally cooked and placed in marinara sauce with a ton on onion slices. Marinara sauce isn't even a Sri Lankan thing. We also ordered the kothu rotti which was nice but lacked vegetables. We ordered spiced coffee and when asked what was the spices they said was made with Sri Lankan spices, all it was was regular ginger coffee. I would not recommend this to be a place to experience Sri Lankan food.
