jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q I had the chicken korma and it was the best I ever had. Delicious!!!! The ordered the bread cooked with lamb inside. Also some appetizers of vegetables that were excellent.. I am so glad to have found this spot. Beautiful view of airport and live music. I love the Indian beer also
