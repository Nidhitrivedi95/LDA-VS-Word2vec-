rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA To be honest I came here because it was on blogto....and I have to say I really won't be returning ever. Firstly it was hyped to be the best butter chicken in Toronto, which is what I ordered. And I kid you not, on a Friday lunch, where the restaurant was half full I got my food about 35 minutes later. When the food came out, it was pretty good, but I can't justify anyone waiting 35 minutes for it when I'm Toronto, you are spoilt for choice in terms of Indian/Pakistani food. 

The butter chicken is delicious however. They use grilled chicken in curry so it's got that extra tandoori flavour on top of the butter chicken sauce, which was rich and flavourful.
