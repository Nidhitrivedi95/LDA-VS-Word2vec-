MWcN6qLWTfRJqLySxwJNqQ So we were not planning on going to this place, but our original destination was closed. So we opened our handy Yelp app and this was the closest location...AND WE WERE BLOWN AWAY!

This place has an indian food buffet all weekend long! We ordered hummus as an appetizer and they chef made us a fresh batch. We were also made naan fresh whenever we wanted!

My friend had been looking for an indian dessert called Carrot Halwa and low and behold, they served it, and it was amazing!

This place was an amazing find and I loved that they served all different types of mediterranean food!
