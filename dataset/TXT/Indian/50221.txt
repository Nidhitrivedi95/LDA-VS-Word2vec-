UAXz2KC1aXpxzV-MLdXbmQ OK, update to this place as I went in for dinner the other night.

It was fantastic!
Now I'm a big butter chicken fan. There are a few ways to make it I suppose, and I like it when it's a bright orange colour and really creamy. I've seen it down where it's darker orange, almost a brown, and I don't like it as much. I don't know what the difference in preparation is, but I like the bright orange version, and theirs was delicious.

We also had Chicken Xanatti (sp?) Currey (which was a coconut curry based dish). Fantastic. 

We had Lamb Rangonjosh (sp?). Fantastic.

We had another dish of new potatoes prepared with sauce. Fantastic.

We had butter naan (I think I got that one's spelling right). Fantastic.

We opened with those deep fried onions appetizer (I don't remember what they're called). Fantastic

I'll be back to this place for sure. It was delicious.

Dish prices are good too. I know it's designed to share, but most of the individual dishes were probably between $9.99 and $14.99. So you get 2-3 dishes for two people and you're good to go. 

I took my mother here as she was visiting town and we over ordered just for fun to try more items. We ordered 4 dishes, the appetizer onions, and there was WAY MORE than we needed. I took it home and had a huge lunch the next day!

It was a little spicier than I normally like it (I'm weak with spices), but perhaps it's as simple as telling them to hold some of the spice (I used to be able to do that at my favourite Indian restaurant in Vancouver, I'd just say "Spice level zero please" and it would come out very mild.)

Anyway, I love Indian food and I'll be here again for sure.

Win!
