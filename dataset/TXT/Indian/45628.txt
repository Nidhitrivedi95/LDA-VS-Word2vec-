ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Pretty decent place for Indian food...especially in lakewood, oh. They have a pretty big menu with all the basics. Started out with some samosas and vegetable pakora...they were decent, but needed more veggie and a little less potato in each.

For the main, I always go with a chicken vindaloo and my brother with the lamb. Definitely make it spicy, but always risky telling and Indian guy you like it spicey. Fortunately, he nailed it and was a really good couple of dishes. Like the appetizers though, little less potato and little more...well, meat in this case...

It doesn't. look ike much from he outside, but nice on the inside with friendly service. They do need to realize though that filling the water every 2 minutes is not necessary...at least when ordering dinner...an keep it full during the lunch buffet. 

Would hit ths place again sometime if I am in lakewood.
