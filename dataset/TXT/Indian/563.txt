-coR5Ch6_HsUAfBWcuetKQ Ordered the baingan bharta (eggplant) dish. It tasted good but don't think there was any eggplant at all. It was a creamy tomato curry with peas, onions and peppers but didn't see or taste any eggplant. I only opened the container when I got home so it was too late to return but the dish name was written on the container so don't think it was a misunderstanding. Plus for the quantity, it's slightly overpriced.
