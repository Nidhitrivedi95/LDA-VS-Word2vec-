iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w This was such a unique place. I eat all over the world and I rarely write restaurant reviews but I really need to for this place.  I was travelling on business with two other colleagues and we came here not knowing what to expect.  A woman came out and said, "I'll ask you what you like and then I'll cook for you."  We went through a list...what spice level do we like, which meats, which vegetables, and she provided recommendations on dishes she would make that all complemented each other.  I think it was a beef curry, some amazing thing with shrimp that I ate enthusiastically even though  I don't really like shrimp, and butter chicken, which she said would balance out the spices but I would have never selected it on my own.  In fact, I typically go for my usual favorites and this was such a great way to open me up to something new. And it was FABULOUS! The 3 of us were still talking about it the next day.  

We got up to check out not knowing what the price would be (not really caring, expense account!), and the dinner with 3 meat dishes, 1 veggie dish, appetizer, naan, rice, and mango lassi's x 3 was just $90.  TOTALLY reasonable.  I wish I lived here as I would come back often.  It was really great.  Loved it. 

I am not sure how they do it with just 2 people (that we saw) and I thought that our service was reasonably paced with only one other couple in there that was wrapping up their meal.  Definitely not a place to go if you are in the rush.  A place to go to savor and enjoy. When we were leaving, she said that next time, we should call ahead. Not sure why, but I'll suggest that as well!
