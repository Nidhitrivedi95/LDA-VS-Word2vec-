The to-go offer is at a great price point and would definitely recommend this for an outside-of-the-fast-food-bag lunch.

The atmosphere is really interesting. The restaurant was about half full when we arrived around 11:45am, yet it was dead silent inside. I swear we were the only group of people talking, wait staff included. It was a little odd, but can't be too picky when grabbing a workday lunch bite!
