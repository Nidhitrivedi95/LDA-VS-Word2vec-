The samosas are large, curry filled goodness and the pakoras are crisped to perfection. The vegetarian and carnivore can peacefully coexist and dine the afternoon away to be unhealthily full upon departure. There's a dessert section, but if you buffet'd well you will be hard pressed to partake. Ambiance is par for the course for a casual Indian eatery. We can't speak for regular lunch or dinner service, but staff has been attentive every time we've gone for the bountiful buffet. Just get there on a Sunday and eat your heart out!
