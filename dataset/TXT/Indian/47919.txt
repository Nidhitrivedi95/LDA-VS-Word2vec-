TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I don't know how people rated this place 4. I think they never tried a good Indian restaurant or had tasty Indian food. We were 16 people and we ordered almost every item on the menu. Not even a single item deserves a 3 rating. 

They had cocktail menu but it's good for nothing. I tried ordering 5 different cocktail from the menu one after the other but they said none of them is available. Then why the hell they kept it in the menu I don't know.  at last I ordered sweet heaven and guess what it is sour ...LOL...They have put orange juice saying it is sweet and the worst thing ever is they even put the seeds and grounded ..making it worst and sour. 

Don't even try this restaurant. Expensive and doesn't deserve even 50% of the price. Try Californian restaurants u will get tasty food for better price.
