S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA I usually don't give 5 stars but I can't go any lower.  I went for the $8 lunch buffet which runs 11;30 to 2:30..  The place is super clean, the service was excellent.  Of course since  I went in near closing at 2:25 PM  so  I was the only one there so getting attention wasn't hard.  No the buffet isn't some exotic king buffet, but for $8 you won't  find better.  I didn't care for the iced tea--it tasted like jar instant tea.  Hey guys  I know you read Yelp so hear me when I say you need to get a tea brewing machine!  I have not tried the dinner hour yet, so this only applies to the lunch buffet.
