-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA First time here. I chose this place due to all the great reviews on Yelp. I'm a fan of indian buffets.  
1. This is by far the cleanest and most modern looking indian buffet I have ever been to.  That is a BIG plus for me.
2. Lots of variety in their lunch buffet, typically twice the size of what you usually see.
3. Flavors were good.  Very spicy however.  This is not mild food so be aware.
4. Would I be back? If I am in the area, sure.  It wasn't the best I have had. Personally, I really like India's Oven in Gilbert as far as flavor.  But this place beats any other indian buffet on variety and cleanliness.  Give it a try!
