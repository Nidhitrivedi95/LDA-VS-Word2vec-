cVdBHFoDjJZX9JOh-1GWHw Best Indian cuisine in Durham. Cute little family owned restaurant close to the Pickering waterfront on Liverpool south. 

Always friendly service (usually served by mother and daughter). We have never waited more than 10 minutes for our meal. 

Food is always fresh, steaming hot and very tasty! Tons of options. 

Interior of restaurant is not anything fancy, however they have a cute little side patio which is nice in the summer.  

Another positive note, they are happy to make minor adjustments to dishes on the menu. 

Great spot. Will Continue to recommend!
