-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Today was my first time eating at Chutney's and it will not be my last.   My husband and I went in for the buffet.   The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very attentive.  The food was good and had a nice spice.   The buffet offered many vegetarian options.   I will be back .
