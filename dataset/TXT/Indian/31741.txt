kXXeD5QOg3GKyyl9QWMifg I live in Kensington and eat here from time to time. I always kind of wonder why there aren't more people in this place. Maybe it's that they don't serve alcohol. Then I'm sure it would be full! I usually get the chicken roti, which is good... last time I got the hamburger and fries which was surprisingly cheap and actually good. If you're looking for a cheap meal, this is the place to go! There are a few other places in Kensington that serve some cheap meals which do serve alcohol as well, but I don't trust their food since I've heard some horror stories... however, Tasty Corner never disappoints!
