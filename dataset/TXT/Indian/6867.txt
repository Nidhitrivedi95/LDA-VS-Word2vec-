4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw Definitely over priced they charge $3.50 for single Seekh Kabab Murgh, the price listed online is different than the price listed in store.m, I am sure there's regulations in place in US that don't allow this. Update the site or respect the lower price 
 
Raita is watery least they could do is make it not watery when they are charging you for it, pretty much an insult to Raita 

Didn't try the naan but yes the Roti is horrible. Hard and overly crisp.

Chicken tikka masala isn't at all like it should be. Also you are a restaurant in America so go easy on the oil. 

All in all I will only go back for the overly priced Seekh Kabab It's the only dish that tastes decent. 

Till I find another spot. 

Also not the place to go if you care about customer service, because they definitely will not be giving you any.
