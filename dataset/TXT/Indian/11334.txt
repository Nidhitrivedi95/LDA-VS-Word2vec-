Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w This place was the first place I went to a couple years ago to have my first bite of Nepali/Himalayan food, and my first impression - loved it! And there I began my Himalayan food adventures and started going to every Himalayan restaurant in and outside Parkdale area to try more food (Tibet kitchen, Norling, Om, Tsampa, Shangrila..etc). After the whole eating and trying adventure, I gotta say Himalayan Kitchen's got the best of all in terms of taste, freshness, and consistency! And now I come here almost every week for dinner, and probably have ate and tried 90% of their menu :D

Here are some of my favourites: Nepali Thali, chili momos, jhol momos, chicken chilli, dropa khatsa
