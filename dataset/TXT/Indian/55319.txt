x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA It is a pretty popular place, we waited for almost 30 min on a weeknight for a party of 6 so I would recommend getting take out if possible or making a reservation. I cannot say enough good things about their food--there was not one disappointing dish and we tried quite a few. We had ordered the paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, chicken biryani, grilled meats (lamb, chicken, etc.), and garlic nan. We are from the states and we have seriously considered driving back up JUST to come to this restaurant. 100% worth the trip
