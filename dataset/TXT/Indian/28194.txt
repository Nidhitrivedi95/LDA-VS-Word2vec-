iXGqaPR7ucNdwK-HapDnCw We Yelped this restaurant because we were staying at the Sheraton Airport Hotel.  The website doesn't list this, but they do deliver!  So convenient to have it delivered to our room in less than 1/2 hour on a Monday evening when we didn't feel like leaving the hotel.  The service was with a smile and very easy.  Ordering from the website was easy, and we had minestrone soup, salad, sautéed mushrooms and bruschetta. Food was ok.
