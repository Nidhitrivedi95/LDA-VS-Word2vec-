Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Tamba offers a lunch buffet on the weekends that is quite satisfying.  Plenty of choice, including salad-y stuff, entrees, desserts, and plenty to satisfy either vegetarians or meat-eaters in your party.  It was all very good, especially the vegetable curry I tried.  The staff is helpful, the dining room is nice.  The only thing that would have improved the experience for me would be 1. being hungrier and 2. labels on the buffet choices (the staff were happy to answer our questions about any of the food, however).

#2 is a perennial complaint I have with Indian buffets... I like Indian food immensely and would like to learn more about it so I can remember what I especially like.  But all of the Indian places I frequent are label-less, so except for stuff that's easy to identify like curry, I am left describing things as "that green goopy thing" and "that orange goopy thing" and "that other thing with the lamb".
