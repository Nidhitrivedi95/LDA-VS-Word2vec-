UI4lGUcqc4YyzXJ2Uqe6BQ This is by far one of the worst places I have been to for indian chinese food. We went here for lunch on a weekend and the place was empty. There were a couple of folks that did a takeout but that's about it. Service was friendly but food was terrible. They tend to add a lot of artificial color to make the dishes vibrant. Avoid the chicken lollipops, they did not taste fresh and we had to send them back. To salvage some pride, they did not charge us for this dish. We made our way out quickly not caring for the food, in fact we only had a couple of bites. Please do not go here if you are expecting haka style indian chinese food, sadly this place is far from it. I am already missing Inchin's bamboo garden in Seattle :(
