-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Updating my review which I had written months back . This place has great food , I had combo gobi munchurian & fried rice . It was delicious , indo Chinese at this place is much better than newly opened indo Chinese restaurant in scottsdale . Service is good too . I had a chat with the other owner and he was telling me they are going to add more dishes to menu . I am looking forward to try those .
