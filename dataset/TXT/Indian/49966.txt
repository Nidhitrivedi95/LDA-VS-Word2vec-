Staff: Super friendly and was nice chatting with them while we waited for our food. Staff earns a star on their own.

Ambience: It's a small place, so it's mostly just a take out or catering spot.

Food: I had ordered Chicken Samosas, Veggie Samosas, Kebabs and the Grill Platter which includes one pound of AAA beef Ribs, one pound of Beef Mishkaki, and two Chicken Leg Quarters, served with Fries and Mogo. I say the best were the Veggie Samosas (filled with so much corn and peas!), the Chicken, and the Mogo which is basically cassava wedges. Dipping them in the Ambli Chutney was just perfect. The Fries and Chicken Samosas were pretty good but nothing too exciting. Unfortunately, the Ribs and the Mishkaki were just not that impressive for me. They seemed overly charred and lacked any discernible flavour.

Pili Pili has definitely intrigued me enough to come back to try more of their menu.
