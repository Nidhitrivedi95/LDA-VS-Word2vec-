jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ I believe this is a family business and very new so they may be working out some of the kinks of a new business and may need to get their staff a little more organized and on top of things but the food is awesome! My friends and I tried and shared M15 Punjabi Thali, and M99 Namaste Special Platter for our meal, and for appetizers A7 Kutchi Dabeli and another one I can't remember the name of but everything was exceptionally tasty, very nicely seasoned and spiced, seemed very fresh, and we were quite satisfied. I bought some cookies they had for dessert which were crust-like, flakey, coated in a sweet glaze and delicious. I will definitely go back and highly recommend trying it out!
