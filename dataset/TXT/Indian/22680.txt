GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw This is the second time I visited the restaurant. My friend and I went last year and were in the area again. The food and service were just as great as I had remembered the first time. 

We seemed to have arrived during a slump. They were switching servers and kitchen staff. Regardless our food was quick and flavourful.  We ordered the dinner special for $25.00. It was enough to share amongst two people. 

It is also a great date night venue. Small and intimate. Will return in the future.
