auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Food was good the first time. We went 2 more times, and the food was bad, like really bad. Half the stuff in the buffet was intermixed and was not clean around the buffet. Second the glass for water smells really bad, get better soap please. But service was good, water was always filled. All in all there is a reason they have not won best of Las Vegas since 2013
