j3YSK-IgpNabCIzWEl7CaA the cashier/owner....i'm not sure of her role, looked at me like I was going to steal something.  I guess not many African americans  come in there.  After looking at my Chloe bag she walked away saying ok ok. WTH.  Anyway it is cleaner then some of the other Indian stores in this area.  Small but clean.  Only had two types of Henna so I made my selection and left. Will I go again?  Only if I have to.
