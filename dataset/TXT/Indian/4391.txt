1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g Decided to check this place out since it's in my neighborhood and has been getting great reviews.  We went on a Wednesday night, and it wasn't busy but service was slooooooow.  We walked in and stood at the door for about ten minutes, because although there were 3 tables of diners and a few people waiting for food, there were no employees to be found.

We were seated and then left alone to peruse the menu.  We ordered within ten minutes--I got the veggie nepali plate, the husband got sesame chicken, and we got veggie momos to share.  And then we waited.  And waited, and waited.  Two couples walked in and walked out while we waited, because the only employees at the restaurant were in the kitchen the whole time (?).

The momos came and they were AMAZING.  Flavorful, with a delicious spicy sauce.  The food came, and it was just okay.  Kinda lukewarm.  My plate was very similar to the thali plates I have had at various Indian places, but honestly, I liked them better at the other places.

I may go back for momos and to give this place a second chance--but I will DEFINITELY be calling it in, or bringing at least one bottle of wine, because start-to-finish we were there over two hours, and had been planning on a quick meal.  Yikes!
