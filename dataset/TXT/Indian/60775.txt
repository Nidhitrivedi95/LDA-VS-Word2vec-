ZqmUmrXkwihgPFjMCYh_Mg Showed up on a Saturday night 30 mins before they closed in a huge group of 16 hungry folks and they did a great job of taking care of us. They had run out of some dishes but told us upfront. Food was tasty and we dint have to wait too long considering the size of our order. High marks for the Malai Kofta, Butter Chicken and Chilli Gobhi. The special chicken biriyani was good too (was tastier during prior visits). A fried who was visiting from the bay area was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was (now that's saying something). Hope they keep up the good work and maintain the quality of the food. P.S. Please sign up with Uber Eats.
