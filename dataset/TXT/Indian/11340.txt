Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w I would recommend this place to anyone who loves dumplings or anyone looking to try something uniquely Tibetan. The momo's and the thali here was amazing. The flavors were unique, tasty and also great value. Food was tasty, fresh, and flavorful. I'd definitely recommend this place.
