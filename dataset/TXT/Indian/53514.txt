VdyTesw5gfEOlMPs7pcH0g I went here for the lunch buffet on a visit to Charlotte with a couple of coworkers and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had great service and the food was delicious. I was surprised that some of the indian buffet lunch staples were nowhere to be found (chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, any type of paneer) but what they had was pretty good. 

If you like Indian food I would definitely give this place a try.
