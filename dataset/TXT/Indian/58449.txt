yi1LdN8dBh3TLN1hTTOrGw Why have I never eaten here before. We came for the Valentines set dinner. It started with an amuse bouche of a semolina crisp filled with chick peas. Then the first course was a lentil coconut soup. It needed salt. But otherwise it was lovely and smooth. The second course was chicken tika fresh from the tandoor located in an open glass both for onlookers. The main was a choice of a number of dishes.  Both the saag paneer and the chicken tika masala were delicious. The rice and peas were wonderfully cooked. The dessert was a choice of gulab jamun and kheer. I had the kheer. The only kheer that rivals my mother in laws. My husband had the gulab jamun. They were lovely warm and juicy in the honey and rose water. All in all a lovely dinner. The place is filled with dark wood and nice staff. I'll be back.
