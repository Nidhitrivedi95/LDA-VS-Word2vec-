3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Wasn't sure what to expect but stopped in for a quick lunch at the buffet. Really really glad I did. Lots of locals there (and lots of natives from India too -- a good sign).

Buffet had a ton of choices and really varied. All were really good. A nd a good value too for lunch.

Furniture is showing its age and they were sometimes a little slow on water, but for those looking for lots of Indian food, this was a really good choice.
