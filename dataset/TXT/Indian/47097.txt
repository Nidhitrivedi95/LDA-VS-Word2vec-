Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I have been to this restaurant several times and have consistently been disappointed.  The service is slow and uncooperative with my requests, the food takes far longer than one would expect, and most especially the restaurant is filthy. I had to clean the light switch in the men's room before I could even feel comfortable turning it off. Even though the restaurant is still fairly new the carpet looks old and covered with food grime. We are desperate for a good Indian food restaurant in this neighborhood, but this isn't it. My partner and I have given it our last chance and we won't be back.
