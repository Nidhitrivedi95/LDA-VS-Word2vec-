B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg This Place is so close to my office that it was inevitable to try. so glad i did, the best, most flavorful dishes are served here. the cheese naan, although not too traditional-Indian, is the best I've ever had. their chicken Masala is also incredible. The price is right for on the go lunches with generous portions. a bit overpriced for dinner with same menu/portions as lunch, and that's why they get 4 stars!
