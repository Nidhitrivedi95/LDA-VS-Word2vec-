TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Just a small warning - this place while close to the Strip is not located in an ideal location. The surroundings look run down, and we saw some not so pleasant people hanging around in the neighborhood.

We visited on thanksgiving day for lunch buffet. Being from SF Bay Area we are used to a large selection in buffets and were disappointed to see very few options. But the saving grace was that most dishes in the buffet tasted good. The prices were reasonable and the service was decent. I would go back for lunch when in LV but would not go there at night.
