CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ I've had dosas at more restaurants than I can count, both in India and North America, as well as at a number of South Indian homes. With all that, my favorites have always been at Saravanaa Bhavan. So I went to the GTA location full of expectations and hope and they did not disappoint.

The restaurant was big and bustling - one of my favorite aspects of having dosas on a late weekend night.

I ordered the ghee paper dosa - my favorite - and loved every bit of it. It was its usual crunchy yet soft self that I fondly remembered from India, and it had just the right amount of ghee. The sambhar was delicious and I most definitely took advantage of the free refills. The only thing I wish came as a side was some gunpowder and ghee though I suspect I can get some if I ask for it next time.

What inspired to me to make sure and leave a review was that we had a minor issue with one of the dishes when it arrived and the manager handled it with care and efficiency. She took it off the bill, had a new one delivered to us in a matter of 2-3 minutes and came to check on us a little later to make sure everything was good. It was and we really appreciated the extra care. We will be back!
