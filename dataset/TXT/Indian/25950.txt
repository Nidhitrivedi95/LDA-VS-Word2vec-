i0vXeFOD6e-DZ8cBwxaQRQ Maya serves Thai Style Stuffed and Dressed Ice Cream Rolls and a small four item menu of Indian Food. The Ice cream is all natural, high quality and fresh made in front of your eyes on a sheet that freezes the cream. You pick your ice cream base then the toppings you pick get hand chopped into the ice cream a sauce get rolled in and your ice cream rolls get toppings and whipped cream. 

I had an all fruit Ice Cream Rolls and My Husband had an all chocolate creation. Both were excellent! 

Maya is located in Arrowhead TowneCenter on the first floor across from AMC Movies. You can enter from the outside of the building. 

I didn't try the Indian Food but the ice cream is Excellent! The Man working there is friendly and helpful. The place is nicely decorated and there is an outside patio.

The only downside is that it is a very long and slow process making the fresh ice cream to order. Once you receive the ice cream the wait will seem worth it.

It's really cool and fun for kids of all ages.
