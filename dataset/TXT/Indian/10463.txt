9rti-kF-oQ7IOhUF3JYsRA I don't eat out Indian food very much because I can just get my mom's wonderful home cooked Indian food. I love the fact that it's a vegetarian restaurant! 
But this place has changed my mind a little about eating out. 

The four of us were seated quickly, however, the initial waitress was a little soft spoken. Our glasses were not super clean. When I took a sip, the glass was salty which was kinda gross... 

We ordered some garlic naan, shahi paneer, matar paneer, and dal makhani, and a mango milkshake.

Personally, I've never been a huge fan of paneer in anything but I absolutely loved their shahi paneer and it has changed my mind forever. I was super excited for the mango milkshake which was really great except it wasn't cold which was kinda disappointing. 

Our total was about $43.00 which was a little surprising because the portions were quite small. 

TLDR: Food is awesome, price was disappointing, cleanliness is questionable.
