vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw I went here during winterlicious twice and loved it each time. The first time I went with my father who is, like me, in no way an expert of east Indian food. He had some sort of chicken appetizer and for his main course he had the fish and loved it!! I had the eggplant for my appetizer which was very good and for my main I had the golden jewel or something..? The name had to do with a jewel or something precious. Either way it was a chicken dish and it was to die for!! The rice was perfectly done as well. For dessert I had the ice cream and soared every last bit. Daddio had the mango cheesecake which I though was okay, the cheesecake drizzle on top made it. That part was wonderful! 
The second time I went I took my partner with me who is West Indian and thought that the food was amazing as well. My partner had the chicken appetizer and the same chicken that I had had last time as well as the mango cheesecake. He thought that it was all sublime, and better than other East Indian dining establishments that he had been to. I had the lentil soup, which was delicious and the butter chicken, which was not what I was expecting but still good. We adored this place and will definitely be coming back in the near future!!
