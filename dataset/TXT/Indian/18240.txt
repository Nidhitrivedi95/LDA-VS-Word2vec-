EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg I just got to Vegas, and decided to place a delivery order. The service was great the food was tasty. The only issue was that my phone died on me (battery low). During this time the delivery person called me twice, and the restaurant left 2 voice messages. By the time my phone had enough juice to boot up, it had been 15mins.

I would like to thank the person who delivered the food,  although being upset he waited for me and was very polite. 

I will be ordering from here again,  the owner called me and we had a wonderful conversation. Great to see such concern for a customer

The food was good, service was excellent.

I used 'beyond menu' to place the order and paid online.


Tips : do order the rice pudding (kheer) it is delicious
