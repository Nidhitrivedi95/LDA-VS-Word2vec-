GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA BEST Indian food I have ever had. We had the Tikka Masala fries which were to die for..tasted like an indian version of chili cheese fries. We also ordered the Chicken Makhani...which was recommended to me by the owner who was featured on triple d's. The Makhani was perfect curry. Creamy richness with a slight spicy kick. Being from NYC and the tri state area, this place has perfected indian food to the finest.
