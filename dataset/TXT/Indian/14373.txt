The staff is friendly and efficient. The music during the night can be a little too loud. I had the Braised Beef Ravioli from their daily specials menu. The raviolis were large and beef filling was tender and succulent. I was quite impressed with the meal. Dinner for two and a bottle of decent Merlot went for just under $100.
