0jQwF4gv9sVV2U53vFyD1g I've been to the dozens if not hundreds of Indian restuarants in Toronto mentioned in David M.'s review, and this place is right in the middle of them.

You can easily do better.

I went here for the dinner buffet.  The three things this place has going for it: 1) burfi on the buffet - a rarity in my experience, 2) the server brought a couple fresh nans to our table (at my request) and 3) they had pakora curry on the buffet, which is nice to see even if it wasn't all that well-made.
