0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg Vegans beware! They say they will provide the dish veganized, but your dish may still have paneer. Happened to me today and I ended up accidentally consuming one. They casually apologized and replaced it. I won't visit again after this experience.

Overall I don't know what the hoopla is about. They have average service, poor ambience and charge full restaurant like prices. Food taste was good though.
