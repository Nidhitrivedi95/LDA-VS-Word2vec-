LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Guru Lukshmi is by far the best South Indian restaurant anywhere around. After living 5 years+ in South India this is the only one that gets the approval seal! 

Absolutely delicious food. I always have the vada(lentil bun) / idli(rice bun) combo in the beginning (dipped in the curry as it should be), an it's never changed. Always perfectly cooked and spiced. The rasam (South Indian soup) is yes very spicy but bloody delicious! But the key are the dosa's, I always try the basic first to make sure and it was great, hence I've tried a bunch of their dosa types and I've yet to find fault with any of them! All of them are just so good!! 

Lastly make sure you have the Madras Filter Coffee. It brings back memories! Go there ASAP! An make a reservation!
