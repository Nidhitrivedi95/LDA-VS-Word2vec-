jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Other reviews were right the food was very good, but the service was not up to par!   My server was the bus girl, she could not answer question about which dish was what! 
It was not that busy for a bus person to wait on us!  The service was very slow we came in before a party of 8 and were served 15 mins after they were served.
