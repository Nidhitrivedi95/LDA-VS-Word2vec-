5KsvP10z9InBcI6hhqjjKg Some friends and I went for lunch a few weeks back and for sure ill be back. I love a good Indian buffet and this place did not disappoint. The buffet is huge with lots of options for me as a vegetarian. Lunch price was more than reasonable. Decor is bright and airy. If I could say one thing it would be the desserts (not like I needed it) , the icecream was generic out of the tub and wasn't a big fan of the rice pudding. A lot of the other desserts as well sort of looked like something you'd find in a cafeteria line. But as I mentioned it was just as well because I had already eaten more than necessary trying to get all my favorites in.
