According to my senior colleague (who has been at Pitt for over 20 years), this is the best food truck at University of Pittsburgh.  
The food is certainly very good and inexpensive.  It's highly recommended for a quick eat near campus.  

The portions are large, and you will likely have some food left over.  You can also specify spiciness.  
The biryani (chicken, vegetable, shrimp, or lamb) is $4.00 for small and $5.00 for large.  I usually get the chicken biryani, which is cooked with basmati rice, coconut sauce, nuts, and herbs.    
The Mango Lassi is good for only $1.50

I think they make the food while you wait.  Call ahead if you want to avoid having to wait out in the cold or the lines.
