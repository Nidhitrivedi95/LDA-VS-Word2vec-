LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw after a friend of mine had a disappointing experience at istanbul (quality/quantity vs price), i decided he needed a trip to salem's.  two drinks, two dinners plus hummus for about $20 (with tip) and he was in heaven.  generous portions of amazing food.  the lamb curry is delicious, the falafel perfectly cooked and very tasty.  i've also had the goat and shawarma which were both excellent.
