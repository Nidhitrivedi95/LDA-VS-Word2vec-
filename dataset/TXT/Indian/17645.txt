DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ Sweet India is by far the most delicious, homestyle indian food I have ever tasted. As I work at YYZ, popping in every week or two for some chicken karahi, butter chicken, or any of their other delicious curries is a ritual. Being able to get a meal that actually tastes good for $5 which includes bread and rice is next to unheard of these days. They also have a very large selection of sweets and other Indian "snacks" like samosas and pakoras but I have yet to try them. The place is very busy at lunch and has only a few tables so if you plan on eating in, arrive early! 

I highly suggest their bhatura bread with your meal. Prior to eating at Sweet India I had no idea what I was missing!
