JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw To walk in and smell the heavenly spices already sets your mouth on drool status. The menu is very friendly breaking the dishes down into vegetarian and non vegetarian fare i had the samosa meat pies as an appetizer very delicious careful not to burn your mouth and the tiger shrimp in cream sauce absolute HEAVEN!  Ample parking right off of Interstate 85 i would highly recommend even for sissys like me who love indian food but can rarely eat it
