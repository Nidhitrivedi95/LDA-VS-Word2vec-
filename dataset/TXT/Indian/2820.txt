0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw Had dinner and was disappointed to say the least. I ordered a Mango Lassi and it surprisingly tasted a lot like Mango Kefir which I enjoyed. It was strangely not very cold perhaps it isn't supposed to be.

I ordered Chicken Tikka on an onion sizzler. When it came out it was sizzling and I was excited to try it. I ordered it "spicy" and it came out very bland. The chicken was so hard and over done that I suspect it had been cooked earlier and reheated and then placed on the very hot cast iron pan. Very disappointing.

Then to add insult to injury I was asked whether I wanted rice or naan with my chicken Tikka. I choose rice and it had also been previously cooked and barely reheated and I was charged an additional $2.99 for this rice which I erroneously assumed was included with the meal.

Charge more if you must but don't make the meal seem miserly  by nickel and diming to get a complete entree.

The setting was pleasant and comfortable. The service was good and for that I gave the second star not for the food.
