OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A This is a restaurant owned by a family. The food is AMAZING!!! The service is kind and they take care of you and explain you the menu until you are satisfied. 
It's really the best place for Indian food I've been. 

If you don't have a reservation they find the way to give you a table. 

Overall the experience was great.
