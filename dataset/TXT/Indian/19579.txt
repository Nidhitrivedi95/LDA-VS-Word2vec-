FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg I really like their food and I have been there multiple times. Their vindaloo, butter chicken and biryani is some of the best in the GTA. 

However, the last time I went there I sat on one of the booths and was bitten multiple times by by insects. Almost represented bed bug bites and left scars on my skin for weeks.
