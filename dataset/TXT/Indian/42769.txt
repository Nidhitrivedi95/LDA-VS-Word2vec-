RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg It's been a few years since Sweetie and I ate at the Blue Taj.  We had an impromptu date night come up and scrambled for a place to dine on a Friday night in Ballantyne.  We crashed and burned on our first choice and thought about The Blue Taj.  Ballantyne Village was hoppin and we didn't think we'd get in on this chilly night.

We walked in and were asked if we had the dreaded reservation.  I pretty much figured we were going to have to drive down to Showmars at this point but were ushered to their outdoor seating area which was awesome.  They had these heaters on and it was like we were dining in Tahiti!!!

We started off with the vegetarian appetizers which had samosas and other stuff that I couldn't really identify but they were all good.  They had a homemade sauce served with them which couldn't have had any more flavor!  YUM.  I had a lamb dish suggested by our waiter which was both full of flavor and had just the right amount of heat.  Sweetie had a shrimp dish that she enjoyed also.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of the dishes, but just going off the recommendations of the waiter we did really well.  Oh, I forgot the NAAN, holy crap get the Garlic Naan.  

Service was a team effort and we stayed taken care of the entire night.  

Great experience and We'll add The Blue Taj back into the rotation
