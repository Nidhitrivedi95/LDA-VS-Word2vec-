Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg Friendly staff, great food, nice decor! I love going here for a romantic date night, or even a group dinner.  They are very accommodating no matter if you are a few or a lot of people.  If you are in the mood to try something new they are also great at recommending some delicious things to try. Always happy when I go there.
