RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Well as a native of Lahore and now living in Toronto. I can say that this place is pretty close to being authentic. The service is very quick, YES, very quick. The quality of the food is great, its fresh, hot and sometimes sizzling. I would recommend sitting outside than inside especially during summers. The biryani is unbeatable, I can make some kick-ass biryani myself bu their lamb biryani is truly out of this world. If you are a little adventurous try the 'brain masala' - yes it is cow brain but its pretty awesome. I didn't tell my friends until after they had eaten and they had throughly enjoyed it. Don't forget to order mango lassi to push it all down.

Trust me you will not be disappointed and if you are a vegetarian all the items including aloo gobhi and daal fry are great!
