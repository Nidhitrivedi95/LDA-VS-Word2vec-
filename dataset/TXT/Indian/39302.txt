oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q I've been a regular Eddie's customer for many years. It is great Hakka/manchurian food. There are so many veggie options that you may actually have a hard time figuring out what to order. (To all the meat eaters: this is an unusual experience for vegetarians!)

I always start with the hot and sour or veg manchurian soup. The manchurian soup is great because it comes topped with crispy noodles adding a great amount of texture to the soup. This is a soup you chew, not slurp! 

My go to items include chilli paneer, vegetable Manchurian in gravy, and vegetable Manchurian chow mien. There's always plenty left over because the portions are huge! 

If you're in the neighbourhood around lunch time, definitely stop in for the lunch specials. There is no shortage of options to choose from and the portions are very generous! I personally found the quality of the lunch specials a little less than dinner or take our service. Maybe because they're super busy or they mass produce?! Not sure. But regardless, great value and delicious food! 

Now go eat!
