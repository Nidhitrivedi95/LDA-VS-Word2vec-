0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I stopped in here on a whim with the help of Yelp and got an old favorite, the Pav Bhaji. It was so good and it's one of those flavors you never knew you needed. The garlic Naan was also amazing. The staff was super friendly. This place is a good 25 minutes from my house, but I can't wait to try more of their menu.
