nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA Just came back from dinner with my wife at Maroli, and we both enjoyed it immensely. Not a deep menu, but very good food, fresh, well-prepared, home-made chutneys, and attractive presentation in an updated dining room. Friendly, efficient staff. Most of the clientele appeared to be from the Indian sub-continent, and seemed very happy to be there.
