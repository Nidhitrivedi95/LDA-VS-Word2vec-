h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA glory be to tandoori eee

i heart this place so much, and that means more than you. raj rani is the cutest, i swear she is hopped up on ginkgo biloba because you can come in with a party of 6+ and she never forgets the who's and the what's.

 appetizers are meh....but the chicken fraizee and chicken tikka are sexlectric. get the tikka and you will understand. 

special naan is flipping good as well, but i usually go with onion kulcha or pudina parantha. the bar is shiny and someday i will drink to drunk here...but i will not over do it because the last place you would want to be flailing around would be the ladies room stall. yes,it is still there...it's gone from disgusting to endearing. my favorite transition, actually.  i have come here hungover..it's a miracle really. sweet lassi will cure many an ailment.

the sticky balls are delish but if you go during buffet hours your balls will be hot, i prefer them chilled, better for the syrup. 

i highly recommend this place...i wish they were open for breakfast.
