K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I am so happy they opened in North Phoenix, closer to my home! They recently opened about 1.5 years ago and the food is amazing. 

I recommend the Gobi Manchurin! I get it ALL THE TIME! The curries are good too. The Indian spices are so yummy and flavorful too. 

I have to mention that I am "VEGAN", because some dishes have milk or dairy. So, they customize it for me a little, which is nice. 

The only small thing I would say is that there is a server that never smiles and hard to approach.  The flip side is that there is another server that is super nice and we always hope he will be our server. 

Another small thing that bothers me is that all their appetizers are deep-fried, so I usually don't get them. I wish they had some more fresh choices. 

The pricing is pretty good too. I highly recommend this location if you are looking for tasty traditional Indian Food. I am a fan and will be going again.
