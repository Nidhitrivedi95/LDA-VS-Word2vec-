z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Extremely dissapointing trip here. Service was average to bad. Food quality left a lot to be improved. Currys have no meat but curry. Taste wise it isn't great either. I make far better indian food at home. Meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy. Overall I don't recommend it and won't be going back at all. Oh yeah their carpets were dirty with food everywhere,seems like they don't vacuum at all or very little.
