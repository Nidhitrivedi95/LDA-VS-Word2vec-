-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg Look, the place is real nice and all, and it has all the right feels for a more upscale indian, which is nice. 

So ambience of when we got in - perfect. But then it goes downhill. Didn't get any rudeness and maybe it's cuz they're new but holy it takes soo long to get service. One member came a bit late and ended up having to go to the waiter at another table and ask him to come over after 15 mins. All he wanted was a beer lol. We made a quick comment about it to the manager/owner just as a courtesy and we could hear him chew out the waiter in the back! Cmon, there was only one waiter for every table, not his fault.

Food: average. Not bad, but upscale places you expect a brilliant chef and many tastings before making a menu. Hugely diverse menu, but why do it so broad if it's all average? I'd put it well below Nirvana and Avani in taste of food.

But still a nice place and when they work out kinks and menu it'll be better IMO. Decor and all is so nice it can easily trick ppl in enjoying it more than the food allows.
