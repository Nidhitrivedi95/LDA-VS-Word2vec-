4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q BEWARE - I must say I was rather disappointed at this restaurant.  Food wasn't bad but the service was terrible.  I went with a group of colleagues during lunch and when we got the bill, gratitude was automatically added to our bill (which was fine), but the waiter didn't say anything and when we asked for separate bills (there was a group of 10 people), he just told us the total amount which was $17+.  For those that was paying cash, he asked do you need any change back, so automatically we think we should also tip and most just gave $20.  We realized the next day that tips was already included and why would he even ask whether we need any change back, and he didn't even mentioned that tips was already included. So each of us pretty much tip around 30%+.  That is just dishonest and I hope he is not doing that for other customers.  The waiter never even smile once throughout the dining experience.  They need to replace someone else that is more honest and friendly.  I hope management knows this.
