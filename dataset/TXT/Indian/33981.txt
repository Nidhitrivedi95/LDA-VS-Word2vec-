m38PfxkTGgINuArSTX16iQ I've tried the lamb curry, the beef curry, and the fish curry. All were flavorful and much better than typical indian food court fare (better than Amaya in the Urban Eatery IMO - the meat was fairly tender in all three dishes). The samosas are excellent and the mango lassi is good too. 

Pros:
- Fresh naan made to order right in front of you
- Tasty 
- Cheap - most combos are $6.99
- Large servings

Negatives:
- On the salty side
- I think the curry peas dish uses peas from a can but it still tastes great

I think this and Milos are definitely the best options in this food court.
