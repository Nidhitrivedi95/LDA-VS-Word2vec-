aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q It's a burrito?
Nope.
It's a satay?
Nope.
And it's NOT a SUB! 

Then what the heck is it?!
Who the hell knows, but it sure does taste good!

Ordering goes something like this;
Steak, not hot. 

The 'burrito' comes in a massive wrap, and while it's make like a burrito, and comes with meat, lettuce and a gritty white tomato, the white sauce/dressing will throw you for a loop, but you'll enjoy it. Trust me. Just take a bite. And don't think about the cleanliness of the guy who made it. (or the fact that he just handled money, rubbed his hand on his dirty apron, and then rolled your 'burrito') 

Yeah, that's it.  
Then you wait for a long time. 15 minutes. *It will feel like a million, depending on how much you've had to drink. 

While you watch the guy (it's been the same dude for as long as I've lived in Toronto - 7+ years) cook, take orders, handle money, then go back doing what he does. 
It's not sanitary. His food handling situation is frightening, But I've never gotten sick, so who cares! To hell with Toronto Dine Safe! 
Like I said, these are worth the risk.

But listen, it's not a FREAKIN' BURRITO so stop calling it one.
