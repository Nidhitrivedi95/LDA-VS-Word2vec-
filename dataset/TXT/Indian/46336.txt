sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I went to Gandhi's for the first time this week for lunch and got the lamb roti! The pakoras in the display case look sooo good but since I've been warned about the large portions I decided to pass on the pakora...this time.

The lamb roti was so flavourful, medium spicy was VERY spicy but so good. I could barely eat half of the food so for less than $10 it's great value if you're like me and can get 2 or more lunches out of it!  I'd go back for the quick take out service.
