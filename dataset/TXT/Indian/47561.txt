TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I love Indian food.  India Palace is probably the best Indian food you can get in Vegas.  The service is great.  The food...even better.  There are only TWO suggestions I can make to management.  #1, please change the GOD AWFUL television playing on the wall.  It is like watching a Mexican sitcom.  They all look the same, everything is over acted and nothing is funny.  Well, the same can be said about what is on the TVs at India Palace.  #2, I like wine.  Servers at India Palace will cork the wine behind the bar and bring an uncorked bottle to the table.  This is a BIG NO NO in wine service.  See my review of The Broiler in Hawaii.  Anyway, visit this place.  The TV is terrible, wine is uncorked (wine faux pas) but the service and food are spot on!
