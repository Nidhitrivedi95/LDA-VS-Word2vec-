kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw Curry in the Box is a high 3 star for me.  I love that a place like this exists - essentially a fast food version of Indian food.  Similar to Qdoba and Chipotle, except they have a wider variety and don't quite make the food in front of you, but wait time isn't much longer and prices are comparable (under $10).

I ordered the Packer Green Chicken Curry lunch special, a soda, and Roti Paratha bread.  The food was quite tasty even if lacking in presentation, and I appreciate that it comes with rice.  Portion size was a bit on the small side, but thankfully the dish I ordered was pretty filling so it seemed like less of a problem.  It had those addictive properties that most curries have, and I would easily come back for it just like so many of us do for Chipotle burritos.

The staff was friendly and helped steer me in the right direction for my dish.  He was familiar with his product and gave me some alternatives when I wasn't interested in his first suggestion.

Would like to see a few more condiments aside from Sriracha (soy sauce at the least), and a little more flair to the dishes, but otherwise this is an enjoyable lunch stop that won't break the wallet.  I'm sure a review update will be coming sooner rather than later on this one as I really want to see how their Chicken Tikka holds up
