DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I know I'm biased a little because I used to work here but I've tried almost every Indian food in Vegas and not one comes close. Most places won't customize your orders like curry leaf will and other restaurants don't pride themselves on their service either. Believe me or don't believe but at least try it out for yourself! (Specifically the garlic shrimp and gobi manchurian)
