YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw I had the lunch buffet on my first visit to the restaurant.  The food was excellent and diverse.  The food was very fresh, properly cooked, and never dried out or left out for too long.  The goat biryani was the best goat that I have ever had!  There were plenty of Indian customers dining at the restaurant which indicates a high degree of confidence in the food served at Persis.
The wait staff was very attentive, polite, and professional.  
The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere festive yet pleasant.
The buffet was very reasonably priced with a diverse selection of entrees.  The waitstaff recommended the Sunday buffet as being even larger than the weekly lunch buffet.
Summary: the restaurant is highly recommended, and I will be a regular customer (including bringing my coworkers and friends).
