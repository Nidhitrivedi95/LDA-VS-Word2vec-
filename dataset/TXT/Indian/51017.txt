UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Very good malai kofta and naan! I think this is good quality and tasty Indian food in a hole in the wall sort of place. I'm interested in trying their lunch buffet. The restaurant isn't as nice as it could be but who really cares when the food is good! The wait time for food is pretty long when you call in an order but I don't mind that because it makes me believe the food is extremely fresh!
