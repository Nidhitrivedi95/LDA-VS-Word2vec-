But mostly I do their take out lunch specials. Good size portion plus appetizer and beverage water included all for one set price. And that's a good thing. Great bargain. Also there was a time when I bought takeout lunch and it was late in the afternoon when the restaurant wasn't busy. I asked them if I could eat my takeout lunch in the restaurant because I was sooooo hungry, and they let me do it, so I appreciate their understanding.
