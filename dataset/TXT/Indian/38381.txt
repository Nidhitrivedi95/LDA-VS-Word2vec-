We were greeted by friendly wait staff who showed us to our tables.  The cutlery and plates were made of copper and really gave you a feel of a South Indian restaurant.  We were then provided hot towels to wipe our hands, which I don't think I've ever had at an Indian restaurant.  The attention to detail here was something Indian restaurants can learn from as most other places herd you in and herd you out.  The restaurant decor is the best for a sit down Sri Lankan I have seen thus far in Toronto.

The menu had a decent selection of food for both vegetarians and meat eaters.  I am a vegetarian so trying to find well spiced mock dishes are difficult to find, but this place had a great selection.  I would definitely recommend the gardien biryani.  

I applaud the culinary vision that push the edges on some of the traditional dishes! 

This is the place to be in Toronto if you are looking to try something different from your typical South Indian takeouts!
