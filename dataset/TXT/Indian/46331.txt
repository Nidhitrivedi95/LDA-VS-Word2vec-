sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ This is hands down the best roti place in Toronto. The lamb roti is definitely my favourite, though many of my friends prefer the butter chicken one (personally I find it very salty).
The portions are HUGE, and sometimes I struggle to finish the entire thing.
One tip: call ahead as it can take a decent amount of time for them to prepare your meal. The actual restaurant is tiny and very warm in the summer so it is not enjoyable to actually eat there - much better for take out! Alternatively, if you don't call ahead, walk west down the street to the wine rack and pick up a bottle of the inniskillin cab franc - i have found it pairs (in an odd way, but really well) with the lamb roti. A great take out dinner!
Also, I really enjoy spicy food, but be warned that their definition of spicy is really... spicy. I order spicy, but on occasion I have found it so spicy it is not enjoyable to eat.... as in that the next day you stomach will punish you for being too cocky and thinking you can handle gandhi's spicy.
