VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ This is an amazing, authentic Indian restaurant... Right here in the heart of Gilbert! I'm full of bliss to find such great food right here in town. Their vegetarian dishes are phenomenal -- I recommend the Baingan Bharta (spicy eggplant) with some of their fantastic garlic naan. The staff also always has a great attitude, as well, and they will help you with your selections if you don't know what spice level you want, or how much rice to get, etc. Also, they have a great in-house ambience (greeted with ornately carved wooden furniture and gorgeous murals on the walls), an easy online ordering system, and are open until 10:00pm all week. I totally get why they were voted one of the Best Of Phoenix. Definitely worth a try. (And with low-lit indoor and outdoor seating, it makes a great date spot!)
