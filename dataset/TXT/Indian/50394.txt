UBv8heCQR0RPnUQG0zkXIQ I recently visited this restaurant because my friend suggested it to me.This is one of the restaurants that reminded me of authentic Indian food. The food is very good and freshly made. I am a huge biryani fan, and I loved the biryani that they had here. Definitely would recommend giving it a try. 

Despite the bad reviews mentioned by other people, I highly suggest that you judge by yourself. I loved it and I think you would too.
