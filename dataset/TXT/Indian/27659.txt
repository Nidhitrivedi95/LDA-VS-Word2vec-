Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Got takeout here yesterday, the garlic naan is DELICIOUS. Great samosas. The methi chicken was good as well. Only complaint: I asked for the chicken to Level 3 Spicy online which I assumed would have a big kick with it being an Indian restaurant, but it was barely spicy at all.
