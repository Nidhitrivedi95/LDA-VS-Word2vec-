0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I live across the street and can't eat here any more.  I went in once for lunch to go and the one of the curries melted through it's container and one to my car seat.  The other ones were lacking in salt and spice- very much boxed versions....no love in the food.  I too experienced the crunchy rice.  What turned me off completely was that my bf and i went in once to pick up some sweets and there was a nice american lady ahead of us in line that had ordered the same thing that we were going to, and the owner quoted us a different price that what he quoted her!!! Epic fail.
