ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I enjoy the food here, but I called in an order and when I got in, a portion of my order was missing even though the person on the phone repeated it 2 times back to me. I had to wait for the rest of my order there about another 10 minutes, but didn't get any type of hospitable treatment since it was an inconvenience. Seeing as I was waiting I asked them if they could honor a yelp deal that had been offered but I was met with a round about "no" and that was it. Good food...customer service let me down this time
