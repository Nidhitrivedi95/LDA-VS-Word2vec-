-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Worst customer service

 No one greeted us while entering... a guys visited our table and served water... waited for 20 mins just to get the menu.... then the guy from counter came to our table and asked in a rude voice if u guys re served... when we said no politely... instead of saying sorry at the first place... he shouted back saying u guys have to wait at the door to get seated... and started speaking in a commanding manor.... seriously... Man U are serving food not donating food...seriously you need to take lessons on customer service.... just because the other Indian restaurants re far away you cannot take customers for granted....  we thought of ordering the second round however he placed the check at the corner of the table and walked away without even turning back at us as if we were eating at his place for free... will never suggest these guys to anyone ever. Thanks for your hospitality
