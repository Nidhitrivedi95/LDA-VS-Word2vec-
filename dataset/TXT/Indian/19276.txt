F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w If you are looking for ambience and a romantic upscale dining experience, you might want to look elsewhere.  Very basic decor, function and purpose.  If you are looking for a solid lunch with a good Indian flavor, give it a try.  I think you will not be disappointed.  I ordered the Paneer Makni with Rice and regular Naan.  Big chunks of paneer in the butter masala with the addition of peas.  I could not finish what was brought to me.  Good food. Motto much to finish.
