oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q Chicken Pakora for the win!

Love the chicken pakoras here. Not oily at all. Perfectly cooked. Crisp on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. Great chutney/dip that comes along with it.

Other usual culprits such as Hakka Noodles, Chicken Manchurian and veg or chicken fried rice are pretty good too.

We tried the coriander chicken but were left utterly unimpressed. Soggy and poorly done.

Usually it's full on weekends so there's a wait period unless you make a reservation.
