yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Oh. My. God. This place was amazing! Cannot say enough good things about the food here. Boyfriend and I were visiting from out of town and took a chance coming here, and I'm so glad we did! We ordered their Tandoori Chicken, Yellow Daal, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Garlic Naan. Each item was incredible, and we both agree that it's the best we've ever had. Everything was very fresh and cooked perfectly. Service was impeccable. They were very polite and attentive, and answered all of our questions about their dishes. I'm so bummed that this restaurant isn't at home, but it will definitely be our go-to place whenever we visit Vegas. SO GOOD!! Highly recommend.
