CvOxwAhmwwy3sQRKYVAjGg Amy wife and I were in the mood for Indian food last night .  We weren't sure about this place as its in a low key plaza but we're glad we went. This is home style Indian food. Nothing was over salted or too rich we left after the buffet feeling good.  I suspect they use great ingredients and don't make the food taste better by loading it up with fat, it felt actually healthy.  The place was clean, the food was hot, and delicious. Everything from the pickles to gulab jamon were home made. Lots of veggie options and a  few meat options. I was a big fan of the makhni Dahl my wife loved the pakora and butter chicken. Fresh naan was brought to the table which was also amazing.  
The best part was the bill. Buffet for 2 with tax was less than $30 on a Thursday.
If you're wondering about this place try it out.
