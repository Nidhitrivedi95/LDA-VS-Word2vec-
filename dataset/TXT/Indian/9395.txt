The place gets really busy, and there isn't a ton of space for people to wait so it can get cramped. They also do a lot of take out business, so aside from people waiting to dine in, there are also people waiting for carry out. 

Service is ok, I sat at the bar, so I felt better taken care of than those sitting at the tables. There aren't that many people working, so I suggest you go early to ensure better service. 

Overall, I am looking forward to my next visit to Sitara.
