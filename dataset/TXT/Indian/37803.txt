ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Food is decent, but service is terrible. The waiters have little training in customer service and are simply standing around and watching TV while the customers are waiting for their food. 

I have called this restaurant twice in the past 10 days to make reservations and each time I was greeted by the work "Hello", not thank you for calling Origin India, how may I assist you or something a little more professional than just a hello. 

Last night, after waiting 30 minutes to receive our food (mind you that there was just one other couple besides us in the restaurant and almost 6 waiters working), the tall waiter with glasses (I didn't catch anyone's name since the staff members do not introduce themselves) sticks his thumb in our chicken tikka masala while serving the food which was disgusting!! Then he places the food on the table and simply wipes his thumb down with a handkerchief in front of us. Needless to say, although we paid for the Chicken Tikka Masala, no one touched it. I wished that the health department was present to witness such a disgusting act by a restaurant employee. 

After we finished eating and left a 20% tip for the poor service that we received, no one bothered to say thank you or even acknowledge that we were leaving. 

In fairness, I have eaten at this facility while the owner was present in the past and had a better dining experience; however, the previous 2 visits to this restaurant have been totally unacceptable. 

The 2 stars are for the Tandoori Chicken, otherwise I would give 1 star for everything else including the service. If I were the owner, I would tell the staff to spend less time watching television and spend more time attending to the customers. 

Needless to say, I will not be back to this restaurant after my experience last night.
