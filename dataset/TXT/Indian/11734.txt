aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q This place is fantastic! I eat once or twice a week, but could easily go everyday. The plum chicken, vindaloo, and lamb special are all very good meat dishes and the alu ghobi and matar paneer are delicious veggie dishes. They have a great selection of curries everyday and yes they are all curry. The gentlemen behind will certainly let you know if you just ask for the chicken curry.  They are only open until about 6 pm because of parking costs for the owner which is pretty disappointing, but they've been at it for 10 years and they know what they're doing. Everybody should go here, try it out, and support a great mom and pop restaurant.
