TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We've come here quite a few times for both dinner a la carte and for the lunch buffet.   It's my bfs favorite Indian food place in Las Vegas.   I think it is slowly coming to be mine as well.   

The service is great.   We never have to ask for more water and someone always stops by to check on us.  This is especially good for lunch time when you want more garlic naan. 

The food is very consistent and always tastes good.   Everything comes to you hot and spiced just to your liking. 

Last night was the first time I'd gotten take out  (from yelp! ) and it was just as good as dining in.   I got there early and sat at the bar.  The service is so great they made sure I was ok and didn't need a water or something. 

The food was also just as good as dining in.   Obviously things that are fried and the naan don't travel that well but everything else was spot on.

I absolutely recommend this place to anyone!
