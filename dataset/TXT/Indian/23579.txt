gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A In our group of family and friends, no one ever said no to the suggestion of going to Mount Everest for lunch.  We never minded the twenty-minute drive from Henderson for lunch or even dinner.  

The staff are always very nice and attentive.  The food is always delicious and fresh.  There's no reason why you shouldn't give Mount Everest a try and make it your favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas!
