NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ Hungry? Want to leave Edinburgh and go to a hotel for dinner in Kathmandu? in Gurka cafe you will think you have arrived. Quality service, homemade authentic Nepalese food (Italian but better with Chinese Influence). 
They guy cant do enough for you. I think next time I go I will ask for a camel steak just to see if they manage to find one! They managed everything else when I took a group of fifteen crazy Americans there. 
A credit to your nation and an asset to Edinburgh
