auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ After reading great reviews for this place, I was very excited to order some take-out for the family. I am by no means an Indian food connoisseur, but I know what it's supposed to look and taste like, and this was not it.

The yellow dahl was mealy. The spices were alright, but the texture was all wrong.

The vegetable biryani was dry. I also bit into some sort of pit.

The chicken tikka masala was a real joke. The chicken looked and tasted like an old breast cut into pieces and thrown into sauce (which was, fortunately, acceptable).

The chili (spiciest) chicken was just hot to be hot. There were no real flavors, making this dish a bust as well.

The highlight was the mango curry chicken -- nice juicy pieces of meat in a flavorful sauce. The naan was also ok.

None of the entrees (about $15 each) came with rice. If I had ordered enough for 4 people, it would've cost $10. Unbelievable.

I will not be ordering from/dining in this restaurant ever again. If anyone knows of authentic Indian cuisine in the Valley, please let me know.
