The gun powder fries are pretty tasty but the fry itself isn't the best I've ever had. I would say for a place that is more cafeteria style, this joint is a bit overpriced but the flavour is strong. The decor is really nice inside and there's lots of room for seating. They take your order and give you a number - Panera Bread style.
