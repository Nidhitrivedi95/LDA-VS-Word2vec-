xXmmm_mcAUxXeyaMNRDLDg Yes I am a fan of their large samosas and Pakoras. I have bought them for my friends too and my non-Indian friends have enjoyed them very much. The potato samosas are authentic, vegetarian and delicious. 
They have their main location on Islington and Albion Rd in Etobicoke, which is also highly recommended for lunch, Indian sweets and snacks.
