biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg First time going back in awhile obviously.

The service was TERRIBLE.  Very, very bad.

I ordered some eggplant dish and I didn't like it at all.  I usually love eggplant no matter how it is prepared.  I also ordered my dish mild and about burned my mouth off eating it.

Done with this place.
