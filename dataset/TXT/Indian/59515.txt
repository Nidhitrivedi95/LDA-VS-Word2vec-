ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ We celebrated my bday party here. Great appetizers and food. I really enjoyed the tandoori chicken and the nilagri chicken. The service was exemplary. They were nice to allow us to bring our own wine since they do not have a liquor license. Service was awesome too for a party of 12. The staff was attentive but not too over bearing. Will definitely be back.
