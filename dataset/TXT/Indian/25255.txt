hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q The only negatives you will ever hear on this place is that the lunch buffet leaves more to be desired...other than that this place is outstanding. I used to live in Chicago off Devon Street which is known to have some of the best Indian and Pakistani food in the U.S. Bombay Grill in Fairlawn holds its own. It is a wonderful family restaurant with outstanding customer service. The prices can be a little high, but you will have leftovers and when you have a craving for Indian food...who cares right? Support this fantastic establishment and you won't be disappointed.
