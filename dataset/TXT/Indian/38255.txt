OJfFKXx0AHk5VsL5VPvbdA Stopped by here after work on the way home one evening, this is one of the few shawarma shops in the area but being the only option definitely did not decrease the quality. 

The shawarma wrap was was pretty dope to say the least. Not only that it was also decently priced for the size and a bit spicy which I liked. Only downsides are that the shop itself was a bit dirty and they didn't have a bathroom for customer use but if you're getting take out and are in the area I highly recommend this place.
