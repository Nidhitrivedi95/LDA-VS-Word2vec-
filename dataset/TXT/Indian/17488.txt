Sherbrooke Street has an interesting street life, with little restaurants on every block. Maison India (India House) is one of many that have sidewalk tables with a white picket fence around it and blooming flowers.  It doesn't have many reviews, but most seem very positive.  I join the list of those enchanted by the cuisine and friendly service. Perhaps, it was partially the opportunity to order Indian food in French that started off this experience so well. 

The draft Biere Indien was a blond with a definite English attitude. We both enjoyed it throughout the meal.  

Our appetizer was Bhaji aux Oignons (Onion Fritters) with choice of three dipping sauces.  The Tamarind was best.  The Bhaji tasted freshly made; the cooking oil not leaving extraneous tastes of where it had been before.  

We also shared Poulet au Beurre style Indien (Butter Chicken) which arrived in a flaming sunset colored semi-sweet and nuanced mild curry sauce.  This was one of the best Butter Chicken dishes I have tried anywhere. Tender chicken, great spice mix, creamy sauce.  It all came together well. And, of course, the Nan a L'ail (Garlic Naan) to soak it up and savor.  This Naan came out uncut on a large plate.  We had to get physical with it and rip it apart for each piece we wanted.  It was hot, loaded with minced garlic, and not overly oily.  The baker is a big asset. 

The Bangan Bhaji (Spicy Eggplant) was also quite good and a nice complement to the Chicken. 

To our surprise the House provided us with a free dessert, Mango Glace (Mango Ice Cream), which was cold, creamy and a perfect counterpoint to the curry, garlic and coriander. 

This was a first rate meal. I would definitely return here next time in Montreal. Next time I want to try a Mango Lassi, as everything else was so good that my favorite Indian drink should be phenomenal.
