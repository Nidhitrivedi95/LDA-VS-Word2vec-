m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Very mixed feelings. I have a hard time seeing myself coming back here after atrocious service we received last night even though the food was pretty good.

Pros: 
-Serves alcohol --- they have wine and beer, reasonably priced for a restaurant. 
-Food is good -- everyone at our table enjoyed their food; I had the Bhuna chicken chili masala and it was good, fairly mild. If I were to go next time, I would get the lamb vindaloo or something spicier. The garlic and cheese naans were great!!
-Large selection -- they have a pretty big menu as compared to the other Indian restaurants in town, which is to see a variety.
-Fairly priced - in comparison to other Indian restaurants and many other restaurants in town, the food is priced fairly
-Great decor/ambience -- even though I know they kept  much of the layout from Escobar, it still is nice to see the Indian paintings and decorations that they have placed on the walls.
-Close to downtown Champaign - nice addition to see an Indian restaurant near the downtown area to add to the variety of new restaurants opening up.

Cons:
-Wait time for a large group -- coming here with 6 people on a Friday night is a huge mistake. They will keep telling you'll have a table in 10-15 minutes but we ended up waiting over 1 hour. They started taking our order while we waited by the door and said the food would be out when we got seated, which never happened, and we ended up waiting another 45 minutes to an 1 hour for food. 
-Terrible, terrible service --- the waiters here are confused and have no communication with each other. After receiving our appetizers, a different server would come out with the same item, trying convince us that someone had ordered another order of the item. Additionally, they brought out food for everyone at our table but completely forgot one person's order, which led to another 15 - 20 minute wait. 
-Servers are not responsive -- many times, someone at our table had to get up and find a server to fill up water cups or address an issue or even give is our check, when more than half our dining area had left
-Issues with not receiving items order -- as I mentioned earlier, they forgot to make/ bring out someone's dish completely, which just added another 15- 20 minutes to the wait time. Also, someone had ordered masala tea, which never came out but no one informed us at all. After receiving our food, it was forgotten that it was ordered but when we went to pay, the host told us that they didn't even have any tea that night.
-Overall time spent -- our group of 6 ended up spending  very close 3 hours of which we spent 2/3 time waiting either to get seated or food or chasing down someone to fix our order.

Overall, if you want to eat here, don't actually eat here, just order take out and it will be great.
