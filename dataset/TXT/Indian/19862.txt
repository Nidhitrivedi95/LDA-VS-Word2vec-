The naan is served hot from the tandoor, and the chicken tikka masala is among the best I've had (although the "cubes" of chicken breast were more like large chunks). If you like paneer (Indian curd cheese), definitely try the paneer jalfrazie. Finally, the mango lassis are outstanding, with lots of mango flavor!
