sdO4fyWkFsZYHSj6yVwQIg I'm conflicted on giving this a 3 vs 4 star rating. I have been going to Shahi Palace for easily the last 15 years. The food is always on point and delicious, I highly recommend the butter chicken and chicken roll, as well as seekh kabab. The service and decor on the other hand, is a different story. The interior of the restaurant is in bad need of a facelift, I don't believe they have touched it since they reopened after a fire maybe 10 years ago, even a fresh coat of paint would do a world of difference! Then there is the problem of service, or lack of. Even though this restaurant is small, you will see the staff (owner) 3 times, once to take your order, another time to deliver your order and lastly to clear the table, try to flag them down and you get an exasperated sigh for going over your quota of 3 interactions. I went with 4 stars in the end because I enjoy the food that much, but do yourself a favor, call in advance to place your order and get it to go.
