fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Since I work around the area this has been my go to spot whenever I'm craving Indian food. The buffet selection is excellent with a large variety of options. There are certain items here that you won't find at other buffets. 

Only slight downside is that sometimes you have to flag the servers down for naan when it gets really busy. Other than that the food is great and is one or the best Indian restaurants in the area.
