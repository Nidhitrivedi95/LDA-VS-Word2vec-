aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q I was having lunch at another outlet in Arcade. While waiting for my lunch I walked over to Indies. The owner could not have been any nicer or more genuine! Offered me multiple samples, educated me on Indian food, spices, styles...The flavors were authentic and fresh. No wonder he has had a successful 10 year run in this location. Super reasonable prices. Had a lentil soup and will be back for many more complete meals....
