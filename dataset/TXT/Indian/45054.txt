S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Had a wonderful evening with my wife. This restaurant sure did pass the Indian/Punjabi litmus test. We ordered saag(cooked mustard leaves) and onion kulcha(stuffed bread with onion, potatoes). Both these dishes were completely amazing! The saag was perfect and reminiscent of the authentic way it is prepared back at home. No extra cream or oil was added and had a subtle blend of spices. Similarly, the kulcha was original without any frills. We also ordered pistachio kulfi. It's basically a semi-solid frozen dessert which gave us both the final aa-ha moment!

As a sidekick they also serve Indian beers which, are 8% alcohol with 650ml volume, twice as effective as American beers. In case anyone is up for a trip!

Service was great, everyone is attentive and takes good care of you. I also heard some good Punjabi music. They, definitely deserve a five star.
