YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ Good food, reasonable prices. Restaurant looks clean inside.

Details:
Food was mediocre, nothing to be thrilled about but at the same time it was not bad. If I lived in the area I would maybe go there from time to time because of the price though, not the food specifically. 
However, I live 50 minutes away from the place and I went there because a friend of mine suggested it to me. Because it was not anything extraordinary I will probably not go there again in the near future.

FOOD
I ordered Chicken Korma with naan and I have tried it many times in different restaurants around the world and the korma I know is usually nicely sweet, sometimes even with raisins. 
This Korma, sadly, was salty and a little bit bitter. There were a lot of kardamom seeds in it which made it probably so bitter. For me it was dissapointing.
The naan on the other hand was very good. 

My boyfriend had the Lamb Saag and according to him it was nice and he really liked it.

SERVICE
The servis was nice. Girls were smiling all the time. I think the place is missing an order because as the place got more and more crowded, the service was struggling a lot. 
It would be great if they divided the place into "sections" that would be waited by each waiter/ess separately. So they know who already ordered their food and who did not.
