gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I love Indian food and am able to cook most Indian dishes being an Indian from Singapore. Occasionally, we will eat out and my first choice is Mount Everest India's Cuisine. Why? The service rendered by Prakash is worth mentioning and he caters to our every needs. Thank you Prakash for excellent service and delicious food. Love the tea too..
