OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Came in late last night with a friend, and was checking out the menu when Carlos offered to seat us at the bar. We then realized the place had just closed, apologized and started to head out, but he told us there was no issue! We ended up getting the vegetable soup, which was the perfect mix of heat and savory flavor, I loved it! Got the chicken65 as well, which had a little less heat but was still saucy and delicious. Washed everything down with the best margarita I've had, thanks to Carlos. He took such great care of us, and his willingness to go the extra mile made our night so much better! I'll definitely be back soon!
