jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg I've had the lunch buffet twice, and both times, it was exceptionally good.  Great selection, well spiced, pans quickly replaced as they got low.  The dosa was the best I have ever had.  The only suggestion I would make would be to add riced cauliflower for those of us who count carbs and would rather have cauliflower than rice.  The owner is very much involved and checks on restaurant patrons  - attentive, but not invasive.  Love Haldi Masala!
