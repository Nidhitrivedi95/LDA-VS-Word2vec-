yOi6Lrcm9EnbVxMj0lNSnQ This place looks like it has had numerous health-code violations and the food is extremely overpriced, meals do not include rice or naan and the dish I had was extremely bland and possibly older than it should've been. Not to mention the service was rather on the pompous side.
