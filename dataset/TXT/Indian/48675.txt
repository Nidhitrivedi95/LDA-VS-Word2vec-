The regular menu features the standard North Indian curries and a smaller selection of South Indian dosas. They have a very nice dal. 

The weekday lunch buffet is also very good and is vegetarian friendly. The weekend buffet, which costs a dollar more, is better tailored for omnivores (unlimited chicken 65 and mango lassi!!!!). 

Parking is easy to find on Craig, although meters can be expensive.
