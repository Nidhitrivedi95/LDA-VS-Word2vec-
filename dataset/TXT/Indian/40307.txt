plXrGjtnDxYjHdpZ3wNMZQ I have to admit I was a little skeptical of this place, based on their location on the front staff as they weren't Indian and I was wondering about the authenticity of the cuisine. We were pleasantly surprised! Service was very attentive and friendly and they seemed very well versed and knowledgeable about the dishes that they serve, Both cuisine and food were outstanding as well.
