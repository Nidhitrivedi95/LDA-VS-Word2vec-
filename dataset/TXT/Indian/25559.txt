Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA We headed out for dinner as UK folks living in Chicago, it seemed to check our cravings boxes 

Spent $30 return cab fares from downtown and was excited to get some expat food having read the menu

Did not realize there were no "all day" breakfast  or brunch items which ruled out cheesy beans and full Monty variants etc as these are weekend mornings only 

We were told that every type of pie and the the balti curry also not available 

On ordering another cider, then told that all Burgers off the menu now too

Pretty much left with a choice of bangers and mash, fish and chips both with mushy peas and a couple of curries, the third was going to be too hot 

Curry was ok to good if you like sweeter tika but as a pub curry no issues

Fish and chips and bangers and mash were sent in with arugula salad in absence of mushy peas !!!

Bangers, mash and arugula nothing to write home about 

Just not cricket 

Fish was OK and chips OK but not like UK 

All in all the lack of menu was more than a little disappointing.  They took off  $2 to $3 off each dinner but after a $30 transit fare the discount was irrelevant we could afford to eat at places close to hotel with high ticket items, we chose to make the trip for the experience which unfortunately was not good
