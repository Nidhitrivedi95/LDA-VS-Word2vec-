-coR5Ch6_HsUAfBWcuetKQ This review is limited to the fish wrap at this place. I've tried it twice. I've also had the shis kebab, to me that was standard.

But the fish wrap was AMAZING!

They fried the fish to order, perfectly cooked (moist, tender and flakey) and the seasoning fit perfectly - it wasn't overly drenched in a different flavour, you could really taste and appreciate the fish.

I live in the area and this is going to be a frequent take out stop for me for sure.
