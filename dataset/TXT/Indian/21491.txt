GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Went to this restaurant after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  It definitely was a dive.  Our host was blowing his nose in a tissue very often.  Doubt he washed his hands.  Our curry goat had a hair in it.  The samosas were cold in the middle.  They did apologize,  but still had item on bill.  I will not go there again.  Beware false advertising.  Although to be fair I didn't give the food real chance.  It was hard for me to stomach.  My wife enjoyed the tandoori chicken.
