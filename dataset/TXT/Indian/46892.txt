The food here is solid. Chana masala, lamb vindaloo, and tandoori chicken were additions to our table tonight. Everything is tasty, with a respectable spice level. 

The servers were better at filling our waters and there were no hiccups with our orders, despite all of the faces the server made. I guess I like the quirks of this restaurant, but I'm willing to skip the American music and instead pretend I'm in a Bollywood restaurant scene.
