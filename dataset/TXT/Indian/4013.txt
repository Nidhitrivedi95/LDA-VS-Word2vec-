112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA I went here a couple weeks ago on a Friday evening with a friend. We both got the palak paneer, he in a rice bowl and I in the paratha roll. Positives and negatves of the place below:

Positive
- Cheap ($6-7)
- Masala chai was excellent
- Taste was not bad for price (a little too "fusion-y" for me, but works for some)

Negative
- For a "fast food" place, took a hell of a long time (20 mins +)
- Servers that evening seemed incompetent. They messed up customers' orders, made excuses for their mess-ups, about which customers caused a scene
- Paratha roll was extremely drippy and messy, yet there was no plate served! I had piles of napkins to soak up the stuff
- If you're going to work in an Indian-y restaurant, try to pronounce the items a little bit more correctly. Authenticity goes a long way
- Not much seating, and the chairs/furniture seem rather cheap and uncomfortable.

In summary, it was new and cheap so it was worth a try. As excited as I was about this place, I'd rather pay the extra $4 to get some decent Indian food and I don't anticipate coming back here again.
