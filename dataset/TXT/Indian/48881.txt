tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA What a amazing hidden gem. Excellent food. We ordered so many different items that I'm not sure what we got but every dish was unbelievably tasty. The flavours were just right. Everything was perfect. I will definitely go back there for my next Indian take out.  The service was very polite and friendly.
