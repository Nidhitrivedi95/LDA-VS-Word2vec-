tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I ate here a couple of months ago and the food was tasty and the service was decent too however a German cockroach crawled across my table during my visit. I called my server over to show him. He killed the roach and brought me a bill? I politely informed him that I would gladly tip him but I am not paying for my roach infested meal. He then brought a mgr to my table who told me that I got full and should pay. I almost called her out of her name. Smh. Never again. I did tip my server though. I can't believe this heifer tried to make me pay but I have to shake out my purse and sweater before I get in my car to make sure I'm not carrying unwanted visitors. You know I called the health dept. right?
