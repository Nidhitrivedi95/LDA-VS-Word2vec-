gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A The best indian food. I am stuffed. Wondeful fluffy naan. The vegetable korma was a little sweet and absolutely delightful. Chicken tandoori was flavorful. The goat was tasty. Palaak paneer good as always. And the Tikka masala sauce was perfect for sopping naan in. My girlfriend loves the sweet rice and everything is just wonderful. So good it hurts.
