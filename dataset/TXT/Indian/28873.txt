jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q This is a one star because there is a stocky build guy who works the dining room and does not care about food allergies at all.  To him it's nothing more then a big joke.

My wife likes the food here, the few times prior to this visit the food for me was good as well.  Normally we've had one of the female servers who do listen to customer needs and made sure the kitchen made my food properly.

On this visit however, after several dishes were served to include the rice and we started eating, I immediately noticed an issue.  We called the waiter over and asked him if there was cinnamon in the rice and/or anything else?  He said yes.  Really??? Cinnamon in jasmine rice as well as other dishes?  We all looked at him in disbelief stating we told you there was a cinnamon allergy.  His response?  You've been here before for the lunch Buffett, did you eat the rice and other stuff that time?  Really?  You don't deserve to be working here.

Our response...we asked what dishes on the Buffett had cinnamon that day and they took the time to ask the chef.  As I was headed out the door to try and get medicine to counter act the allergy, I noticed the girl staff yelling at him for not checking and taking this seriously.  It was a very rough night that came very close to the ER.  He's lucky he's not facing a law suit, he was just rude and did not care.  My wife says he seemed to feel bad and took 10% off the bill and gave her free desert, really?

My wife likes the food here and it's good for her dietary needs so I will take her back if she so desires however, I will NEVER eat here again as I do not feel I can trust this place to take food allergies seriously.  Luck of the draw on servers does not work for me.
