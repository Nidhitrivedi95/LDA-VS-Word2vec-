gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg We went here because of the deceiving number of stars and thought it might have promise. Wrong. First the decor and ambiance is sort of crappy. Just feels slapped together on the cheap and not done well. The bathrooms were gross too. Also it feels like they use swamp coolers in there. I was hot and humid.
But most importantly the food- not great. I'm a sucker for some good dahl (lentils) and all they has was one kind with a description including mustard a few other things which did not sound appealing. Big disappointment. When we asked about it they told us sambar is the same thing. We ordered it and got soup. Not the same thing. I ordered the vegetable vindaloo and they used frozen beans which did not impress me. It wasn't great. My wife ordered something that was a number 1 in one part of the menu (forgot the name) and it was bland and tasteless. We could not even identify one of the vegetables. It was somewhat like a potato in texture but had no taste (like the whole dish). We had to ask 4 people to help identify it before we were told it was a plantain. It did not taste like plantain.  
Nothing was good about this place even the rice was subpar. Save your money and try Curry and Scoop for a treat or Chutney's for really delicious Indian food.
