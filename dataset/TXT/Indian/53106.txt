vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg In a previous review of an Indian restaurant I've enjoyed I mentioned that there was not a single none South Asian person to be seen (granted that place was in Brampton, but still!), the exact opposite can be said of my time here at Waterfalls (except for the last 10minutes when I did see a group of 4 Indians wander in). 

Waterfalls looks very inviting from the outside and that's the main reason my friend (Susan G) bought a groupon for it. Walking in, at first glance it looks pretty nice inside but upon seating ourselves at a table of our fancy as our friendly waitress suggested the interior does look rather tacky. The white table cloth (underneath the glass exterior of our table) had more than a  few stains. There was live music which was not bad, albeit a little loud and random song selection, but the stage, lighting and backdrop just didn't seem to go together, there were still Christmas lights put up but not switched on alongside dollarstore looking Valentine's Day deco.

The menu presentation was possibly one of the worst I've seen, a few pages of a simple Word Document file printout in a file cover where the extra file pages in the back were not removed but instead had white or black paper filling them. But apart from that, they did seem to have a good list of food to choose from.

We got the chicken chettinad, okra and potatos along with roti and cheese naan. I would have given this 3 stars if I did find the food to be tasty, but I didn't. I found it to be quite bland but at least the serving sizes where big.

Waterfalls gets 2 stars for it's friendly staff and the fact that they have the Flying Monkey on tap!
