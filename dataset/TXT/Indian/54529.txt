W4PkdKcGXYM3Njo_Y9pPHg The owner is from India and he really knows his Indian dishes. I tried the curried lamb and was left in awe .. amazing flavour and tender .. his Biryani was amazing and his homemade pepper paste is incredible .. he will prepare almost any dish to order as he is a professional chef, amazing .. the business is only 4 months new so his prices are very low at this point for the quality/quantity he's providing .. I'll let him earn his five stars as I plan to eat hear once a week
