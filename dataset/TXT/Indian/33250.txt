llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I think this is a very good example of when you go wrong in selecting the places to go for based on reviews. The place is nice and fine. I went for the bufet with my friends and the dishes were very limited (no breakfast items, no biryanis) and mostly below average in taste. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who seeks to have a good authentic and tasteful indian food (south Indian people esp). I hope this helps others who are searching for places to go based on the taste afterall thats what we need to feel satisfied after a good meal.
