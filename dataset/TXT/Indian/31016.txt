kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I love Indian but was hesitant after transitioning to pescatarian..they actually had a lot of options for me to choose from though. The service was great but a bit overwhelming as 4 different people would approach us every 10-15 mins. I ordered the fish masala and was satisfied but the fish could've used a bit more seasoning..I would revisit just probably order something different
