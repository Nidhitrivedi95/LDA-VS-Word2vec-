A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Clean tasting and fresh vegetarian offerings.  Their talis are really good and Spouse and I have demolished more than just a few dosas in our time.  The rassam broth is by far the best I have tasted in Toronto.  I love, love, love the crispness of the dosas and for a fried item, it isn't swimming in oil.  The staff there are very polite and when you arrive, you are entering a welcoming environment.  This is a good alternative in Little India if you are seeking good quality, South Indian vegetarian food.
