XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Very disappointed.  Went here tonight.  Sat for maybe 10 minutes before getting the menus.  Then we got waters after another minute.  (By the way, they did not have air conditioning inside and it was quite warm.)  Then we waited again for another 10 minutes with no service.  I understand that maybe the back patio was really busy, but inside, there were only 2 other tables.  Then we watch a large table of maybe 11 that arrived maybe 15 mins after us received their menus AND got to order their food.  We waited another 5 minutes of still no service and then decided to leave.  This was also right after seeing another two ladies leave as well without getting any service too.  We won't be back.

We ended up going to Norling down the street where we got seated, and received our food within 20 minutes!  So My Tip:  Head to Norling!

Update - Note that the owner was very attentive to my post.  He not only reached out to apologize about our experience but offered for us to return on the house.
