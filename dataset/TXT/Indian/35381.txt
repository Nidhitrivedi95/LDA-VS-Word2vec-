There are some dishes for Western tastes and they also make the REAL stuff if you ask. This isn't the usual coconut saturated Bangladeshi food called Indian. It is Pakistani, good stuff, with Afghanistani food as well. Much is surprisingly mild in taste. Ask the owner for advice.  

The atmosphere is pleasant and they also have a nice luncheon buffet.

If you want a family meal in a place that doesn't serve alcohol this is a really good choice.
