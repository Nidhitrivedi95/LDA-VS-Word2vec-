S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA The food was pretty awful and at the end of our meal my hands were literally yellow, we asked the manager what it was and she casually said it was food color. Not only was she nonchalant about it but suggested using alcohol to remove it. I would recommend eating anywhere else in the Las Vegas besides this place !! Trust me do not waste your time and money on this place. I wish they had negative stars for places like this.
