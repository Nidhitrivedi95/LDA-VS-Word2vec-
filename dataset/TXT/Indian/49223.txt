tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My date took me to India Oven one Friday night and though I was bit skeptical of a buffet that served Indian food I was pleasantly surprised!...The buffet was just the right size and offered multiple chicken and lamb dishes in an array of sauces including curry of course rice, salad, fritters and some desserts that I didn't get to try...they also bring out fresh naan bread and a sizzling skillet of chicken with onions and peppers...We were like, "Wait we didn't order this" and the server said, "Don't worry it comes with the buffet!"...Wow all of this for $8.95!!! I'm sold!!! 

Overall
Good food
Attentive servers
Great change from your "typical" buffets
