51yM2HV5lsE8Feuhvs-pGg At times I wish I'd trusted my instincts telling me not to go. I'll be nice, starting with the ambiance bleh, not good not bad. Typical 2 decade old or so look. Two of the servers quite nice. Time to get the food not bad. The medu vada (South Indian Doughnut)was the ONLY saving grace of the meal. It was actually nice. 
Now the real review. That was one of the WORST south indian cuisine I've ever experienced. An I've experienced a lot. The Sambhar (Veggie Stew - A South Indian Staple) was overwhelmed with salt. The consistency was completely off and no drumsticks. The chutney (savory condiments) were either from a bottle but absolutely horrible. lastly the Dosa's...seriously? white dosas? Are you kidding me. The Uttapam was huge, the onions that are supposed to be cut up in tiny pieces were large and caramlized and instead of being on top were all inside the uttapam. As if all this wasn't enough the server was so rude. All in all one of the worst experiences I've had in food. Did I mention there is a MANDATORY 10% Tip? Seriously?
