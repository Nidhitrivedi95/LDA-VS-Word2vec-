9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Very good Biryani. Tasty food. A must in Madison. Thoroughly enjoyed every morsel. The owner is pleasant and knows how to please his patrons. 
Ambience can be interpreted as both fine and casual.
The paintings are very beautiful.
I'd suggest the owner to hire more staff or be attentive to every customers needs.
