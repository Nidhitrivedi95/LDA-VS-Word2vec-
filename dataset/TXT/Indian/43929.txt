RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w If you are a tourist (or Caucasian), do not eat here! Worst dining experience I have ever had. Zero service and out of all their dishes!

Very long (unorganized) wait to get a table. Then they hand you a mini white board so YOU can write your order down, then YOU can take it up to the counter, then YOU come back to the counter to pay after. Zero service. I'm surprised I didn't have to walk back into the kitchen to get my food. 

I get up to the counter to have the rude lady (who doesn't speak English well) tell me they're out of Butter Chicken. What kind of Indian restaurant runs out of Butter Chicken!? So I ask what other dish is not too spicy, and she scoffed at me like I'm a stupid white girl. I finally get her to suggest Chicken Tikka, and take my order number back to my table. 

The appetizer, rice and naan arrive relatively quickly, but no sign of the Tikka. After about 15 mins we ask the waitress to check on our order. Another 15 minutes go by, and now we're really hungry (and late for Victoria Day fireworks). We ask the server to check again, only to have her come back and tell us... They're out of Chicken Tikka too! 

Thank goodness for my partner, who walked up to the counter and WAITED IN LINE to pay for the stupid rice and naan we ate, because I was about to storm out. 

Literally the WORST dining experience I have had in my 32 years eating in Toronto.
