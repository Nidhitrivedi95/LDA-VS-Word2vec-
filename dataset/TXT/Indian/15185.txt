The restaurant is spacious and had many different varieties of curry (both meat/vegetarian) as well as salads, naan, rice and ice cream at their buffet tables. I thought that the service was good since the staff was attentive  and accommodating. 

Since it was a buffet, I decided to try the different meat curries that they had to offer. I enjoyed the lamb curry and the masala chicken since it had the right amount of spice to it and wasn't too extreme in terms of flavor. I really liked the tandoori chicken but I guess you can't go wrong with it.

Nothing to report in terms of the dessert since it was just plain ice cream. 

Overall, I thought the place was decent. My friend who loves Indian food enjoyed his time here. I would say their GroupOn was really good in terms of how much you paid for the meal.
