gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My sister and I were craving Indian food and decided to stop by for the lunch buffet. The food was just fine. The flavors were there but didn't blow me away. The spices just didn't come through for me. The tandoori chicken and chicken in the tikka masala were also dry. 

As a buffet, the choices and most of the flavors were pretty solid. I guess I was just looking for more. On the other hand, the service was attentive and polite. If I crave Indian food, I may stop by for dinner to give it another try.
