z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Delightful food and service! One of my friends was visiting from out-of-town and we were wanting an authentic and comfortable dining experience. Bombay Grille fit the craving and made for a relaxing night out. 

Once we ordered we realized that they were running a Living Social deal. Within minutes and a couple quick swipes of the finger, we snagged the deal. Bonus. We ordered a side of naan, the vegetarian mutter paneer and the chicken tikka masala, both level 2 spicy. The spice definitely packs a punch, so if you are sensitive, then don't go above a 1! Very delicious, generous portions.

Service was attentive. Each staff hustles to get tables served, waters filled, leaving patrons full and happy. 

If you are craving quality Indian cuisine in a humble atmosphere, this is your place.
