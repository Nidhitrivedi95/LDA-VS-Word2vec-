We got Bihari Kebab and Lamb Karahi; each of these two items came with free nun and salad. The Kebab was a bit dried, but spicy and tasty. i wish it was a bit juicy. However, the Lamb Karahi was top notch. There were enough pieces of meat with nicely cooked curry. Loved it! 

The service was good, the lady who took the order was nice and friendly. The price is reasonable. We actually had to wait quite long to get the food, but the best part was the foods were freshly cooked. I will definitely go back to this place.
