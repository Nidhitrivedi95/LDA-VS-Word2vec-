TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA This restaurant has the worst service. You dont have to wait for a table, you just walk in and sit anywhere you like. People fight with each other to get a table. The guy who stands by the counter to take your order is the rudest human I have ever come across, doesn,t smile or care about the customers. I ordered a karahi chicken and ended up getting a nihari, when i complained about it the guy at the counter just shrugged his shoulders and said too bad. The nihari was disgusting by the way. The only okay item was the bihari kebab. They don,t even know how to make proper nans. By the way when i left the restaurant I also noticed a temporary pass on their window from the health department. I dont understand how places like this survive.
