o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I would rather never go to a restaurant again than this place. It took fifteen minutes to get a drink and appetizer and they wanted everything is to order the main chooses at the same time but asked for more time. Took another ten minutes to get the drinks and five for the apps to start trickling out. There is only one server but there are only three tables with people. I expect faster service in a packed restaurant. At this point we are over a half hour in and I still haven't ordered dinner and gotten one of the three naan bread and the fries. They were out of samosa. Fourth minutes to order dinner. 
If it wasn't for the fact that the people I was dining with refusal to pay for what we got and leave I wouldn't have had dinner here. They don't bring out the entrées at the same time and don't indicate why there is a delay or  when it it is coming. As it stands the food tasted good. But the place should not try and act like a restaurant. It should be call in orders for pick up and delivery only. Avoid if you aren't doing one of those if you don't have hours to spend waiting for food.
