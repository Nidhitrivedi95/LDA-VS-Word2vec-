muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw First time here, it was overall a good experience. We got chicken samosas, chicken curry, butter chicken, and aloo mater. We order with the intention of left overs and we were not disappointed. Only a slight difference between the two chicken dishes would be my criticism almost seemed like two orders of the same dish. I may have misunderstood when the dish was described to me over the phone so I will order again in person  to verify. We will definitely order again.
