QMB3hmb_Yv6Vk-HLiM2cdA So good!! I was craving vegetarian food so we made the trek up here and it was so worth it. Every curry was solid and incredibly satisfying. It's not oily and greasy and the portions for the price are so worth it. Also, for every curry you get you get a whole tray of rice, such a great deal! Aloo Gobi is the best. We also like the Saag, Daal, and Rajma. The only thing I've had there that wasn't great was the Daal Makhani. Definitely prefer to order individual curries as the portions are bigger. The space is clean and bright and the staff who work there are so nice!
