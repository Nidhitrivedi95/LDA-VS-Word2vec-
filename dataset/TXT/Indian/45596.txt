ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Maybe this is just my perception, but when you go to restaurants nowadays, the staff aren't as friendly as in the past? And I'm not talking about that fake friendly, either.

My trip to India Garden was like a time travel experience: everyone was friendly and attentive. Of course, no matter how amazing the staff is, subpar food will undermine the experience, but the food was amazing; the samosas, especially.

Everyone should copy this restaurant's style. 5/5 all day.
