45fMwU6aolShQ-B0mTwglg Was out early on a Saturday looking for breakfast. Decided on something other than pancakes and over-easy eggs. Settled for Chutney Swamy due to proximity to home and keeping up with the lazy weekend mood. 
I knew what I was going to order. This being a South Indian restaurant, it had to be a dosa. There was a buffet available too. 
The dosa came in almost cold. The accompanying chutneys and sambar were okay. But they add little value if the dosa is itself not enjoyable. Add to this that the dosas being served on the buffet were exactly the same as those ordered from the menu. Not satisfying at all. 
The price being charged for this kind of food adds to the feeling of insatiety.
Next time, im going to skip the laziness and drive a little further.
