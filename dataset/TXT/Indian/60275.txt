ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Oh man, this place left me with the worst food poisoning I've ever gotten in my life! 

We came here for the weekend buffet, the little place was crowded...a good sign since quite a few of the patrons were Indian themselves. The buffet selection was also good, they even had a pani puri station, seemed cool. I grabbed quite a few things but all were mediocre. I think what got me was the paneer tikka masala..I ate some (my bf didn't touch it) and in my head told myself..hey this isn't the right texture for tikka masala..something's off...and then 6 hours later I was barfing my guts out for the following 24 hours. 

I'm sure this was an off day as my bf and his room mates have eaten here many times before. Sadly, I don't think I'll be eating here ever again, I'm basically scarred for life. The buffet is large and cheap..but considering my experience you may want to stick to the a la carte menu. 

Good luck.
