QT4Ub4DlaDX52vdnKutD0A This was a restaurant.com visit, around 2pm on a weekday.
We were the only patrons, until 1 other person showed up for the buffet. We took one look at the buffet and thought it had seen better days. And there were only 2 vegetarian options so we ordered from the menu.
Pakistani food is different from Indian food, but not by much according to the menu options. I like to order things I've never had before, so honestly, I can't really remember it. But it did have spinach, eggplant, and potatoes in a spicy sauce. It was fine.
Also ordered a side of naan and it was the tastiest I've ever eaten.

All in all, a good meal. Price point is good for middle class budgets.
