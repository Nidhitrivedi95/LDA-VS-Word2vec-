ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA I love Indian food. But I seem to managed to order the same thing everything I come to Saffron. It's the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Aloo Goobi and of course the nann bread. I usually tell them to do it non spicy because I can't handle spicy food at all. And I love it. I love how every time I order the food it taste as good as the last time. Their services have gotten way better since my previous review. I also like their lunch buffet. If people are interested in trying Indian food. Their buffet is a good place to start.
