TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We thought we'd try this place so I purchased a Groupon, $16 for $30 worth of food. Thank God for Groupon...
Everything is an added extra charge.
When you order your main dish... Between $14.95 and $25.95 average...
it doesn't include the rice, an extra $12.95, bread was an extra $2.95 and even extra sauce was $2.95. By the time they charged us for every single thing the bill came to over $56.00 for dinner.
I would have given them (NO) Star, but I will say the food was very good. 
I didn't mention that ten minutes into our meal an (unknown) live bug came crawling across our table and then began to circle around our plates and dishware... 
Wow, I seriously lost my appetite at that point. The waiters all rushed over to see what the commotion was about and offered to move us to another table. Not one of them even offered us a discount or anything... 
The only thing that was said by one of the waiter's was... "We haven't seen one of those type of bugs here since our bug problem back in October,  I guess we need to spray again". I could not believe it, normally a Manager would have come over and a least apologized and offered to comp our meal or offer a discount or even dessert. NOT a common practice here at India Palace, where the Bug's are KING!
I will definitely NOT be back to experience your over priced food 
(Ala Carte') ways of doing business.
Nobody wants to eat in a bug infested environment... Period!
