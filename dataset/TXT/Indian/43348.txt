RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Royal India is hands-down my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The ambiance is incredibly elegant and tasteful. The staff and customer service was beyond amazing, they truly listened to all of our likes and dislikes and made wonderful suggestions. We ordered the Chilean sea bass and vegetable samosas, I'm not sure which I enjoyed more! I would also recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala. Quite frankly you CANNOT go wrong with anything you order here. Thank you Royal India for a wonderful experience, I will surely be back!!
