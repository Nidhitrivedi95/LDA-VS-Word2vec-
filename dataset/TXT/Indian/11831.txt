Yelp Friend has been well trained.
Like a Truffle Pig sniffing for Truffles.
I agree SOMEthing does smell Deep-Fried.
I walk pass it but she guides me back to LCH.

We stood behind SOME people looking at Hot Tables.
Food came in Balls, Sticks, Wet, Dry, Thick, and Thin.
SOME Dude made us creamy drinks from a Drink Machine.
Drinks came in Hot Pink, Mellow Yellow with colored straws.
SOME cold Round Balls were floating in our thick Drinks.

We tried ordering SOME more but Dude gestured, I don't do that shit.
Then we were signaled to walk towards SOME friendly helpful Lady.
I pointed at the Stick, at the Round Disc with a Hole, and some Balls.
Paid 8 SOMEthing, and we walked out smelling like SOMEthing good...
