yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I LOVE Indian food, so I requested Indian food for my birthday dinner, and the family took me here, even though it was a bit of a drive. 

Since we had reservations, my party of four were seated immediately at a table with really cool silverware and plates, plus the best "goblet" I've ever drunk water from! As the dinner progressed, Mark H. commented that those goblets didn't sweat. Sure enough, the goblet was keeping my water chilled but wasn't sweating. Cool! 

The hostess and waitress were incredibly attentive, and we also had the opportunity to talk with the owners! Take time to read some of the information about how civic-minded these owners are (on the left wall when you walk in). They truly support the local community. 

The food? I'm not sure what we ordered, as I let my hubby take care of the ordering (since the national dish where he hails from is Tikki Masala). The food, however, all tasted yummy. You must have the garlic naan though to go with whatever dish you order, and top your meal off with the Chai tea (best ever). 

Great place! I'll be back, as I'd like to visit their grocery store next door and experience more of their tasty dishes.
