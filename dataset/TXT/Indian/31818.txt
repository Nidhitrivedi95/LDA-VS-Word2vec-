kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g I tried this place out with a friend recently, and was pleasantly surprised. The vibe of the place was a bit Americanized, but beyond that, the food was delicious. Catching the tail end of their 4-6 pm Happy Hour, we ordered a half-dozen mild Tandoori wings for only $4, and they were amazing. We also tried the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chicken Tikka Masala, and both were also delicious. The Vindaloo, though, is definitely for the more adventurous; it's insanely spicy! In total, with tax and tip, we spent around $20 per person for a nice dinner in a comfortable atmosphere, and our waitress was lovely! Definitely worth a try, and I'll be sure to go back.
