B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg The quality of the service here deserves 5 stars, especially considering the price of the meals.  The linen tablecloths and napkins are almost absurd considering the prices, too.  Really nice plates and utensils.  The decor...well, this is more in line with what you pay.  Think Chipotle: concrete floor, exposed ducts under corrugated roof...industrial casual.  Kind of weird.

The food: samosas were good.  Meal comes with a little cup of soup, which was tasty.  Garlic naan is fine, nothing special.  Curry was not apparently traditionally made; the sauce was mediocre, tasting only of tomato and (too much) chili pepper, with no simmered meat richness.  Rice smelled distinctly of used ashtray (seriously).

Great service, good prices, kind of jarring atmosphere, and just OK food.
