_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA This is a pretty good Indian restaurant in the Entertainment District of central Toronto. The food is good, the service is decent and the atmosphere is relatively nice. The Mulligatawny Soup is particularly good and I also like the Chicken Xacuti. The prices are a little expensive but not out of line for the quality of the fare. With tip and tax, you can expect to pay about $30 - $35 CAD per person. This is an OK deal for the quality of the experience.
