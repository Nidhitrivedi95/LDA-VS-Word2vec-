GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Went there with a friend for lunch, it was good! I The place is cute,  not so small people commented as long as it isn't fill up with people. The butter chick Marsala is so good and Mango Lassi is my favorite! Waitress is very helpful as well, she is enthusiasm on recommending us some great food and happy to bring some Lassi favor to see if we like it first. Definitely come next time!
