KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw What a food and hospitality! A must place for foodies. The masala fries   were crunchy and delicious. The Dosa burger was amazing; you can taste dosa in the sandwich. Innovative and a perfect fusion. 
Butter chicken and rice was super delicious. Reminded me of one of the best butter chickens I had in India. I still have to try their desert somosa (filling if cheesecake and Ras Malawi). This joint take you to another level of food pleasure. 
Keep up the great work.
