gqiBy1X5n1KHq21D2dawEw What a wonderful find! Though it shouldn't be considered that I suppose since it's right there in 'Little India,' but for someone who grew up eating South Indian (Kerala) cooking and who finds most of what's offered up as Indian food in Montreal not quite up to par, to put it mildly, this place is indeed a find. Sanjay the owner met me warmly and remained a consummate host throughout my dining experience. He and his family are from Hyderabad and they do all of the cooking themselves. At lunch today, his wife was running the kitchen. Hyderabadi dishes are quite renowned for their brilliant flavours and innovative mix of Northern, Southern, and Middle Eastern cuisines. Although the menu looks rather typical now of "South Indian" food outside South India (dosas and idlis) he says they are gradually introducing the full range of Hyderabadi dishes in the form of daily specials. (He had a funny story of how when they went to print the original menu which listed basically everything they knew how to cook; the printer laughed at them and told them what they had was not a menu it was a book!) Okay to the food: all fresh and delicious. First, I had a bowl of rasam to warm up my bones. It was rich and spicy and sour all at once. Hit the spot. That was followed by a plate of vadas, which are basically yummy savoury lentil donuts (!), served with sambar and two kinds of chutneys. The coconut chutney has the Hyderabadi "extra" touch, which is to mix in a peanut paste. Then of course I had to try the good old standard masala dosa: perfect. The filling could probably be a little spicier but then this is the basic dosa from which there are a million permutations, which I think included spicier versions. 

Dosa Pointe is a true gem, anyone who likes Indian food should go right out and try it (or maybe you shouldn't; I would hate to stand in a line in this cold!). I can't wait to go back and try one of their biryanis!
