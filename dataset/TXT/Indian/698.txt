Worst tasting food ever. This restaurant is awful. 
The chicken kabob were ready made / frozen that could be reheatable. These kabobs you can get from WALMART. And these guys wanted us to pre-order when reserving for our table. If we were getting frozen kabobs why not just take the order when we come in. They are heatable in 2 minutes. 
The naan is the size of a small child's head. You can literally finish the naan in one bite and they cost 2.25 (rip off).
Malai Tikka -- are you kidding me no comment on this dish it was just bad
Chicken Karahi - they must have gotten this recipe from pinterest hashtag generic
The only thing that was good here on our visit was the ROOH AFZA - which was free. 
My family is so disappointed. My mom has given up hope. My dad has stopped talking to me and he is planning on not celebrating EID. He will donate his BRAND NEW shalwar kameez. My sister is traumatised. My brother had a heart attack. As for myself, I wasted 1/4 of yearly salary on this HUGE mistake.
