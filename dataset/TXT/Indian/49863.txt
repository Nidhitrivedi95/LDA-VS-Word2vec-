U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw A real gem of a find, no a jewel, no a diamond in Chandler.  I live in SE Gilbert--not exactly a hot spot for authentic ethnic food--something I dearly dearly miss from the east coast.  One day, I searched, again, for Indian food and among the usual results, a new name appeared--Bay Leaf!  I was willing and am I glad I did!  There are only a few dishes I've ever had that will cause a hankering, all back on the east coast, except for now.  I hanker for their Chicken Tikka Masala; and try to make it a point to get there at least once a month.  Beautiful texture, beautifully spiced, basmati is very well prepared; naan is the best; Alu Gobi; biriyabis; goat, lamb, chicken fabuloso.  Chef is clearly someone who cares about what they put out. You must try.  I've been coming for about a year now.  It's tucked away, easy to miss perhaps; small store front part of a mall, classy décor; very clean and neat;  but SE corner of Alma School & Chandler Heights; enter from Alma if coming from the East.  Great people.
