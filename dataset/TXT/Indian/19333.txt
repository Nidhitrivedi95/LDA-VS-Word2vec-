f7RXwcus_-EOsR0q5ctVjw I had alot of doubt as the food in Montreal has been extremely bland, and in extremely small portions.  I figured...aye if it sucks... i'll deal with it. I was given the menu and saw that the items listed the ingredients (which isn't really common in most indian spots that ive visited). We ordered the Chicken tikka masala and the mango chicken, along with garlic naan. This is the best Indian food that i've ever had in my life so far. In most western European countries, the chicken tikka masala are stew based. In the US, it's very cream based. THIS had the perfect mix of cream (35%) and stew. Robust flavor in each bite. The Garlic Naan, with actual diced garlic cloves, was PERFECT. It was so soft and tender, while have a crispy edge. The price was also reasonable. I'm extremely happy to this place for preventing me from giving up hope for properly seasoned and DELICIOUS food in Montreal.
