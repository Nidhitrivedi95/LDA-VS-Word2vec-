OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Urban Turban took us by surprise in Vegas -- we weren't expecting the food to be SO good, but it was! The owner himself is from Bombay, and so is the chef and between the two of them they cook up some delicious delights.

On our plate:

Kheema Pav - this is a dish similar to scrambled eggs, but made with beef or goat mince and served with a street style bread -called pav. This version was pretty close with what you get back in India... dry, seasoned well and non-oily. 

Chicken tikka - real charcoaled grilled tikkas fresh from the grill - very delicious.
 
Chicken biryani - came in a pot sealed with dough, piping hot and very well done. Spiced to perfection, flavorful and great quantity. 

Garlic naan -  fresh and crispy 

Paan shot - this is a non-alcoholic after dinner aperitif. It is the liquid form of paan or betelnut leaf. It's become very popular in high end restaurants in India and great to see Urban Turban bringing it to us here in the U.S.

Over all, this was a most excellent meal and could be a 5-star review if the restaurant sorted out its issues in the kitchen and with the service. Service is a little sketchy and seems they were having delays in the kitchen. Towards the end of the meal, we also felt a little rushed - would have liked to sit back and enjoy the last few bites of the excellent biryani and savored the paan shot, but didn't really get the chance to do that. However the staff seems really genuine and it would be great if they could figure out a way to iron out these issues. 

PRO TIP: If you're not sure what to order, chat with the staff or the owner Bhushan - they gave us great advice about not over ordering and and we were happy to go with their recommendations.
