iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Desi Burrito is an Indian food truck with a Mexican fusion concept. Sounds like it's trying to ride the coattails of the successful fusion food truck movement 5 years ago. Except, it's probably 5 years too late. It tries to emulate the Chipotle concept of customization, but choices are fairly limited - you can choose between tofu (korma or makhani), chicken, or lamb in either a bowl or burrito. And while Chipotle's assembly line is expeditious, Desi was anything, but. It took nearly 20-25 minutes to receive our rather simple order. I can't imagine that boding well for the drive-through. 

Given that this endeavor is fairly new, there were many positives. I enjoyed my lamb stir fry wrapped in a flour tortilla with lemon rice. The flavors were great and the tortilla is a great substitute for the traditional naan, which may be too thick to wrap. The pani puri was also a nice, refreshing appetizer if you like chickpeas and mint. The combo comes with a side of seasoned fries and a canned soda.

While the concept is somewhat outdated, the food flavors were good. I wish there was something extra instead of just stuffing Indian food inside a burrito with cheese. Making the burritos a little larger and stuffing them with the seasoned fries would've been a better move. I think with a little refinement, this little spot can blow up, but their speed needs to pick up, especially with the hot summer months rolling around the corner.
