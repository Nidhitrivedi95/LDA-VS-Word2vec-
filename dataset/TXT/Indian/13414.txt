bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Federick, you really disappointed me!! 

When your kitchen's cooking is worse than mine, I really have an issue!!

The Corn with Crab soup is so starchy that basically my spoon can just stuck there upright! The Crab though not fake crab are the previously frozen/canned varieties and is so fishy! I definitely can make my soup from the canned corn from the supermarket and makes it so much better! The whole table even have a hard time even finishing their small bowl.

The Chilli Chicken has no chilli, no spicy, no fire... It is not even wok hot! The reason I am eating out in an restaurant because I want the dish to be fresh and serve hot directly from the wok.... It taste like something I get from T&T hot food department...

The Fish Pakora hardly have any favour... but at least it is the best out of the 3...

The indifference waiterstaffs with no smile I can get over since this is normal for Chinese restaurant.. but medicore food.. I really cannot stand!

I hope my experience is just an off night from the kitchen.. it is so sad when this happen... Will I be back?  Sorry, maybe not!
