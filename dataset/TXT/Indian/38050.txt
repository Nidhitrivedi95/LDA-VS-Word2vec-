ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw When we first arrived we ordered drinks and they were out of the first three types of beer that my boyfriend tried to order.

I ordered a chicken dish while he ordered vegetarian and the food was fantastic...until 4 hours later when I was sick with food poisoning. It was great going down but I didn't enjoy being extremely ill on vacation.  My boyfriend never got sick and enjoyed his leftovers.  I enjoyed the ambiance but I don't think I'll ever be going back. Stay away from the chicken!
