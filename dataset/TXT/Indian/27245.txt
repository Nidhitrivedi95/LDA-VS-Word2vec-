iJfS02AOptwkaWD-vOVRew I have eaten the lunch buffet a few times.  They change what is served, so they may not have your favorite dish on the buffet  every time.  I really enjoy the palak paneer and the butter chicken.  The manager (possible owner) always personally checks in on every table. Delicious food and friendly service.
