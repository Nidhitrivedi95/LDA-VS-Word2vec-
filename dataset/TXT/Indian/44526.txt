rxR93KtNb5vxGA17wiHd2w There are two Indian and one Pakistani restaurants along this stretch of road, and I picked Khushi's for my takeaway because the dining room was packed and hopping - it was quite loud and animated and that encouraged me that this was a good place to order from. And I was not disappointed! I ordered the "old style Lamb curry" and it was delicious. I'd return if I was back in Edinburgh, it was the best meal I had in the city.
