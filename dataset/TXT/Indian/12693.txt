B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg So glad we found a good Indian restaurant in our area! Woo hoo! We order the fish masala (medium spicy) and the chole with garlic naan and it is soooo delicious. The prices are reasonable and the food is so flavorful! Also they are very quick when we call to order takeout so we have been very pleased.
