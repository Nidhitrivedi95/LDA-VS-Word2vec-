UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Came here with two of my friends and we had the butter chicken, aloo gobi and palak paneer. All three dishes were good but what stood out was the butter chicken. It was slightly spicy and I usually cannot eat anything too spicy but this had the perfect kick to it. It was so good that I couldn't stop dipping my butter naan into the sauce even when I was already full. 

Location is also very convenient with some parking just outside or on the side street. This place is just a few steps away from Christie station.
