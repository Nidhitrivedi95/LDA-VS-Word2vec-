fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw I finally, FINALLY tried this place after seeing a bunch of 5 star reviews and hearing an over the top recommendation from my roommate. Since we have the same tastes, I decided to go ahead and make the trek down the grimey streets of South Oakland to find this place.

First things first, the place is tiny. As in, I'm only 5'5 and I felt like I had to duck into the doorway tiny. There was an extreme lack of extravagant Indian decor that I have come to know and love from other Indian restaurants in the area. The bright orange paint didn't feel as refined as the decor at Yuva Indian, but the place was spotless so I'll take that over ambiance any day. 

Secondly, the service was just fine, but I don't expect much in the way of Asian buffets. As long as I get a hello and a refill on water when I need it I'm pretty much good to go. There was some cool music playing when I walked in and an Asian gentleman next to me was singing along to it, which only added to the ambiance in my book. 

Lastly, for being a buffet, the food was excellent. I have never had such flavorful food from a buffet line before. Typically foreign dishes are watered down and bland on a buffet, but my goodness they tasted like they were all made to order. I tried some dishes that I thought I straight up didn't like because they've been so tasteless at other joints, but I enjoyed most of the vegetarian options here and was very very pleased the taste and texture of the meat dishes. I was seriously shocked. 

In my opinion, the flavorful buffet puts this place world's ahead of anything offered elsewhere in the area. I may even place this spot over Tamarind due to the wider array of options. My only complaint is how warm the place was. It was a muggy day out and I felt there was no circulation in the dining room. 

There is a $10 minimum charge rule and the place is DEFINITELY too small to accommodate large groups.
