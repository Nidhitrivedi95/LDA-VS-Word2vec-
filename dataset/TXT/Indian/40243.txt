pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ We had a great experience at Rasoi. We dined in for ladies night where ladies receive a free appetizer and entree with the purchase of a bottle of wine between two people. The bottles included in this Wednesday deal start at $50.00 - so shared you're looking at $25.00 each. 

Food: Excellent. I started with the fish pakoras which were served like classic fish and chips (in a newspaper with kettle cooked chips). They didn't skimp on the amount of fish included in the pakoras and the batter and filling were flavourful and delicious. I then went with the Fig, Basil and Paneer naan pizza. They were able to lock down delicious Indian flavours on the pizza while still allowing the toppings to shine and work together to make a delicious plate!

Service was great! Our waiters were attentive, helpful and patient to a table of seven girls!

How dare I forget the decor. Beautiful! Whoever designed the interior of the restaurant  should take a trip to my apartment and decorate!

Definitely a solid choice in St Henri
