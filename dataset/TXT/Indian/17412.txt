DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Im going to have to go with three stars on this and its not bc of the main dishes.  It is due to the fact the buffet was missing different types of naan and rita. My two favorite things to have and neither had options. 

Overall. Good food though.  I will be back since it is an office favorite.
