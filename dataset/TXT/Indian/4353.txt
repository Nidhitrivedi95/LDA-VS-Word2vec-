1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw The lunch buffet is such a jaw-droppingly good deal that all other concerns go out the window. The buffet selection is surprisingly plentiful, with classics like chicken marsala and all sorts of unique dishes I couldn't name. There's never enough naan, but I understand - their naan is really, really good. 

I'm giving them 5 stars because the lunch buffet is really just that good - but I have a difficult time imagining that I'd want to come back much outside of the lunch buffet. I've only done it once or twice and I was not impressed.

TLDR: Best lunch buffet
