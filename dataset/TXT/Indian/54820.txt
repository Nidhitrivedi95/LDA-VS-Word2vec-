WmtJ1bArMGPPLdwsIPahBA I went here for the first time on Saturday afternoon. The food was great, actually delicious but I just looked at my bill and saw that I was double charged for the appetizers we had. I am very upset at myself for not looking closer at my receipt before paying but if they can do this I will never go to this place again. I am beyond angry at myself now. Check your receipts before paying!
