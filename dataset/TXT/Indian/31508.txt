KvRh-exPg_KegOM_HXeskw My husband and I just moved here from El Paso and we are trying out all the Indian restaurants we can to find our new favorites. We've tried at least 5 so far and this is by far the best!! I love the 'snack and ice cream' concept. Tried the Gulkand ice cream and it was bomb. The Tikka masala was spicy enough (yay!!) and the prices are very fair. Don't pass this place up !!
