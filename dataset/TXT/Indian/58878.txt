YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA We popped into Gautama this afternoon to get out the rain and decided to stay and try the buffet. Butter chicken and Chana were ok but the curries were quite thin and bland. Also I found the service a little bit rude. 

It was the Festival of South Asia today and we walked pass so many tasty lunch options on the street. I kind of wish we had of grabbed something else before it started pouring and we ran in here. 

The bottle of Kingfisher I had hit the spot as it was about a million degrees in the restaurant.
