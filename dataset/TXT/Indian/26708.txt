iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Marigold Maison is a wonderful spot for Indian food! The vibe of the restaurant is so fresh, yet their food is traditional and delicious. For appetizers we had the seated eggplant and seared tofu which were both great and came with tamarind sauce! For our main entree my family shared lentil soup, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, roti, and garlic naan! Unfortunately, all of the desserts had nuts in them so I couldn't eat anything, but the chef made an exception and made us a crepe with chocolate and berries! That was so great of him and the staff! I will definitely return and I can't wait to eat there again!
