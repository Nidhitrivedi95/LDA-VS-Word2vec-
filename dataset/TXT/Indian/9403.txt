8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Solidly good Indian fare. Went with a group and had the huge booth in the back. Good ambiance. Friendly servers. Good selection of 'ethnic' beers. Friends got the Flying Horse Royal Lager which was pretty awesome (light). All the apps and breads were tasty. My chicken korma was great. Was totally full, but still squeezed in some mango and pistachio ice cream. 

Certain to be my Chambana Indian restaurant for both in-house and take-out.
