UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Excellent indian food! Had the tandoori chicken and the saang with lamb. The chicken cooked perfectly. The saang had big chunks of flavorful lamb, not overpoweringly gamey. The garlic naan...awesome! They also have an extensive beer collection. Its a small place and its pretty busy so i recommend making a reservation. We waited about 20 minutes, but it was worth it. This is my go to spot for indian food in Vegas!
