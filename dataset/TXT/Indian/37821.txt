ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw The most horrible and terrible experience.

I went to this place with my family for lunch buffet, the buffet is over priced $14.99 per person and the following are the items in buffet.

1 veggie soup - flavor less and watery.
2 cheap appetizer 

3 Chicken tikka
4. steamed rice
5. lamb curry
6. Fish curry 
7. veggie curry - no salt and veggies were uncooked and raw.
8 lentils - flavorless, no salt 
9 rice pudding 

Service is very bad, there was a middle aged waiter who has an attitude problem.

The decor is good and looked expensive and therefore it seemed they want to feed customers garbage at expensive rate and make up for the decor cost. 

For the kind of money they charge I could have had better meal in one of the casinos.

The very thought of this place enrages me and my family because we spent nearly $100 for this crap.

Will never ever go to this place, the owners of this place
