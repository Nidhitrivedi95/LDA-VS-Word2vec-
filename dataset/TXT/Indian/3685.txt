0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I've waited so long to write this review, mostly because I don't know how to eloquently state how good this place is. Seems like just saying "it's amazing!" isn't quite enough. Nevertheless, its amazing! 

I moved from Mississauga to Oklahoma City a few years ago and I still think about the succulent shrimp pakora, the spicy chilli chicken, the flavorful crispy beef and really, EVERYTHING Chilli Chicken House has. Eating at CCH was pretty much a once a week staple, if not for a Sunday meal with family then at least for the lunch specials on a workday. In fact, Jeff M. and I missed it so much we got our Canadian family to pack some frozen Shrimp pakoras from CCH when they traveled to OKC. Where there's a will, there's a way!

The lunch specials are really affordable at just under $7 for a ton of food. Personal faves? The Manchurian fish or the Chili chicken. They taste great with the simple steamed rice but if you feel like even more flavor, you can upgrade to a fried rice for just about $1 extra. You really can't go wrong with any of the lunch special choices, although personal faves are the Chilli Chicken or the Manchurian Fish. If you're opting for the à la carte menu, the Crispy Beef, Shrimp Pakoras, Ginger Fish and the Manchurian fried rice are great options. All the food is packed with a ton of flavor and spice. The food here is by no means on the healthier side but you won't leave with regrets either. 

Also, the customer service is SO great. The staff are accommodating, kind and welcoming. It really does feel like you're dining at a friend's home rather than at a restaurant. 

CCH is one of those places where if someone asks me 'what would be your last meal if you had to choose', Hakka food would definitely make the top 3, with only my mother's food at the top of the list (and by 'hakka' I mean CCH's hakka food).

Seriously, if you haven't already been here, go now. Enjoy a Pakora for us sad Oklahomans :(
