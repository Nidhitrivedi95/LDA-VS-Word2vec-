OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A One of the best Indian restaurants in MTL. The chicken tandoori, malai kofta and biryani were amazing. It's quite a small place so it might take some time to get seated and it might be a bit crammed. But there's a really nice atmosphere inside the restaurant, the staff was very friendly and service was quite efficient as well.
