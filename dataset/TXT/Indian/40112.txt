PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw I first ate at Namaste Kathmandu several months ago with friends as we thought it was a Japanese restaurant with it being called 'Namaste', and so we were quite confused when it materialised that this is an Indian and Nepalese place. Oh well, it was still a delicious meal.

Situated just around the corner from the main University Campus George Square, Namaste Kathmandu is a convenient place to reach and would be a great place to go for dinner or lunch. 

Namaste Katmandu's menu offers a selection of authentic Nepalese and Indian dishes including dumplings and curry's, and their menu is split into Nepalese and Indian meals so you know what type of curry you are ordering. I had a Nepalese vegetarian soup to start which was really tasty and clearly made with fresh ingredients. For my main, I ordered the Fish Tikka Curry, which was marinated sword fish and it was tasted really amazing, full of flavour and super fresh - yum! 

They have a huge selection of vegetarian dishes on the menu so there is something for everyone. It is also pointed out on the menu which curry's are mild and which are hot, which is incredibly handy and means you won't get your head blown off with an unexpected chili. The prices are really reasonable at Namaste Kathmandu, with most main dishes priced at round eight pounds.  A lovely place to go for gorgeous tasting food.
