m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Unlike some of the other reviewers' experiences, ours was great.  I called to,see if there was a wait and to ask about a reservation.  I was told that there was no wait and we didn't need a reservation--but one was made anyway.  We had no problem with service at all, and my husband and I both really liked the food.  Our waiter was very determined to help us order things we would like.  We had a combo appetizer, which was okay (lots of fried dough coating), but the chutney sauces were good and gave it more flavor.  I had the lamb saag--spicy spinach sauce (spicy to the level I requested), and it was VERY good.  My husband's vegetarian entree--aloo go I--was also very tasty.  One amendment to what is on yelp:  they serve beer and wine but do not have a full bar.
