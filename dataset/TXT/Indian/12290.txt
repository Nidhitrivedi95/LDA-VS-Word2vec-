auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Ordered aloo gobi, garlic naan and veggie samosas off eat 24 and it was great! The only thing was that I pre ordered it around 4pm and set the pick up time for 9:30pm. When I picked it up the food was no longer hot and checked the ticket and it said 6:30pm. I would suggest that they check the pick up time before cooking up the order. Other than that food was great.
