nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ From the name, I thought it would be more of a salad bar or something similar to Fresh - casual and quick. But it's actually a small and cozy restaurant with a prix fixe 3-course menu ($25 for dinner and $20 for lunch).

My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday evening and ordered the Spicy Chicken Drumsticks and Crispy Calamari to start. They weren't joking when they said spicy. The spices and aroma of the chicken was a jerky flavor but the accompanying fruits help balance the dish. I was pleasantly surprised that persimmons and apples worked so well with the chicken. The Calamari was perfect - not too greasy, paired with the perfect sauce (Scallion Yogurt) and beautifully presented. 

For entrees we had the Braised Leg of Lamb and Mushroom and the Maple Mustard Glazed Double Cut Pork Chop both served with mash potato and vegetables. These are apparently the two most popular items. Mash potatoes were phenomenal. The pork chop was humongous and although it was well-seasoned, the cut was really thick which made the meat a bit tough. Crispy and juicy on the outer but I thought the middle was a little dry. As for the lamb, I'm not a huge fan of braised meat but I can't deny that it was delicious. The vegetables are also large in size; probably the biggest bokchoy I've ever eaten. 

Last but not least, dessert. SO SO GOOD. I'm still thinking about their Mango Panna Cotta. I loved the texture and taste. It's a must-try! The Lindt Chocolate icecream served with a wafer and mixed fruits like dragonfruit and blueberries was great too. So creamy and rich. 
 
Helmed by Chef Dan who has previously worked at Jump and Canoe, it is not a surprise that the presentation of every dish is absolutely superb. Ingredients are fresh and portions are very generous. Service was attentive and courteous. Bang for your buck. All in all, judge the food, not the atmosphere/decor (and the bottled water) and you will leave this place full and happy.
