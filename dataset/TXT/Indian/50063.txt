U8tIgXZ0T--8ZNEVoDap0g This little joint is now under new management. But the quality and the deliciousness of the food can not be compared to any restaurant in and around the area. I have been there 3 times now and will continue to go and every time I go I try different item from the menu and I have Zero complain. Very friendly family runs the business and always fresh food. They have the best tandoori and naan I have ever had and when it comes to the price, it talks about itself!
