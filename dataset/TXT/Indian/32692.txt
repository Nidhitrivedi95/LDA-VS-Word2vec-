LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This is no doubt the BEST Dosa place in the GTA!  When we got there I heard the guy taking the reservations say there was a 2.5 hour wait for tables! Glad I called and made a reservation. We were in fact seated ten minutes early.Dosa and everything else we had was awesome. I didn't eat food this good when I was in South India, so if you love Dosa, Wada, Uttappam etc etc. It costs a little more than most other places but it is definitely worth it, no questions asked. You MUST come here. Lots of free parking and the service is also top notch.
