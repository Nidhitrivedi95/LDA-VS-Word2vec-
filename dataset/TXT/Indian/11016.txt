A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ The food is good keeping in mind this is a buffet place.

Their lunch buffet is quite cheap even the dinner is not expensive. The full menu includes but is not limited to...Pakistani, Indian, Hakkah Chinese cuisines. It was quite impressive the design area included a Salad Bar, Vegetarian dishes area, Non Vegetarian dishes area, Fried area, dessert area.

Some unusual tasty stuff included were Masala Dosas, golgappa/Panipuri, gulab jamun. The place is nicely decorated and quiet big, so space wont be a problem. Parking is free.

Overall, Good Place many choices and easy on the pocket.

For my Muslim peeps! They "don't" serve halal meat.
