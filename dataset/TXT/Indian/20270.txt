fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Found three beard hairs in the food on my last visit. Quite embarrassing, as I was excited to introduce my friend to the restaurant, and of course, he finds the hairs. Not 100% certain they were bears hairs, but I hope so as they were short and curly's. Too bad - It's great food at great prices!
