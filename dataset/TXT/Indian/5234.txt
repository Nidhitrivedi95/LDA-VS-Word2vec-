2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Small shop in the ground floor of some condo buildings on the harbour front. Love the lamb roti from this place. the portions are absolutely humongous, I could never finish everything in one sitting and always had to leave some as an afternoon snack. There are only a few seats in the shop, so you are probably better off bringing the food back home to enjoy. The pictures on the wall are interesting, I always just end up staring at them waiting for the food.
