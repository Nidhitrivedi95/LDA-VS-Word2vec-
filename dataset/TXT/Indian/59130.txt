yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Atmosphere was nice, very clean. Service was atrocious. Seated quickly, but waited forever just to order. Five tables with patrons...four wait staff just walking from one place to another doing nothing. As dishes would empty, we placed them aside in an organized manner, yet none of the wait staff bothered to clear them. We actually had a new dish brougt to our table and they simply moved aside the empty/used dishes and left them on our crowded table. Ordered the tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. Tandoori was not as flavorful as I've had at other restaurants. Tikka was good, but it barely fed two people. I expected more for the price in terms of quality of food and service. A real disappointment, will not be a repeat diner.
