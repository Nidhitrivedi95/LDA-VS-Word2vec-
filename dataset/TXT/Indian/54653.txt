wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw September 2016 International Supper Club Unofficial Yelp Event (#ISCUYE) met here for a delicious dinner and a fun time.  I have not had much Indian food since moving to the Valley, but this happened to be the best Indian dish I've had since I've moved here.  I ordered Lamb Vindaloo with a side of Aloo paratha, the Lamb was delicious, the paratha, mmm... not the way I had expected it to be.  I honestly could not care less about the paratha!  The Lamb was absolutely stunningly pleasing to my palate.  I asked for the level 1 hot.  If you like spicy food, but don't like the food too hot to enjoy the flavors, this is your spice level.  The server said it was the "American Hot".  I thought it was just right.

I would agree that the prices might be a little high for the amount of the serving... but then, I was stuffed after eating half my serving of Lamb Vindaloo.  Also, there were about 20 of us, it did take some time to get the food, so I do think the complaints about time-to-get food may have some truth to them.  I'm going to stop by for lunch to see how long it takes to get a lunch served.  I will update.  Update:. I returned the same Week to grab dinner for take out.  I noticed out front that lunch is served buffet style.

As you can see, I can't wait to return.  Yummy.  Thanks for hosting the September 2016 #ISCUYE!!!
