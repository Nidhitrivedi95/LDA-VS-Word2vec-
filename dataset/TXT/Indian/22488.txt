gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Ruchi is a solid vegetarian South Indian restaurant in Chandler. They offer a buffet during lunch, but also have the regular menu if you choose to order off of that. During dinner, you just order off of the menu. 

So let's get down to the food. The lunch buffet has a variety of food items and you can request dosa as an addition to it as well. Be warned: if you do not eat onion or garlic, aka you are looking for jain food, the buffet does have many onion oriented dishes. I would recommend that you order off of the menu and make modifications as necessary. Our server was very accommodating about the no onion request and helped us work through the menu. Dishes that I personally tried include the Thiruneiveli Spinach Dosai and the assorted appetizers place (medhu vada, masal vada, veg samosa, cutlet, and pakora). Both dishes were pretty good though I liked the assorted appetizers a bit more than the dosa. Portions were quite large and I could not get through the dosa to be honest. I did try some of the madras coffee at the end and it was pretty satisfying. 

Service was good overall and I got a good South Indian meal like I wanted.
