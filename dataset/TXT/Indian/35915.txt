Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg For my money, this is the best Indian restaurant on that stretch of Queen street between University and Spadina. We usually get the Murgh Tikka (boneless chicken cooked in the tandoori oven) and it's great. The cheese cooked in the tandoori oven is also very good. I think Babur, a few doors down, tends to be more popular, but I think Trimurti is a lot better.

The staff is very nice. I believe the chef used to work at Nataraj on Bloor. If you order for take out and tell then you'll pay cash, they'll take 10% off the bill.
