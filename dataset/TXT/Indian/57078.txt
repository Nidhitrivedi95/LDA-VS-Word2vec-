XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw I ordered the butter chicken for delivery and got a large portion of rice with a very small portion of watered down sauce and chicken.  It was flavourless and cold when it arrived at my house.  Understandable, this might have been the delivery service's fault, but it was all around a bad experience.  I have heard good things about this place, so I will try it again and give it another shot.  I hope they change my mind.
