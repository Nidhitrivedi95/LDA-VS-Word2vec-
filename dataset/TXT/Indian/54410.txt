vzjmi_Cxom5b1OVQC3B6MA For Indian restaurants, this place is very good.  All the dishes are cooked differently than those found in more popular/typical Indian restaurants like Jaipur Grill on Yonge or Cuisine of India.  
Arrival:  I ordered takeout. They took a long time.  They seem to be short staffed and I had to wait a while.  I have to admit it was worth it.  So, be aware and plan for it.
Food:  It was very very good.  We ordered a wide variety of items.   Our favourite were the veggie dishes.  The butter chicken gravy was super good but you could tell the chicken was pre-cooked and then warmed in the sauce.  It should have cooked in the sauce for better taste.  We actually ordered 2 chicken dishes and the meat tasted the same in both.  
Overall:  A very good experience.  We ordered too much and had leftovers the next day which were just as good.
