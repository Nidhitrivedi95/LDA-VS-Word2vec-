TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw There were 12 of us that ate at this crowded and cramped place, with stinky overflowing restrooms in Las Vegas. 
The food was delicious. Some dishes could be less greased with butter, but overall the food was good in comparison to mid-range Indian restaurants in the US - although it was priced higher than most in its range. 
The wait was long as there are few tables to seat. Restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with no attention from the owners. A common problem with most Indian restaurants like this one. If the food is good, the price is high - but no funds are diverted to keeping the restaurant clean for a clean experience. Where does all the cash go - not to the poor low-cost undocumented workers ????
