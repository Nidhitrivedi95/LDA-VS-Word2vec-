gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw Food was uniformly excellent. Appetizers and mains. Great naan. Had lamb jalfrezi and chicken chettinad. Both great. Channa masala was ok. Prices are high for Indian, but it has a real upscale feel a great downtown location and delicious food. 4 people at every well for just over $100 plus wine and tip. Definitely recommended.
