iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Absolutely loved this place! We have been back three times now and every time the food and service have been excellent! I like that you can pick how much heat you want in each dish and the freshness of the food. The sauces are off the charts good - that garlic non-bread is heavenly and you have to have it! We have tried chicken and lamb chicken masala the lamb vindaloo and about for other dishes in the samosas which are off the chart good too! I just recommended Marigold to two more of my  friends today!
