DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I had lunch here just last week and I forgot to post my review. So, I was really surprised at how delicious everything was. I'm a vegetarian and find it difficult to find eating places that have more than one item for me to choose from. The waitstaff was very pleasant and helpful- very courteous. The best dish was the okra, not sure the name of it, but it was awesome! Pricing for the buffet is reasonable and I will definitely return, and bring more people with me!
