qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Dinner at The Bombay Grill was mediocre at best.

It took 45 mins for our appetizers to come out, and there was only one other table seated. Not impressed.

While the Hariyali Chicken app was yummy, the Lamb Seekh Kebab was dry. So dry, that it was literally crumbling away with the slight touch of a fork.

The Chicken Biryani is not a Biryani per se, but plain white rice mixed with curry. It had a sweet flavour to it which is not typical. They should really rename their offering, as it is unfair to the definition of what Biryani is. It's fair to say that this was the least enjoyed dish at the table.

The Lamb Karahi faired slightly better. Some pieces of lamb were a little more tender than others, but the sauce was pretty balanced in flavour.

The thing that killed me was the Naan. I am a fiend for Naan, and this was abysmal. As I tore into it, I noticed that the Naan was not chewy and more "Wonder Bread" like. The dough for Naan is supposed to be elastic in nature lending a a springy chewy texture to the final product. That was totally missing here. Man, so sad to have wasted my carb allotment on it tonight :(

Still on the hunt for good North Indian food in Toronto. This unfortunately does not qualify.
