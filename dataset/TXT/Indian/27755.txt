iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw Firstly I'd like to point out how refreshing it is to go to an Indian restaurant that doesn't look like every other Indian restaurant in the World! The decor here is modern and refreshing and is what initially attracted me to give Babur a second look. 

I went to dinner here on a Saturday night and it was packed...always a good sign. I tried the butter chicken, chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka, and the naan. Everything was great and tasty...the naan perfectly cooked although I thought too small. 

So why do I give it 4 and not 5 stars if I'm raving about the food? The service was awful. We had a reservation yet the wait staff tried to put us at the back of the restaurant while other areas were free. Second, the waiters were frantic and the food came out all too fast. Thirdly my curry got cold while I waited for my second piece of naan to arrive (which it never did).

So all and all I enjoyed my food but my experience could have been much better.
