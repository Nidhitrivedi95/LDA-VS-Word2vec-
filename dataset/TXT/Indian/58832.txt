yR_mPDR9kNWmXADWk6-TLw On a never ending quest to broaden my palate, I took a chance on Spice 9 today. Result? Smiles and full belly! I'm not really an Indian food person since I had a bad run in with curry before so when my co-worker mentioned getting Indian food for lunch, I winced. But then I remembered one of my goals this year is trying new cuisines and decided to go for it. 

Their location is a little obscure if you're not familiar with the uptown scene since it's on the 2nd floor of the Ivey's building. It's a pretty sweet spot location wise and you can eat in or take your food to go. You walk in and they have a line where you can order whatever combination you want for lunch (meals ranging from $5 to $8) with veggie and chicken options along with rice and naan. I got chicken, veggies, chicken rice and naan and a soda and the meal was under $9. The portions are sick---in a good way! There was so much food that I was intrigued why it weighed so heavy yet cost so little. The naan was a little undercooked and the yogurt sauce was a bit watery but besides that everything was great and packed with flavor....and this is coming from a girl who doesn't like Indian food!

Seating is limited so you can sit in the restaurant itself or take it to go and eat in the Ivey's area. We got out of there quickly after finishing since people were waiting for tables. Their prices seemed a little steep for dinner so I wouldn't recommend it but this is a very solid spot when looking for a quick, lunch in the Uptown area!
