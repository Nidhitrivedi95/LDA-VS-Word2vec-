3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA This buffet was amazing! This is the first time I've been here and I was impressed with the variety and freshness of the food. The curry chicken and the chicken tandoori were especially delicious. As a lover of spicy foods, this buffet was right up my alley.

The price was reasonable, considering the quality of the food and the atmosphere of the dining area. They do have gluten free/vegan/vegetarian options as well. Overall, 5 stars for a great dining experience.
