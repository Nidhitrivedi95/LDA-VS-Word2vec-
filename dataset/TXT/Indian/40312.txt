pMAZ2aDXn3DaTHWrVo3CSA update on my review: still... 2-3 stars.

They have a high chair for babies, but the place would be a bit too narrow to manoeuvre around with a stroller.

Ordered Mattar paneer, garlic naan (I still prefer the garlic naan from The Host, in Yorkville: fresh ingredients used there), an eggplant dish, and pulao paneer ($6.50 for a small bowl).  

I have yet to experience their buffet, and it wasn't being served on the Monday that I last visited this place on.

Either I'm allergic to an ingredient or something was off this time.  Not in taste, but in the nasty bout that ensued about 30 min. after we left the restaurant.  I enjoyed my meal enough, and was pleased that those working there enjoyed babies, but I'm very confused about what to do about the tasty-enough and convenient leftovers.  

Would I go again?  At some point, probably.
