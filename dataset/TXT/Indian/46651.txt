SxuD7iY8QO88PNbSdNmNKg Delivery review: put in my order at 4:45 after being quoted a 45-60 minute delivery period and food arrived at 7:00, which ruined our plan for the night. My "very spicy" order was medium intensity at best and we received basmati instead of the Kerala brown rice. Not ordering from here again!
