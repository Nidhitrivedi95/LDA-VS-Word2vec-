gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This trip to Vegas my husband put the kabosh on expensive strip restaurants. So after yelping the best off-strip restaurants we decided to see what all the fuss was about. The bottom line (in case you don't wanna read on): food so good we came here 2 days in a row. 

Don't let the neighborhood scare you. Only a lil sketchy. The food is spectacular!! Best Indian food we ever had. EVER. we tried the Mt Everest thali which was plenty of food for 2 big eaters. The naan is yummers- both plain and garlic. Even the lamb, which I'm pretty picky about was so tasty. Not gamey at all. Our favorite dishes: chicken tikka masala, saag paneer. 

We came back for the lunch buffet the day after. I highly recommend it if you like variety and don't really know the names of the dishes. There wasn't a single thing we didn't like. 

Not only is the food amazing but service is great. Prakash is a great host. 
We will be coming here every time we come to Vegas.
