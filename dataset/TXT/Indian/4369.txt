1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw tried the lunch buffet, and enjoyed the food. However, 3-4 entrees (two w meat), no chutneys observed. Chicken used in the dishes was odd ... large uniform square white chunks.

Be aware for $10, you serve yourself (water, plates, etc), and you MUST clear/bus your own table or the staff will yell at you from the back, as you leave! (I had no idea you needed to do this... a first at a buffet for me). Plenty of staff just hanging behind the counter, take pics with other friends that show up and occasionally run some food out to the buffet. Very unfriendly staff. ( I also noticed a table of Indians who left all their used steel plates and plastic cups/utensils at their table ... but where never called out on it.)
