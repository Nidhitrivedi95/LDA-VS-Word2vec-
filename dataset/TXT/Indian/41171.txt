PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ When I was told we were going to an Indian buffet I wasn't expecting much. I had been to enough to expect poor selection and dry flavourless food. Imagine my surprise when we got there to find this huge restaurant with stations upon stations of all you can eat food! Good food at that!! The food doesn't compare to my favourite restaurant but I still give this place five stars because it is everything I could possibly hope for in a buffet. Fantastic.
