KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Cute little restaurant, easily accessible if you live/work anywhere in the area.

Went here for lunch today,  I've tried other Hakka restaurants in the area and so I have an idea of what I like now and what I don't.  This place is good and I will return to try other items. White linnen table cloths, real napkins on the table makes this resto feel like you're eating a pretty nice place. 

Ordered from the lunch menu, which is $7.99. Great price.

You get:
- Choice of soup or one spring roll (there are 3 diff kinds of soup)
- Choice of meat/fish
- Choice of veg fried rice or veg noodle

My bf and I both had the hot and sour soup. Delicious, murky and hot and sour ;). A nice start to the meal.  Second we ordered one chili chicken and one chili beef (both dry), both with veg noodles.

The chicken was the best. It was perfectly spiced, not too salty (which I find a lot of hakka places can over salt dishes), and didn't have a crazy batter on it. It was lightly dusted, fried and sauced.  I think they could have done a little more with the noodles, spice-wise but I guess with the chili sauce from the meat it's okay to have something a little less spiced as the meat carries it.   The beef was good too but I liked the texture of the chicken and would absolutely order it again.

Service was great, attentive and water glasses were always filled.  Server suggested the chili fish next time, which I'll def get. Can't remember if it was on the lunch menu or not though. 

I'll be back.  It was a great price at $18.08 before tip for lunch for two and we were in/out in 40 minutes.
