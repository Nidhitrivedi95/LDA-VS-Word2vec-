The chicken was good and plentiful (unlike some other local Indian places), but not very tender, so I think they grill it separately and just toss it in the sauce. Sauce was spicy! In a good way. Rice was fluffy. Naan was tasty but soggy. Portion size was good. Price was a wee bit too high, and selection varies by day.
