LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw Coming from Chicago where the biggest Indian town is, this place is legit for less than $10 i think it's $9 for weekday lunch buffet, this is worth it. I guess i'm not really picky as i am after the the taste and the spicy chicken is just right to the taste. Im surprised it's empty this Monday but definitely coming back with friends for a cheap lunch.
