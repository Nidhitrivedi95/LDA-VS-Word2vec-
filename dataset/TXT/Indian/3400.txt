0NDbUCHi9YsRwgG3iZO8Kg I liked the ambience and the staff are friendly. The food though tasted like everything was taken from the frozen food aisle of a grocery store. Butter chicken tasted like really bad pie (you read that right) and Ras Malai was served straight from the freezer. Chicken Biryani and fried shrimp were mediocre at best and Garlic Naan was ok. I'd like to think that the chef was having a bad day and the food is generally better like the other reviewers say.
