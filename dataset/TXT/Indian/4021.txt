112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA Been wanting to check this place out for a while since it's right around the corner from Case. My first impression of this place was that it's similar to Chipotle. You first choose a wrap, rice bowl, or salad bowl. And then, you choose what dish you want in it. Options range from lipta lamb, murgi tikka (chicken), palak paneer (cheese+spinach), and aloo matar (potatoes and peas).

I ordered the lipta lamb rice bowl and was absolutely blown away by the amount of flavor it had! The meat was topped by a savory green sauce (YUM!). The rice had such a variety of spices that it could be a dish all by itself! I tried my friends' murgi tikka and palak paneer rice bowls as well. Both were very flavorful and savory :) I definitely agree with some of the other reviews that the dishes could be spicier. Maybe they can put out some hot sauce by the utensils corner for customers who prefer a spicier flavor?

I also ordered their mango lassi. Can't go wrong with this drink! 

Lastly, I love how they have a "Hindi lesson of the day" section on their menu. "Mujhe Cleveland pasand hai"=I LOVE CLEVELAND :)

Definitely recommend this restaurant! Great service, food, and atmosphere.
