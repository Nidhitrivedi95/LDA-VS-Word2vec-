2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Great place to dine in. 
Pros: Good food, Great ambience, reasonable pricing.
Cons: long wait times over the weekends. Better book a table in advance. Food takes a forever to be delivered, but is worth the wait.
Food: paneer chili didn't have any spice in it, was good but not spicy.
Staff: very understaffed for the amount of crowd they get.
Hakka noodles is the best I have had in Northern America.
