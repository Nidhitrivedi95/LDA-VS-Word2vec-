9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w Usually I don't really eat much Indian food, but this is a rare case, and I'd say it was a good experience. My bro and I came with a friend, and they had a good experience last time. Came on a Sunday around 7pm and it was fairly quiet, guessing long weekend affects business.

Their menu had decent choices, from vegan ppl, to vegetarian, and protein and different curries. You can choose if you want rice or naan with your curries, we did a half n half.

My bro and I got the butter chicken. Creamy and mild, and the chicken was boneless and skinless which is nice. The rice grains are long, like your pinky finger nail size long which is still rice, but unusual for me. 

The naan was very light, buttery, and pillow soft, and not dry overcooked charred and burnt. It was a nice enjoyable naan with curry. The service is alright, even though it was fairly quiet, we'd still have to flag down server for some stuff. I'm not sure if all Bombay Bhel is this quality, but this location is good. And they have large seating capacity available should you be interested in bringing big groups, but not sure if they have enough staff to prepare and help you well.

The meal was about $15 pp, which is decent for dinner I'd say.
