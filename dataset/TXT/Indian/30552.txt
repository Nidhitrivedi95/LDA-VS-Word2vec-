kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw A place with express delivery service! On a snowy day food served hot in 20 odd minutes is nothing short of a miracle. The Penang curry with the Tofu (it was nice and tender) was really tasty. 3 was the right amount of spice. It was pleasing for the palette as well as for the eyes! Being a peanut lover the Peanut sauce did not fail to impress me. All in all a good experience. Would like to try more of their dishes.
