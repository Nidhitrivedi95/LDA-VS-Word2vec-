3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg I have become a regular at this restaurant as their quality is just beyond anything else I have experienced in Indian cuisine in Brampton, and even the GTA as a whole. The menu is rich in variety with staple classics like butter chicken, but does not shy away from more challenging dishes - all served at your choice of spike level. All dishes are prepared on order - nothing is sitting with heating lamps over it for hours at a time. The food is wholesome, nutritious and the flavours feed the body as well as the soul. The staff are extremely friendly and it is all very much worth the wait. My family and I attend there for dinner at least every couple of weeks, and it has always been consistent for quality and flavour. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to find a new Indian restaurant favourite.
