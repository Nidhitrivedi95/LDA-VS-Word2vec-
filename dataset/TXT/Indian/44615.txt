When I was homesick, I had eaten  at many Indian restaurants all over New York City and Jersey,  the Dahl soup was not as good as the one at this restaurant.  The Indian salad was excellent, lots of onions but not too strong, lots of variety and a beautiful presentation. The Chana was decent, the chick peas were soft and it had flavor but not too spicy. This is an exceptional Indian restaurant in Montreal, don't bother to go to parc-extension for your Indian food.
