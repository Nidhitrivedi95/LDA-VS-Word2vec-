51yM2HV5lsE8Feuhvs-pGg Best dosa I have ever had. Period. In Toronto or anywhere else. The crispiness and flavours of Madras Dosa Hut's dosas really set it apart from places like Sarvana Bhavan. I used to like Sarvana Bhavan, but now I am a through and through fan of Madras Dosa Hut. The Dosas are paper thin and so crispy, and extremely large (but you can finish one if you are fairly hungry). 

My favorites are the podi (very spicy) and the garlic ghee. In fact most of their dosas that have ghee and spices on the inside are very delicious. We even tried the Dosa Pizza (Doza?) and it was very good. 

We always end the meal with their delicious south indian filter coffee...yum!
