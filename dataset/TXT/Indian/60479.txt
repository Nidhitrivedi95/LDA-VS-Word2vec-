ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw A cool new place for the area! Saw the idea of the British/Indian fusion and found it very interesting! Came with a couple of friends for dinner on Friday and were very pleased. The inside of the restaurant is well lit and well decorated - cool bar areas with lots of different types of gin to choose from. We were seated quickly at a booth and ordered our drinks and dinners. I got the Blackberry Bramble which was super tasty - fruity and refreshing! I also ordered the Tikka Grilled Cheese w/ Curried Coconut Tomato Bisque (such a mouthful) while my two friends both got the Tikka Masala. The food came out quickly and was fresh & hot. The friends enjoyed their Tikka Masala - spiced well and had some heat to it! The grilled cheese & bisque was also very good! The bisque was very heavy, so even though the dish didn't look huge, I was pretty stuffed!

For dessert, the two friends got the cheesecake and bread pudding. Cheesecake came wrapped in a puff pastry thing (we nicknamed it "The Cheesecake Poof") and a side of fruit puree. The cheesecake was super soft and delicious and went really well with the puff pasty! The bread pudding was very dense and well spiced! The garnishes of cranberries, raisins, and dates were also a nice touch. 

Experience was very good overall! Service was relatively quick and very friendly. The food didn't blow me away but was definitely enjoyable, and I'd be interested in visiting again to try more dishes. A bit more expensive than a casual dinner, but a nice place to go for something a little more special. Given the unique menu, Needle and Pin would also be a great place to bring out of town-ers!
