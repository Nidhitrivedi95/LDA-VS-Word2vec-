MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g This is a really nice place with excellent food.
The taste of the food is as close as it can get  to the food in India. 
A lot of places in the states - who carry Indian food - are not anywhere close to what the actual dish taste like.
This place is NOT one of them.
Some of the things we tried here are - veg cutlet, dosa, rava dosa, Hakka noodles, paneer tikka masala, naan and papdums.
All these were simply delicious.
The only thing I didn't like was gobi manchurian. They made this way too sweet. (For those who don't know- gobi manchurian is an Indian Chinese dish - cauliflower florets are dipped in a flour batter, then deep fried, and then stir fried with onion, green chilies, lots of garlic, sauce soy and more, while still keeping the crunch of the florets intact)

The ambience is casual and welcoming.
The place is well lit with white lighting (yellow lighting changes the color of the food we see) 

Here you need to self serve - we place the order at the counter, pay and then collect the food when called out.
This sometimes seems troublesome, if one has ordered many dishes and needs to go every now n then to collect the food. 
Also if you need to order more, you need to go back to the counter - if there is a line - tough luck !
Regardless of the above troubles - the food being  amazing,  I would definately give a big thumbs up to this place.

I have not tried however - They also serve custom cakes, pastries, desserts etc
