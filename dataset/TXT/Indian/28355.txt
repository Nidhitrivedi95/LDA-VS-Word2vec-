J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I had just returned from India and figured I could experience good Indian meals while on business in Toronto. Not so. My meal at Little India was the most expensive and the worst. Very far removed from what is served in India, which I expected, but not to that extent. Stay away if you have a trained palate.
