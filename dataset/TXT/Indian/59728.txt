zdqvzYtIZYMCRAQRNfcKIw We stumbled upon this place on our way to Whittamore Farm to find a Halloween pumpkin, and glad we did.  

Sadly, my wife and I eat out on average at least once a day.  And, it's often very difficult to find a place with great home cooking tasting food.  This place definitely fills that gap.

Very small, but friendly place with really great food at great prices.

We had the vegetable bariyani, vegetable samosas, aloo palak, naan and chicken tikka.

If in the area again, we'd probably stop back in.
