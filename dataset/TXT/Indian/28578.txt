J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ We had intended to go to Babur (base off a recommendation) for lunch  but they weren't open yet so we stopped here. It was a good alternative. A nice buffet of interesting food that was well prepared. Pretty good selection of food.  The butter chicken was good but a little on the sweeter side.  Service was excellent for the buffet...Staff were friendly and attentive.
