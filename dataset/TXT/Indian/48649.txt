tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg This is place is very good! Friendly service. Nice restaurant setting. 
Yummy food, have tried the: lamb biryani, bihari kabob (so so good), lahori daal, kabob rolls, and trifle dessert.
Decent prices, good portions.
However, they take a while to get the food to you (even when we call ahead for pick up- take out).

Bottom line: I recommend this place!
