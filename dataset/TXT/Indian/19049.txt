F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw First time having Hakka food in Mississauga and it was really good. Typically, go to Scarborough to satisfy my Hakka cravings but decided to try something new this week. The servings were quite large for what we ordered.Not that spicy compared to what I am used to but still really good. The service was topnotch and would definitely make the trek to try it again.
