J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I love this place....It is always my first choice when I'm in the area. My favorites are the vindaloo and the palek paneer but everything I've tried has been delicious.

The service is great.  They are always busy when I've been there but the food comes quickly, and if you let the guys know if you need anything they will help you out.
