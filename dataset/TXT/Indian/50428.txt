UbZePypGiEf11l1X7mv2SQ This place is not bad either. I went here for my birthday at lunch for their buffets. They were close to closing so the restaurant was quiet with one nice lady serving. I was happy with the food. Compared to typical buffets they kept their items under 10 and did a good job on keeping everything fresh and tasteful. They only had gulab jamun for desserts so I couldnt really have much for sweets, but overall the food was good. I will try out some other time for their a la carte menu which looks promising. They even have a huge room which caters to a good number of people for reception parties or other events.
