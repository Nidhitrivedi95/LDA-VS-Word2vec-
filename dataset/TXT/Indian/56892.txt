xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw For the past three years I have driven past this little place every day on the way to and from work and I have never stopped it. Today I did and I think I have found my new favorite place. I got the Ultimate Taco with the green chilies and it was delicious!! The beans were fantastic as well. I will definitely be eating here again.
