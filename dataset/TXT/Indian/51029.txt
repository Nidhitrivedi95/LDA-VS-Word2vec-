UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ K, so the food rules, but if you go during lunch expect to feel rushed. I just was at Indian Flame during prime noon - 1 pm lunchtime and patrons awaiting a table were staring me down waiting for me to get up so they could take over. It felt especially awkward when I got up for plate #2 (don't judge me, it's a buffet...) and a couple started swooping in on my table before noticing I wasn't getting up to pay, rather to fill my plate. Minus one star for not enough tables creating unnecessary awkwardness.
