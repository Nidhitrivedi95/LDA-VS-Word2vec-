uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Lamb saag was excellent and butter chicken was average. Based on food alone, this place deserves 3.5 stars. However, they charged us separately for naan AND rice. I can understand them charging us for naan. Even some U.S. Restaurants do this. However, rice is part of the meal! Nobody eats butter chicken by itself. I wouldn't mind paying slightly more for the dish, but why do it in a round about, shady way? Instead of charging $12 for the dish and $3 for rice, why not make the meal $15? Shady shady.
