OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Went here on a whim to discover it was happy hour - yay! Explored the HH menu and some drafts with my boyfriend, but couldn't stay long to try as much as I wanted.

The food was awesome and I was delighted that they had Magic Hat, along with some other interesting brews, on draft. Finished off with taking some pictures in the turban-mobile before taking off. Looking forward to returning to try more of the menu and the late evening vibe.
