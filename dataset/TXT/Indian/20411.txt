FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ I'm not sure how well versed these reviewers are on what is "authentic"
I ordered the Chiang Mai Noodle off the lunch menu... it was sticky, tasteless, and the "lo mien noodles" they used were packaged Top Ramen that was so over cooked, it was a congealed mess. The Rama Chicken my fiance ordered was soupy, and the peanut sauce was so sweet, it tasted like peanut butter. The Crab Rangoon were almost burned, and the "pot stickers" were more like soggy Wontons.
If I could give this place a lower rating, I would. All that I ordered I ate literally 1 bite of, and could not stomach another. I just threw out $27 of food, and I will never make that mistake again.
