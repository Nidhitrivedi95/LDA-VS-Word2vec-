J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Ordered here from Ubereats. Disappointed at the butter chicken with it being too sweet. The tika masala chicken was okay but both platters barely had any chicken pieces. Mostly sauce. The rice wasn't the best either. The bread that comes with the butter chicken was overly toasted that it became like a dorito chip. It wasn't edible anymore. I don't think I'll being ordering from here again.
