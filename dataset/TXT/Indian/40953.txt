PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA For location and atmosphere this place is 1 star - Located in a bordering-on-skeezy food court at The Riviera.

Food is great however - extremely decent, with some of the hugest and tastiest naan around.

I wouldn't go here over most of the sit down places in town, simply because I want some service and don't like food courts, but if you're trapped at The Riviera this is infinitely better than the rest of the crap they serve up (It sure was depressing to see how the vast majority of people opted for lowest common denominator hamburgers and hot dogs over wonderful Indian cuisine).
