DjlOWc6p2jkit9zMSFa_ew The owners are true Keralites from Kerala, the southern-most province of India. South Indian food is typically very hot (spicy), but the food here is very tasty without being hot! Too often hot spices are relied upon to give taste to Indian food, but not so here, which IMO exemplifies the proficiency of the chefs. The son describes each dish with great enthusiasm and knowledge, which just adds to the dining experience. Highly recommended!
