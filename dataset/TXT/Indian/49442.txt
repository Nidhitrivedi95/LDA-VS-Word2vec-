tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I don't even want to give 1 star. The food is terrible. I have been to many other restaurants the food taste might vary but I didn't come across any spoiled/ rotten food. And the worst part is that when we asked them to take that out from the menu, they didn't. I am not sure how this place got that many ratings. I feel they should atleast consider the health of the customers while preparing the food.
