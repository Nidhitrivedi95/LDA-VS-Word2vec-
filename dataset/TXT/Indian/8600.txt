7vgWonwfqRt9pxR1c00Ulw Being of Indian origin, having grown up on Indian food, and since I've frequented my fair share of Indian restaurants in and around Montreal, I'd say I'm in a position to judge Indian food from an informed standpoint.  In my opinion, this restaurant offers delicious Indian food.  Apart from the food, the service is absolutely outstanding.  The delightful people who work here will treat you like a guest of honor.
