sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Gandhi is a to-go spot in the Queen West area for take-out indian roti.  Do not be taken back from how small this location.

They have great vegeterian choices and meat options too!  Yummy rotis for under $10.  They also have vegetable pakoras & samosa for $1.50.

Service is quick if you are getting items to-go.  There is limited seating if you are staying in.

I will definitely be back for future quick lunches and dinners!
