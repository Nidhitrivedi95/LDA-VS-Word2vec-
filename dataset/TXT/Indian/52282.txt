UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA The inferno menu is no joke.  I eat all kinds of spicy food.  I grind my own Trinidad scorpion moruga, ghost, and habanero mix.  I got crushed by the inferno curry. I had to stop halfway through my meal due to a stomach ache from the SEVEN TABLESPOONS of ghost chili powder that they use in the meal. The food tasted delicious and the service was great.
