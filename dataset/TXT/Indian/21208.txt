GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I sometimes find the Indian/Pakistani resto choices in Metro Phoenix lacking, some places are good with certain specialties, etc. with Curry Corner, most of their curries and biryanis are on point. For instance their chicken tikka masala consistently tastes great, as well as their Karahi's and the Chicken Achari. 

I've been a regular customer the last 10 years, back when Curry Corner occupied a storefront at the corner of Lemon Rd and Terrace and pre-food network fame when it was a go to for Indian international students living nearby. I'm happy that they've grown and have still retained their low prices, and the portions have stayed the same. I like their cheese naan, and the tawa paratha too. Definitely get yourself a mango lassi, it's so refreshing especially when it's warm out.
