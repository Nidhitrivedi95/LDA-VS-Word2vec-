I'd have to say, so far, that in my not so humble opinion, this is the best Indian restaurant in the downtown area. Lamb patties, okra.... NOT the usual slimey okra, but believe it or not ,crispy and just delicious, you'll change your mind about the vegetable forever. Lamb with cumin, a potato dish, I can't remember the name, but it was a revelation, as I was not even aware potatoes were even consumed in India as accompaniments.Live and learn.  Spiced eggplant, ALWAYS order it, several varieties of naan, which one to pick: the plain is super , but the onion , garlic, and I've forgotten which others. Such a dilemma! I've been here several times already and I've NEVER been disappointed. This place is NOT cheap, but worth it,service always good.
