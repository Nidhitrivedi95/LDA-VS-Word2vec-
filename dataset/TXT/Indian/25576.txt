htK8VGscVVAiOGnsaZFNsQ After a long day walking the Edinburgh sightseeing spots, we were looking for a place to have a decent dinner. After looking into a few places which were all full, we decided to go into the Kasturi after checking the menu outside and approving of the dishes and prices.

From the first impression with all the white interieur and tablecloth, I thought this place might just be a little to fancy. But then, we did'nt want to search any further and picked our table.

I ordered a mango lassi and a tandoori with vegetables, and some rice and naan to go with it. The lassi came first and was good, allthough a little to sweet to my taste. During the wait we could watch the chef through a big glass window operating the tandoori  stove, sticking skewers with meat and veggies into it.  After about 20 minutes our meals were served. I got a plate with plenty of onions, mushrooms, broccoli, pepper, aubergine and courgette. The stuff was spiced allright, with just the right amount of hot and tasty seasoning. The vegs were cooked to the point of perfect crunchiness. A enjoyed every bite. The rice was flavored, I think with cinamon, onions and cloves - absolutely delicius. The naan bread tasted good too and went well with the food.

So I was very satisfied with the food and the price. A little bit annoying were the lights all along the wall at our table, they had a constant flicker which was reflected from our tablecloth. That was a little irritating, but not enough to make us change tables. The service was allright, not the fancy kind, more kind of relaxed.

While I would'nt call the place a gourmet restaurant (as the sign outside suggests), I recommend it to anyone who likes some tasty tandoori food.
