jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Sometimes you write a review and it is painful to be honest about your experience, but in this case, I can offer superlatives without fear of contradiction.  Bar none, this is the best Indian cuisine in Las Vegas!  The surroundings were intriguing, overlooking the Strip and the airport runway, but believe me, once you bring that fork to your mouth, nothing else exists.  We had garlic chicken, the creamed spinach with cheese, Naan and the mixed grill.  Everything was perfectly prepared and savory.  Even the dessert was terrific.  Three entrees, naan, two glasses of wine and dessert for under $80, including tax.  It was only a Thursday night, but they also had a musician/singer playing melodies in the background who was very talented.  The restaurant has only been open 3 1/2 months, but it is already my favorite dining spot in Las Vegas.  A couple seated across from us was from California and had been there twice in three days.  They called Pure India better than any Indian restaurant in LA.  I can understand their enthusiasm!
