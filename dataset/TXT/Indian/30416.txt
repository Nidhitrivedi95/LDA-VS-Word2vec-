Got the mutton biriyani for $7 (including tax). There is a fair amount of meat, and the flavor is great. Warning: it is pretty spicy. It came with a side of pickles, which complimented it well (another review had mentioned a side of eggplant, but I didn't  get that). It also comes with a tandoori leg, which was really tasty and juicy. 

I ordered a mutton roll as well ($1), which was pretty medicore. Also the various other curries they had on display didn't seem very appealing to me (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). 

Takes debit. Fairly big parking lot.
