-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Went for the lunch buffet. The service and ambience was excellent, but the food was average. Maybe I went on a bad day? Idk. Some dishes were excellent, especially the desserts, but the chicken dishes were nothing special. The naan bread was hard and dry too. Might go back again to give it another try.
