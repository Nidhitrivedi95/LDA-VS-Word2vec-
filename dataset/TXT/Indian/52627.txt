uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ I was very impressed with this restaurant. I went there with my girlfriend and we both really enjoyed the food. The restaurant is very nice inside and puts some of the old Greek places on the danforth to shame. I was also extremely shocked to see dinner for 2 for such a reasonable price. The service was also good and the waiters are very nice. I would definitely go there again next recommend it to everyone
