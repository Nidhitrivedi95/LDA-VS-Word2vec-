_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Doesn't surprise me that this place has closed. I went there just before it closed and there were small bugs on two of the plates. Not roach sized- a bit bigger than a fruit fly, but still the most disgusting thing I've seen in a restaurant. I would avoid all restaurants in this group.
