MRoTUJyR2TVpvDdbOAtBlQ We came here on a Thursday night. It's supposed to close in half an hour but they let us in anyway. Food was delivered to us very quickly after ordering. We had Manchurian chicken and chicken pokoras. Chicken pokoras are now one of my favorite Hakka dishes. Manchurian chicken was great too! A bit spicier than I thought it would be.
