vzjmi_Cxom5b1OVQC3B6MA Finally went here after living in the area for almost a year! It was good. I was there a little early (it must have been like, 4pm on a Tuesday) so they didn't seem to have all of the food ready yet. The naan was amazing, as was the butter chicken. The chicken biryani was also very good. Pretty sure I tried a little of almost everything and no complaints here, although none of the food was all that spicy, which was slightly disappointing. Would definitely go back again though!
