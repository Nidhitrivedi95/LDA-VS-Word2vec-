FG3ja8Wz_ukRkTL-seRBFg This was our sixth time ordering from this restaurant.  Normally we order from them through JustEat, but this time we had a Groupon so i went and picked it up. This restaurant is usually 4.5 stars. The food is delicious and the portion sizes generous. It's a bit pricy when all is said and done, so we usually stick to Spring Rolls (which never fails us). 

The reason for the three stars is that this visit was a 2 star. My criticism is that unlike every other time when the containers were pretty much filled right up, this time they were barely half full. I really hope that this had nothing to do with the fact that we had a groupon, as that is not a way to make and keep new customers. We will try Amaya again, but if there is anymore inconsistencies in portion size we'll have to pass and look for another place to get our Indian food fix.
