kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA Went here with my partner, his sister and her partner. Came here on a recommendation from a friend as we were looking for good vegetarian food. As a meat eater I wasn't super excited but I came away full and not disappointed from the lack of meat! Had baked stuffed potatoes and it was delicious, the naan and rice were fab too and my partners okra curry was delicious. Definitely returning and absolutely getting my own okra!!

Service was good and attentive, had a lovely waitress who was very cheerful and helpful.
