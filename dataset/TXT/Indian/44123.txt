RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w How terrible! I saw a lot of the negative reviews but overlooked them for the positive ones-- bad move. Compared to other restaurants nearby this one definitely seems the best from the outside. But as soon as you step in things go downward. No waiters to sit you down or ask you for items. You look at the menu, YOU write it down, and YOU walk you request up to the unfriendly old woman at the counter. From there you sit down and I ordered channa, tarka daal, and chicken tikka. The channa was OK, the 'tarka' daal consisted of the cheapest lentils and had absolutely no tadka whatsoever. The chicken tikka was cold and dry--none of the food is ever made to order; instead it just sits around in the kitchen and they bring it out once it's ordered. Samosas were heavily refried. They don't even give you basics like chutney, raita, or onions unless you get up and specifically ask. Portions were small too and service was subpar. Wouldn't recommend at all.
