ZL6UXFASbbBU5Sile3l6gg Ended up down the shore trying to avoid the festival madness on a rainy sunday afternoon and happened on Guchhi by accident. The food was excellent we had a mix of mussels, scallops, madras and chicken pakora on their 5 tapas for £20 deal. The nan and pilau rice that we ordered were a step above the average too. If you find yourself down the shore I would definately recommend a visit to Guchhi, great food and service.
