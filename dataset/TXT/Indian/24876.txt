h2cPIifmtPD029q4sthRSQ Some parts were great, some were not.

My friends ordered the dinner buffet and the portions were very good and filling. Some of it was good, like the curried chickpeas and butter chicken, but the samosas tasted bland and was most likely not fresh. 

I got the vindaloo chicken. The sauce was great as it was a good amount of spice and the flavor reallt shines through, but the portion was quite small for the price. The naan was very disappointing, a quarter of it was BURNT. And in regards to the actual tastiness...well I've had better ones from Costco. 

The service was pretty bad though. Our server really did not want to be there. Tough luck for us because the owner seems sweet.
