7dZtL9I_AsTQ1pc6t9TTyA Thank God! This place is close to my office! The food is phenomenal as if Heaven Comes to Earth!. Their drinks are also fantastic! All the items are  fresh and healthy. Their spice combination could be their secret, I don't know yet. My fav so far Khalit Wrap with Salmon, Samosa Chaat and Badam Milk. Starting from the Owner- Naveen and the General Manager, all the staff is positive, friendly, and  professional working for your cravings;)
