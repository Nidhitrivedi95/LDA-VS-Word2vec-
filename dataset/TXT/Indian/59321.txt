YywWkWX235ZurTWSLqNPog I hate to write negative reviews but this time I will my stop myself. We have been at this restaurant several times. This is a self serve restaurant. You stand in a line to place your order, get a table, pick up disposable cutlery, foam glass and a water jug, and wait for your number to be called when your food item is ready. 

Prices at the self serve restaurants are usually less when compared with other restaurants with full service. You can get Thali for $6.49 which consists of 3 veggies, a dessert, salad, rice and a nan bread or two rotis (whole wheat bread). It's a decent price and food tastes okay.

However today July 16, 2015 we had made a visit to this restaurant with two other families for a quick meal. In my order I had found a plastic stripe in rice which was about 6-7cm long (pictures have been posted in the picture gallery section). While chewing my food I felts something wasn't right and when I took the stuff out of my mouth that is when I found this plastic stripe. I was disgusted and so as others on the table. Imagine how unhealthy and unhygienic it Paul's have been if I would have digested that plastic.

Sad part is when I showed the plastic found in my food to the girls at the front they called the one of their senior girl who just said it could have been from their plastic bags outside and said she could give me extra rice if I want. She didn't even apologize. I declined her offer of free rice and said thank you to her. 

At that point 6 people on the table had lost their appetite and we decided to leave the place. All 6 of them, regular customers of this restaurant, said they will never visit this unhygienic restaurant again. 

I really hope they take the cleanliness and hygiene seriously.
