A huge variety of appetizers and entrees, both vegetarian and meat based, that are not spiced too hot, and are well suited to the average American palate.  However, for those experienced in ethnic dining, or if you want something more adventurous, you may want to try ordering off the menu on a non-buffet night. I'd recommend the chicken biryani, lamb vindaloo, chicken seekh kebab and the garlic naan. Bon appetit!
