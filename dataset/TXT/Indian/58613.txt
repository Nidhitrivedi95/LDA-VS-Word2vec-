yLmZPpg57FRukoqlLZH_dQ This place was quite disappointing. Reading the reviews my family and I went in with high hopes to have some great Indian evening snack kind of foods. 

1. The service is the worst I've had in a long time. They seated us and then forgot about us. It took them 10 minutes to bring us water and take our menu even though the restaurant wasn't very busy. They never at any point asked how our meal was and mostly ignored us. 

2. The food itself is oily, mostly tastes of spices and the restaurant provides very small portions. What really annoyed me is the poor service in bringing the food. 

My mother received her meal and we figured they would take a few minutes so told her to go ahead and eat. My sister and I received our dosa just as my mother finished her dish so she was left staring at us while we ate. The common stance when serving multiple people food is to bring it out at once or to bring it very close together. 10 minutes apart doesn't count as being acceptable. 

- The pain puri was ok -  nothing to write home about.
- The sabudana vada was the only good part about this meal
- The sada dosa was good for what it is - plain dosa
- The accompanying sambar was incredibly watery and cold despite our dosa being incredibly hot
- The Pav Baji simply tasted of masala. In India when you buy Pav Baji you can taste the vegetables and the butter but at this establishment you can taste only spices that weren't properly cooked out. It was passable for cheap Indian food. 
- The dosa was incredibly greasy and parts of the dosa were quite thick and became soggy quickly 
- The mango lassi was ok but for the price the portion quite small 

$40 for a meal where we were provided slow service, passable food and overall a mediocre experience.

We will not be back.
