PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ I like variety and this place is ALL variety.  I would tell you how many different dishes they offer, but I can only count to 10 in Hindi (I kid you not) and gave up after that.

Weird decor.  Not sure what this place used to be, but the colours and finishes do not suit an Indian restaurant.  It kinda looks like they took over a previous restaurant (maybe Mexican?) and just put a new sign on the place.  Perhaps they purposely chose these colours, but I'm not a fan.

The food, however, is amazing.  I really wanted to try absolutely everything offered, but my stomach wasn't big enough.  Although it was busy on a weekend evening, it never took long to grab food.  The food was replenished quickly if it ever got low.  It was also so busy that nothing ever sat for too long, so it was all very fresh.

While I like being served at a restaurant (I'm a snob) I think getting up and walking a bit between each plate is a good idea.  It definitely helps you pace yourself.  Plus, as already mentioned, I like being able to try lots of different dishes, rather than just ordering one or two dishes.

Great for groups.  Lots of seating.  There were lots of kids there when I was dining there, so be prepared for that.

Interesting (weird) beverage options, but enough to choose from that you're sure to find something satisfying.  I wasn't a huge fan of the dessert options because I find most Indian desserts too sweet, but there's also a good variety offered in that department.

We drove all the way to Brampton JUST to dine at Tandoori Flame, and it was well worth the trip.  Lots of parking available.
