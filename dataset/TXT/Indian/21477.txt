GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA So good! I'm a vegetarian; got the veggie thali plate. Delicious, super-spicy garbanzos and dal, not so great spinach. Excellent value. Mango lassi tasted sweet, not mango-y. Split excellent aloo tiki appetizer. Husband said his chicken thali plate was also great. Wish they'd open one in our part of the country!!
