GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g This cute place on ray road serves authentic south indian fare.It's vegetarian and reasonably priced.
They serve more than 10 varieties of Dosa.The Pav bhaji (rice crepe with pav bhaji masala and onions) and Mysore masala (rice crepe with spicy chutney,potatoes and onion) are my favorites.All Dosa's are $7.99.
I recommend trying the Mysore masala if you can handle a little heat.

We also got the South Indian Thali for $9.99.It comes with rice,sambar,rasam,three types of curry,pappadum,tea/coffee and sweet.For sweet they gave me Gulab jamun (which i love).
The chutney bar is nice.The portions are generous,you can also order the thali's to go.

They would totally be 5 stars if they could get rid of those styrofoam plates because i feel it gets really messy especially if you are eating the Thali.
The interior is basic nothing fancy but the food i would say is very close to Home.

Cheers!
