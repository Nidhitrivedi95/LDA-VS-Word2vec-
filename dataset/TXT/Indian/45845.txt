SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg Man i do love me some indian food!

Went here with a buddy and I was blown away by how the front of the building looked. Place looks like a cross between a jungle, a night club, and a movie theater, yet the side facing the Buffet@Asia place looked like a closed 50's style diner.

The staff was very nice and recommended imported indian beers with our choices of food. The inside of the place was very nicely decorated and Indian music videos were playing on the screen and through the speakers, if that's not immersion i dont know what is.

The food i'm gonna have to agree with everyone else, Portions are ridiculously small and if it wasnt for the appetizer my buddy got we would have stopped by a del taco after hanging out. and the prices are high for the amount of food.

I would take people here from out of town as an experience but as a local i'd stick to smaller mom and pop indian spots
