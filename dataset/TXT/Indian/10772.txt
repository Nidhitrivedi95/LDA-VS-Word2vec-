A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA 3.5 food was great, chutney one of the best. There were only Indian folks inside, so that's a good sign... tikka  masala and aloo were on point and samosas were great too. But the service was horrible. Super nice man, but not very attentive, we had to refill our own sauces, get our own silverware, we should have been on the clock.
