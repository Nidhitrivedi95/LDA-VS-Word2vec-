yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg Love that this is a family run place.  Stopped in for dinner. The menu selection was good.  This was a go to place for us in the past.  Over the last couple years the taste of the food has changed a bit.   I had the keema matter and it came out with a sweetness, like they added a cup of sugar to it.  I've spent a lot of time in India, southern parts and I've never had keema come out sweet.  The chicken tikka masala was ok, wasn't great but good.  I loved that they use actual basmati rice and the naan is awesome.  

The other downside is their speed of service.  They are super friendly but if you're in a hurry, don't plan on getting out of here quick unless you're there for the buffet!
