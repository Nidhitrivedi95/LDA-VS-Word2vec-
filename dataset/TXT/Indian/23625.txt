gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Not sure if chefs have changed or what, but today's lunch buffet was really delicious, fresh and flavorful. Chicken curry was especially on point with enough heat to be potent but not overwhelming. Butter chicken was more complex and rich, satisfying. I'll raise the star levels if they're capable of repeating today's experience.
