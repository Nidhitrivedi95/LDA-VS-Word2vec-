hz8JI69K_LooYtxNClDr5g Went there not long after I came back from a trip to India.  The food was good and tasty. We had a bunch of dishes to share. The only issue is that it was during winter and the restaurant was cold. I don't know if it was a heating issue or if it's always that way. In any case I would suggest going there in the summer to bypass the only inconvenience I have with the place.
