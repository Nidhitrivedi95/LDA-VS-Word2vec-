Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I literally eat here almost every single day.. I've lived and traveled all over the us and abroad and this hands down is my favorite Indian restaurant hands down. The restaurant is beautiful, staff is so pleasant, efficient and sweet and the food is out of this world!!! Service is super fast and food is very inexpensive for the serving size. If you're in the mood for Indian food.. Please try this! You won't be disappointed!!
