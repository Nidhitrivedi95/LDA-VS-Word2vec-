A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA Delicious!!!  I love Indian food (actually I love most food), but I don't do very well with really spicy foods.  Hubs and I found this place on Grub Hub and thought "what the heck, we'll give it a whirl."  And once we started, we can't stop.  We order from this place nearly every week!  Everything we've ordered has been absolute perfection.  We can specify the level of spiciness (so I don't die) and the only, and let me emphasize ONLY, downfall is there is a bit of a wait for the food.  But, it's so worth it that it doesn't even warrant subtracting half a star.  :)

We've tried many menu items, but our favorite is the Palak Paneer.  Most places you have to really dig to find those yummy little cheese cubes.  Not here!  This is stuffed to overflowing with fantastic little bites.  Also, the cucumber sauce is to die for! I could eat that cold and plain as a soup almost!  In fact, I did one night.

The restaurant is small, but always very clean and the owner/staff have always been super-friendly.  This place is a little gem in Chandler and I will definitely be back for more!
