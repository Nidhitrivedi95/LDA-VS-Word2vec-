DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I had the brunch this time (Not my first time here)..Definitely expensive ($13) for their brunch. Good variety of breakfast items - The pongal was amazing..Idly, Dosai were just the usual. The sambar was just OK (they should improve considering it is the primary side for b'fast)..The gobi manchuria was amazing..The lunch items were OK (one snack, paratha, 2 entrees & veg biryani). Decent variety of desserts (the gulab jamun was perfect & this is another place that serves it hot)..Ordered Mango Lassi on the side & it was amazing! 

Final Verdict: I would visit this place again, provided, they improve their sambar!
