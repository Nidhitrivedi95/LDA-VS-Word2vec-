uBcwnALb3HFKZ-Vvj0conQ I'm an Indian person and this reminds me of the food that my mother (and I) make ourselves -- in a good way. I ordered the chicken masala and it was quite excellent; my only nit-pick is that this was made with boneless breast meat, while I've typically seen it made with bone-in dark meat chicken, which gives the masala a richer flavor (from the gelatin and marrow in the bones). But the breast meat was very tender and the rasa (sauce) was terrific. We also ordered the vegetarian thali, which was also very good. The shahi paneer and channa masala in the thali were both very tasty. The only other small negative is that the naan, while tasty, wasn't freshly made.

I understand that they're opening a sister restaurant that's slightly bigger called Peg-n-Tikka (or something like that). The bigger size would be welcomed, as Namaste is very tiny.

One other note: my 4 stars are typically the same as most people's 5 stars, so that's not a knock on this restaurant at all. I'm just a pickier grader. :)
