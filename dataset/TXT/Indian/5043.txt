2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw My husband and I went on a Friday night.  We shared a grilled mix meat dish and rice. Food was presented well and taste was on point.  Very flavourful.  Made us want more.  But we were satisfied with the portion. 

The service was okay.  Not a small family feel but not like a Moxie-type rush.  

Price was over priced compare to other small restaurants which would give you larger portions and the same quality food.  It was odd a $20 something meat dish did not include rice. 

Would I return...no.  I'd like to explore other similar restaurants.
