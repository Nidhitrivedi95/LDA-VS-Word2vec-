auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Have been here probably 50 times, and every time got the buffet to go.  All of a sudden they change their policy to dine in only.  I guess spending like $50 a trip wasn't good enough.  I did notice that there were 3 people in the restaurant today.  Seems insane to not take my business.  Everest is better anyway.
