TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Ordered takeout chicken saagwala- sooo good! $14 for a nice portion (rice was separate but a huge order.) saag was creamy with tender chunks of chicken. I like spicy Indian food (but can't take it too hot) so the "regular" intensity was perfect. One of the most savory versions I've tried - if they were walkable it would have been 5 stars
