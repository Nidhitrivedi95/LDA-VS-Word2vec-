JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg Today I ordered delivery. I was pleased that they took my order & delivered the food fast even before their normal delivery hours.
The food arrived very hot & fresh. 
I orderes garlic naan & butter chicken. 
I put 4 stars only that souse for butter chicken was way too liquidish, but taste was all right.
