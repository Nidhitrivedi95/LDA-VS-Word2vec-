Surprisingly, it was not crowded so we were seated immediately. The menu has a good selection of items including vegetarian dishes. I assume a number could also be vegan or made vegan. I ordered the lamb korma (spicy), and it was very good. The right amount of heat and very flavorful. The serving size was generous, and we ended up full without an appetizer. Overall, worth the time and money for sure.
