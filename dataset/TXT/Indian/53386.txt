VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Tandoori Times has quickly become one of my favorite restaurants. Until about 6 months ago I had never even tried Indian food now I'm here every Wednesday if not 2x a week. I can not get enough of the methi chicken and Lamb korma (Wednesday lunch specials) along with the great service and friendly staff it is an awesome place.
