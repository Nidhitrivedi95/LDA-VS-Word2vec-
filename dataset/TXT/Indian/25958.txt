i0vXeFOD6e-DZ8cBwxaQRQ So I had seen a video of ice cream that was made like this on Facebook but it was somewhere in New York. I had asked my aunt if there was something like it here in Az. And this was the place. I had been waiting to try it. I went with my mom and best friend and man was I impressed and pleased beyond measure. I couldn't tell you what I had the two times I came here but the ice cream tastes so good. It's so fun to watch them. I wish I could explain how they do it but it's hard to explain. They roll it themselves on the metal thing with their utensils. You literally follow the directions on the paper, write your name and give it to them and they make it for you. They also have Indian food there for sale as well and man does that taste good too. I had a sample my first time and my stomach was so satisfied. I can't wait to go back and have Indian food with my ice cream. I love this place!
