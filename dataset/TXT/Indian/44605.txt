S104l3lOcpkX6g98CFrGPw Excellent food and service for a BYOW, I was very impressed. We decided to split one of their combination menus for two and let me tell you for a big eater I was having a hard time finishing the food in front of me ! Best mulligatawny soup I've ever had and the curries phenomenal. 

Definitely a gem in Verdun's wellington neighbourhood... which is starting to get pretty up and coming ! In a nutshell, great food, great service, great decor and great prices... what more can you ask for ? I will be back to this place !!! Bravo !
