uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg I had their Thali lunch special, non-veg. It was $10 and came with 3 curries, rice, naan, and a porridge dessert.

Two of the curries had chicken and one a fritter. The one with the fritter was yellow and amazing. This was a thinner sauce but had great flavor. The fritter had great texture and flavor. There was a brown colored curry that was the texture of yogurt. There were good chunks of chicken that were cooked well. There was a good spice to this one. The last curry was very thick, almost to chutney territory. Once again the chicken was great and a very solid flavor.

I had a hard time deciding whether to dip my naan in the curries or eat them over the large serving of rice. The naan had a good flavor and a perfect slightly chewy texture.

The dessert was almond flavor and very thin. I talked to the owner afterwards and he called it a porridge. When I think porridge I think thicker, but either way it was great. I usually don't go too crazy for Indian desserts like mango ice cream but this was worth the trip by itself.

The owner was super nice and the place looks way better then when it was a burrito place. The food was done before I finished paying which had me skeptical, but I will be back for sure.
