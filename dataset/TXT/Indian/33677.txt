lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw First time there, also most likely my last time. Staff where very polite with assisting me on what to order as a first time customer. I order the SALLI CHICKEN BOWL, it was very tasty, but the only thing was it came with 3 small chunks of chicken. I think I paid $14 for the meal.
