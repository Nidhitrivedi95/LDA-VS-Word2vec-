Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Got there right at 11am opening on a week day for the buffet. Some the most fragrant and delicious Indian food I have ever had. Very authentic, polite and attentetive staff, nice cozy environment. Insanely reasonable for all you can eat for two..came out to be under $30 with the 10% check in discount. This place is a gem. Sweet rice and mini samosas are amazing, they bring fresh naan to your table even when you eat at the buffet. We will absolutely return next we're in Vegas!
