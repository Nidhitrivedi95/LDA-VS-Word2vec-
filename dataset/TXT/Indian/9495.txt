8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Been going there  two a week now. We had Curry fish, Aloo Gobi, Lamb Saag today. Curry was very rich and savory without strong scents of coconut. Aloo was unbelievable with bright reddish tomato paste. Lamb Saag, the saag still surprises me every time and it's a full bowl of lamby lamb chops today.
