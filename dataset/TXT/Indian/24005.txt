gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A we stopped here on 12/28 evening  after enjoying a day long in valley of Fire. It's located completely away from Strip, so pretty good spacious parking space available. Ordered Garlic Naan (Aweome ! sooperb), jeera rice (just too much of Jeera felt bit uncomfortable wile chewing), Mushroom masala and Paneer tikka masala along with Pakora - all prepared with perfect authentic propositions. Few of my friends tried Lamb Briyani and they said it was hard to bite. But on the whole we had a perfect diinner for our evening. Hall is very spacious and have very less  wait time is 1-4 mins.  -  Must try if you are in need to tasty good Indian food in LV
