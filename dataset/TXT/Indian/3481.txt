0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Happened to be in the area and saw the decent reviews so I had high expectations. I live in Markham which is close to Scarborough and as such, I've had some of the best Hakka in Canada. Hands down. 

This place is nicely renovated with adequate seating. The staff was quite tight lipped and slow, but I was hoping that the food would make up for it. 

Unfortunately, it didn't come through. I ordered fish with steamed rice. The food was exceptionally salty - like unnecessarily so. There was also too much sauce. 

I'm not a big fan of this place. I was trying to be healthy and maybe ordered the wrong plate. 

But I figure that if you're at a good restaurant, all dishes should be amazing.
