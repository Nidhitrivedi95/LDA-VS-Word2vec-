M4vHTtux1VDKA_KC5I_JOA Very tasty, authentic buffet. It's a smaller place than we expected from the photos, but that gives it quite a nice, friendly and cosy atmosphere.

They're bringing out fresh food all the time, so you get that just-cooked taste with every dish. The garlic naan is lovely - really buttery and fluffy. Also, for those with a sweet tooth, try the gulab jamun, yum. Round off your meal with an Indian tea - they do a really nice one with a chai spice flavour.

Good value too - although the food's rich and tasty, so you'll soon get your fill.
