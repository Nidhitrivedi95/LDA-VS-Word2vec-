_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Food like a fusion of Indian and Mexican.  Some of the fried items were a little too greasy - still tasty (Samosa sampler).  Spinach and cheese Naan (I forget the name) was a bit limp and like a quesadilla.  Jackfruit dish was nice - savory, chili-like.  Tandoor Paneer cheese (I forget the name) came on a skewer.   They were large chunks of cheese on the skewer - a little dry inside.  However the dipping sauce that came with it may the dish good.  Perhaps, I'm not used to the cost of glasses of wine in Toronto - but they were particularly costly.  Service was professional, business-like, a little cold.  Nice ambience.  Restaurant is on 3 relatively small levels - main level has cozy nook round table.  2 level has view of cooks through a screen (not certain that this is that great).  3rd level has some seats with view of street.
