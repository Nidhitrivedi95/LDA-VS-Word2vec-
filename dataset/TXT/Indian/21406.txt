GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA We know good Indo-Pak food (having grown up on Indo-Pak food gives us some credibility) and on our 1st visit, the whole group left raving!! 
The Kharai Goat was finger licking good! 
Seekh Kebabs were so flavorful! 
The Afghani Boti was grilled to perfection. 
The chicken tikka masala was ok. 
And the mango lassi was so refreshing!!! 
We will be back to Curry Corner for sure!! Worth the 30 min drive from So Chandler:)
