rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ For a fast, casual Indian restaurant, Cafe Delhi is great. I might not go out of my way to go here, but it's convenient for me, affordable (especially lunch), and take out is always fast (I rarely ever eat in here). Lunch is the best deal. I enjoyed the Malai Kofta but was disappointed that there were only two dumplings; my other standby Channa Masala is always good. Naan seems to be kind of variable, but not sure how much of that is a factor of getting it to go.
