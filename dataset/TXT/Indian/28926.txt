jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Pros:
- Butter chicken & Palak Paneer was really good.
- Ambiance was warm and modern
- Service was very friendly
- Restrooms were clean

Cons: 
- Service was extremely slow
- Naan was a bit hard
- Music coming from the Hooka Lounge was too loud.

I would reccomend this restraunt.
