yLmZPpg57FRukoqlLZH_dQ Pretty good chat restaurant although they have much more. I had a few of the dishes and all were made very well. The best was the dhai puri. The service was very very quick. I was surprised at that. 

Only reason for a 4 is because I've been spoiled by another chat restaurant in New Jersey. The food isn't as good as Bombay Talk.
