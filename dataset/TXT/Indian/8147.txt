7dZtL9I_AsTQ1pc6t9TTyA Finally got to try this place out after finishing a round of 9 hole nearby. Came in the last hour before closing so it wasn't busy but still smelled delicious upon entry. 

I love the decor and fun ordering counter. I got the soy kebab kathi roll, they ran out of soy tikka!  The spice I asked for on the side really helped but the flavor of the roll was great. Simple but strong, ate left overs the next day and it was still good. 

Thought the bread was a little thick but still flaky and delicious. 

The samosa chat was good, except just slightly too sweet for me. 

My friends tried the bowl and samosa sliders. Both liked but didn't finish their portions and had leftovers. 

Will come back again if I'm in the area!
