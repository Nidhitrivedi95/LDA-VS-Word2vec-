A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA I was originally introduced this restaurant by a group of my yoga teachers. They are all vegan I believe. I am not a vegetarian, but have no discrimination against vegetarian food and I love Indian cuisine, so I gave it a try.

Udupi's food - is South Indian, which I understand is less creamy compared to North Indian (sorry for my poor description I'm not an expert). I love creamy Indian food such as butter chicken, but Udupi's not-so-rich food wins over it with the complex blend of the spice. It make an amazing harmony with the vegetable ingredients, kudos to the chefs. 

I order South Indian Thali - which you get a number of staple plates, yogurt and a desert. More of the same variety each time, but I never get bored after visiting there over 10 years. Cost effectiveness, friendly service adds to the goodness of the food. This is absolutely the best Indian restaurant in Toronto, in my opinion.
