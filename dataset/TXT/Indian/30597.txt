kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw What a dilemma! So many tempting dishes on the menu and I can only order one.

The quality of the ingredients and preparation easily matches any Asian restaurant in town. But with the counter service and informal atmosphere, I enjoy bargain prices. 

I don't recommend the small- sized egg rolls. Everything else on the menu has been a delightful dining experience.  And, obvious effort has been devoted to keeping the place clean. I highly recommend Curry in a Box.
