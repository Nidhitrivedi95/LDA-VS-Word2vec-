yk4d81xgwrXJvoWMxWftvw We stopped by here the other night, noticing it was new to the neighbourhood. It's tucked into a corner next to a bank, and easy to miss, but we are so glad we tried it! The decor is very simple and functional, and they seem to have a small menu, but man is the food good! The owners were so kind and gracious, and the prices are super reasonable for the portions and quality. My personal favourite was the spinach with paneer, great fresh spinach flavour and a velvety texture. Butter chicken and naan also excellent. Really high quality, clearly freshly cooked from scratch food. I really hope this place sticks around - we will be regular customers.
