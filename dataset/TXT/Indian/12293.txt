auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Had a gnarly hankering for some Indian.  Grub Hubbed it over to the pad and got my Indian on!  Yummmmmy!!  Had the Lamb Korma, Basmati Rice and Naan.  Totally awesome flavor, barley ANY salt used which is refreshing and loved not having to leave the house and have fabulous Indian food!  It is rather pricey but I won't be ordering it everyday!
