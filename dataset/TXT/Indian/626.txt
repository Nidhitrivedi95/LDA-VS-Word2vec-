-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q Mirch has a great student lunch buffet with a pretty decent variety of foods (including the classics such as chicken tikka masala) at a good price (and student discount)!!!  My main caveat with this place is that the food is toned down compared to other Indian food that I've eaten.  I'm not sure if this is to cater to the diverse student body, but for more flavor and/or spice, there are better Indian restaurants in the area.
