H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ This place is so close to home and I stop here all the time to pick up food when I don't feel like cooking. Why have I not posted a review before?

I've always found the food to be good, in the better half of all the similar Hakka restaurants I've been to. I do, however, still have my favourite joints that I frequent. I sometimes find I have to add a bit more salt but maybe that's just my taste.

My orders have included Chili Chicken, Manchurian Chicken, Chicken Wings, Chicken Fried Rice, Crispy Beef, Hakka Chow Mein, Cantonese Chow Mein, Singapore Noodles, and a few other dishes. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are very generous, often enough for three servings. Great value!
