9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g We traveled an hour to get to the restaurant on a regular Sunday, at 12:45 in the afternoon, after checking their website at home, only to be told that the restaurant was closed all day today for a private function.  There was no information to indicate this otherwise, they don't ask you to call ahead and check first, so there really is no way to know that this could also happen.  We are big fans of the food, but such unprofessional behaviour is very disheartening and disappointing.  Will rethink going back again.  There are plenty of really good Indian restaurants to go to.
