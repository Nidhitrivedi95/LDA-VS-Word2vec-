qLEShJZktG253dxYTG5jYA WARNING!!!!  DO NOT EAT OR ORDER FROM HERE.

We ordered from here off Just-eat.ca and what a shit show. We ordered a small tandoori chicken and they called to tell me that it doesn't come in small so I said we'll take the large or whatever size they had. We also ordered a small butter chicken and some rice and naan. It took an hour and a half before our food came, only to find that there was no tandoori chicken, a samosa (which we did not order) and the food was cold. Looked at the bill and it showed that we were charged for the tandoori chicken. I called the restaurant and there was no answer. 

So I called just-eat and they got a hold of them and the guy (Joseph) on the phone tried to explain that instead of giving us tandoori they gave us a medium butter chicken (instead of small) and a samosa to account for the missing tandoori... unbelievable! Seeing that the price of the tandoori was not equal to upsizing the butter chicken and we didn't want a samosa, I demanded that I wanted a refund for the tandoori and he argued with me. I threatened to write this review and he agreed to give me the refund which I have a feeling I will never actually see.

On top of this, later in the evening just after we go to bed my girlfriend is hit with a wave of nausea... Yep, food poisoned from the indian food we got at this place. We ended up calling 911 because of how violent the illness got and the paramedics came and treated her. She is ok now, but wow, amazing what damage ordering from this hell hole can cause. Be warned!
