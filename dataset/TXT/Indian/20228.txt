fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA This place is my go to Indian joint. It's all you can eat as well which makes it really attractive. And at $14 you can't lose. 

There is a wide variety of dishes from goat to chicken to veggie. 

All of their dishes are fresh and exciting. 

The butter chicken is really delicious and they are very generous with their meat. 

The best part is that you don't leave the restaurant feeling dehydrated and pasty. 

The food is clean and fresh. 

Great place!
