UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This was my first Indian restaurant in Vegas.  Went with a friend and it was great....I'm looking forward to going back and maybe try the Inferno menu....I'll sign the waiver!!!  Everything we had was darn good.  I can not remember the actual name of the dish I had but it had Mango and Chicken but it was super.  My friend had a veggie dish based off of a butter chicken curry....and he said his too was good.  I've been telling my friends all about it.
