-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q Stopped by for dinner, they had amazing chicken tikka masala and gulab jamun. My friend choked, completely his fault, and they offered to give him anything on the menu thinking he was upset. Such amazing service and a great family owned restaurant ! Will be back again very soon :)
