yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw All of the Indian food places I go to are usually the same old same old, and upset my stomach. The Dhaba has extremely tasty food you will not regret, super cute set up, and our waitress was very friendly and recommended my dishes and my beer. She has good taste! I can't wait to go back. My mouth waters every time I think about it. YUMMMM.
