XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Came by here (commuted over 2 hours) because I heard they had the BEST CHILI CHICKEN....nope. Not even close. My friend and I found it to have no spicy and little flavour at all. Originally, I thought we must have gotten the wrong item but looking at photos, it looks right. We were expecting the chicken to be crispy as I read in some reviews, however, our dry chili chicken was SOGGY. It was actually the worst chili chicken Ive ever had... I would reccomend this place in Scarborough on pharmacy (forgot the name), or chili chicken house in Mississauga. Try making chili chicken at home too. My mom's is much better than this place. 

Other menu items/highlights :
- gyuma blood sausage appetizer: DELICIOUS MUST TRY ITEM. It was my first time trying blood sausage or blood anything. Had no idea what I was putting in my mouth but everything including the onions were a delight. The sauce was sososo good! 
- ginger garlic bok Choy had a great tasting sauce
- was not expecting a huge bowl of steamed rice. We ordered a fried rice bowl and ended up not eating much of the plain rice or finishing the fried rice. It looked like they used different grains of rice. 
- tibet fried rice was better than expected, tastier than the basic Chinese fried rice that it basically looks like
- service: okay... We didn't have water for a long time. We waited for her to come back and asked her to fill it. I think even then, she only did once. We were the only table in the restaurant too for awhile. Then two other groups came.
