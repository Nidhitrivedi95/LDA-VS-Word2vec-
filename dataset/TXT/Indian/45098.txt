S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA This place is always so inviting and friendly.  The service is amazing.  My drink was never half full before it was filled. The naan was always refilled. Plates cleared right away. The buffet is so delicious and has a great meat and vegetarian selection. The best chicken tikka masala I've ever had. 
My husband loves the desserts. They have rice pudding and the heavenly doughnut like balls. There is even chai included in the buffet and it's so inexpensive for such a huge selection, $7.99 lunch buffet.  They have everything from two types of rice, entrees, salad, samosas, and dessert.  Definitely our new favorite Indian place. 
They have goat and lamb on the weekends!! 
It's family owned and operated.
