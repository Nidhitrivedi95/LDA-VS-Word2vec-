Taste wise, it's definitely not close to the best Indian food I tried in Toronto (excluding my time in India!), but it isn't bad either. Curries for both chicken and chickpeas are not spicy enough. Naans were lukewarm. Portion is OK. Would come back when wanting to stay close by and craving a quick butter chicken or curry, but not my first choice.

The "restaurant" is a small area. They have a couple tables to sit and eat, but are always taken so the people in line are mostly taking it to-go. You can also eat it at the food court close by.
