kMgdZVLzAXM1JQwFsPXIlg Huge portioned butter chicken roti although on the expensive side, I did have it in two sittings so... it's like a $7 meal (total was ~$14). Definitely not bad at all.

Came by for take out and waited a long as/s while with no AC and a fan that blows towards the kitchen instead of the patrons. Be sure to take down their number and call ahead of time so you don't have to sweat your ba/lls off while waiting for your food.

I got the medium spicy butter chicken roti but feel like I should have gone for the spicier one (I lovehabanero and scotch bonnet peppers so you can gauge the level of spiciness).

I would definitely return but will call in ahead of time!
