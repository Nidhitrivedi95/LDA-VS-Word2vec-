V679T4yys91392j8rcKaMQ Friendly owner, nice ambience and good fusion Indian food. Ideal for those looking for a nice fusion Indian flavor along with a small bar. We ordered Kathi roll and Malai Methinks (really flavorful and tasty). Bread/naan was fresh and buttery. Overall a good value for the money.
