UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ What a jem of an Eastern Indian cuisine restaurant in the middle of Laveen Arizona! The curries are absolutely delicious and my husband loves the kabobs. Incidentally, my husband claims not to be very fond of spicy ethnic foods in general, but he loves this place so I think that says a lot. My favorites are the lamb korma, chicken tikka masala, and curried shrimp and vegetable dishes. Thanks Kabob Express!! ;)
