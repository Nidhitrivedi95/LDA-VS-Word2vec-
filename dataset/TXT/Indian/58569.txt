YLeAUkFFJri_21uTkyrVFg This past Sunday, I made the very snowy trek up into north Scarborough to try some Malaysian food at Malaysian Garam Masala. It is definitely out-of-the-way, in a small strip plaza in a residential area near to Woodside Square (coincidentally not far from where I went to high school back when the area was REALLY out-of-the-way). As other reviews have noted, the place is not much to look at, about a dozen green tables with flowery wallpaper and a few panes of mirror, and a serving counter at the back where you place your order. But it is very clean and bright, and the service was very attentive. Admittedly, there were only a few other people dining-in, and some others who came for pick-up, but this was not bad considering the very bad weather at the time.

After browsing the menu and asking a few questions, I ordered the Malaysian fried rice with chicken and the Garam Masala fish. The fried rice was excellent, spicy but I still added some of the hot sauce provided on the side. There was also lots of it, a large plate piled high with a fair bit of chicken mixed in; this certainly could have been a filling meal on its own. The fish was also pretty good, but not a standout like the rice. The rest of the menu has different varieties of chicken, beef, fish, shrimp, rice and noodle dishes and several types of roti. A meeting of Indian and Chinese styles, similar to the hakka restaurants that are popular now.

With one $4 beer, my bill came to only $21, and I had enough leftover to take to work for lunch. Definitely a strong recommendation; great food for a low price. I will most certainly be returning to try other dishes.
