IpuLXGV2iSsQhejPIM3NQA If you want the best pastries ever then this is the place to go! Their mango pastry is to die for!!!! They make the cakes and pastries without any eggs and initially I was a bit worried about the taste but I was wrong. It was just, delicious! Their masala tea and puffed pastries were yummy too and I will definitely go back. If you are in the area, make the trip. It was so worth it for us.
