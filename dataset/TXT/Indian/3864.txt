0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Bets buffet in the valley in my opinion. We all know buffets can be a little scary but to my surprise, this place was an absolute delight. All the food was enjoyable and the service was on point, constantly refilling my water and bussing my dirty dishes. The only complaint I have is the decor and look of the place. Very old and rundown looking, could use a refurbishment to make the place seem more welcoming and appealing. A regular bystander would most likely run from this place form how it looks on the outside but give it a chance!
