ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ So the unfortunate reality about Toronto is that it's actually really hard to find great Dosas! That being said, Madras Masala is pretty good; you'll be just fine coming here as there really isn't a better option downtown that I know of. 

My 3 stars really should be a 3.5 but that's not possible with Yelp and 4 stars just doesn't seem right.

If you haven't experienced South Indian cuisine, then you will have no problem enjoying this place.

Most importantly, I can confidently say that I have been here multiple times and will return multiple times again in the future.

Enjoy. :)
