xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw This is the best fry bread I have ever tried, hands down! It is slightly crunchy, light, and a bit chewy- literally the most perfect! Also, the portions are huge! I ate half a taco for dinner and enjoyed the rest for lunch the next day. As far as ambiance, I love the way this restaurant is laid out- the lines feel very clean and uncluttered, thanks to their unique use of ropes to demarcate the order line. Their string lighting is very kitschy and adds an artistic flair that balances out the modern feel of the space.  The food and ambiance makes me want to bring g everyone I know here- thanks Fry Bread House!
