5HAv0eKeid0MIEAr-IqYkw Enjoyed a great lunch here last week.  Both of us are a little picky about Indian food because we eat it so much, and this place was a-okay in our book.  We had the business lunch special, which was a great value.  Enjoyed nice appetizers, a soup and a dish of lentil onion dumplings which I forgot the proper name of, followed by a Tandoori chicken and another curry dish, with naan and rice.  Included in our meal was a rice pudding dessert with coffee and tea.  Restaurant is nice and clean, and has a great location.
