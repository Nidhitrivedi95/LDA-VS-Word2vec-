zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Just as an FYI, they are closed Fridays from 12:30 pm to 1:30 pm and a sign inside states that they only do takeout after 8 pm Monday to Thursday and 9 pm Friday and Saturday.  Only reason I mention this is that I happened to place an order at 12:28 pm one Friday.  They mentioned their closing and gave me the option of still placing the order with my food being ready at 1:30 pm.  it was no big deal so I went with it.

A few months back my car was in the shop for about a week and I took the bus to work.  Passed by this place and meant to stop by but never did.  It was featured in a recent issue of Phoenix Magazine Cheap Eats.  I decided it was time to take the plunge.  Tried the mantoo and garlic naan for lunch take out.  This is the first time I've tried Afghani/Pakistani food but love Indian and Greek food and imagine I'll become a further fan of Afghani/Pakistani food as well.  

The mantoo had so much flavor I absolutely loved it and would recommend it.  Going to go back and work my way through more of the menu.
