nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA Great food, but unfortunately their service sucks. Ordered butter chicken and mutton biryani. Our mutton biryani came right away but the butter chicken came 45 minutes later because they didn't place the order in. After we reminded them about it, they came out with the wrong dish. Terrible service.
