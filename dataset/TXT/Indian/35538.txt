MWcN6qLWTfRJqLySxwJNqQ Great little place serving fast-casual Indian and Middle Eastern food.  It's located in a small plaza off Center Ridge. You walk up to the counter and order from the menu boards. They have ample seating inside, but it's nothing fancy. They used to have a lunch buffet 7 days a week, but now it's only M-F. :( 

The first time I stopped in with my sister, we each ordered entrees from the kabob menu and a side of Naan.  Wow, the food was fantastic!  I ordered the lamb kabob and my sister had chicken. The meat was perfectly tender and flavorful and the Naan was super airy and soft...perfect!

The second time, I ordered Butter Chicken and a side of naan from the Indian menu.  The flavor of the sauce was spot on, but the chicken tasted a bit overdone and maybe like it was reheated from last night?  The rice that came with it seemed like some Uncle Bens microwaved instant rice..no fluffiness at all...lacking gluten. Not acceptable! Definitely different from the basmati rice I had the first time.  My meal would've been perfect had they fixed the chicken and the rice.

Overall, it's a good place. I just bought a Groupon for Kabob Place. We'll see how my next visit goes.
