Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw We've been to Delhi Palace three times now.  I prefer their dinner service to their lunch buffet. The lunch buffet has a decent number of options but I didn't care for the food too much. The saag or palak dish(not sure) was tasty but I found the baingan bharta to be too sweet for me. The rice was ok not overcooked. 
For dinner I usually order the paneer tikka masala and garlic naan and this time we also ordered the chole. Both of which were tasty and hot. The naan was delicious and oddly enough, mixing the gravy from the chole and paneer tikka masala resulted in a delicious tasting curry. The chole does have ample raw onion in it, so if you don't like raw onion let the waiter know. I personally like it so it wasn't a problem. They offer a complimentary dessert of rice kheer(rice pudding) with a gulab jamun in it. I was a little skeptical as a I don't care for rice kheer but together with the gulab jamun it was pretty tasty and I ended up finishing it. 
Overall I enjoyed the food, the owner was very polite and nice, as were the wait staff, our glasses were filled all the time and the owner came personally to each table to ask how the food was which I really appreciated.
