fVbZptKCH2lIRS56M1zc6g We are almost a regular customer now!!! We like the foods here.

Good food at good price. Spicy (just what you expect from Indian cooking), aromatic and freshly cooked. 

Some times it may take quite a long wait before the food is served. Keep average 20 minutes in hand after you place your order for dinner. Most of the servers are pretty helpful and polite (except few, but that is natural I guess).
