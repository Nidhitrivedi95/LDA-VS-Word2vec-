DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ I have to admit that I'm still somewhat of a newcomer to Indian food.  A friend at work got me to try Nirvana II near the office for lunch once and that good experience got me started.  Turns out that I've become a big fan of the flavor profiles overall.

Sangam is near home and I learned they had a lunch buffet.  What better way to try more varieties of a new to me cuisine!  Other than the basics like veggie masala and tandoori chicken, there's no way I can tell you what I ate by name due to the newcomer deal but, I can tell you that I enjoyed all of it.  Every item I tried on the buffet was delicious, hot (temp not spice) and flavorful.  There are cards above each item letting you know what the dish is, what's in it, spice level, etc.

The service was very attentive with the old plate removed when I went back for seconds, water glass kept full, check brought and processed quickly at the end of the meal.  I love the fact that I can continue lunch visits to Sangam and keep exploring.
