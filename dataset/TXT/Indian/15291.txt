CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ My wife wanted to go here with me recently because she had often been to the one in Dubai when she lived there and also the one in Vancouver anytime she visited her brother. The unfortunate reality is that while the other locations are good, this one is not even worth giving a second chance.

The food was all way overcooked and didn't taste quite right. The service was ok but not amazing and we really didn't understand why the place was so busy? 

We were even hoping to at least have decent Dosa's but they were absolutely mediocre and not worth the drive from downtown to this place.

Unfortunately, I would not suggest this place to anyone who knows anything about South Indian cuisine. To be honest, I would suggest this to anyone really. :P
