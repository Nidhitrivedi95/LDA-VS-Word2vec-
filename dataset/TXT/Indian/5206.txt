2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Visiting from out of town on business and had a craving for vegetarian Indian food. Found this place on Yelp and was initially skeptical due to the lack of sidewalk appeal. I took a chance and was so completely happy I did! Reviewers are right, this is a huge portion, but I managed to scarf the entire thing myself. Unpretentious and authentically delicious. I had the Chana Roti (mild) and loved it. Very "clean" food without a lot of additions or oil. 

Tips: cash/debit only. No real seating. Made to order fresh (this is a good thing!), so prepare to wait 10 min for your food.
