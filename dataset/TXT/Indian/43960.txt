RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This is a PAKISTANI restaurant people, Lahore is the capital of one of the provinces in Pakistan. Indian food tastes dull, has no meat in it and is usually quite tasteless. This is what Pakistani food tastes like. Kebabs, Naans, Lamb and Karahi Woks are a Pakistani thing.

Anyway, personally since I'm a Born and bred Lahori, their food is Horrible and a disgrace to the famous Lahori taste. I only eat here when I forget how horrible the food is here.
