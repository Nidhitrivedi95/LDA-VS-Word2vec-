yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg I was unaware of this little gem of a restaurant next to Trader Joe's in Ahwatukee, and the only reason I ventured there with my wife was that there was a Groupon deal for it. Thanks Groupon! 

Here are a couple of things I thought were worth mentioning about my experience:

Food:
I had the Chicken Tikka Masala with "medium" spice levels, and it did not disappoint. The curry was fragrant, rich and spicy! Just the way it should be. I'd be hard pressed to recommend a better Indian curry to my friends. The garlic naan was also well done and was a decent portion, be it for a slightly exorbitant price (more on that below).

Spice Level:
Spice levels are more spicy than the the typical Indian buffet, so beware if you have a delicate constitution. My wife was tempted to get "hot", but lucky enough she settled for "medium". It was just right  for her, and she likes spicy food.

Price:
The meal was a little on the pricey side due to the fact that we had to pay $2 - $5 for rice/bread on top of the entree, as it is not included with it. 

Onion Fumes:
While waiting for the food to come out, I started tearing, and started wondering if I was just having a "moment". ;) But as it turned out, it was onion fumes wafting into the dining room from the kitchen that were making my eyes water. Yes, the fumes were that strong! Then again, we sitting right by the kitchen door and it was a little stuffy as it was cold outside (winter) and they likely had the heater on. I did cease to notice it once the food came though, because I then started crying tears of joy whilst stuffing my face. Nom nom nom!

Conclusion: 
I would likely return, and bring a couple of friends or family members back with me!
