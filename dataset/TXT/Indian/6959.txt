4scx_rtI9RZfFHWUxqPuHw The ability to sit on the square was really nice with a great view of the square.  The food was solid but not the best Indian I have had in Madison.  Garlic Naan was a bit flat and the dishes were not terribly aromatic or bursting with flavor.  I would come back for sure as it is a nice experience.  Perhaps it was a one off night.  I enjoyed myself and will return at some point.
