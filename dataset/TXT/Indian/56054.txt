xhc-bSw2Cz2Inskzjve3Rg There are a lot of Indian buffets on the westside of Madison and my husband and I like to go to them all. Most are very similar but sometimes you get different things when you eat at a variety of them. My husband and I wanted to see if we could throw this one into our rotation.

Service was very good and attentive. There was also a large variety of food more than I think at other buffets. I liked that they had several different appetizers to choose from. Nann came out hot and had a good texture. However, everything else (curries, tikka masala, chicken dish, etc) was just really salty. When I got home I felt so parched and drank a ton of water.

We will probably try it again because it had just opened when we were there and maybe my taste buds were off that day.
