-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw Thank you Chef Hemant Kishore for stepping up the pub dining game to something actually interesting and exciting!  Who the hell is doing stuff like deep fried banana peppers in a spiced chickpea batter (Chilli Bajji) or doing a non-Thai whole pompano fish?  Nobody!  That's why this place rocks.  

Our group bulldozed through almost the whole menu and here's what I am definitely having again:

Rasta Wings:  Spicy and a little sweet, these babies were perfectly fried.  Buffalo wings can take a back seat to these jerks any day.   

Biryani:  Complex flavor profile where the mouth get hits from all angles in one bite, along with that oh-so-fucking-tender chicken made this a clear winner.  It was the best version of the popular mixed rice dish that I've had in a long time.  

Asian Persuasion One:  Not one second of persuasion needed for this Asian to devour the living hell out of this burger!  Hell yes to Mongolian beef, grilled shrimp and gochujang aioli on a grilled sesame brioche bun.   It honestly hurt to share and I never plan on doing that ever again.  A perfectly cooked sunny side up egg makes everything better including this.    

If there is anything to gripe over, it's Inn Zone Bar itself.  I attempted to dine here a couple of weeks before only to enter an insanely smoky atmosphere that made me believe they could only be burning Marlboro Reds like incense, which prompted an exit in less than 30 seconds.  You should plan on wearing it out.   But the food is so damn good; I'd even tolerate being seated between Marge Simpson's sisters for it.
