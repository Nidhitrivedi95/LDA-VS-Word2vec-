VmHGm_FNSZBjnolJ9f7Svg I loved it. Went there with my boyfriend on sunday and ordered 3 diferent tartares (they have so many options of meat and styles is amazing!) - i loved them all! We also ordered a portion of fries and salad and the salad was specially good! The price is also great, paid 3,50 for the amazing salad for example! and we ordered good drinks and the PERFECT desert! i couldnt be more pleased with the ambiance service and food. Really worth the visit.
