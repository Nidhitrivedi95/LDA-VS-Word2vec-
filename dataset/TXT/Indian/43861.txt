RU6E7WsAfsTRcjXxH1Lo5A Food was great and service was great. It was my first time here and they let me and my friend try as much as I wanted before I selected. Food was fresh, had great flavor, and satisfied my craving for Indian cuisine. The naan bread was out of this world good. They baked it right in front of us and served it to us fresh. Their $8 2 entree meal was a deal!
