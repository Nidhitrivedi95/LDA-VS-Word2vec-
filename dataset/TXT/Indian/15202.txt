CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA I must agree with previous yelpers about the tablecloths under glass, not attractive and does detract a bit from dining experience. Food was good, standard north indian cuisine, good taste and quality. The Saag was excellent, creamy and just the right spice at a medium although next time I might go up in spice just for the heck of it.  The chicken Tikka Masala was good, chicken just a tad bit overdone, mild disturbance in tastiness of dish yet overall pretty yummy. The garlic Naan was relish, samosa ok, rice was cooked perfectly, Gulab Jamin meh (not a big fan anyway).  The price and quantity of lunch specials was right on point.  The atmosphere and service were a bit lackluster yet if you just want to eat decent Indian food and are not there for the total dining experience, Mantra is a very good choice. We left full and very satisfied, would definitely be back especially since it is close to home.
