0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I had been wanting to try Danforth Dragon since I moved into the area, walked by and was like: WTF is Hakka food!!??!!

Since then I had been intrigued. Fast forward to almost 3 years later and accompanied willing participant to try it out with me (the hubs wouldn't do it...he's all "Indian chop suey? NO!".

So with glistening eyes full of temptation and ready to be fulfilled with deliciousness I ordered a noodle dish and my friend ordered some sort of sweet and spicy meat and we dug in.

Whon whaaaaaaa. Its Chinese food. And not even good Chinese food, just okay Chinese food.

I was expecting something a bit more spicy and Indian inspired but I kinda just got a whole lot of China town in my mouth (which on second thought could be kinda gross....hmm). Perhaps the spices were running low in the kitchen?
