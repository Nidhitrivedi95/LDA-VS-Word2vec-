OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ Went here for lunch buffet in University area because it was cheaper than other buffets. Wasn't expecting the best for $8 but a lot of the items weren't warm on the buffet. Furthermore my favorite general dishes (chicken masala , creamed spinach and cheese etx) were lacking the good flavors that make Indian food worth it. Disappointed  but again wasn't expecting too much for the price point. Still, I don't know if saving a few bucks is worth missing out on the awesome typical dishes! Hostess and waitress weren't that friendly. Felt like lacking strong AC on hot day as well (?fans only) . I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon
