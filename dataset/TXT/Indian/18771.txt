emNQ1jxMev2NzIcP2wdfgg Having been born in Tanzania and being of Indian heritage, I decided to get together with some other Indian friends from similar backgrounds to take a walk down nostalgia lane.
The good times stopped there.
This little restaurant owned by a man named Sultan, who seems to rely exclusively on people's yearning for the good old days to over look the awful service (I had to get up 4 times from our table to help myself to drinks and cutlery) and the awful food.
The type of food has been described well by Deanna W. in an earlier review.  On this visit, we found the food to be Mishkaki (Kebobs on skewers) to be dry and none too fresh.
We also ordered Ugali (a traditional East African staple) which has the consistency of mashed potatoes.  The Ugali was nothing like I remember it and the red bean soup which is a traditional counterpart to the Ugali seemed to have been recently pulled out of the fridge and micro-waved into life.
Similarly, the mogo (or cassava) was lacking in taste and crispness which it should have had.
None of the five of us enjoyed our meal and left as soon as was civilly possible to find another restaurant to fill our bellies and lift our disappointed spirits.
