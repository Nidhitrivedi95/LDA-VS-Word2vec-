PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g The best Indian food I've had in Toronto. Best service, too. Love their chicken masala, and chicken vindaloo that's the hottest but most satisfying dish I have enjoyed here. Can't wait to go back... For the umpteenth time. Oh, I forgot, Indian beer complements all the great dishes.
