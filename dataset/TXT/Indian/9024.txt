For the price, it's not the best but you get good fluffy naan, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb curry and a few vegetarian items.  Flavors of dishes were OK but nothing was spicy so if you are craving spicy Indian food, ask something a la carte.  Friendly/attentive service. 

PS: Free wifi available. ask for the password.
