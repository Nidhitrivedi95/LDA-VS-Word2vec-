lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw Second time here. Not sure if it was what I ordered, the sauce I chose or the food was just better but I had a pretty good experience.

Food:
-Sauces: We were graciously allowed to try them all before ordering. We ended up liking the szechuan sauce but the garlic sauce suited the poutine well. Szechuan for everything else if you enjoy a little spice
-Chicken lollipop: Delicious, especially with the szechuan sauce. 9/10
-Poutine sizzler: I don't normally enjoy regular Canadian poutine but I actually liked this and so did my dad from seeing him eat even the crispy bits. 7/10.
-Steak and chicken sizzler with cheese: Not sure if I got the name right. I added a fried egg on top. It was a generous amount of food. The chicken is a lot better than the steak so next time I might just order a chicken only dish. That being said the steak is still good with szechuan sauce and the chicken is very nicely cooked. Good balance between sauteed vegetables and fries as sides on the platter. For taste, I'd give it a 7/10 but overall satisfaction came out to a solid 8-8.5/10. Great for a big eater like myself.
-Special Sizzling Brownie: Delicious but learn from my lesson the first time I ordered it (and found a viable solution for this time). The brownie comes out very hot on a platter with ice cream on top. They pour chocolate syrup onto it which immediately starts sizzling. The heat rapidly melts the ice cream and in my haste to eat it while the ice cream was still a ball of ice cream and not soup, I burned my tongue on the molten hot innards of the brownie. I don't do well with hot food and tend to burn my tongue often so maybe it's just me. Anyway, solution: ask for the ice cream on a plate on the side so it stays cool until the brownie cools to a reasonable temperature. This worked very well and it was delicious with butterscotch ice cream. 9/10
-Service: Outstanding. It's gotten even better and it was pretty good the first time too. 10/10
-Value: this is entirely a personal topic but while it's on the pricey side, the portions are big and the food is pretty good so I feel the value was overall fair to good.

Would come back! Kudos to the owner for maintaining and improving quality.
