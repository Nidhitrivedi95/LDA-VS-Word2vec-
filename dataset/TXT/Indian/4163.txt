1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA With the sea of Indian restaurants (or wannabe Indian restaurants) in Brampton, I'm so glad to see one's getting it right.

Totally recommend the Butter Chicken, Saag, and also the Mushroom Curry if you want to try something a bit different.  Food is very well balanced.

My rating is only based on take out.  Ordering over the phone is simple and quick.

Decor is.... Well, it's there.
