llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg It's become our  go-to "Indian food place" recently.The food is great..much better (in both quality and amount) than any of the "local" Madison joints. It does take a bit longer to go there, but the food more than makes up for it.  Infact, some of the dishes are better than I would get back in India. The staff are friendly..the place nice and clean. 
Lamb dishes are a favorite. You can actually differentiate between the different curries..Carefully seasoned gravies and well cooked meat. 

Would definitely recommend it to anyone who's into or would like to try out good Indian fare.
