grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg Now that I have been to Babu's a few times I'm ready to put in my two cent. Or should I say a Nicole ;-). 

I have had Kothu Roti (chicken and beef). Pretty hefty serving for 7 bucks. Last night I tried Beef Masala, noon and a Mutton Role. Food is tasty. Service is pretty decent. Just be prepared to wait a bit if they are busy. 

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I feel like something is missing. As soon as I put my finger on it, I'll post an update.
