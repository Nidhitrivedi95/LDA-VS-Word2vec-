gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw My favorite gyro in town, by far.  Always super fresh and spiced with as much heat as you want. The resident vegetarian in the crowd also claimed the falafel may be the best she's had.

We wander in here almost every time we're downtown.  It has certainly gotten busier the last few times we've been there; there can actually be a wait for a table sometimes, but everyone plays nice looking for somewhere to sit.
