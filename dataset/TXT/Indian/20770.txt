Unlike most indian snack shops, this one is definitely upbeat and clean. My last visit, service was a bit slow probably because they were a new business. But visit after visits, I have become a fan of this place. Not only that but even my friends that I recommended to Pastries and Chaat to loved the food. This place has potential and its always packed. I got a custom cake made from this place and it was delicious. The chef was very nice and took his time to understand what I wanted and presented me with an even better version of my cake. Hats off!!! Their chicken pizza is the best you can get in town. Also the mango cake actually tasted like mangoes. Keep up the good work guys.
