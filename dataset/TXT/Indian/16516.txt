They have Chinese food as well since the buffet for Tadka is hosted in the connected eatery, Inchin's Bamboo Garden. They have fruit for dessert as well as fruit custard, sticky donut balls and a Tapioca drink. The buffet is yummy and is around $15.00. I went with my friend on Christmas day and it was packed way past the lunch closing time!
