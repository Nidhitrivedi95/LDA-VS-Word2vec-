aX_uLs7LYmnK7VJTZJzACg Situated on Clerc Street, K2 Kebab House is ideal for students from the local halls of residence and I went there myself quite a few times during my first year.  At that time they used to have a deal on called 'chicken, chips and chutney' which cost £3 and was exactly what it claimed to be and tasted great, although horrifically spicy.  
I was back in about a week ago and they're no longer doing that deal, but they're still offering delicious curries, kebabs and burgers at reasonable prices.  I went for the lamb korma with rice which cost less than £6 and tasted great.
My mate, however, ordered a pizza which came with lashings of grease which he had to mop up.  Other than that their food is generally good and well worth a taste.
