m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Kohinoor is an outstanding non-buffet Indian restaurant located near downtown Champaign. It is a spacious restaurant with plenty of wait staff, so you never have to wait long for anything. The menu has a wide variety of options which fits well for my vegetarian leaning girlfriend and my lamb loving self. 

Perhaps, the best part of any Indian restaurant in the naan. Here you are presented with so many possible naan options. I've been twice, and keep telling myself that I need to come back just to order a different type. 

This has become my go-to Indian restaurant in the CU. If you're a fan of Indian food, I doubt you'll be disappointed, and if you're new to Indian food there are enough safe options with chicken or seafood that you can slowly figure out what you like without being overwhelmed by a buffet. Another plus, they do takeout. 

I cannot recommend this place enough.
