h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA As I read through some of the previous comments, I notice a similar story coming up...the food is great, the service and atmosphere are horrible.  I too have been a patron of Royal Taj for over 10 years and have watched the owners become more bitter and rude with each year passing.  Even the food has slightly changed throughout the years.  The Chicken Tikka Masala used to be their signature dish...now it looks and tastes like precooked and reheated food.  What really changed things for me was placing an order on the phone, and when I picked it up, the manager Raj Rani gave me the food, charged me full price, and acted rude (as usual).  I checked the bag and noticed one of the items I ordered wasn't in the bag?  I asked if I could get the extra item I had ordered and she smiled at me and said, "We don't have that today."  Why wouldn't anyone have said that when I ordered it?  Why wouldn't the manager offer something else if they were out of an item? Why would you sell something to someone on the phone, charge them for it, and then act like it's no big deal when you don't give it to them?  I'll tell you why...cause they don't care.  Neither do I anymore.  Apparently they don't need the patrons money anymore.  I won't visit their dark and grim establishment ever again.
