ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg While a little rough around the edges and also partly a video store, the staff was very accommodating. I arrived right as they were closing on a Saturday night (but didn't realize). They let me dine in anyway and were very kind. 

I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was very flavorful and spicy. While a very casual spot, they insisted on boxing up my leftovers for me. 

The decor is a bit shabby and they only have plastic utensils but, my dining experience made up for it.
