TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I couldn't leave Sin City without an Indian dinner. There are no Indian spots that I'm aware of in Henderson but the logistics of my visit had me spend the last night a few blocks East of the strip putting me in close proximity to several spots.

I chose IP since it was the closest and with car rental already returned I was walking it. Plus of my options it had the highest rating.

I had the Lamb Rogan Josh which the menu describes as "Kashmiri delicacy cooked with intensely hot & fragrant spices" which it was but it did not compete well with the LRJ I had in Philly. 

I did have something called 'Temrin Sauce' with the very thin wafer type cracker not Naan but if you've eaten Indian you know what my brain doesn't  but the Temrin Sauce was a treat t remember.

The goin out the door on IP is, I'm looking for a repeat of my LRJ experience in Philly and it could be IP's is more authentic and I'm simply DUH. There was a presence of Indian clientele so perhaps I am more DUH then IP is in authenticity. When I'm in these parts again I will give IP a try again
