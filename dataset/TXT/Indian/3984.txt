Waiter asked 'Are you sure you want chicken, it's going to take me like ten minutes'. Really? What kind of service is this? On top of that, you get free food if your order takes longer than seven minutes, and you fill out a time log card (or something of that sort). Telling me it takes 10 minutes to make my food and having a sign that says '7 minutes or you get free food', is quite contradictory. Then there is the mango lassy, which was supposed to be sweet. Unfortunately it left the taste of garlic in my mouth for a few hours. As to why they are putting entire cloves of garlic in their sweet mango lassy is beyond me. The waiter's response was I'm sorry, that's the way it is (with no offer to remake it or offer a refund). And it wasn't only us, we had the entire table try it, and the immediate reaction was seen on each and everyone's face. Finally after about 35 minutes we received our food, and it seemed the few people in their had also been waiting a while (must be the reason why they have board games and a rubik's cube at the tables). Unfortunately I had to wait way to long for a wrap, the size of my palm, that didn't have the filling I wanted because they were either out of the product or were to lazy to make it. While the chicken wrap was mediocre at best, it was the service and experience as a whole that will keep my friends and I far from this place.
