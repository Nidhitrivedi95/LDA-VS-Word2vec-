gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This place is a must visit. We were in town again and this was our first stop. The food is so delicious I don't know where to begin. I like my food spicy and even with all the spices, the flavor was so deep- just fabulous. It's off the strip in a bit of an iffy neighborhood. Do not be discouraged!
