RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w There was a lot of hype building towards a group dinner here, but LTH delivered! We came in a group of 8 on a Friday night and it was easy to get a seat before 7pm. A friend ordered for the whole party to eat family style and we shared: 
- Beef, Chicken, Lamb Kababs
- Hara Chicken
- Chicken Biryani
- Lamb Kharai
- Paneer Tikka Masala
- Naan
- Pistachio Kulfi

It was cool to see some items not typically served at other South Asian joints downtown. Some dishes were a bit less spicy than conventional but they were still all rich, flavourful and filling. Service was polite and efficient - while some may complain about writing your own order or eating off of low end tableware, it's really not a place to expect exceptional service when the food is already such good value. Factoring that we totally over-ate and left feeling extremely full, we still paid less than $25 each after tax and tip!
