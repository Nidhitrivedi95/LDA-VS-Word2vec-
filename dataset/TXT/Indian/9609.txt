8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ I want to give BCF a higher rating because their food has no issues at all and you are always guaranteed a delicious meal.

Their service on the other hand is sub-par and average at best with their customer service. My first time ordering, I called in a fairly large order only to be criticized over the phone that I had 'ordered it in the wrong order' which I was not aware of.

Upon arriving slightly early to pick my order up, I walked in to pay and then ask how much time is remaining only to be told that 'I was told it would be 20 minutes' even before I could take my money out.

If they would just ease up on their attitude and realize people are just trying to 1. order and 2. pay them - both of which require no bad attitude from the restaurant.

Food's great though...
