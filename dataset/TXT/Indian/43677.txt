RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA I might have just found my favorite Indian place. I went with two friends for a feast and we were not disappointed! We were greeted warmly and told we could sit anywhere.  The space is a little small, but that actually adds to the atmosphere of warm, delicious Indian food, friendly owners and staff, and good friends!

I ordered the Malia Kofta for my entree.  These are vegetable balls with raisins and and almonds in a creamy sauce.  It was out of this world!!!  The veggie balls were slightly crispy on the edges but soft in the middle and packed full of flavor.  The sauce was not too creamy and the raisins added a sweet taste throughout.  Both of my friends have since gone back and ordered this!

I wish I could remember what they ate, but this actually happened a few months ago.  I remember the Malia Kofta like it was yesterday, though!
