x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Went for dinner last night and the place did not disappoint! We were a big party, but were lucky enough to get one of those big booth tables, and got some privacy from the rest of the hall. 

The food was delicious and the best Indian Chinese I've had in the US. My personal favorites are the Chili Chicken, Chili Potatoes, and the Basil Chicken Rice!! So good!

Our Server was pretty good too! Yes, it takes a while for the food to get served, but hey have you seen how busy they are on weekend nights!? We waited for a bit, but the food was definitely worth the wait! Oh btw, while you wait, you can always read up on Chinese signs and pick on people at your table ;) haha!

Definitely Recommended!
