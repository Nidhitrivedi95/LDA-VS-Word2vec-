DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Udupi is one of those rare ethnic eateries in Tempe because it features the cusine of southern India, which is less represented in the Indian food available here in America. While most people would associate Indian food with lamb biryani and chicken tikka masala, Udupi's cuisine is a vegan person's ethnic paradise. I am definitely a fan of their Uthappam and just about anything on the menu that has potatoes in them. Any of their dosais are winners, but I do love the masala dosai a whole lot! Be adventurous and try a little of everything! This food gets mighty spicy though-- your taste buds will definitely be put to the test. Ample free parking and a great, friendly staff. My only gripe is that they're closed on Tuesdays.
