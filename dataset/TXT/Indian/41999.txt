qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA I was skeptical about this place because there are 259 things on their menu. Less is more friends. I don't have confidence in a place that has chow mein and grilled cheese on the same menu. I should've went with my gut (literally). Here is my "grilled cheese".. literally slightly toasted bread with kraft singles and shredded cheese Not. Melted. At. All!! 

Don't trust a chef that messes up grilled cheese
