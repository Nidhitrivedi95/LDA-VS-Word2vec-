TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Rather dark inside, definitely unassuming from the outside. A bit skeptical to  give it a shot after cruising through the neighborhood but pleasantly surprised that I did. An earlier reviewer was right. "You can't go wrong here." As spicy as you like (I like) with tastefully exotic ambience. Well worth the cab fare from the Bellagio.
