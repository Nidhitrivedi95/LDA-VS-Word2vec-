OlJODULZWPGLZP_ntZfSfQ This was such a disappointment.  Firstly, the curry itself was average at best - my tikka massalam was distinctly nippy, much spicier than it ought to have been. Now I'm fine with heat but a lot of people aren't and you don't expect a tikka massalam to be hot. My boyfriend's passanda was so so. It wasn't just the sauce, the chicken was dry too. Just not nice. And, worst of all for a poppadom lover like me, I received fewer than I'd ordered - so I'd been shortchanged.  When I phoned to complain I was fobbed off with the explanation that the kitchen doesn't get told how many poppadoms people have ordered... They said to mention next time and I'll get what I ordered but I won't be ordering again. I actually think I ordered from here a few months ago and the same thing happened then. So much for being one of the best Indian takeaways in Edinburgh.
