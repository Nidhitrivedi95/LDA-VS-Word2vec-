llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Had dinner here for the second time and I really love the food here . So much flavor in all of the dishes I've tried . The Tikka Masala was amazing, fast friendly service . Haven't had a chance to try the buffet yet as it's only available at lunch but looking forward to trying more dishes here ! Highly recommend.
