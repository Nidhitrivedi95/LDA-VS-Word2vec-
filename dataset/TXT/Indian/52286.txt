UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Came here to have an early dinner with my friends. The food is literally amazing. Order butter chicken with naan bread. I have to take off one star because I feel like they up charge for everything. The naan should be included in the price just like the basmati rice is included. It's not a lot either. On the upside UNLV students get 10% off. Too bad we found out about this awesomeness after we paid our bill. Overall great service and great food. Will definitely be returning.
