DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Ive been here a few times for lunch and was really impressed with the food and service. 

So far I've tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Tandoori Chicken, the Murgh Makani, and Lamb Vindaloo. All were excellent from the meat down to the flavorful sauces that I soaked up with their naan bread. Speaking of which, their butter and garlic naan breads were fresh, warm, and delicious. We tried their Rice Pudding and Gulab Jamun w/ vanilla ice cream and they were both great ways to conclude our meal. 

Service was welcoming, friendly, and attentive. They immediately remembered us after our first visit, which is always nice. The restaurant is clean and the decor of the dining area is appealing. 

I'm so glad that Curry Leaf opened up nearby where I live as I've always wanted a good Indian restaurant close by. My brother is new to Indian cuisine so I took him here one time for lunch when he was in town. He raved about it so much that he even left a review here on Yelp long before I did.

My review is actually only for 4 1/2 Stars (I rounded up) because I really wish that they had a AYCE lunch buffet special. If they ever did, that would give it a solid 5* in my book easily.
