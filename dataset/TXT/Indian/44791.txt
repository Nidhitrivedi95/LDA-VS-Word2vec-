S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA From a shady looking, wrecked place from outside to a exquisite Ethnic Indian Loungish looking interiors this restaurant really did surprise me. We infact planned to turn around go elsewhere looking at it from outside, and we are glad not to have done that. The restaurant has a lotta potential to be turned into an Indian Nightclub/Lounge at night, thanks to their multiple rooms, multiple floors, Red interior decor and tall ceilings. We took the Lunch Buffet which I felt was kinda OK. The best part of all was the Tandoori Chicken. Delishhh...one of the best I've tried. The rest were passable. Their Mango Lassi was pretty good however. Overall I felt $12 aint a bad deal for a quick Indian Lunch quite close to the strip in a grand setting.
