-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw Amazing food!! You can definitively taste the quality, creativity, and passion in each bite. Everything was delicious! The fries are double fried and taste like heaven. The burger is made with butter dipped bread and melts in your mouth. The bariyani was food for the soul, and definitely will leave you full to the brim. We can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu :)
