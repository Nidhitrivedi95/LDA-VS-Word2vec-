From the moment you walk in you are made aware of the class and style Dishoom has to offer. Very professional yet nice staff. The bartenders that made our drinks while we waited for our table were both very sweet and creative. Though it was extremely busy but still they carefully listened to what we would like to drink and crafted the drinks perfectly to our tastes.

It's a fusion restaurant and that's made very clear in every aspect of Dishoom. From the decor to cocktails to table ware and serving dishes, everything is clearly chosen to reflect traditional Mumbai Indian culture yet mixed beautifully with contemporary style.

Food recommendations; Chicken Baryani, Chicken ruby, and don't miss out the amazingly scrumptious Kali/Black daal.

Of course the meal wasn't complete without the delicious malai kulfi and chai.

They don't accept reservations but it's completely worth the wait.

Really wish they opened a branch here is US.
