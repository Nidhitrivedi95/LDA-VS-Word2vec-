gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My husband and I frequent Mt. Everest every date night. The food is perfectly delicious and they have plenty of vegetarian options for me. The service is always excellent, and the staff is invariably friendly and helpful when looking for a new dish to try. If you're looking for delicious and reasonably priced food, I highly commend Mt. Everest.
