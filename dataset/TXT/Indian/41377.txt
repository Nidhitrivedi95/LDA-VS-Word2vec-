Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ Cozy, intimate restaurant in Yorkville.  My spice tolerance is pretty bad so for people like me, I would recommend the shrimp malai curry. It was creamy and delicious with just a hint of spiciness. Our meal came with complimentary papadam along with a couple chutneys which were pretty tasty. For dessert I got the Gulab jamun which was a tad too sweet for my taste. From what I remember, the dishes were fairly priced too.
