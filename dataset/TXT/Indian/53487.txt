VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg I found the indian food to be tasty and fairly well priced.

I split the Grilled Plate with my girlfriend. It was full of tandoori cooked meats: chicken, lamb, and beef. All very good-tasting with lots of classic indian flavor (without being overly hot).

I also had the Aloo dish (spiced potatoes) which was very filling and very generous portion.

Lastly, as always, I ordered some naan. The bread was soft and warm, however, it wasn't the most flavorful naan I've ever had.

The menu was all al carte which meant that to get a full meal you had to order numerous items. I think if their menu had full combo offerings (and was a tad cheaper) (and slightly better naan) I would have given it four-stars.  So really it's like a 3.5
