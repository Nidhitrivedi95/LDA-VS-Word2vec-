abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg If I want south  Asian tapas, this is definitely the place to go. Having said that, as a south Asian , I don't want my cuisine as tapas, so that was my struggle when I visited here.

The flavours were phenomenal, the duck (lollipop?) special especially good. 

Beef paratha tacos- ok
Naan kebab- absolutely nailed the flavours of Bihari Kebab. Really good
Falooda- I understand fusion, but this tasted- artificial. 

Pricey from my perspective , portions small- but then again that's a sober Pakistani who was expecting dinner, not snacks!
