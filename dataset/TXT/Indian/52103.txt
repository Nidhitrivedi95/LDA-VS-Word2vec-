UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA One of my favourite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.

Massive menu and really lay out your choices, great for vegan friends!!

No dish has ever disappointed us.

Oh, they also have good tea selections. I had the mountain tip, and it was so good and refreshing. Really goes well with meals.
