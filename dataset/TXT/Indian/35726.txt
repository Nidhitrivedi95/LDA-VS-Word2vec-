n2uhwMwM9mGz-8eMSEeqTg Great food and service. My favourite so far is vegetable biryani as it's very flavourful and not too unhealthy. Haven't tried the butter chicken but it was cooking hen I came in and it smelled AMAZING. Big portion sizes and very cheap prices.In Toronto, you would easily pay double. They cook the food to order with an exposed kitchen so everything is made fresh and with care.
