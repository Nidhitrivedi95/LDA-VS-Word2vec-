UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Delightful!   Truly.   Great atmosphere, attentive,  but not over bearing service and DELICIOUS Indian food.  Flavours from Southern India AND Northern India are available as well as a few new twists on old favorites.  We enjoyed the pani puri to start,  Chicken Korma & Lamb Rogan Josh.  We played if safe on the heat scale at a 3 on the scale to 10 and we could have easily dialed it up a few notches.   And for real spice/hear lovers there is a separate menu of items called "Inferno"....needing a waiver to eat.   We'll be back.   Can't wait to try more on the menu, including the cherry lassi.
