Sat at bar, enjoyed lamb tikka masala with delicious naan and rice. I was practically drinking my tikka masala sauce afterward. One thing -- only three or four pieces of lamb! Taste made up for it, thankfully.

Green turf stairs and decor inside felt cheap for such cool building and great food.

Left my wallet and went to pick it up between lunch and dinner shifts the next day as a courtesy. They wouldn't let me in to get it! Loosen up.
