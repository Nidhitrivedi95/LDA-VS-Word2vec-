ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw The cocktails were excellent! I got the aviation, which I've had at other restaurants, and this was certainly the best. 
At first the concept of the menu was a little difficult to understand but basically it's a tapas bar with 4 entrees. Mostly everything was super tasty! I like the blending of Indian flavors with English dishes. The gobi manchurian.... daaaaaaamn. So good. My only complaint was that we ordered the steak and for 29$ they should've at least cooked it properly. Little over cooked. 
Our waitress was very nice and helpful. Attentive without being overbearing. 
The atmosphere is a little weird for being in the middle of Dormont so it'll have to grow on us, but the place is nicely designed.
