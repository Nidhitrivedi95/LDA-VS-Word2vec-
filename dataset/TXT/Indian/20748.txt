g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ One of the most highly regarded Indian restaurants in the world sits half way across the world in New Delhi, India. It is also called Bukhara and everyone from Arnold Schwarzenegger to Hillary & Chelsea Clinton have enjoyed their giant naan bread, famous kebabs & vegetarian dishes. 

But the one we're interested in here is relatively new and resides on Bloor St West in Toronto, Ontario Canada. 

If you're a fan of Indian food, Bukhara Grill craft above-average, quality dishes that would compete with some of the much higher priced Indian restaurants in the city. Beautiful balances of flavor and a variety of curries to choose from make it a spicy lover's paradise. Make sure to try the garlic naan bread. 

The staff are very welcoming and there is a noticeable attention to detail that goes hand in hand with the service. 

Perhaps one day this Bukhara Grill will be able to boast of its celebrity clientele.. while maintaining their down to earth friendliness. 

I'm no celebrity.. but I'll be there just in case.
