v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug Food was average at best.  Rasam was thick and opaque... Not clear and tangy with the flavor of tamarind.  Buffet left a lot to be desired.  Chicken was full of bones with little meat .... Raita was ok... Kheer was disgusting.. I didn't taste one hint of cardamom.  Worst of all, I introduced myself to Victor ( owner?) because I was interested in holding a 30 person party here in a few weeks.  He showed me the area and then never said another word to me for the rest of lunch.  The waiter also had no personality and seemed bothered to wait on my mother and I.  I told my Indian husband that I think they treated me this way because I'm not Indian and he  said... No.. They will treat all this way.  Very disappointing and rude staff.  I must say the waitress with short hair was nice.  I will never set foot in this restaurant again
