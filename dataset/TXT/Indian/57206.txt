This is not a typical/full menu Indian place. They have about 5 meat options (including Butter Chicken, Lamb + Chicken Curries and Chicken Vindaloo). These items are either served with Rice or Roti. Their specialty is the Roti. If you are looking for an Indian buffet, or for a larger variety of dishes, or Naan, then this is not your place to go.

That said: If you are a fan of Roti, and you are looking for a budget meal, this place is the place for you.

The curry chicken ordered very spicy was about a 6 on the spicy scale where Jalapeno is a 3, Habanero an 8.5 and Dave's Ultimate Insanity Sauce a 10. 

That means it started to make me sweat slightly, and I was totally OK with that. I prefer more spicy, but didn't fight too hard for it today.

The food was Excellent however. The Roti is sort of a Roti burrito filled with the meat of your choice...comes out piping hot, and super tasty. This place is pretty inexpensive too and you get a lot of food. if my date and I liked the same dishes we totally could have shared a single order of the Roti.

Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yummy Yum!
