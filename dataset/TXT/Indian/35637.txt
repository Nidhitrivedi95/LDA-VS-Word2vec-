N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for how long I waited for my food. It was at least 30 minutes if not more before I got my food. I wouldn't mind waiting that long at a sit down place but a food court should be wayyyyy faster. The food itself was delicious. I got Chana masala and it was the best I've had. The naan was delicious and soft, with a buttery taste. Food was great but if you're in a hurry definitely skip this place.
