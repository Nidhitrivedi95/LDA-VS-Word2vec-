Lk-qYbjqJAdi72XRrt0QWw I felt like a bit of a walk at lunch time so took a wander through the meadows and the links, unsure of what I fancied food wise but knowing I wanted away from the office. Then I came upon the pleasant aroma of curry and my decision was made... This Tardis like (well it is a police box) Indian takeaway is something a bit different, selling inexpensive curry, freshly cooked and made to the heat you want.

The proprietor is a happy cheery sort and seems genuinely interested in how your days been going. All in all the Bollywood Box is well worth checking out and ideal for a quick lunch on a nice day.
