7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA DINNER REVIEW:

We ate here for our American Thanksgiving dinner and let me just say I'll stuff my face with Indian food over Turkey and Stuffing any day!  It was delicious.

We loved our meal and the owner was super nice!   We had samosas and the chat papri to start, followed by the Chicken Tikka Misalla for me and Lamb Korma for my hubby.  Portions are huge and one order of naan is plenty to feed two people, our eyes were bigger than our tummies and we had way to much food . Everything we ordered had amazing flavor and the restaurant was pretty busy.  I found that to be a good sign and many Indian diners lead me to believe that this place is legit.  

The one thing they could improve is the pace of service. It was friendly enough, but I don't think I would recommend eating here before a show unless you order at least 2 hours before curtain time.  We were there for a over an hour and a half.  Yes, it was busy but the restaurant was not full to capacity.

We would definitely eat here again.
