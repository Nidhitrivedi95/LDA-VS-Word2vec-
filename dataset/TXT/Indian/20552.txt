fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw I ordered my favorites in delivery. aloo China chat (cold chickpeas with a delicious vinegarette yogurt cream, chips, potato, cucumber, and tomato) was the best I've had.   Their korma (butter and nut flavored sauce) was also the best I've had. I had the lamb, and it was perfectly cooked in there, not overdone. tikka masala is my usual favorite sauce and this was just as good as normal, but korma was extra special. I ordered the shrimp and they were nice sized shrimp. I preferred the garlic naan to the regular. baingan bharta (eggplant with tomatoes) usually has more tomato flavor, but theirs in more eggplant strong and it was creamed like a paste. my personal preference is more tomato flavor and a little more recognizable.
