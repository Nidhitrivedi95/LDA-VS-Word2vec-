7d2LqDc0Cb5dcizil_h34A We visited Karma's kitchen for dinner. We ordered many dishes and here's my take on the food that we had. We were 4 people with 2 groupons.

Veg Momo steamed - were pretty good. There were 8 pieces in a portion and were the best item on the menu. Best we had in Toronto, we'll definitely be back for these.

Chilli Potato - was good too. Decent amount of chilli and flavour. Pretty balanced.

Veggie Chef's own fried rice - were horrible. They had a very overpowering garlic flavour and was tasteless. We had had 2-3 spoons and left the entire portion untouched.

Veg Chowmein - was okay. The vegetables were crisp but the chowmein lacked flavour though.

House Special Crispy Chicken - seemed stale. There was stench to it. Left most of it.

Cauliflower Manchurian - was okay too. It was different that we expected. The gravy was tasteless/flavourless. 

Mango Juice / Mango Lassi - were okay.

We might go there again to crave our momo cravings. Otherwise it was pretty unimpressive. The service was attentive.
