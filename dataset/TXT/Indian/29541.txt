jRxLnJ9my31Re_O2MvQGhw The Tasty Bowl Subs and Such is truly a  hidden gem of Westinghouse Blvd. I ran across this restaurant playing around on Yelp and I'm glad I stopped in with a friend and my mom for lunch. 

Being our first time we were full of questions. The owner Raja was very helpful. He asked what flavor spiciness we liked and created a few samples for us to try. I let my mom try one of the samples and she said it was too sweet so Raja created a new sample for her and it was a winner. 

The concept for the rice bowls is very simple. You get rice, choice of sauce and meat (chicken or shrimp) and pico de Gallo. The menu is a little misleading cause there is a miss print but you only get one meat choice with the price on the menu or you can have both for an extra charge. 

The bowls were amazing. What's really impressive is the size. We all ordered the small bowl and couldn't finish. We ordered a Sesame Ginger Teriyaki, Mexican and Thai Sweet Chili bowl and 2 orders of fries. The fries are very crispy and seasoned well. I'm not a fan of pico but I was very trusting of Raja and the mix of rice, chicken and pico was outstanding. 

Raja came by our table to make sure we were all satisfied with what we ordered. He made some spicy sauce for my friend to add to her bowl. He's very personable and we learned he even remembers his regular customers choice of spiciness.  

I will definitely be back. There are so many flavor options and I want to try the subs and their wings!!!
