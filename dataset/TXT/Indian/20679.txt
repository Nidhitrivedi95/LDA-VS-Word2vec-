g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ Fun decor, friendly attentive staff and the lamb curry changed my day from blah to bam!  7 of us local office workers reserved a table and we all got to sample a few items on thier exciting menu.  Coconut fries are devine with thier side tamirand dipping sauce.  The white butter chicken, not too spicy so it is a safe order for those who think pepper is hot!  Lol  we loved the house pickles mmm a blast of salty lemon heat...love it.  

Update: the energy is high and all the various dishes our group  of 6 ordered today was gorgeous and delicious.  They graduated to 5 stars.
