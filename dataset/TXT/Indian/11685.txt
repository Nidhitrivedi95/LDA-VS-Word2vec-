AnvJqvwBOUlrYgrcubr0nw Terrible. I really wanted to like Spice Lounge and had been looking forward to it all week! When we arrived we were shown to our table and took in the lovely modern surroundings. Unfortunately that's where the positivity ends
Our waiter was rude and we all felt incredibly rushed into making our order. We ordered popadoms and some drinks to try and get him to back off a bit! The popadoms arrived fairly quickly but with a minuscule amount of dips  the pots were so tiny the teaspoons barely fitted in! When we made our order (a reasonable 10 minutes after arriving) we were shocked that all four of us had chosen different items, all of which were unavailable! Rather than explaining, the waiter hurriedly wrote down a different dish for us whilst announcing it to us! We were all very confused at what was going on and asked him to give us 5 minutes to relook. Group consensus was to jump ship as the drinks hadn't arrived after 15 minutes and we were all getting fairly annoyed by the attitude of the waiter and limited menu. It was Friday night at 7.30pm, surely they should have been well stocked! We left the £3.95 (!!!) for our four popadoms on the table
We decided to stick to what we knew best, Abida. Never disappointing and managed to save our night.
