O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Love this place- went again today and found out they have a goat curry!  How very unique- I enjoyed it, though it probably could have been braised a little bit longer.  Love the buffet and its a good value.  You'd never find it except for Yelp- great find guys.  Hope they do well- they deserve it.  Nice to get cultural food in North Olmsted.
