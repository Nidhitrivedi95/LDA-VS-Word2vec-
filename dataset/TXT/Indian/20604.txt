fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw After living several different places on the east coast, I became accustomed to good indian food. However, I had yet to find a good place in Pittsburgh...until now. I tried Bangal Kabab house based off of other yelp reviews. I ordered takeout, and I was somewhat skeptical given that the restaurant was so small and there were only a few customers. However, the staff was extremely courteous, and my food was ready when I arrived. 
Upon opening the food when I got home, the food looked okay, nothing extraordinary. I ordered vegetable samosas and chicken tikka masala. The masala looked a little greasy. However, once I tasted the food, my skepticism vanished. The samosas were probably the best I have ever had, and the chicken tikka masala, although slightly different from other tikka masalas I have had, was extremely flavorful and delicious. I could have eaten all day.
I really enjoyed this place; definitely the best I have found in Pittsburgh. I will keep going back!
