Butter 'chicken' with tofu AKA Vegetarian butter chicken AKA possibly vegan AKA my life is made. The sauce was bomb, thick and oh so buttery. Naan bread was also some of the best I've had.

Service was quick and pleasant - lots of smiles.

Lost one point for serving what seemed like a day ( or longer ) old samosa.

Overall good indian food and will go back!
