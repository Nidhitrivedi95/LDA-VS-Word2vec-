i6N0e1zVhkQvof_acn85Og Are you freaking kidding me? Not only is it CASH ONLY for delivery in the year 2014, but there is a 25$ minimum required; it also didn't help that their attitude was so off the charts rude either. Just suck it up and go to the Jean Talon location cause this place certainly ain't worth it. It's like, -20 C out there tonight and all I wanted was some GD palak paneer, way to kill a dream Bombay Mahal Express, way to kill a dream.
