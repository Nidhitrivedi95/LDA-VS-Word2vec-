9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw I went to a business event here recently, that was held in their lounge. The interior is very classy, well decorated and kind of cool. The service was great and they even have a great quality german non alcoholic beer  which is very hard to find.  

I was thinking, "where I am going to afterwards" because I am just not a fan of this cuisine.
I was wrong, we were served several lamb and chicken dishes with curry''s and it was spicy but really very good.

I think I will try it at lunch for the buffet as other reviews have said
