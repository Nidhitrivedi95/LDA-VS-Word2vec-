gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is my favorite Indian buffet in town.  I love Tikka Masala, and theirs is one of the best I've tasted.  They bring out fresh, hot naan with the meal right to your table.  They've got some spicy dishes, which I always appreciate.  It's always a treat to eat at Mt Everest.  Thank you and keep up the good work!
