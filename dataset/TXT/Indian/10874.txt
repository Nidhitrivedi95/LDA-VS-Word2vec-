A2aeHV_EsLIxEqRthPoujQ I went to this restaurant last night with my beautiful new fiancé.

Indian is her favourite food and she certainly wasn't disappointed. I have had Indian food about 20 times in my life and this was by far the best.

I read the reviews on yelp before going there and got a good sense of the detail and effort that goes into making every dish there. 

I didn't know the significance of things like: "all the butter chicken is created using tandoori chicken" but the staff members sure explained it to us.

Each week they use close to 1000 pounds of tomatoes to prepare the various sauces that go into these delicious meals.

Everything about the restaurant was amazing.
