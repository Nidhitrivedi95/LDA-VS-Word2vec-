0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I have been to several Indian buffets in Phoenix and also in San Francisco and Boston and I was definitely pleased with my experience here. I got the Groupon for two buffets for $10 and came in on a Saturday night to find an almost empty restaurant. Nevertheless, the food was hot and fresh and there was a nice variety of options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike, and most of the dishes were very tasty. 

The atmosphere is kind of weird particularly some of the employees who watch over you awkwardly and peer out the door hoping the place is going to fill up miraculously. Otherwise would definitely recommend. 

P.S. The Naan was delicious. My girlfriend couldn't get enough,
