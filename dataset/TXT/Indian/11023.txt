A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ Thanks to super-Yelper, Anthony N., for turning us on to Desi Spice! 

 I normally avoid Indian buffets but eating with my son and husband, Quantity takes priority over Quality. At Desi Spice, we can have both Quantity and Quality...and for a great price.

Apart from their wide selection of dishes, Desi Spice offers a palate-pleasing array of paneer-based items (eg shahi paneer, paneer tikka masala, palak paneer, matar paneer etc) and sag-based items (eg sag paneer and sag gosht). While my 2 meat-loving men satisfied their carnivorous cravings, I made my own thali by filling small bowlfuls of various paneers and sag dishes and enjoying them with veg pulao and fresh nan. 

For dessert, I enjoyed the warm gulab jamun but had to skip the rasmalai and fruit (getting too full!) I didn't see the panipuri station until after I had devoured my gulab jamun so panipuri became my 2nd dessert. :-)

The best time for dinner is at the beginning of dinner service, 6 pm. Yelp states that dinner starts at 5 pm but that's incorrect.

Looking forward to our next meal at Desi Spice...
