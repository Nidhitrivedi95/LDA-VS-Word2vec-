UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w It is definitely not the place that serves you the best indian food but there are not many options in Tempe. 

The samosas are ok, and so is the dhokla. The entrees are fine, and are not expensive. Service-wise it is not gona be the best but it is clean and hygenic. You can browse through a lot of Indian spices while you wait for your food.

It is not the place for a romantic dinner, but to grab a bite of quick not-so-spicy Indian food. If you are looking for a sit-down place, try Krishna Cafe in Chandler.

PS-  You might have to cut  the older guy on the counter some slack. I guess he love his tobacco more than the customers.
