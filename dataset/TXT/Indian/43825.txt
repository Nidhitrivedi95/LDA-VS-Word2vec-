RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg Good food overall!! Offers a wide variety of dishes to pick from, and all the vegetarian' curries taste good. I would rate it a zillion times better than the lame 'Basmati' that it used to be earlier. However, i wouldnt recommend any dish that involves meat (chicken/lamb). I auways end up finishing the whole dish, leaving all the meat aside. It feels like huge, bland chunks of cisco meat that taste no better than rubber had been dumped into the gravy/sauce/curry that you ordered for, and then served. Now i stick to vegetarian food when ever i visit this place.

Note: good cust service.
