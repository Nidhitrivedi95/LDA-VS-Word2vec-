bswktkxTqTFdhg8uvcuWWw This is a pretty good place to grab some food. I usually get the combo for two when I go, and thy give you a lot of food. We've never finished it all in one sitting, and for the price it's pretty good. 

I like to get the butter chicken or the kebab wrap. The food is flavoured pretty well, and I haven't yet tried something there that I don't like. Also, the fries that come with the kebab wrap are so good, kind of like Popeye fries. They're kind of spicy and crunchy and are completely worth it. 

There are a couple of tables there, the last time I was there they were kind of dirty, and the menus we had were dirty too... Not that appealing. The service is just so so, but the food's good.
