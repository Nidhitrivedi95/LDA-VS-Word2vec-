I had the black pepper shrimp and the Indian chicken masala, with naan and a samosa.

The samosa was prepared fresh and was tasty. It could use a little more spice.

The black pepper shrimp was really good. Very well spiced, tasty, and fresh. I will definitely eat it again.

The chicken was poorly cooked and was mediocre at best. I do not recommend it.

Overall, a solid experience, not a hit, but a good spot for its location.
