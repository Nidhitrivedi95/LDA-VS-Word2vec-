CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA Mmmm not so sure about them
It's a new place and I order a pick up 
For some reason everything I ordered seems very small 
The flavor was ok , not very authentic . They give you a free dessert with the yelp but it was all soggy.
The team is nice and smiley 
The place in the most part is clean 
I normally do Indian Buffet not much of the dinner and I won't do dinner again in this place
