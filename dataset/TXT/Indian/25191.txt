hDaookbWWFR3bEm-1_orrw One word: WOW! Having moved to Buckeye after years of living in Boston, MA, I have been suffering miserably without my weekly fix of indian food. This place is not just great, but better than most indian restaurants i have tried in downtown Phoenix. 

I really hope this place stays afloat. As vegetarians, my boyfriend and I ordered the Mushroom Bhajii and the Beingan Bertha (sorry for any misspellings!). Both were *excellent*. We also had the vegetable pakora and garlic naan and everything was equally as good. Waitstaff were super nice and friendly and genuinely concerned about how we liked our food. 

We went on a Sunday night and there were lots of diners, though still plenty of seating. It's a great size, and I really enjoyed the music. Very non-descript location in a shopping plaza, but then what would Arizona be without that? 

Check this place out, you will not be disappointed. I plan to return again and again and again...very excited!
