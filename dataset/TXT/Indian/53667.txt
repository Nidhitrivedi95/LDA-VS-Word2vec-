The service is quick and the restaurant looks clean.

Great variety in the menu and everything was serve piping hot, including the freshly seared naan bread that just melt in your mouth. 

I do point out it's serve piping hot because, the only drawback I can find, the dishes are serve on metal plates which doesn't hold the warmth like porcelain plates. 

The desserts are average. But if you only want a sweet bite to finish your meal. They are spot on.
