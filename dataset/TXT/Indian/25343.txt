HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Tried this place on a recent business trip to Cleveland with some colleagues.  I can say as an Indian food expert, this is one of the better Indian restaurants I have been to.  The staff was very attentive and checked on us quite frequently to ensure our drinks were always full and our food was to our liking.  Much to my surprise, one of people I was dining with had never had Indian food before and even he was impressed with the quality and taste of the dish he ordered.  I stuck to my usual Chicken Tikka Masala and was not disappointed in any way.  I will say as an out of towner, the location was easy to miss as it is not labeled very well and is inside an office building.
