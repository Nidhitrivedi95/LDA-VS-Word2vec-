tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g This has always been one of my go-to Indian restaurants.  I judge them all by the quality of their Saag Paneer or Chicken Saag, both of which are delicious here.  The naan is well prepared and I recently saw that they really spruced up the interior.  They've not made any errors in the orders and I here they have a buffet during the weekday lunch hours. I'll try to make it over there to try it someday.
