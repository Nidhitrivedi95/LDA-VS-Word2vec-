VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg I had the tandoori mixed grill 20.50 and the tandoori prawns 23.50.  burned naan 2.00 (see pic). butter sauce 3.00. Very expensive. Nice flavors. Lots of food. All the meats in the grill were dry and tough. I used a certificate. I would have been very upset if I paid full price for this. It's sitting in the fridge. Not even sure that I'll reheat it. Trying to think of a way to repurpose it.  May go straight to trash.... Be careful if ordering by phone. I ordered the 13.50 prawns and he made the more expensive ones,  and I thought he said the sauce and bread were free but he was saying three. He didn't charge me for the mistakes. that was awesome! The sauce was like a tomato sauce, not very tasty. Def won't go back
