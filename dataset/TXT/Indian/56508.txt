xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw Excellent food!  This is a little hidden gem in North Randall.  One of the best Indian restaurants in Cleveland.  The owner even followed up with me after I ordered my meal.  We got Paneer pakoras, butter chicken and Samosas.  Everything seemed to be made to order so allow some time for preparation.  Great good and even better service!
