SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Bad service high prices. This place gets overcrowded during long weekends.

I went for a lunch buffet, had to wait 30 mins for naan. 

If they want to serve lots of people during holidays they should increase their staff to provide a Better service.

Food is average, very limited options considering the price they are charging.

Only advantage they have is very few Indian places in town.
