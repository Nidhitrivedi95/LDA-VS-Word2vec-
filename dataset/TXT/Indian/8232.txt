I've had their lunch buffet often, it's reasonably priced and always fresh.  Good selection with about ten dishes and fresh tandoori chicken.  My favourites are the butter chicken and palak paneer (curry spinach and cheese).  The butter chicken is creamy rich and they only use white meat.  Curry goat is delicious, too.  I've had better naan elsewhere, but for soaking up the sauces it's just fine.  For dessert, don't overlook the small ice cream freezer opposite the buffet table!  They usually have mango, vanilla, chocolate and/or strawberry.  Dinner entree portions are on the small side, so if you can get there for lunch it's a better deal.
