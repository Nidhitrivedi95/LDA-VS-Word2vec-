vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw The food isn't bad, but you can find comparable or better Indian food for less. Unless you are going there with a groupon, or for Winterlicious, I just don't think the place is worth it. Also, the location is a little out of the way. If you have to travel to get there, I don't think you'll be that satisfied.

People say the prawn dish is da bomb though. So if you go, try that!
