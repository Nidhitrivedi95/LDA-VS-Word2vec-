O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg After 2 months, we went back to Flavors of India.  The waitress that I was very unimpressed with was there, but I figured we would put up with her because my son and husband wanted Indian food.  Either she's read my review and wanted to prove me wrong or she was having a very off day because this time she was very good.  the food, as always, was excellent!
