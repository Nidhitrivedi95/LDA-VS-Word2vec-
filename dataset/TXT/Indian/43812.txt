RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg OMG I'M SO FULL BUT I WANT TO KEEP EATING.

When the food comes out, I always think it looks small but I get filled up so fast and I always have to take home my food.

I've been pleased with each visit I've made here.

Unfortunately, I don't know much about authentic Indian food so I try my best. I don't even know what I ordered so I end up trying something different each time!

For my most recent visit I ordered the "Bhuna Chicken Saag" which is a hot Chicken entree. I can taste the spice but it is not that spicy. I don't need to take a drink of water or nothin', ya know? It is still deliciousss, the vegetable portion is good, I mix it with the rice. The chicken is tender & juicy. I'd say it's about 3:2 vegetables to meat.. As it should be.

BASMATI RICE. YUMMMM. In my culture, eating rice everyday is normal. I can only wish we had that delicious Basmati rice everyday.

I also ordered the "Onion Kulcha". I've had their "naan" & "tandoori roti" as well. All I can say is WHY ARE INDIAN BREADS SO GOOD? These pieces look like pizza & you get full after one. It's weird.

Complimentary lentil chips come with your order before your food comes. They taste good. Don't really do anything for your hunger lol. The red & green sauces that comes with them is bomb. I wish I knew exactly what it was but I'm too shy to ask.

Their buffet is also really tasty. There isn't TOO MUCH of a selection but I mean, it's enough to have a bit of variety. I never feel I get my money's worth though cause I get full after 1 - 1 1/2 normal sized plates. (I don't have the biggest 

My dad likes their Mango Lassi. He says it's the best he's ever had at any restaurant (Other states and Canada).

OTHER NOTES:
- All the dishes I've ordered have been kind of oily.

- They have a large vegetarian section.

- Every time I've been here, this place has only been maybe 1/4 filled at the most.

- I'm black and a few times I've been stared at by Indian families while eating, which is uncomfortable and kind of disheartening, but it's alright. I'm not going to let it really bother me.

- Waiters/Waitresses/Hosts are very nice, informative if you have questions and seem to come at the perfect times to check on you.
