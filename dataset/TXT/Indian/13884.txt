Bu1SgnZblQhE345j3GlzUg Just amazing.  We used the Groupon Coupon and went there last night for my birthday.  Loved it, loved it and loved it.  The naan and paneer kulcha was just amazing, so was the non-veg tandoor platter, the bhindi masala, lamb roganjosh.  To top it all we had the sizzling brownie for dessert.  Highly recommended and would go there for more.  Authentic Indian food without the  overpowering spicy sensation.  We also enjoyed chatting with the owner; he was friendly, and had an interesting story for the beginnings of his restaurant.
