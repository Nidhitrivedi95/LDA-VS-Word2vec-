0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw I have been to this place several times over the last three years and have never been disappointed with the food or service. They changed their menu a year or so ago, and stopped making a few items I loved, but I am still more than happy whenever I get a chance to come in! Both lunch buffet and plated meals are great!
