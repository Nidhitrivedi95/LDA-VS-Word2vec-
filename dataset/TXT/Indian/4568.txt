2-Y-kNEbrP_m1U9Hc2xH7A Had lunch this week. Good price for Indian buffet.

Offerings were very tasty, but limited in number. More selection down the road at India Garden, but I liked the spicing at Sammy's more, which is what Indian is about, to me.

Food was more lukewarm than I like, but I was the only customer when I came in, and only 2 more came in while I was there, so I guess it's hard for the steam table to keep it hot.

Service was attentive.
