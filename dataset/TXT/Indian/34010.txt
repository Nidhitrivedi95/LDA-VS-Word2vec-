m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw The menu at Kohinoor is extensive and features the usual suspects at a North Indian restaurant; vegetarian, chicken, fish, lamb prepared in various ways. The vegetarian appetizer sampler was fried and tasty. Chicken korma and lamb saag were both flavorful and the meat was very tender. Rice was beyond fluffy. Best part of the place, most entrees are around $10, a bargain for the amount of food you are getting. 

The menu did not indicate they sell liquor which was a bit of let down for dinner, and the service was speedy, but it wasn't clear that we had a server, it seemed like more of a team effort, which is a bit confusing. 

The changes in the interior from Escobar's are minimal; decor is lacking but seating was comfortable. I will be back to Kohinoor, I just will be stopping elsewhere for a cocktail after dinner.
