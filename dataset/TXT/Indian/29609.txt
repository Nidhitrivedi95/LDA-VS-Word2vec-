juhOeT4OP0mOMu3u-4KYIA Great samosas, tasty fresh naan. Easily accessible in the Brampton vicinity, and always a good place to pick up some snacks or fresh naan to go with home made food. We always come here when the families have parties at home.

The chaat papdi is really tasty. On a regular basis the family picks up chana bhatoora and they are delicious!!
