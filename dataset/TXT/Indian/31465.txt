KtNPcK6x9Dxj3aYGis5wgg First off,  let me preface this review with saying that ALL Indian food makes me run to the bathroom and evacuate, not just this place.  Bon appetite!

Firstly, the location is phenomenal!  It's walking distance from my condo and if I'm stopping there on my way home from work, there's plenty of parking along the side, next to the Gas Station!

Secondly, the price is great!  My wife and got an order of Butter Paneer, naan, and rice and it only cost us $25.  One order was more than enough for both of us.

We always call ahead and order due to it being a take-out establishment and not a traditional restaurant.  It's always ready when we get there which is pretty awesome considering it's all made-to-order!

The taste of the food is really what matters and this place tastes great!  Everything I've tried from here is has been awesome!.  

I've never been to India and eaten their food, (because every Indian person I've ever talked to tells me India is a horrible place and I should never go,) but having Indian Kiss steps away from where I live is amazing!

Now, where's that bathroom?
