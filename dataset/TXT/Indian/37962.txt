ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Origin is absolutely deliciously out of this world! The restaurant ambiance provides a romantic feel at the same time adding a touch of elegance of India. Tai Mahal premium beer is a must get, it is refreshing and it makes you feel like you are sipping on champagne. Order the nan/garlic nan paired with red curry, lamb with rice and the shrimp Molly. The nan with curry exactly what I expected, perfection! The lamb with rice in a bowl was tasty the lamb was tender and was full of flavors. Finally my main entree the shrimp Molly, it is out of this world and it would rock your taste buds. Thank you Goldie (manager) and your staff. Superb!
