B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog I decided to give Gandhi a try very early (5pm early bird special) on a Sunday night and thought it was pretty great. They had just opened for dinner so it was fairly empty, but I've passed by several times and seen it full. The food was excellent. I had a veggie curry which tasted so fresh and spicy. My partner had duck tikka masala and although I am not a fan of duck, I tried the sauce and was excellent as well. 

Read the reviews below about service issues, but didn't experience that at all. We had him all to ourselves though, so next time I go and it's busy I might update this. From the first experience the service was very friendly.

I highly recommend trying a special curry... amazingly good!
