P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg A friend of mine recommended this place to me. Myself and one other person went for dinner two weeks ago, and it was not worth a penny we paid. 

To start off, our food came about five minutes after we ordered (literally), which seemed odd.. I mean, fast service is great, but is it really a good sign when you order three dishes and they arrive within 5 minutes? 

I chose the shrimp chow mein dish, which was nothing close to shrimp chow mein. I don't even think there was shrimp in it. They used the wrong noodles, and the wrong sauce. It was basically a whole other dish.

The person whom I was with ordered the pad Thai. Worst pad Thai ever. Seriously it was so bad we didn't want to eat it. 

The third dish we ordered was black bean beef. When they brought it to us, we found a long, curly black hair in it, which was disgusting, and when we told the waitress, she took it to the back and brought it right back out to us. Same dish... just removed the hair. We obviously did not eat it.

I don't know about their other varieties of food, but if you want good Thai food or chow mein, do not go to China Cottage
