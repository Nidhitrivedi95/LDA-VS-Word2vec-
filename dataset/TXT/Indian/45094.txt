S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA so far the best India food I have ever had here in Arizona. not only the food bust also the environment is very clean and nice! service is great too, very friendly owners and even we bring our little one we still feel very comfortable eating here! definitely can give it a try!
