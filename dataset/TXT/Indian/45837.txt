SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ We found this restaurant near our hotel... It's walkable from Wyndham hotel where we stayed... At first sight it was uninviting.. There was a couple sitting... We went in... Interior was kind of fine...
The staff is very cordial n they customize the spice level according to the requirement. We liked it...
We placed an order for kadai panner And daal  makhani they were bad...

Onion naan , parantha and tandoori roti were soft and chewy... Had that charring and crispy texture too...
