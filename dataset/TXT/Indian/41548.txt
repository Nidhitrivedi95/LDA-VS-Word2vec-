q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw Based on other Yelpers reviews I tried  Kabob & Kurry for lunch today and really liked the food and the staff! However, I wonder if it will survive as it in a strip center that looks to be on life support. 

I arrived at 11:30 for the buffet, and there were only two other guests. The waitress/hostess was VERY friendly and explained that business was so slow that they did not want to cook a lot of food that would go to waste. She said she would bring me the most popular dishes from the buffet, which consisted of: 

Chicken Tikka Masala (5 stars) - which was Excellent! A generous portion of chicken in a delectable, velvety sauce.
Mixed vegetables (3 stars) - spicy and tasty!
Chicken Kebab (3 stars) - moist, and very flavorful.
Lentils (2 stars) - I thought this dish was OK, but rather bland. 
Naan (5 stars) - fresh and not oily, some of the best I've ever had!
Rice - OK what can you say about white rice?

All of this for $5.95! It was a very good meal, and I brought half of it home! My only issue with the restaurant is that if they are going to cancel the buffet, then I'd rather they offer a menu - that way I could have chosen what I wanted.  

Super friendly folks, great food - they just need some business!!
