KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Hidden Gem in Mississauga. We tried this place on my husbands birthday. Rick greeted us right away and helped us with our order. Everything we had was crazy good. Basically heaven in your mouth. We especially liked the T-Bolt and the Loaded Butter Chicken fries. Rick brought us over cheese cake samosas on the house. We will be back!!!
