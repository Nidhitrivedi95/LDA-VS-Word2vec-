But I will admit it was not easy to do at the Copper Chimney.  We arrived as a group of four, place seemed full and I could tell there was a possibility we would be leaving fairly quickly when it came as a shock to the host we had not made reservations for this Friday night.  Well, they just took the reserved card right off a table and gave it to us.  They could probably tell by my open toe sandals and Nebraska Corn Huskers hat I was going to be drinking a lot of high margin beer.   Got the Channa Masala and Butter Chicken (on a side note I am not Indian but would certainly challenge any restaurant with my own India Fare, I make it hot) it was good, chicken was boneless and without any fat.  My friends' dishes also appeared to look pretty good. Food is fresh and there is a lot of if for the price. I played it safe with the standard Indian plates but there were many options. Beer is in bottle no tap but good selection of Asian and N. American. Full fare was 40 bucks with taxes and booze.  Good Show.
