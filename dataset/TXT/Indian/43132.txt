RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg We had an excellent time here! A lot of it was due to how incredibly kid friendly the place was, which you just don't see a lot with Indian food restaurants. Our 2 1/2 year old loved the little play area and the host/waiters/food staff were all super friendly to him and showed him how the food was made. 

We got the butter chicken and paneer tikka masala, both which were excellent, along with an order of garlic naan. There were a couple of little chicken bones in the butter chicken, but nothing to ruin the sauce. The naan was tasty.  We went on a Sunday night and there weren't a lot of people in there, hopefully just because it was Sunday and they are still new. I would definitely go back.
