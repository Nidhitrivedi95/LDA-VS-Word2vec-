I am a woman of habit so I always get the same thing: mixed veg korma roti. It is truly sensational. My husband gets the butter chicken roti. He loves it. Even when we're trying to eat healthier, it only takes one of us mentioning Mother India to have the two of us salivating and my hubby marching along queen west to pick up the best roti in the city. Oh that fabulous dough. That creamy rich sauce. The tender vegetables!
The restaurant itself is not a thing of beauty, but being a takeout gal, I don't much care. I'd rather they save money on renovations and fancy decor and just keep doing what they're doing.
