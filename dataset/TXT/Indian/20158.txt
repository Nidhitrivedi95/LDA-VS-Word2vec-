fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA very busy restaurant ... although i love Indian food.. i had no idea what to select when picking my food...  the food is freshly made and nann was delicious and hot.

i stuck with most of the things i knew.. but tried some interesting new foods too.. everything tasted quite good.. and not surprisingly i see alot of asian people in there too..   

I cant eat alot of Indian food as i do at other buffets because i find all the currys and everything very heavy.  It sits in my stomach for a long time so 2 plates was enough for me. 

its 15.99 on a weekday dinner..
