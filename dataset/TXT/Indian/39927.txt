pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Good buffet, horrible service.  Dishes piled up on the table, impossible to get a refill and not very friendly.  It looked like on of the owners was sitting there rolling a mountain of silverware instead of lending a hand!  We couldn't get a check and left  extra (plus tip) just to make sure we paid in full.
Too bad because the food was very good.
