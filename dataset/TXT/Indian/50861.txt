uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w I ordered the vegetable and rice dish. I asked for mild. I really couldn't enjoy the dish because it was still way too spicy. The portion size was good but the food was just OK. Very few vegetarian choices on the buffet. The staff wasn't very friendly. Definitely didn't feel warm and inviting.  Can't say I'll be back, too many other places to try.
