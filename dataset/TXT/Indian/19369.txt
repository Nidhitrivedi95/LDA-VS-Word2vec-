fagmJeecurJfXGAxbgMv8Q We ate at this new South Indian place based on other reviews on Yelp, and then ate there again because it was so delicious.  We don't get a lot of South Indian cooking in New England so we just asked our server to bring us a good meal, half vegetarian half not.  Everything was fantastic, and he was great about encouraging us to eat things we'd never had before, giving us the choice of having it "British hot" or "Indian hot."  If you go, order a double order of the chili fried idli.  You won't be sorry.  Limited beer and wine menu, but the Cholas special mint drink was a great alternative.
