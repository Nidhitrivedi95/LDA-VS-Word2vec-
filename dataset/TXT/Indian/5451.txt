33yClygMVQZb5y9WgOCHLA The Best Chicken Tikka in the Phoenix Valley. I try to go almost every week there. People are nice, food is great, price is very affordable. They have also improved the ambience. Not the best, but no complains. Guys, if you visit there, dont forget to try the Chicken Tikka (legs) there. My advice to the owners is: Keep up the good work and maintain the food and restaurant quality.
