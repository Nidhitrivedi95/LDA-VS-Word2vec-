qmcIsZjLpxd0V4RekSozmA I recently joined Blythe R here for lunch with the purpose of reviewing and we were both pretty well impressed with the place but I'll try to stick to my own opinion here as you can see his below.

First up, I wandered in on my own and made a pig's ear of communicating my booking arrangement to the staff and somehow got sat at the wrong table, only to realise that another large table was being quickly set up because I had sat at the wrong one. When realised my booking was for two and not six and, embarrassed,  communicated this (I'm sure they had already realised) they didn't show the slightest irritation and happily moved my to another table. 

Service was exemplary, friendly and efficient. Once our orders of dosa, idli and utthapam  were taken, there was a bit of a wait, but this was deemed well worth it when it emerged that our food had been made fresh to our order, and was frankly delicious. We wanted for nothing throughout the meal as service remained attentive but not at all intrusive. 

Another great part of the experience was that advice we received regarding the menu was honest and we weren't up-sold or overly full by the end. 

The value is as great the South Indian food and I will be going here again, soon.
