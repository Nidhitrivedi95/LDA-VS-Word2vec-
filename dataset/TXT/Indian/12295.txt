auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ My husband and I cannot stop going here! The food is amazing and the service even better!  We have been for both dinner and lunch buffet many times. The lunch buffet is what we prefer.(ends at 3PM)  Good choices and the quality always on point. Great quality and a great price.
