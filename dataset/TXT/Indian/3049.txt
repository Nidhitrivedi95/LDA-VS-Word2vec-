0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw Hahaha... don't listen to all those people who aren't satisfied with the Danforth Dragon. Those are the same people who think Chinese food is chicken balls, egg rolls and fortune cookies. Hello! Those are just made-up foods.

China is a massive country with so many regional cuisines. What most people in Toronto think of when they think of Chinese food is actually Cantonese food. The more well-known, but less famous Chinese foods are probably Szechuan and Shanghai (dumplings, green onion pancakes, etc.) fare. Hakka food, on the other hand, is a different beast altogether... and at the Danforth Dragon, they don't serve pure Hakka food... but they serve Indian-influenced Hakka food.

They serve food that is popular amongst the Hakka Chinese living in India. You're not going to find Cantonese Chow Mein here, folks.

Back to the restaurant: the service is always excellent, and the food is always amazing! I usually order the dishes that are either spicy or cripsy... those are my favourite. If you aren't sure, ask for guidance and the chef/owner will be happy to oblige!
