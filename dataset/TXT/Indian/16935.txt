DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew If you need any Indian fix, this is definitely the place. Food has always been good quality. I did cut one star as portion and price ratio seems a little steep considering this is not a luxurious restaurant. I would suggest either to increase the portion or decrease the price just a little.
