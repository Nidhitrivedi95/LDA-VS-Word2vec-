DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Based on the reviews, I was very eager to try Curry Leaf. Compared to most Indian restaurants in town, the decor was very bright and cheery. I was really feeling the ambiance! 

My friends and I arrived for lunch. Most lunch entrees average $10 and include rice and naan - total bargain! My friends felt that the lunch menu was a bit limited, so they ordered from the dinner menu. 

Here's what we tried:
Gobi Manchurian   A
Lentil Soup   A+
Saag   C
Lamb Biryani   C
Vegetable Biryani   N/A
Roti    A
Garlic Naan    A+

The dishes that were good...were really good. The others were approaching the mark. One issue that we encountered was our server forgot to order the vegetable biryani, which happens from time to time. The problem was that he did not own up to his mistake. Instead, he told my friend that he felt she did not need the vegetable biryani. It was too much food. When did servers become the portion control police? 

Needless to say, I won't be returning here anytime soon.
