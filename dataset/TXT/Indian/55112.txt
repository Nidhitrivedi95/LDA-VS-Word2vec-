Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Had lunch buffet there today. On the plus side, they had a good variety of food for the buffet. The food in general was bland. It did not have much flavor. The spices did not come through in the food and the sauces for the curries were watery. The atmosphere inside was not bad. It is quiet and authentic. Overall, the palace passes for average.
