xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw We stopped by this placed this past Saturday. We are from Los Angeles and were visiting Phoenix for the Dodger game. My husband and boys all had Indian Tacos. We also ordered two tamales, and I had the Green Chile Stew w Frybread. Everything was delicious and we were left fighting over their yummy frybread. Thank you for the awesome service!
