UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA My fiancé wanted to go to this place and I was a little nervous at first since I have not had not been to a good indian buffet in town and I had given up trying. I was really surprised when we got here though. 

First all of the food looked really fresh, not like it had been made earlier this week and was reheated. Everything was very tasty and not spicy. I really enjoyed their mint chutney, spinach, pakora, tiki masala, goat, and garlic naan. (yes I did eat all of that for lunch, I know I'm a fatty). Only giving it -1 star for no samosas and the service was kind of lacking.
