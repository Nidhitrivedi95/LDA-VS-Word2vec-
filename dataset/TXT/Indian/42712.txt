RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I love eating at The Blue Taj. I do recommend they work on their customer service a little. I noticed the last time I was in there that one of the girls took the fork I was using for my appetizer right out from underneath me as we were still eating -and I snatched it right out of her hand. I think it's rude to assume that people are done eating and try rushing them. Maybe ask patrons if they are finished before taking their dishes and flatware? Another thing that should be fixed are the chairs. Oh. My. Word. I cannot tell anyone how annoying the chairs are. I feel like if I bring my chair out from under the table to sit in it everyone starts to stare at me or something -they are so loud! I would suggest putting something like felt pads under the legs. Other than that, I think everything is good. The food is great, the decor is pretty, the manager is awesome. Oh, and I suggest making a reservation to anyone who wants to get a table for dinner.
