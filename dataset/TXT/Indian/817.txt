-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I was super early to work and didn't want to arrive too early. I bookmarked this store last year. Since I was in the area I visited this morning as soon as they opened at 10am. My visit wasn't bad at all. I have more of an interest in Japanese food but Indian food and products have always made me curious. 
Rani's is like your normal ethnic store with food, mini restaurant, and a bit of accessories. 
I was hoping to try the jalebi or other Indian sweets in the restaurant but since I arrived early there wasn't any prepared.
I still would love to try some of the Indian food but it would be best to come back at lunch time.
