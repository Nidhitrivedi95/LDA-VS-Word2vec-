rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Ok, so I have never really had Indian food before. Some Curry dishes here and there, but that is it. From my first experience with going to a full on Indian restaurant, I loved this place! Connected to an Indian Community Center, this place is so simple, but very tasty. I had Vegetable Samosas and Chicken Tikka Marsala! Awesome. Only went level 3 on the spice for the chicken and still got a runny nose and a little toasty. I will be back for sure!!!
