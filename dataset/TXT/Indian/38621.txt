OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Extremely poor customer service as chef always stays outside to explain dishes to non Indian or wanna be Indian Americans. It took my food 1 hour to get to my table after complaining hell out of them. Extremely over priced. They might be under impression that customers are mainly tourists and not regular so that they can keep fooling people. I saw their main chef explaining "butter chicken" to a group of wanna be Indian Americans in his fake American accent for a complete hour and half I was there. Even though I was screaming for food, he didn't bother to do his duty. Extremely bad
