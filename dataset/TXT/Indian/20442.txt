FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ This place is not good. We've given it a couple of tries since everybody has a bad day once in a while. The food was really just never tasty. Most of the time it was poorly seasoned or way over salted. It also really bugs me that this is classified as an Indian and Thai restaurant. It's probably the worst Indian food I've tasted in Madison. If they just called themselves a Thai restaurant and changed the names on their menu, I might have given them two stars.
