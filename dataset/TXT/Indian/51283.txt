uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg Decent food. Very very basic settings if you decide to eat in house. Looks like a very old-school fast food restaurant, very worn and smells a little bit of cleaner, etc. 

They put your food on "cafeteria" style trays, basic forks and knives, this is basically as cheap as you get. 

The food is decent, very hot (temperature). The naan could be much better. Very bland.

Probably a better choice for carry out. I would probably not eat here again.
