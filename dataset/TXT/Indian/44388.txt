Rwbj2ed2IHEAQlCFl2pR-g The thing which first attracted my mates and I to Passage to India was its name and original sign.  This place is definitely not just any ordinary restaurant, and I would even go so far as to say that it is flawless.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted like old friends by one of the friendliest waiters I've ever met.  The decor is stylish and unique and the tasbles all seem perfectly placed to give a comfortable atmosphere.  The menu is extensive and has a good range of kormas, tandoori specials and other authentic Indian dishes.
I ordered the Lamb Tikka, plain rice and a naan which all arrived pretty quickly and tasted incredible.  The sauce was amazingly creamy and had a good blend of spices whilst the lamb was clearly of the best quality.  
We each spent about £13.50 on a great, filling meal and some real Indian beer.  I would recommend Passage to India any day for both impeccable food and service.
