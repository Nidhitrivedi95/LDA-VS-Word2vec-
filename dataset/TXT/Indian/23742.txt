gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Lucky to have found this GEM two years ago. In a city where it seems like Indian restaurants are popping up all over the place, I have yet to find one that even comes CLOSE to Mount Everest! Food is made with LOVE and you can taste it in every bite. Hot, flavorful, tons of options for every palate! I'm a veggie so I love the Paneer dishes and Veggie Korma but I would be happy eating anything on the menu! 

My boyfriend gets the Tandoori chicken and Paneer dishes as well but tonight he tried the chicken and noodles. He died over how amazing it was! Try this place, you will leave in a good mood with a happy belly. And take first time Indian food eaters HERE! Remember to order the crispy, soft naan bread perfectly cooked every time! Enjoy, and you're welcome :)
