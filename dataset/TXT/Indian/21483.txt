GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Food is on par and amazing but the service leaves something to be desired. The staff is not rude but generally a little inattentive. The atmosphere is that of a dive location but the last time I went it looked like they had done some modest remodeling.  I am ok that the service isn't stellar because I really enjoy the food.  The Goat is amazing!!! 
Favorite Indian/Pakistani food around just go with little expectation for the service and ambience and you will be a fan I am sure. 

Check them out if you like authentic food!
