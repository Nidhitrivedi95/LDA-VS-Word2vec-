-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g This place gets a 4 for food and options but only a 1 for service. You have to ask for a clean plate after a messy appetizer and have to flag the waiter down for drink refills. They do have a nice happy hour with lots of food options. You could probably have a full meal just based off the happy hour menu. I would definitely give them a try but have some patience.
