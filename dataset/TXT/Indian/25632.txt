hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw So, SO good. I'm new to Las Vegas, and was craving Indian food tonight. After dinner tonight I am completely satisfied.

We started with the samosas - delicious. Crisp on the outside, a little spicy on the inside, and whatever that green dipping sauce was - yum. :) Dinner was the Chicken Tikka Masala and an order of the plain Naan.   My boyfriend and I decided it was he beat naan we have ever had. (Not to say we KNOW Indian food, but we have had enough to compare!) I loved the spice to the Masala too. I ordered mine medium-hot, and it was perfect. 

The only thing I'd say that could improve after this first trip would be the service. It was a little slow, my water ran out a couple times (spicy food + small water glasses = water refills for me), and one of the employees (family-owned I'm assuming) had a phone that kept ringing which was a little annoying. However, I'd say if you order an appetizer, you'd be fine. 

I'll definitely be back!
