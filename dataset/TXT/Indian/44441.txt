rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg I love food! Particularly good with a punch. This place delivers bold flavours that will satisfy the not avid food lover out there! Everything we ordered was delicious. Hubby and I shared the Thanjai special soup, an platter with an assortment of appetizers, shrimp biryani, lamb dosa and chili chicken. We usually ask for our food order to be spicier then their usual but decided to follow their "heat" chart. Thank goodness we did lol! Good thing we made reservations because the place was full and people kept on coming in. Very good eats at a very affordable price. Also BYOB!!! Service was excellent even though we received one of our main dish before our soup and appetizer. I mentioned it to the waitress and she was very nice and apologized. It happens and it didn't ruin our evening. I can't wait to come back with a bigger group so I can try the 6' long dosa :)
