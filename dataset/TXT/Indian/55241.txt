WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA The reality is that after going back and forth between roti joints, everytime I end up ordering from Bacchus again reminds me that these are the best. I've also been delving into enjoying their somosas and occasional dessert, like the ever tasty "Peanut Butter Star". 

And I've gotta say that the random days of being closed have even been reduced over the last while so I no longer have any hesitation in saying this place is indeed, as good as it gets!
