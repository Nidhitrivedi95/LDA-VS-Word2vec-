We ordered the tikka plate, chaat and biryani.  Everything had a nice flavor and I was happy to get a side of hot sauce to spice things up.
Overall, it was mild for non spicy food lovers but everything was fresh and flavorful.  Great for Indian food lovers and as a gateway for those less exposed to it.  
Cheap. Fast.  Modern.  Fusion. Convenient.  I want one on the west side!  I'd eat it often!
