4ritTGFnNxmKnKm-UX3kPQ Dined here on 5/28/15. True to the ratings expressed by other patrons, the vegetarian food served was excellent. Ordered Dhal Makani (5/5), Aloo-Gobi fry (5), and Malai Kofta (4.5).  The several types of Nan's and rotis we shared were are very tasty. To top it the gazara halva was the best we ever tasted. The final item masala chai flavor fully wrapped our excellent experience.

 The host and owner Anil is a smiling, vv courteous young gentleman. The place is clean, void of smells, clean restrooms, pleasing ambiance, serves moderately priced menus. In summary, an excellent place.
