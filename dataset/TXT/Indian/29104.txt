jGisKivsuty7TKwAz5HEVQ Service as good as you'd expect from somewhere as established as this and food quality pretty much along the same lines. Marks off though for hustling a review from amongst the six of us. 

Large range of vegetarian options and overall a well presented menu priced towards the upper end of the scale. Not the place for rowdy groups so fairly peaceful although, given it's location I expect during the Six Nations it fills up and has to turn away a lot of passing trade.
