jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Came in from Chicago looking for some zabiha halal breakfast food. The place is nice and clean albeit a bit confusing the way the seating is laid out. We ordered cholay, halwa poori, and nihari. The food was bland and tasteless. The only item that was decent was the garlic naan. We haven't had any Desi chai. for a while so against our better judgment we ordered some chai. Fail again. $42.00 later we just had to write a review.
