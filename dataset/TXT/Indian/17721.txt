e3D-zDL66uIaTFOdjJv8SQ I attended a wedding event at Chauhan's in their banquet hall.
The hall is rather dingy/rundown and the chaircovers were tied so haphazardly that I was mortified (I work in events and this is just a no-no!) I had to resist the urge to go around retying them!

We enjoyed some apps before the main event (the pakoras were AWESOME) and a buffet style meal. I ended up eating rice+naan because the chicken and beef dishes looked too oily and creamy for me to stomach. The naan was fantastic though!

I don't live in the area so won't be back anytime soon, but probably also wouldnt go out of my way to go if I did.
