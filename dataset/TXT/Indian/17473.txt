DPsbhgdHty--Jegj_yNaUQ Never a bad meal. I have eaten here literally 100 times. We have large retirement or birthday parties here and have eaten alone or in small groups. The food is very tasty and incredible value for price. It is clean and well decorated. The staff is friendly and attentive. They have a good range of food for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Nothing bad to say. I'm hungry now.
