OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Amazing food, we just loved the place. 
We went as a group of four. We ordered Laal maas, Biryani, Dal tarka and Veg korma, I must say both Veg and Non Veg items were superb.

Eric was really nice and soft spoken. He made sure we had great experience. 

Prices are a bit on the higher side however considering the quality of food it is justified.

Cheers!!! and Keep up the good work guys, would definitely visit again.
