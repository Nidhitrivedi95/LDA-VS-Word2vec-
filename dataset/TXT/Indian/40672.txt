PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw The food here is delicious. Dining area is small so this is truly a perfect carry out spot. I got the veggie samosas and they were really good. Chicken tiki masala was perfectly spiced. The garlic naan was different than what i am used to- it had the jarred minced garlic instead of fresh- still good but fresh would of been better. I will definitely order here again. I am not the indian food expert - i wish descriptions were on the menu or on the online menu.
