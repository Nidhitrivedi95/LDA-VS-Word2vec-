xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Tried this place for the first time last night. It was recommended by some work friends. The building appears to be going through renovations but it didn't appear to affect the interior. Seemed a bit of a wait to be seated and then a long wait to get a drink. In fact, when the waiter finally came around he seemed a little short and annoyed with us for some reason although we were only sitting and talking. Food came quickly and everything was delicious. We have a favorite place that we typically go that has awesome service and great food and we definitely missed the warm welcome from our normal spot but the food here it top notch, so that makes up for everything else. Overall, I would recommend giving it a try.
