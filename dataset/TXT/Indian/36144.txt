nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw I avoided this place for like two years because of the giant "STUDENT ID DISCOUNT" sign in the window, which I generally consider a bad sign--more fool I.

When my partner and I finally tried them, we were blown away.  They will make things super spicy if you ask them to (as my partner prefers), but they also make things appropriately mild if requested (I'm wimpy).  Their saag is delicious (one of my favorites), as is their chicken tandoori kebab, although I have to be careful with the latter because I think there's something in the marinade that disagrees with me--it's hard to say for sure because every time I eat it, I make a complete pig of myself.  Anyway, the naan is also good (various varieties--we like the spinach stuffed) and my partner LOVES their biryani.

They deliver via Straight2YourDoor, but if you don't want to pay the fee, they also do take-out.  Since they're right on the square, you don't even really need to live nearby as long as you have transportation of some kind, including a direct bus route.  And the 10% student discount is good at dinnertime as well as lunch (at lunch, they have a buffet; we've never gone, but it's under $10 a person).

I just hope they get a lot of delivery and lunchtime business, because it seems like whenever we go in at dinnertime, the place is more than half empty.  It'd be good for a group--you wouldn't have to worry about seating!  They definitely serve beer and wine; not sure about hard liquor.
