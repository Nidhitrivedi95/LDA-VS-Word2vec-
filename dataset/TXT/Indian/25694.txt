hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw By far the best Indian food I have ever had, no exaggeration at all.  I came here for the first time last night, I normally phone in my orders and have it delivered. Very nice people, will continually come here. The shrimp curry by far is my absolute favorite, perfect amount of spice and everything I've tried here is very flavorful. I highly recommend this place to anyone
