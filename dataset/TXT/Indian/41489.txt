Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I am a believer! I finally got to try the buffet. Let me tell you, if eating until it hurts is wrong, I don't want to be right! They had all the staples (Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala) as well as some new items I've never tasted. Chicken 65 was the most notable - kinda like crunchy bite size pieces of Tandoori Chicken, except spicier. Dessert didn't dissapoint either; there were at least 5 you could pick from. The most notable were the Mango ice cream and Carrot Halwa.

Note: Lack of Samosas and Palak (Spinach) Paneer didn't push my rating to a 5. There is hope, however! I did go on a Thursday for the lunch buffet; the weekend buffet is supposed to have more offerings.
