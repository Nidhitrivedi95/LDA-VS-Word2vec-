JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng This is one of many restaurants in the Charlotte area which we have tried. This has by far been the best. I called Siri for restaurants and Aroma popped up with 4.5 stars. We tried it... The service was great friendly and clean cut. We ordered lamb kurma, chicken tikka masala and dal makhani which is one or more of the items we usually order at the other restaurants and a samosa for app. The food was prepared very well we ordered medium which was not quite hot enough but the flavor was still superb. We live in Waxhaw nc so this is about a 35 min drive for us with the other restaurants being closest we would drive the extra to go here it is that much better.
