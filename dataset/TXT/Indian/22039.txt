GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I really like this place. We had very good service. The waitress was friendly and helpful so we're the other employees.  I ordered the special beef dish can't think of the name now but it was a bit on the spicy side which I really don't mind. This dish came with naan bread and a delicious side salad oh and rice. They do not skimp on rice. And fyi if you order it as a side you will get the same amount as you would if it came with the special. I decided to upgrade the bread to spicy and that was pretty good too. If you are not into the spicy thing don't do it or even order the beef special I will edit the review later when I get the name of it. own The beef was so tender it just melted in my mouth. I was very pleased that I didn't have to chew meat for five hours or choke to death. Please try the tandoori shrimp appetizer it is the bomb.  the shrimp is very tasty and it seems grilled it has some char like it was. It lies on a bed of some grilled peppers and onions. You will receive a few sauces with your appetizers and they are very good.one is red one is green and the other is a pickled ginger kinda sauce. Each one has their own unique flavors. So it is totally up to your own taste buds. Oh my friend ordered the tiki masala dish and that was so good.  The chicken was cooked to perfection in the beautiful curry sauce. I think it's curry but if you eat Indian food you know what I am talking about. They say most of this food has been cooked in clay ovens. That is why it has an original old school flavor. I will tell you that I will be back. I want to try the wraps. We seen this lady across from us tearing up a wrap... and I am sold. More reviews to come.
