OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I don't know how this place has such glowing reviews. It was just average in both food and service. Tandoori chicken was not particularly flavorful but it was juicy and tender. Chicken korma was nice and flavorful and creamy. East Indian rice was advertised as having peas and raisins but it contained neither. Naan bread was okay. They have traditional seating (on the floor) which I thought was a cool concept so we opted for that. However, we were forgotten about. The waitress was very apologetic and sweet about it though so I forgave her.
