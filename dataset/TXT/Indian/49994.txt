U3Ah385YhvlraXsKcEeZ4g "There's always the Butler's Pantry" says a lot about the unassuming, but dependable restaurant. It's probably not your first choice, but it'll always be there if the restaurant of your choice is too busy or closed that day. The "homestyle" dishes are affordable and comforting. The decor is homey and relaxed.

We stopped in for a quick bite during the early dinner hour. While my dinner dates (who both grew up in the Roncey neighbourhood) both opted for the tried and true sheppards pie, I made the rookie mistake of going with the crab salad sandwich and hated it. The bland melted cheddar atop of the generous blob of chopped previously frozen imitation pollock stick doused in mayo was bad. 

The home-style unsweetened iced tea as well as the service was great though. I'll be sure to go back to gather a more thorough sampling of the Butler's offerings.
