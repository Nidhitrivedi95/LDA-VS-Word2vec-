bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A I can hardly tell my paneer's from my Gobi's but I can tell you that I like this place.

Walk in and you will find a modern contempray dinning room with granite top tables, booths and tables. In back is the buffet setup.

We were in for lunch at 12:30 on a Saturday and the buffet was the only option, and what a good option it was. So many flavorful dishes and All VEG!  I tried them all then tried many a second and third time.

We were offered dosas, a Indian crepe like item. I don't know if this cost us extra but it was good and with dosa's the buffet was $12.

The dishes had pretty good flavor, some flavors did not pop as much as I would have liked but overall the selection and quality won me over. The buffet is nice as I am still mostly lost on what to order when looking at an Indian food menu. 

We had water with our meal, they give you glasses and a carafe of water but oddly no ice.

If you are veg go here and just keep eating, if you are not, you may not even notice that the place is meat free.
