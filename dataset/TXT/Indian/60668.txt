zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Fantastic food, authentic tastes, the chai transported me back to my time in Somaliland. I really enjoyed the  Usbek Pulaw( seasoned lamb cooked on skewers and served on a bed of Afghan rice(basmati rice mixed with grated carrot, raisins and little chunks of meat) accompanied by a cucumber salad. For desert I had the Gulab Jaman. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat genuine Afghan food and does not care about the setting
