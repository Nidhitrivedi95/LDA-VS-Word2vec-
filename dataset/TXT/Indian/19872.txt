FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw One of my favorite restaurants, I've eaten at Swagat many times for dinner and lunch, I've used their banqueting rooms, and I've hired them for catering.

It's good.  Really good.  With a few caveats - the lunch buffet is generally decent, but can be a little hit and miss, and a few of the dishes don't survive well under the heat lamps.  It's a fine enough way to sample a few things, but it's not the best way to experience indian food, because things don't always go together well.

Also, the default setting for spiciness is often "wisconsin spicy", particularly with the buffet.  However, they can, and will on request, bump up the spiciness (both the heat and otherwise).  Having the boti kabob at a spice level of what the chef said was "how he would eat it" was revelatory.  It wasn't blindingly hot, but it was deeply savory and complex in a manner that the "standard" spiciness wasn't.  Without asking,the standard spiciness can be a smidge bland.  

Their menu is huge and features both north and south Indian specialties.  The north indian specialties seem to be the best best - the south Indian utthapam were good but the iddli were a little dry.   I've never had a bad tandoor dish there, though, and the naan is always excellent. 

Service is almost always prompt and attentive.  Almost too attentive - it always seems like there's a waiter nearby trying to refill my water glass, which can be a bit disconcerting.

We hired them to cater our wedding, and it worked extremely well.  It was a big hit with our guests, the caterers showed up promptly with a nearly perfect amount of food (we had enough leftovers for a few lunches but we weren't swimming in leftover palak paneer), Mr. Singh was very friendly and helpful, setup was a breeze, and the price was quite reasonable.
