2KkTzafNqkEKr5VTjsR3hw Prices have changed since the last review was posted. Their 'shorteats' or fried items are around 2 for 1$ now. Ordered the chicken biryani (found it way to spicy even though I'm very used to spice), egg rotis were too salty, tandoori chicken had the color of the spice but tasted nothing like it and was very dry. I wasn't very impressed with the deep fried items either. I was hoping for a better experience since I saw two long lines lined up inside the store with 6 people handling the lines at the counter. I didn't try other items so maybe I'm missing something that the crowd loves (?)  Plus points - the girls at the counter are very helpful at explaining the dish(es) and although they are clearly stressed with the crowds, they are very polite and pleasant. Also, they're open until midnight if you're craving something spicy in the Markham area.
