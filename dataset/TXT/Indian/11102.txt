A9W5rhp49EX-BYpALGLJdg While looking for a new restaurant in a familiar area, I found Bombay Touch.

The restaurant has been open for about a year now.  The place was very clean, and the staff very knowledgeable and polite.

The menu had a lot of great options on it, both veg and meat.  They had foods clearly spelled out which were gluten free.  The gluten free options rate about half of the menu.

I had a Lamb Roganjosh, and had a dish of eggplant and a gluten free Naan.  The person with me had the butter chicken and a normal Naan.

The food was exceptional.  The lamb was flavourful and tender and perfectly spiced.  The eggplant was in a nice thick yellow curry and was served with fresh ginger grated across the top.  The gluten free Naan was very interesting: it was gluten free and yeast free, but tore like a normal gluten flat bread.  It was also delicious.

My friend also enjoyed his butter chicken and Naan.  We both agreed that this was to become one of our regulars.

I highly recommend this place.  Must go to if you love great Indian food.
