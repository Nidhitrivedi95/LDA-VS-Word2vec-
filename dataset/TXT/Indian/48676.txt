TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA Love this place! Been coming here for 4 years. I bring my parents, my friends, and my family friends here. Great food and tastes like home. Love that there are north and South Indian offerings.

Recently, the service has become soooooooo slow. I can only come here if I know I have a couple hours to spare. It's so disappointing- even when I come when the restaurant isn't busy it takes forever to have my order taken and be served. Please fix this and make Tamarind great again!
