Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Im from Orlando. Came here for training. I love trying out different foods, so I go everywher in Orlando. So Orlando being very diverse I thought they would have the best Indian foods near me..

I was wrong... I got here accidently. On my way to Texas Roadhouse I saw this and had to try it. 

Boy im happy I did...

My favorite Indian place so far! I cant complain!

The level of spiceyness is different from where Im from, being not so spicey so I had to add more spices, but the taste was amazing..

If you love asian, Indian and spicey food, stop by here!

And please try the Garlic Naan.. For $3.0p and 6 slices of bread its so worth it! It has 3 different sauces that come with it that are incredible... I loved all of them...
