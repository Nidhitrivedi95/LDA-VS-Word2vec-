gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I've come to their lunch buffet a number of times... fantastic if you're vegan because everything is labeled. The sambar and chutneys are lovely and they make a great dosa. Service is attentive and friendly.  Oh and one tip... wait to get your chutneys/sambar until they bring out your dosa because last time I ended up with double of everything!
