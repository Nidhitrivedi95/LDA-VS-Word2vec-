Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Nice atmosphere and decor. Owner recommended a dish my wife really enjoyed. We loved the Naan bread! Flavors in the sauce were excellent!  I wish mine was a bit Spicer and the chicken was salted, but I enjoyed it.  I notice everything and am critical lol. Overall great food and a good night out enjoying Indian Cuisine
