g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ Happy that there is great decent Indian food in the neighborhood.  Very nice service and delicious food.  Restaurant is a bit tucked away as it is in the lower level of the building but it's super cozy and beautiful inside.  Wish they had some pictures advertised so people walking by can see.  We went in only because we have been craving indian food for awhile.  Glad we ventured down the steps.

We've also had delivery several times from here - since we live down the street, food arrives within 30 mins (they quote 60 mins).  Naan and butter chicken are our favorites.

Edit: food is still good but what's up with the service? Servers never look me in the eye, always speaks solely to my male partner. Not a fan.
