yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw *Update* I received a lovely response from the owner regarding the Groupon. That's the first time any owner has responded to one of my reviews and it's refreshing. They deserve a 4 star rating for that!

Let me preface this review by saying this was my first time trying Indian food and I just don't care for most of the flavors involved so this is going to be less about food than the experience.

I met a few friends here for dinner tonight. The staff is very friendly. Nice ambiance and the table comes prepared for you with water and their flat bread with sauces and that's a plus. I will say after reviewing the menu it's rather pricey.

My friend ordered the appetizer combo plate and it turned out its literally a dish that just combines everything into one plate. Interesting but not bad. I ordered a vegetarian rice dish as I'm not a meat eater, with peas, tomatoes, onions, and Indian cheese. It was fairly basic and bland and although you get a healthy portion it seems pricey for what it is at $11. I sampled a bit of everyone's dishes and (again my tastebuds) it wasn't really my thing.  I ordered the chilli naan bread and I will say that was amazing! I could eat a stack of that alone.

Me and a friend purchased a Groupon that day to use... $16 for $30...great deal! But they wouldn't let us use them because we bought them the same day. I read all the fine print and nowhere does it mention this so that was irritating. I am getting my money back for the Groupon as I don't think it's a place I'll go back to. 

I want to be clear that I think this place is a great representation of fine Indian cuisine;  I'm just not a curry fan, etc so if you're an Indian food lover please try this place. Lovely ambiance and staff! Just keep in mind about the Groupon.
