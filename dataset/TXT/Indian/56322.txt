XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Visited for the first time today for breakfast and it was an experience I haven't stopped thinking about al day! Excellent price for an extremely filling breakfast of eggs, sausage, a bowl of a chickpea and potato soup, different types of breads and spicy sauces. Also ordered the steamed veg momos which were amazing! The chai was also excellent, can't wait to come back!
