U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw A little hidden gem in South Chandler. 

I haven't had the pleasure of dining in so this will be based solely on take out orders. 

I have ordered take out quite a few times so feel it is time to review this place.  

Service: each time I've ordered they are always friendly over the phone and the first time where eager to answer any questions I had about the menu.  My order has always been correct and hot n fresh. No issue here!!! 

Food: I've had the Tandoori Chicken and the Chicken Tiki Masala. Both of these are absolutely outstanding.  I want to order something different each time, but can't bring myself since these are so dang delicious. I don't have much experience with Indian food, but the few places I've had this place is excellent. Great flavor. And the naan bread is made fresh as well. I recommend the Garlic Naan. Yummo!!!!
