llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg I'd heard a lot of good things about Swad, so my husband and I decided to check it out on a recent Saturday night.  I'd never had Indian food before.  It turned out we made a great choice for my initial foray into this cuisine.  We seated right away.  Since I wasn't familiar with the food, I had several questions for the waiter.  He was able to give me lots of details and advice.  The food was spectacular and I was very happy with my choice of chicken tandoori.  My husband had a curry and was also very happy.  He's eaten Indian food at several other restaurants, so he was able to make a good comparison.  He had nothing but good comments.  We were both really impressed with the service.  Several times other servers stopped by our table to make sure everything was going OK and we didn't need anything.  I really felt like they were all working as a team.  I want to come back for the lunch buffet  so I can try more of their dishes.  I can't wait.
