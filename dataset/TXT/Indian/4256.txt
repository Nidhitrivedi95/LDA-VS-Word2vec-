I had the chicken malabar and was not impressed.  The chicken was tough and chewy, my boyfriend had the curry house special biriyani and it came out very dark, almost dark grey in color.  Very little meat and the little bit he had was tough and chewy.  We were expecting so much more after such a long wait to get our food.  We will not be returning.
