eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg One evening I had a huge hankering for some Indian food. This restaurant was the closest, so I thought I would give it a try. Upon sitting down I noticed the interior of the restaurant definitely needed some work ... nothing really looked like it goes together. During my meal the employees were still working on cleaning up the lunch buffet. This seemed somewhat unprofessional. It also made me question their level of cleanliness. For my meal I ordered the garlic naan, chicken vindaloo, rice. The naan was somewhat thin/soggy then what I was expecting. The spice and flavor of the vindaloo was perfect, however there seemed to be a lot potatoes in it. Portions were what I expected. Excellent service. My bill came to $17 plus tip. Due to the ambiance and the average quality of the food I would have been content with a bill around $12. But with it coming closer to $20, I would have expected slightly larger portions or improved interiors or some stellar tasting naan. I would only give this place a second chance in order to try out their lunch buffet.
