OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Avoid this establishment. YELP rieviews must be written by owners because not only was the food TERRIBLE but serivice was rude and non existent. Ordered the Bombay platter that is claimed to be a sharing plate for $36.  The plate was the size of a dinner plate with each portion so small a single person wouldn't even be satisfied . Top it off they ran out of one of the meats that was supposed to be on the platter. Waiter said he would replace the meat with some other meat. Never got another meat to replace the missing meat and was charged full price for the platter. In addition, we ordered wine which the waiter forgot to put in . 30 min later we reminded him and 10 min later we were told they ran out of that wine. Please don't waste your hard earned$ here .
