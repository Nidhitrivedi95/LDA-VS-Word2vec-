zzCsh8Rx40ZXcyDrzFnfOQ We sometimes go here for their lunch buffet on a Friday. It's just a short walk down from the North York Centre subway stop so it's quite convenient to get to.

The lunch buffet is $11.99 and has all the regular dishes that you would normally find in an Indian buffet. The food, for the most part, is really tasty (their Butter Chicken is fantastic) although I can't say that I'm a big fan of their Tandoori Chicken...  I find it to have an overwhelming flavour of charcoal.

This place isn't much to look at on the inside and I reckon they could do a little work on the outside to give it more curb appeal but the service is friendly and the seating area is well laid out.
