IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA Very bad servicing for delivery.
1. They told credit card is not accepted so it was difficult to get cash.
2. We ordered 7 plates of momo for per person but we got it in just 2 box.
3. Too late for delivery. They told the food will be delivered in 1 hrs but it took 1 hrs 35 min. 
4. There were no spoon and other items to eat. Just only food.
