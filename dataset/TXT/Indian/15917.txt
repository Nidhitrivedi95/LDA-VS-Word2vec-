daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ Horrible customer service 

We ordered a paneer tikka masala at this place. We were served chicken tikka instead and we are vegetarians. I went and told the guy in charge and he just started smiling. I told him we are vegetarians and you should be careful. I understand this type of mistake can happen , but worst part was the guy was so unapologetic and arrogant. We felt really bad and am never going to this place again !
