b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA so call for a take out tonight...pick it up in 30 minutes they say....
...45 minutes still waiting...
....order comes out but its wrong, as they doubled on one dish....customer behind me they forgot 2 rices (PS. check your food before leaving)
....they correct my bill and I gladly pay by credit card so get get home....
....as they bring my order, so i can leave, the front head chief lady, very rudely states that they made an error (ie. on their correction of their error) on my bill and I owe them $1.41 and WANTS my credit card back.....
....you kidding me, I say.....no she says, in all seriousness & rudeness.....
.....okay I say....but last time you see me again.....
.....all this time waiting, took time noticing how not clean & un-organized this establishment is, imo....
