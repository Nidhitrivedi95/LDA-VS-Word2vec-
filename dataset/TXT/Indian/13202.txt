b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA The food at Sahib is wonderful. An extensive menu of items to choose from and they prepare many favorites. I prefer vindaloo and the chicken and lamb vindaloo are always tasty and very spicy. Prices are very reasonable and the portion size makes 2 meals for me. The delivery drivers are always friendly and confirm my order with me as I pay. Highly recommend!
