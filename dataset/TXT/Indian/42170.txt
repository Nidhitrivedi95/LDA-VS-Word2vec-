qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Let me start by saying i have been coming to this place since it opened...the food is always good. However- on this occasion the service was BEYOND DESPICABLE! i had ordered 3 mains, each comes with your choice of rice, or naan.

i arrived, paid my bill; then realized it was abnormally high. i looked at my bill to see that i was charged extra for the rice and each naan, and had 3 additional naan included at a charge of $0- not what i ordered.

No big deal; went inside, pointed out the error; to which the young girl behind the counter LAUGHS at me and says "no sorry sir not at this location".

The menu states it, the website states it; THE WRONG SIDES WERE INCLUDED- THEY GOT THE ORDER WRONG, and REFUSED to offer up a refund.  Apparently this is the customers fault.

HORRIBLE SERVICE. RUDE. OBNOXIOUS BEHAVIOUR.

i happen to know the owners and will be returning during the week to give him a piece of my mind.
