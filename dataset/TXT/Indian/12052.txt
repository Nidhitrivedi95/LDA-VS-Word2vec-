auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I have been here twice now. The first was for the lunch buffet and second for dinner. 

A nice place located in a pretty pretty plaza. It is very spacious, good for small and large parties. They have a giant bar area so I assume they have a full bar. The lunch buffet is set against the wall next to the bar. 

Both times service was ok, the bussers were much more friendly than servers. Our drinks were constantly refilled, dirty plates were quickly picked up. 

I think the lunch buffet is about $11 or $12, very good deal. The Buffy includes: tandoori chicken, few different types of rice, various types of curry (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian), small salad selection, and dessert. For the price the quality was very good!

For dinner we ordered goat curry, this was so delicious. The meat was tender, sauce was perfectly seasoned, simply delicious! We also got garlic nan, shrimp "fried rice" - we ordered level 4 spicy and this burned a little! We also ordered a lamb dish that was also very good! 

Overall this is a nice place for Indian food. Chelsea than their places I've been too and the food was delicious! Will definitely come back!
