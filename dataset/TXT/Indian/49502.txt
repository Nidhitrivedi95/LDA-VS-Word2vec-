tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My whole family is full of adventurous eaters. I met with my son and his wife and my two girls on Tuesday for buffet at Indian Oven. Wow, the food was fabulous and showed a great variety of meats and vegetarian dishes. The hosts were attentive and frequently returned with delicious hot Nan bread and fresh water. Mango juice and hot chai tea came with the meal and for the price, it was a great deal! We will be returning soon and the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned!
