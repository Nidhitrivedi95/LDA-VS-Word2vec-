We went for the buffet but will be back for dinner for sure.

What makes this buffet different from others?  Most places just give you naan and have one or two chutneys for you.  This place?  Butter naan, plus 6 different dips/chutneys, plus made-to-order dosas masala.  Dosas are crisp pancakes made of lentil and rice flour. They brush them with butter and then fill them with a masala filling of potatoes, cabbage and spices.  YUM!

Moving onto the buffet: Two different kinds of biryani: a vegetarian one that was flavored with tamarind and a meat one (goat).  Real, authentic biryani is nicely spiced, with little crispier pieces of rice and softer ones.  Clearly made from scratch.

There was a salad bar to start, some fritters in yogurt and there were several appetizer items.

For meats/eggs: they had chicken curry, butter chicken, a curried egg dish, the goat biryani, and one other I didn't try.

For veggies/paneer: they had a peas and cauliflower dish, manchurian eggplant, daal curry, two veggie soups, paneer tikka masala, the tamarind biryani, a potato dish and some others I can't remember.

For dessert: they had a mango custard, a warm semolina dish with raisins and nuts, and a mango and condensed milk cake.  They also had hot chai and cups at the buffet.

Everything was excellently spiced and I'm excited to return for dinner.  The only thing I'd change is that my water sat empty for quite a while.  That said, I never asked for a refill, so now I know to ask.

Solid job.  Easily the best non-vegetarian indian place in the Phoenix metro area.  And the lunch buffet was only $10!
