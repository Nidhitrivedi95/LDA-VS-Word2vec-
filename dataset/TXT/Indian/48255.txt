ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA This is my first review ever. But I have to write this. Went there for dinner. Found hard stone like black stuff in dal makhani. I had ordered daal for my kid. When I called the lady at the counter and told her, instead of saying sorry, she says thanks for letting her know and went straight into the kitchen with that stone. Service was pathetic, they won't come to the table after serving to check if we need water or other stuff. Never going back again.
