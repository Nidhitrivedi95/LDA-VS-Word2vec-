YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA Kothur is an Indian restaurant with South Indian owners. With that in mind we were set on ordering 'South Indian' dishes if possible. There were surprisingly few that fit the description (though the menu has over 100 options).

Assessment of the food:

Mixed appetizer tray - This was a good sampling of all the appetizers. Unfortunately we found everything had a pretty overwhelming deep fried taste to it. 

Two different soups, both of which were a bit flavourless.

Chicken dish (#35 I think?) that in the description identified itself as 'South Indian'. The flavour of the sauce was very unique compared to any of typical indian dishes served in restaurants.

Tandori Shrimp Sizzler. Large portion and came with a BIG basket of naan bread. Unfortunately it was quite overcooked and didn't have a lot of flavour but I think this dish has a lot of potential. It certainly looks delicious with big succulent sizzling shrimp.

Dosa - this is a staple of South Indian cooking. It's a big pancake filled with a potato based filling (big as in larger than a dinner plate!)

In case you can't already tell...we ordered WAY too much food and did a terrible job of ordering a good variety. Our meal was essentially carbs, carbs and more carbs. (Totally our fault).

No air conditioning in the restaurant, but lots of fans to help keep it cool.

Anyway, I honestly haven't had a waiter as sweet, friendly and eager to please as ours was tonight. 5 stars for the smile our waiter's face, but just a two for the somewhat bland food.
