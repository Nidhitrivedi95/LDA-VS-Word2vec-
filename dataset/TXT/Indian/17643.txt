DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ I've been going since 1997. I hadn't been for a couple of years but decided to drive out to the place. I was very impressed with the renovation and the selection. It's amazing the selection of foods available, cleanliness and quality. 

I don't typically order meat dishes as the vegetarian selections are great. They make great chic peas (chole/channa), saag and aloo gobhi. My wife ordered a chicken biriyani and enjoyed it as well. 

Speaking to the owner he mentioned that they cook fresh food daily. After going to other restaurants I would have to agree as the food is always well made. 

A must go if you crave Indian food.
