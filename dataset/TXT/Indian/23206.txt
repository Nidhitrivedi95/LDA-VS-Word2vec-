gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I haven't been here in about a year, but in that time, Mt. Everest India Cuisine, hasn't lost its mouth watering touch. Bollywood movies play in the background as I wait, and then dine on my Chicken Mahkani  my 'go-to' meal when I come here. The Garlic Naan is bar none, and I could really just eat that as a mea,l in of itself. The Basmati rice is always cooked to perfection and a nice accompaniment to the entrees. Las Vegas' Best Kept lil secret! Who needs fancy deco when you can have fancy Indian food at an extremely reasonable price. Vegetarian options are always available.  A GREAT first date place..snd a GREAT Happily Ever After regular. LOVE this place!
