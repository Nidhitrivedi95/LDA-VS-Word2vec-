C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I've only been here a couple of times -- once for dinner, another time at lunch.  I love the location as well as the vibe to the place.  It's busy but intimate.  However....

The dinner was ok, though I can't remember very many specifics.  I had a soup and a pasta, both were nice but clearly not something that really stood out.  Decent drinks and service for a relatively large group of people (there were about 12 of us).  I'd rate dinner 3.5 stars.

My lunch experience here wasn't the greatest.  I ordered the Reuben sandwich and it reminded me of something I had at the Cheesecake Factory.  It was dripping in cheese, mayo, butter, grease...it was disgusting I couldn't eat it (I tore it apart and ended up picking at pieces).  I can't remember what my girlfriend ordered, but she ended up throwing up a couple of times during the meal.  Admittedly, she wasn't feeling the greatest before lunch, but whatever she ate did not help.
