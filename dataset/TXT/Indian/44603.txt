S0ekW-gI5jKtMokyra5oZA Have been coming here for the last few years for my Sri Lankan food; which is made on the premises.  I usually pick up freshly made vegetable samosas 3 for $1. Chicken samosas, & Indian style hot tea. Several of my staff and clients that have tasted Siva's samosas have become regular clients, as they find the stuffing really fresh, tasty not to mention light and not greasy. They also have different types of curries available daily. He must be doing something right, as lot of the local Sri Lankans eat there on a regular basis.
