nyEL20vR0RZ3IUI-Z4m1yg I'm not exactly an expert on kababs, but I'm trying to figure it out.  From what I understand, the Kabob House down on Independence is Persian-style kabobs, while the Kabab hut is Pakistan-style kababs (don't know if the spelling is indicative).  To most Americans, it's just meat on a stick, which is generally a good thing, because it makes it easier to eat.

The restaurant itself isn't much to look at - essentially a counter where you can do your best to order - often the people working don't speak particularly good English - and then a table or three where you can eat (you can also take your food with you).  There is an International Grocery attached, as well.

You'll find that the food actually seems to be fresh, and portions are good-sized.  If you're in the mood for a kabab (or kabob) and don't want to pay a larger price down on Independence, check out the Royal Kabab Hut.

You will have to dig a bit to find this place - it's in the strip mall across from the Starlight Roller Rink and where the Delta Six Theater used to be.  To make matters worse, the whole mall looks closed since the China House and Las Estrellas closed down out front.  It's not.  The Kabab Hut is way in back - just keep going and you'll find it eventually.
