gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Really delicious Indian food at decent prices, I found this place on Yelp and gave it a shot with friends. This place has great service, they were really attentive and friendly. This place has a great atmosphere for going out on a date, family, or close friends. Naan bread was thicker than normal, but very tasty. Worth the drive from Death Valley.
