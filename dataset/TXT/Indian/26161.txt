Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw Despite how crowded this place can get at night, the resto is quiiiite spacious so reservations aren't required. Each time I've come here, I've ordered a quick combo platter (veggie dinner is $11.99, while any meat or seafood plate is $14.95). These plates can also be ordered at lunch ($10.99 and $12.95, respectively) and come with a bunch of sides: rice, veggie pakora, daal curry, aloogobi, and rice pudding. I've tried almost all of the lamb dises, but my favourite would have to be lamb korma. Absolutely loooove how tender the meat is, and how flavourful the sauces are. What I like about this place is that you can choose how spicy you want your dish to be. The naan they serve is sooo good, especially when it's hot. In the event that you underestimate the heat level you choose, they have lassis on the menu ($3.75 - sweet, salt, or mango) or you can just down the rice pudding (it's kind of watery, and tastes like suuper sweet milk... but not like condensed milk). Service is good, you just have to wave them down buuuut they usually come by frequently to refill the water glasses. I can never fully finish a plate, yes that's how filling it is, and how large their portions are (even though they don't quite look like it. Peep the metal meal platter pic I posted!).
