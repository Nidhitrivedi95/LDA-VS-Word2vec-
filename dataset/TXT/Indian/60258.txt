ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I ordered deliver tonight and I was less than pleased. Even when I specified I didn't want my tikka masala to be spicy, it was. I ordered a portion of nan bread and it seriously had two small pieces, the appetizers were cold and my order took a little over an house even though I live 5 minutes away. I don't think I'm going to be ordering dinner from this place again, but I might still go for the lunch buffet once in a while because the lunch buffet even if not the best Indian food I've had is not the worst one either. For $8 or so I liked their chicken tikka masala ( not as spicy as the one I got deliver), love the onion bhaji I just wish they had fresh from the oven naan bread like other Indian buffet's I've had. Not a fan of their mango lassi, they have a different version with some herbs, I like the sweet one.
