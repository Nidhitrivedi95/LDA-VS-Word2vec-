2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw An excellent choice for tasty Indian food, located close to the Heartland shopping district.  Generous portions are perfect for sharing, one app, two mains, single orders of rice and nan was more than enough for two and leftovers to take home!

Nicely out fitted dining room for a comfortable dine in experience.  Everything is fresh (including the naan, which you can watch made thru a window into the kitchen) so BE  PATIENT!  Our app was 30 mins from order and the meal itself 45 min.
