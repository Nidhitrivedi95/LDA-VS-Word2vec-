7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ I love the buffet here. I get to try a lot of different Indian dishes. I've had the weekday buffet for $9.99 the weekend buffet for $11.99 and the special buffet on Christmas for $14.99. The special buffet has goat, lamb, fish and chicken and unlimited mango lassi. Weekday buffets have chicken, paneer and veggies and usually tea or orange drink.

Lots of Indians eat here so that's a good sign. I like this buffet more than the others I have tried.
