qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Like others have said, this restaurant is a bit of a hidden gem in an unassuming plaza. We had been to the former location, which was on Main Street Markham in a plaza that has since been torn down for condos, but we like this location better, even if it's nothing to write home about atmosphere wise.

I had beef vindaloo, which was nice and spicy, along with garlic naan, which had a great flavour, and my wife had the paneer. I enjoyed all the dishes, and would recommend this restaurant as a solid Indian alternative if you're in the area.
