HF-fLG3QaNepY151QKDNLA This is one of those hole in walls with delicious food. Don't expect fancy anything. They have two dining areas. Enter left door if ur a truck driver or a group of uncle ji's. Enter right for family dining. I was in family since it was my cousin and I. They are quick
On taking your order and even bring u a decent plate of chutney and an Indian salad.  We order the lamb chops, sizzling and full of flavour. I had to start with the butter chicken. It was good but next time I'd get the chicken tikka masala only because I need my food spicy. And then we got some garlic naan which complimented the butter chicken perfectly. It was light crispy and soft.  They even have a tv with Bhangra beats.  Between two ppl it was $25. So it's cheap.  I wanted masala chai but they refused to make me some because they were too busy and there was no chai wala. I found this hilarious but that's how many ppl walk thru....both doors!!!
