skKvWc8KwSAhj5Zf_pe7Dg My husband and I just ate here last night for my birthday. We have had a taste or two of Indian food before but this was going to be our first time really sitting down to eat indian cuisine. We arrived at 9:30pm and the place closes at 10pm so we were worried we might not get the best service but the service was wonderful! We were welcomed and seated and given our menus by a nice young girl. 
     The prices are great, most of the "appetizers" are $5 or less and the entrees are about 14$-12$ but they are enough to feed two with just one. We didn't know how big the servings were so we each had one appetizer and 2 entrees and had to bring the second entree home, which we ate first thing this morning for breakfast we couldn't wait to taste their amazing food again. 
     The food is hot in temperature and full of fresh flavor, and they ask how spicy you would like the food which is nice because I can't handle very much heat but my husband loves spicy foods. The owner was present and came to speak with us, he is very nice and shared with us that they just opened about a month ago. 
    I live in Glendale and I do not regret driving to Chandler to visit this place, and we will be coming to eat here whenever possible. You just have to give it a try, you will be happy you did trust me!
