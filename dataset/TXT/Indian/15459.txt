CRgCV0KUx40uW_j_b0p-MQ I love this place! The dishes are fragrant and tasty. I've eaten there or done take out over 20 times now (in just under 1.5 years) and the food has never disappointed. As a matter of fact, I have friends from London UK who also love this place. Oh the Jalfrezi! It's 9:38 am as I type and my mouth is watering
