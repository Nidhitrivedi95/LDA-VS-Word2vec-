yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Food tastes much better when it's made with love! The chef was incredible. He was constantly coming out and checking on the food for the buffet. He asked if we had any questions and made a special bread for my vegan friend. He told us to wait on the rice because he has fresh rice coming right out. The staff was great! Very friendly! The food was amazing! The only downfall: I over stuffed myself because the food was so delicious, I couldn't stop eating.
