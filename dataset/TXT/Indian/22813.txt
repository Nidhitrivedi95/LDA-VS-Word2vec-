grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg I give this place a...MEH.. review. I don't understand why folks below find it amazing. I just find everything way too greasy. But then again, South Asian food is always greasy. Maybe I didn't try the right dishes... It was just very... OK.

I think their saving grace was the sweets. I enjoyed their gulab jamun and jalebis. Oh and their samosa's too.

I'll definitely won't go back.
