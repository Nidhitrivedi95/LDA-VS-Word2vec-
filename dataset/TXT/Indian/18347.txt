eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Most people seem to really love this place and it's a nice place to go if you're in the mood for some veggie, Desi food but I just wasn't feeling it. I thought the selection was kind of shabby, the service was slow, there were just TOO MANY little kids being loud and annoying and, worst of all, I found a hair in my food. I can put up with almost anything BUT being grossed out by what's on my plate. The plus points were that the food itself was pretty tasty, the naan was delicious, and the desserts were really good. I probably won't be back for more, I've been to better Indian food buffets.
