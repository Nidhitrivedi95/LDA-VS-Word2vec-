A2aeHV_EsLIxEqRthPoujQ We always used to order from this restaurant through uber eats but last night I decided to call the restaurant to order and a young woman answered. She asked for all my information regarding home address and phone number, took down my order and said the total amount that it will cost and then proceeded to tell me the food will be delivered to me in an hour. An hour goes by and I call her back and she says she never put the order through because i didn't tell her what I wanted and the phone cut off as I was giving her my phone number. Then after she said she called me back which she never did and apparently a man answered saying wrong number. I would understand if she just simply forgot to give the order to the cook as that may be an HONEST mistake but she kept lying saying she never took my order, I didn't give her my phone number or address or even the order itself. I find this ridiculous because she gave me the exact TOTAL AMOUNT for the food. How would I know the total amount if she "didn't even take my order down". This is the worst customer service ever, she needs to be checked for her problematic attitude. At least acknowledge you made a mistake! Perfect customer service if what you're looking for is to drive people away! So disappointing, was a regular but this is just the most outrageous crap ever.
