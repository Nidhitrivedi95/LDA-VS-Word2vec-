DrdhxvpwlZGhwF5vTR_QnA The restaurant I was aiming for wasn't open, so decided to try out the lunch buffet here and was pleasantly surprised!

There were soups, salads, vegetarian dishes as well as several meat dishes to choose from. All for a very affordable price.

The quality of the food was good as was the taste.

One star off as the naan was a tad dry and the dessert lacked a bit of attention.
