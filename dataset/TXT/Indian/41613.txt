Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g This is the second time I ordered here. First time I ordered the lunch special, chilli chicken with sauce. It comes with soup, 1 spring roll, & rice. The portion I found was small, not much chicken...more sauce.

The 2nd time I ordered Manchurian chicken with sauce. Definitely didn't look like Manchurian chicken I've had before . It had a yellow sauce, unlike usually dark brown. The taste is ok but the chicken was undercooked, pink on the inside. I hope I don't get sick tonight!!  Guess I have to cook it myself more..,so don't get SICK!!Also when I got my order for take out, surprised doesn't come with rice!! That is outrageous, usually when order a dish you get rice to accompany it. 
With this last experience, not sure if would go back!...VERY DISAPPOINTING since so close to home. Think still might have to drive to Mississauga for Hakka Chinese (Chilli Chicken House or Hakka Legend is better or Frederick's in Scarborough)
