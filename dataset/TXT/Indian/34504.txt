MKCbZC6KR4oxA4LOQAVdhw Have been passing this place since it opened and hadn't taken advantage of the opportunity to try the food until today. Had the Frankie with chicken which was phenomenal. Perfectly done. Service was very fast. I was in and out in less than 10-15 minutes. Had the pleasure of meeting the owner who was very kind. This is an excellent and welcome addition to the neighborhood and I would encourage people to try it. This is the kind of place that you want to stay open as long as possible. I will absolutely return.
