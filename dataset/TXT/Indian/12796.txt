B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Delicious food, beautiful decor, and really good service. My wife and I ordered the non-vegetarian dinner for two and everything was fantastic, with the exception of the lamb curry, which was a little too tomato-y for me. I especially loved the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Kheer. Also, phenomenal mango and strawberry lassi. Our new favorite Indian place in the Madison area. Be warned, the dinner for two is more like a dinner for three, it's a lot.
