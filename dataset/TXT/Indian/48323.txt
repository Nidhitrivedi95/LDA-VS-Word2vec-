ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Fantastic Indian restaurant in a nice area.  The wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive and the lamb with pecan sauce was incredible.  

They have a selection of flavored Naan bread including garlic, cheese, or chili.  I got the garlic flavored Naan and it was awesome.  

Reasonable prices for dinner.  I can't wait to try the lunch buffet!
