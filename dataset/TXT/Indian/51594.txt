UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Mint is ahead of the game, definitely one of my top spots to eat in Vegas.  The service is great and they're very friendly and easy to communicate with, even with English speaking customers.  They even gave out two complimentary dishes since I've been here as a trial run to open up new items for the menu.  They are foodies as well, and know what to suggest and to whom.  The food we've ordered all came out very prompt.  The dishes here I found more delectable than the other Indian restauraunts.

Vegan, vegetarian, and meat lovers all alike with feel welcome here.  The music has a mixed playlist of Indian music along as well as techno and other genres.  Come try it out cuz this place is awesome.  Mint even has a ghost pepper inferno curry dish where you appear on the wall if you dare to try and succeed!  Kudos Mint. Good eats.
