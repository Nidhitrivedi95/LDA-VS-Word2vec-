qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ This restaurant is at a new location at 5694 Highway 7. They won't get many points for decor but once you get past the looks there is much to like. Great naan, excellent tandoori, very good aloo gholbi and they will make the spice to suit your palate. Service is fine though timid and soft spoken. The food is always steaming hot and cooked fast. A nicer space would easily earn 4 stars.
