Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg Walking along Queen Street, I was looking for some Indian food to eat. Trimurti is located on a block surrounded by 3 other Indian restaurants. I figured I'd try here because of the cheaper prices and extensive vegetarian selection. 

It was a good choice going here, the food is delicious. I was with 2 others, and we all ordered vegetarian items, all of which were good. You choose a curry, and order rice or naan on the side if you choose. The food is quite filling, so you might have some food leftover to take home. Before your food is brought to you, a server brings some pappadums with various sauces to snack on. Being a student in the city, I'd probably go here often to order something to eat. 

Service is a bit slow, but it's worth the wait if you have the time.
