Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Once you find this place in an old shopping centre, it's well worth it.  Service was great, it was quiet, meals were lovely, butter chicken a little different from the Aussie butter chicken but still nice. Meals were large as I ordered a number to share but there was so much left over.  Very nice.
