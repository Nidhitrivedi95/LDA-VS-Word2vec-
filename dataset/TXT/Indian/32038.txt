ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg Its an Indian street food joint , all stuff on the menu is authentic indian street food, but not the taste.. it's okay when you crave for it and missing home. Nothing is awesome or exceptional or great but nothing is bad either :)

when you are in the vicinity, can go for it, as they have good sitting area, particularly patio.
