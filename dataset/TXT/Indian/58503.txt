I been going to Tabaq when they also were try to run a restaurant where now Watan kabab resides. I used to grab the breakfast or have the breakfast buffet from there and then they closed off that location and concentrated on the current one.

Grabbed Halwa Puri nastha (breakfast) and I would say it was greasy and good.The meal came with 2 Poori freshly fried, Halwa (Dessert), Aloo curry (Potatos), Channa curry (chickpea), small portion of Achaar (pickle). The entire meal was hot and fresh and packed nicely so it doesn't leak.

Over all it was a good greasy experience.

FYI... this place is halal!
