OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg I've never been to the Host before in Toronto.  I went to their Markham location once many years ago.  I was working in the neighbourhood and looking for a new restaurant (new to me) to try out.

I was very impressed with the layout of the restaurant, the tables, and the dishes.  It was a very welcoming presentation.

The music was at a nice level, and the mood in the restaurant was calm.

I mentioned to the waiter that I must keep a gluten free diet, and he was very helpful in getting me food that I could eat.

I ordered the Chicken Lababdar, and the Okra.

The Chicken Lababdar was good, and the okra was slightly firm and cooked with onions and mango powder.  I also got to try the eggplant, and it was also cooked perfectly and was a very nice dish.

The place was clean and the waiter was very good as well too.

I was very impressed with the menu.  There were several options that were old favourites that I hadn't seen in many years, as well as the usual old reliable such as the butter chicken, and biryianis.

I highly recommend this location.  I will go again.
