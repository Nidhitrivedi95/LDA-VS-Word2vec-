LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I'm so surprised by this restaurant. I'm not a vegetarian, so I always hesitate going into a vegetarian Indian restaurant. But this place..... I'm just speechless. Ordered the Andra Dosa with aloo masala (the aloo masala is a must in my opinion). Also had chilli baji which surprisingly wasn't as spicy as what would've happened if you but into a typical chilli. Overall, great place! And it's always super packed!
