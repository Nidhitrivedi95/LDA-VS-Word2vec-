-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw We have been buying briyani here for couple of times of week, initially it was good then gradually we had spoiled meat for atlst thrice and we did tell the owner about it and he got so annoyed and response was so harsh. He hardly heard what we spoke and we did tell him very politely and now we stopped going there. I am seriosuly thinking to write to Food safety inspector about the meat used here. It was so smelly(Bad) as soon we opened it once back home. We cant eat there so obviously we see only after we eat at home and they denied to accept the truth. I have never seen such a worst behaviour of the owner. So pls dont say he is kind he was very rude when u tell him the truth. Cleaniness is must i guess
