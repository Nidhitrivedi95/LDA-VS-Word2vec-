gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My favorite Indian food restaurants! Any time I'm in town, I have to make a stop. The lunch buffet is delicious and fair fairly priced. Dinner is awesome, and the spices are spot of for my taste. For the price, you get a good amount of food. Also, the ppl are very friendly. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family.
