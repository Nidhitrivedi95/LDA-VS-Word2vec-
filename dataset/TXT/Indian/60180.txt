ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA This was our first time here. We were visiting from out if town. My husband said they had the best mango Lassi he ever had. For dinner we ordered an assortment of naan, mango lassi, saag, tikka masala, and vegetable lo mien. Service fast and portions were big! Which was great because we had a toddler. I wasn't expecting to really like the lo mien I just ordered it because my toddler loves noodles; but I couldn't stop eating it. We loved it!
