kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A Came through during lunch on Sunday. Buffet was on. Decided to try it out nonetheless. 

The good, the vada and sambhar was not half bad at all. No where near Guru Laxmi's food but still. The lassi (thick yogurt drink) again was nicely thick and done nicely. 

The bad, bleh not worth the $14 for the buffet. Though I will give place the benefit of the doubt that the non buffet section is better as the other reviewers have stated. The idlis (steamed rice cake) hard and not good. Rasam pretty darn terrible. Stay away from the North Indian dishes (cottage cheese, chick pease etc). Saying they were dry, tasteless and weird would be nice. 

Will I go back? I truly don't know. I just might to check out what the good reviewers meant. I will say that stay away from the Sunday afternoon buffet.
