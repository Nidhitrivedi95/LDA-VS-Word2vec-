3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ I can't say much about the food, because I am not an Indian food expert.  It was good and I enjoyed it, but that's about all I know.  The problem was with the service and replenishment of the buffet.  Let me preface by saying they are very nice and they were extremely busy, with a wait, but that's no excuse for running out of plates, silverware, food, etc.  We waited almost 20 minutes for the bread to arrive and there was an extended line up at the buffet that kept building, because there were no plates for quite some time.  Seemed very unorganized, to say the least.  Wouldn't rush back, but it's certainly a friendly place with decent food and reasonable prices.  They just need to up their game on service and upkeep of the buffet.
