-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw It's definitely a hole in the wall. Came here with my friends for a long weekend. Their food definitely has a kick to it. The best deal is to get a plate served cafeteria style with your choice of 2 meats and a veggie. Came out to about $10 per plate. 

Their butter chicken was very good, but the other curries didn't blow me away. Great place to eat after a few drinks.
