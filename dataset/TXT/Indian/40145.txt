PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg I was a student in Edinburgh and the Mosque Kitchen was seriously a life saver! A huge, delicious meal for under a fiver is pretty much every students grail. 

Now, even though I'm not a student anymore, going back was like a home comfort. There is always too much food, it's still cheap and tastes great! Yes, it's paper plates and canteen style serving, but the seating area is modern and always clean and friendly. 

I ordered the Tarkar Dhal, rice, garlic naan (which I believe is the best naan in Scotland) and a can of Rubicon and it came to £5.50. I don't know whether it's my taste buds that have changed, or the cook, but it was missing the kick that it used to have. Maybe I should just go for a spicier option next time!

There is always a fair amount of people in, but I've always managed to get a seat, even at lunchtime. 

It may not be to everyones liking, but I strongly suggest everyone tries it at least once. In an expensive city it's a beacon.
