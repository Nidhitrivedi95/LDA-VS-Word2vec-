OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g By far one of my favorite Indian spots by far. Eddie one of the servers always provides a good experience, it's great to find people that can relate to many others and are knowledgeable about what they are cooking/serving this is a great place to eat and will make you feel right at home!
