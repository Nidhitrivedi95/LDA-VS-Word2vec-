UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I have been to Indian Flame several times, and the food is always delicious. The cook does a great job at making authentic Indian food at a reasonable price. The Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite, with the Tikka Malai in a close 2nd place. I could eat this food until I die!

However, and unfortunately, I might actually die waiting for decent service at this place. Upon ordering our food, the woman (not the one who owns the place - she's great) literally yanks our menus from us without even acknowledging our choices. Then, the food often takes 30+ minutes to even come out. This past weekend, while waiting ages for our food, I asked her very politely for a mango lassi shake. She again neglected to even acknowledge me, but instead walked back to the kitchen, brashly pushed open the door, turned to the cook just enough so I could see her roll her eyes and say, "add a lassi shake"... Then, when it came out 10 minutes later, it wasn't even a shake! It was just a normal mango lassi. 

I was blown away. I have *never* been treated so poorly at a restaurant - let alone a restaurant that I've been to many times. 

What is hard, though, is the food is still good. So, I'll probably return - but I'll call my order in ahead of time for pick up and go eat somewhere else.
