5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA If you love Indian food than you must go here.  We enjoy going to Indian food lunch buffet's - enjoy the variety.  This way we don't have to pick just one item.  Anyway, went there for lunch today.   Selection was good and the food was outstanding.  The spices in the food was unbelievable.  Only disappointment/ surprise is that we were the only ones there.  Hopefully the word will get out and they will get more people.  Owner was very nice and explained the items.
