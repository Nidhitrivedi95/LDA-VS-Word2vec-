YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A I came here with my girlfriend for my birthday and we got the Sev Puri, Bhuna Lamb, and Paneer Tikka Massala. Usually, I'm hesitant to go to an upscale restaurant that serves ethnic food because I find that the flavors are diluted, however this was not the case. Although we didn't enjoy the Sev Puri that much, both the Bhuna Lamb and the Paneer Tikka Massala were really good. The Lamb was extremely tender, and the cheese in the Paneer Tikka Massala was really dense which I liked. Just a note though, the mains do not come with rice or naan, so you'll have to order it separately. We got both the naan and the rice, and the naan was really good also. The waiter accidentally served my girlfriend the wrong dish, but at the end they comped us with Kheer which more than made up for it. I would definitely recommend getting the Kheer, I usually don't like rice pudding that much, but I really enjoyed this one. 

One thing that I didn't like though was that the service was kind of slow, it took 30-40 min for us to get served, and it looked like the people around us had to wait a similar amount of time.
