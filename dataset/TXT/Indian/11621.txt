ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Definitely deserving of the great reviews. We're visiting from Los Angeles and sought out these dosas.

The store front is a little cramped, but the food and service were excellent. We had the Chili Masala Dosa and the Channa Batura. Both were extremely generously sized and tasted great. Straight up dosa flavors and tastes here, no Americanized stuff. They also offer some North Indian options and Indo-Chinese options.

Looking around the restaurant some others had thalis providing them a variety of dishes to enjoy. I'm getting the thali next time!
