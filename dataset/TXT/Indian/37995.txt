ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I WALKED IN WEARING A 3 PC ARMANI SUIT, WALKED OUT WITH ONLY MY UNDERWEAR...........Did not pay much attention to the prices on the menu, ordered several items, including drinks.  Noticed that the portions were TINY....so being hungry I ordered more food and more drinks......so when the bill came, I almost fainted...THE PRICES THEY CHARGE FOR A STRIP CENTER RESTAURANT ARE EQUAL TO A KING S RANSOM.....I would not pay this much at a five star restaurant at the Bellagio, or the Venetian.   The owners have a typical Indian mentality...get rich quick with high prices, small portions, lousy service.  The one arm bandits are not only in the casinos  but are alive and well at Origins India. Don't go here unless you have money to burn. I want my suit back.
