t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Seriously, guys. If you haven't been here, you need to go. 

This is a pretty place nestled back in the plaza of Tenaya and Craig. 
We live close to here, so we've been here a lot over the course of 5 years +. We went again on Sunday night with some friends. And we can't ever say enough how this is the best Indian we've had in town. 
We've been all over because we love Indian food. But this is a major staple in Las Vegas. 

The dishes I recommend:

Mixed Tikka Platter - all of the tikka. All of it. 
Tikka Masala - Always one of my favs with chicken. 
Lamb Rogan Josh - we love lamb. And we love curry.
Shrimp Korma - Because you have to throw seafood in the mix.
Chili Chicken - just tried this for the first time and we were floored at how good the flavor was. 

But man, every time we try something else, it's always been amazing. 

When you go,  you have to try the Indian beers. Haywood is our favorite. Also, naan. Garlic naan, plain naan. You can't go wrong with naan. 

They do have a lunch buffet if you're wanting a variety, which is awesome as well.

Always excellent service and food. It will always be a favorite.
