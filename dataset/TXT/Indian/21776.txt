gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw I finally got to try Kabob Korner. I hardly venture downtown, but when I do, I always pass by Kabob Korner and think to myself, "One day I'll try that place". So after a happening afternoon at Vanguard, a group of yelpers and I went here for dinner. The menu, as well as the decor, can be described as none other than eclectic. Along with the gyros, pitas, and rice plates that are to be expected at Mediterranean/Greek establishments, there were a few not so expected finds such as pizza pockets and chicken wings. The decor was interesting as well- grapes hanging from the ceiling, vintage hanging lamps, and gold framed mirrors- quite a collection. Everything felt vintage-y, kind of old...Anyways, back to the food.

Chili Chicken Pita- bright red chicken pieces and bell peppers marinated in a spicy, lemony sauce, lettuce and tomatoes wrapped in a warm, buttery pita and topped w/ a spicy (Sriracha-based) creamy, yogurty dressing. The pita itself was oh-so-amazing. The veggies were fresh. The only thing I wasn't too fond of was the chicken. The chicken was fatty- grease was dripping down onto my plate- and kind of salty. Nonetheless, I did enjoy my food.

The workers are great. The food is pretty good. If you're in that area, make sure to stop by Kabob Korner. With their extensive menu, I'm sure you'll find something you want to eat.
