c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Excellent food! Went with a group so we tried a variety of dishes. 

The naan is extremely fresh and made in store so it's a must try! 

The BBQ chicken, tandoori chicken, chili chicken, and butter chicken were all cooked to perfection. Chili chicken especially came with excellent gravy. 

Although the restaurant looks very simple, it was still a great eat and would definitely return. Price was also very reasonable for the amount of dishes and naan we ordered.
