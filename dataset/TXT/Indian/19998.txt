FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I can't believe there are any reviews that are less than 5 stars for this place. I lived in Madison for a year and I ate at Maharani almost every week, sometimes for multiple meals.

This is my favorite Indian restaurant, and that's saying a lot. My mother grew up in India, and she and her parents agree that it's really excellent.

The lunch buffet is definitely the best time to go. Unlike many of Indian places that I've been, they do a great job of both having a LOT of options and changing them regularly.

The staff is very friendly, and they definitely remember their regulars. I always went with one friend and when he moved, they asked me for updates on how he was doing.

Take-out is great too, as it's usually filling enough to last for multiple meals.
