Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q What a hidden gem! And the Best Shrimp and Grits I have ever had. A nicely seasoned bowl of grits with succulent large shrimp perfectly prepared teamed with a salad is a complete light meal.   Recently redone with a nice bar area. Good happy hour with nice wine selection but the name I think is a bit misleading.
Although they have several Indian items I wouldn't expect the traditional fare.
Nice selection of mixed Asian/Indian/Mexican had to add that as the tres leches cake is something I would go back for.
