-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw Go to place every-time we are in Vegas not for buying groceries but the amazing food (so much like back home) !!!

Definitely best Indian food in Vegas taste-wise, don't go here with high hopes, it's nothing like any Fancy Vegas restaurant.. It's a small family owned restaurant inside a Indian grocery store with delicious food ..

Service is definitely very casual and you may end up standing a counter without no one attending you for minutes but it's all worth the wait if you solely concentrate on the tasty food ..

Try the thali, it's reasonably priced with good option .. In the end, don't forget to try the complimentary free Chai (Tea) ..

Owner - Rani Aunty is the reason we keep going there, the way she takes care of customers & serves food is awesome .. Last time, when we were there, there was no Tea and I asked the girl at Counter and she said that yes we are out of it & no plans to make it again today .. When Aunty came & I was talking to her & casually said to her that we always come & get the tea but you guys are out of it today .. She was like, let me get it prepared right away & Viloa - we have freshly made Tea in 10 mins :)

Regular customer here & will always be until the Tasty food is maintained ..!
