RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg This is the only Indian restaurant actually worth going to. We drive half hour to go there every weekend even though there are many other places close by. Love the south indian stuff, specially the dosa. Quality of food is great. People running the place are friendly, though the wait staff can be  a bit slow. Great overall.
