svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w I recently discovered this gem after living in this neighbourhood for 5 months. I absolutely love this place!! They have some great deals for medu vadas, pakodas and other snacks - 3 for $1 or 10 for $3. South Indian food can't get any more authentic in Toronto. I have had vadas and dosas in Bangalore and this place is as good as some of the snack joints there, though I haven't had a a dosa here yet. I also want to try the mango slushy. I didn't like the ambience but then again it gives a very South Indian feel to the place. You get what you pay for. I can't wait to try out other things on their menu!
