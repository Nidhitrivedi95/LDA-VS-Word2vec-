LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Beware of inaccurate pricing on their website.. I phoned and placed a pick up order for the "Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa." When I went in to pick it up and looked at the receipt, it was a WHOLE $2 more (21% increase) at $11.50 instead of $9.50 as displayed on their website. 

I couldn't really do anything at this point since my order was already made, but I would have chosen a different item if I knew there was such a large price increase. Not sure why they wouldn't update prices on the website since most people placing pick up orders would be referring to those prices..

The dosa itself was alright. However, I chose "Very Mild" and my tongue was already burning after one bite. It seems all those options of less oil, no oil, mild, very mild are probably just a gimmick, and the dosa is made the same way each time regardless of your preferences.
