vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Hands down best Indian food in Montreal for vegetarians. No matter how far away I have ended up living from Pushap I keep coming back here. 

There's a menu but most people just stick with the taly of the day with either the chickpea or lentil talys.  Ordering off the menu generally takes a lot longer to get the food.  If you go with the taly of the day, for about $7 you can get a huge meal (two talys, rice, salad, nan, dessert, and a chana samosa).  Best deal in town. 

Located close to the metro so its easy to get to. 

Service is generally very good. If you don't finish your food, you might get scolded and probably won't get your dessert. The owners are very friendly though and loyal to their repeat customers (I usually get a few extra sweets in my bag or extra helpings of chana samosa). 

A true gem in this city!
