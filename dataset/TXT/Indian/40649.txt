PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw My buddy and I ordered from here through Uber Eats. Our food took almost an hour and a half to get to us, but it was Christmas Day so I won't really dock any points for that. My chicken tikka masala was creamy and reasonably tasty, but the consistency was a bit runny and there was this peculiar egg yolk flavor to the dish that I didn't really care for. The chicken itself was low quality. It was reasonably priced and I was full by the end, but I'll probably look elsewhere next time I'm craving Indian in Phoenix.
