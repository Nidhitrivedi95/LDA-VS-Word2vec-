N1BTJaWnLsCVsJ3I41EPdg SO SO GOOD!!

I was sad I couldn't go to Dishoom in London (the line for dinner was too long and they didn't take reservations). So, when I arrived in Edinburgh by bus around 7am, I waited until Dishoom opened at 8am to grab breakfast, and it was so worth.

I ordered the Bacon Naan Roll and loved it. I didn't expect this combination of ingredients would go so well together.

Dishoom's House Chai is also a must! You also get free refills!! I noticed a few locals who brought there work with them so they could enjoy the Chai at Dishoom, and I would too if I lived in Edinburgh.

I really can't think of anything I didn't like about Dishoom. The food was amazing and very affordable. The service was great. And I loved the interior. I hope to return to a Dishoom soon and try other items on their menu.
