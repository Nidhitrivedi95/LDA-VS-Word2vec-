iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ I make a really long drive just to eat here. Everything is so delicious! It beats any other Hakka restaurant out there, and I've been to a lot. 

Favourites: Hot and sour soup, shrimp fried rice, pakoras, and ginger chicken

The only down side is the restaurant seating and interior, it definitely needs an upgrade.
