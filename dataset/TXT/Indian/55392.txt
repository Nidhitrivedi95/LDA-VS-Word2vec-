X-sqtBx78QDbX8kVbqF-dg We usually go to Dee's for our eyebrows threading. It's lunchtime, plus it's raining hard. So we took shelter at this restaurant. The restaurant was empty, we were the first customers, then slowly it the filled up for lunch.

Being an Indian, I know the food well, therefore I am sadly disappointed with most the food. My mango lassi was perfect. Pani Puri was a let down; not enough vegetables and the sauce was bland, not enough spices. Samosas another letdown, the filling was ok, so I just ate that but the pastry was absorbed by the oil so much. Paneer Pakora, I have no complaints. Parantas (plain))were over cooked and the taste was bitter. Aloo (potato) parantas tasted more ginger than the potato. 

In the other hand, the service was good and super quick.

Honestly, I don't really recommend this place. If you want to go to a small authentic Indian restaurant; I recommend Pushap and Thali (near Concordia).
