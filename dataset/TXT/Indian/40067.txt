pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I feel if someone is from a specific culture they should know what it means to have good food from that culture. I have have been told by more than one person that "The Taj Mahal" is the place to go to get good indian food. 

I don't pretend to be an expert but it's a good sign when you see people from that ethnic background eating at the restaurant. It's usually bad sign if you see too many white boys like me lurking around. 

I can't remember what I ordered when I went here because the menu tends to confuse and never end. It seems they have listed pretty much every possible combination out on their menu but everything is delicious and authentic. You could pretty much order by closing your eyes and just pointing because everything sounds good and from my experience is good.   

The place has gotten a few upgrades in recent months making it seem a little less "hole in the wall" but the food is the same and worth a trip. They have a buffet that they do at lunch I believe which is different, and something I will have to give a try at some point.
