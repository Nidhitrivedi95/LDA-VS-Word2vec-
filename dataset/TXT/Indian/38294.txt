OlJODULZWPGLZP_ntZfSfQ Took food out from this place yesterday and I definitely think it was very good. We had bhindi (okra or ladies finger), daal and a Chana masala curry their rotis and naans were awesome! The rice was a tad undercooked but somehow most Indian restaurants do that. The bhindi was delicious.
