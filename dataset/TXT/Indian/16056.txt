DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Went for the first time after finding this on Yelp. We split some chicken tikka masala and ordered two appetizers: samosa and Gobi 65, thanks to a review by another Yelper. Not so adventurous, but we were short on time. Splitting our entree was a good idea - the portions are very generous. We split the tikka masala, adding an extra dish of rice (which was unnecessary), and we had enough to take home. Even the Gobi 65 appetizer was a generous portion - we took some of this home too. Check out pictures on Yelp to see what our meal looked like.

Everything was delicious, and I loved seeing familiar Nepalese dishes on the menu. I'd like to try some of their Himalayan dishes next time I visit.

The prices are reasonable, and there's a great deal on Groupon that I'm looking forward to buying soon. The staff was great. Our waitress was very kind and patient. I'm sure she would answer any question you have. She also took the time to talk to us and offered to box and bag our leftovers. The manager came around to our table to see how our meal was, too. 

The environment is nice - definitely feels like a hidden treasure. The building's unassuming, and the interior looks like it was used as a Mexican restaurant in a past life. There's a stage in the middle of the restaurant that I'm very curious about.

I'll add more photos the next time I go, which will definitely be soon!
