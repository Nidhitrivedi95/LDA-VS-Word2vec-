yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw As I am writing this for whatever reason the Punjab Pimp Daler Mehndi is thumping in my head " Tunook, Tunook mmm Da Da Da". I first want to mention the extreme politeness I get whenever I call to place a take out order. They, unlike other Indian cuisine restaurants want my business...yours too; and it shows. The menu is very broad which I love. They have full vegan entrees, although I am not close to being vegan I do love alot of vegetable dishes and DHABA has many. The vegetable "meatballs" are outstanding. I have never had a bad meal hear although some of my favorite go-to foods I can find better eleswhere. So everytime I do eat here I get something new. My go to items by the way are Mushroom Matar, Palak paneer and a protein i.e. Lamb, goat or chicken. The dishes here always are fresh, fragrant, plentiful, bright and overall spiced very nice. I prefer VERY HOT food in temperature and they nail it; I prefer my food extremely hot in spice too which they tend to be mellow on for my taste buds. Please, Sir Chef...Go on and hurt me with the magical indian spices, it's ok. If I order a ten it should be blazing!! With all this said DHABA is unique in it's offerings, clean in presentation and overall a pretty good Indian joint!! I will continue to eat there. If you are an employee of ANY INDIAN restaurant in Arizona here me now. You are from the continent ASIA....take a cue from your counterparts and GIVE RICE WITH DISHES FOR FREE. JUST PLAIN WHITE RICE!! I do get irked that this cuisine charges for this plain starch.
