aTRnnM41SxIV-u4rUwceOg Authentic kothu roti ( roti cut into nearly thousand pieces) . We had veggie kothu! Nice and spicy food with a lot of quantity for one person to eat. 

Ambience - pick up only! 
Wait time - 10 to 29 mins

Overall! Super place ! Reminded of chennai for eating roadside foods :)
