B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog Extremely good service! I've been here 2 times before with my bf and we both loved it. One time after finishing a glass of wine, he tried to pour himself more, only to be stopped by the waiter insisting that he does it. Same evening, I asked for a glass of water - it arrived in under a minute, literally. 

Food is good overall. Servings are not too big, but turn out to be quite filling. I always go in ravenous but can't seem to finish everything. 

Ambiance is great - the mood, the professionalism of the staff, and even the washroom is extremely presentable.
