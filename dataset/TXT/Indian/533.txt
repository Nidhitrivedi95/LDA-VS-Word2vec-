-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g It is always a good sign when the ethnicity of 90% of the customers matches the ethnicity of the food being served. This was my experience at Mint Indian Cuisine today. 

I gave the restaurant a four-star rating for the number of options available on the lunch buffet, the flavor and quality of the food, and the overall customer experience. I was very pleased as well at the number of vegetarian and vegan options on the buffet.

The food was tasty, the staff friendly and helpful and the price reasonable. 

While the $11.99 price tag is a little higher than I'd like, the variety of options and quantity of food make it a decent value. If I can have three different flavors for a tad more than I'd pay for one in a non-buffet setting, I see that as a good deal. 

I don't see much difference from my previous visits when the restaurant was under a different name, other than the extremely friendly gentleman that greeted me, showed me the buffet and gave me a seat at the bar.
