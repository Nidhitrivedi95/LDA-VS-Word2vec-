P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag Love the buffet here because of all the clearly labeled vegetarian and vegan options!  The spread during our visit included a salad bar with various hot sauces and chutneys, perhaps half a dozen vegetable/legume/paneer dishes, at least 3 chicken options including Tandoori, Tikka Masala, and Chili Chicken, a Goat Curry, and a breaded and fried fish dish.  Also available were 2 vegetarian soups, multiple bread and rice options, and 2 desserts: Gulab Jamun and Jalebis.  

My favorite dishes were the creamy (vegan!) Navaratna Korma with cauliflower, peas, lima beans, green beans, and potato chunks in a nutty green sauce, as well as the sweet and slightly spicy and sweet Chili Chicken.  A lot of reviews complain about a lack of spice in the spread, but the hot sauces can be used to add heat to any dish.  As an infamous chili head to my friends, I was not disappointed.  

The dining room was pretty empty for lunch on Saturday around noon, and the service was efficient at refilling our water and clearing our plates.  Despite the slightly sketchy outward facade, the venue cute inside with the typical Indian restaurant-style kitschiness.  We will definitely be back for future gorge sessions.
