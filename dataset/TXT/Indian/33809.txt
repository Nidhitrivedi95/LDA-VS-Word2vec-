LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng Couldn't believe how good this place was. My sister dragged me here on a very hot day when I wanted to sit at home. The wait time of 20 mins didn't impress me any further.

Once my chicken 65 and samosa chat arrived, I swayed a bit. The nail in the coffin was the paneer though, creamy, sumptuous and perhaps the best I've had anywhere. We were quite full but had to try the dal makhani, so 20 mins later it sat on our table, and it was as good as we expected.

Loved their cocktails as well, with an indian spin. The mojito was awesome.
