pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Ok this was my fist time going there. from outside coming inside i told myself this place will get 5 stars from me. Once I went in no one came to greet us. As a fist time goer in I was not sure if just sitting anywhere was ok or not. So i thought i will give 4 stars in hopes of seeing change next time when I visit this place. The food was good. Ate maybe few too many calories but i don't feel guilty. Anyway At the end I left tip for the busser. I paid and also left tip on the table for the busser. As i was exiting i saw the owner's wife taking the tip from the table. The restaurant is busy $5 will not make anyone rich yet don't understand why the hell she had to take the tip that was clearly meant for the worker not the owner. Very disappointed.
