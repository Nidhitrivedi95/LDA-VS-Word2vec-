Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA Came here for brunch on a Saturday with my partner. 

Let me start by saying our server was excellent. Attentive but not intrusive. 
The food, however, was mediocre at best. 

The Bristol's website brunch menu and actual menu were different. I had planned to order one of the salads that was on the online menu (which happened to be on the online and "actual" dinner menu as well), but unfortunately for whatever reason they could not accommodate. 

We ordered the steak dish and eggs benny. Neither were particularly good...

The steak was tough and overdone. I could not cut, nor chew, it. The eggs that came with the dish were over cooked as well. The salad dressing (which came with the side salad) tasted like raw garlic. Both the steak and Benny dishes needed salt.

I wanted to live this place. The online menu looked promising, and the service was great... But I just can't get past the food, which was terrible... Sorry, but I won't be back.
