PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA I took the suggestions and had the dosa masala. I also added some vegetable pakoras, and they were all very good.  Very tasty, well prepared, very much worth the price. 

I like to judge ethnic food by how many people of that ethnicity are actually present at the restaurant when I am there eating.  Its safe to say that the Indian community is well aware of India Masala and are pleased with the food that is presented there.  That to me, is a sign of a winner.
