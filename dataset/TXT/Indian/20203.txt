fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Always delicious food! My only complaint is that they do lack customer service. They don't know how to greet customers. Oftentimes they might forget to give you the naan bread (which is delicious!!). And they don't refill your water as fast as you would like, so sometimes you have to flag them down. Other times, they are pretty good about tending to you. 

In Markham, sometimes you pretty much expect a lack of customer service. All in all, I do go back there often and will continue to. They have great food and fair prices.
