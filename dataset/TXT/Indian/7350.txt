5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q I ordered some chicken curry from here through grub hub. The to-go order arrived without the rice... also no plastic utensils were provided. Eating curry with no rice and with your fingers is no fun!!!!

Grub hub tried to rectify the situation but the curry house was very unapologetic. They said rice was not necessarily included even though it says so on the menu. This place gets two stars because the curry tasted good even though i was forced to eat it like an animal.
