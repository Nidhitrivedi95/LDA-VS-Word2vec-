ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Been here a couple of time for the lunch buffet and for dinner. Always satisfying food and very friendly staff. Most recently I had Lamb Shank Curry as my entree. The aroma's of the spices/dishes contributes substantially to the flavor and all around experience of your meal. The prices are reasonable, and I will return,
