ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Mmmm mmm good! I was going through Yelp reviews yesterday looking for a good Indian restaurant and today a Groupon for Angara popped up. Decided with the 4 out of 5 star rating and great Groupon deal that I had to check it out. 

First off I absolutely love the decor. Elegant, clean and peaceful. Secondly the l service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, kind and knowledgable. And the food? Delicious. Been missing good Indian food since I moved out to Vegas. 

I had never heard of Handi Chicken before but I'm glad we gave it a try. Fresh onions, bell peppers and chicken mixed with a delicious ginger garlic sauce. Just yummy. We also had to get the staple Chicken Tikka Masala and it was exactly how I like it. Not too sweet like I've had at some places. The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfectly creamy. Combined with the Garlic Naan and basmati rice I was simply in heaven. Oh and the hubby got a glass of the mango lassi that I ended up drinking half of because it was too good to stop. Lol sharing is caring. 

I absolutely loved the food and can't wait to try out their lunch buffet. I hear the selection of food at their buffet is not something to pass up.
