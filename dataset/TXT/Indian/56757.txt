xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw They should call this place "The Soup Nazi" because its exactly like that episode of Seinfeld. The stew and frybread are amazing but the service is F-ing horrid. It almost seems like they intentionally hire the rudest, grumpiest people to work the register. The frybread is a good size and made to perfection but the "bowl" of stew is more like a cup of stew....the portion they give you is OK for my 4 year old but not a grown man. The taco is good but they charge the heck out of your wallet for additional toppings...lettuce, onions, tomatoes etc. Its a good place to eat if you enjoy being frowned upon by staff and treated sub human! :)
