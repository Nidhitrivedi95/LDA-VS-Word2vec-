-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Kinda have some mixed feelings about this place. The wait was long and they took like forever to take down our order. To be honest they are not at all organized and I saw only one person taking down the orders and the other delivering it to the table. So I wasn't expecting good service. If anyone knows udipi cuisine, they would know how good is the Sambhar with its sweet notes. But the Sambhar was way too sweet. And the Avial was like the Thai green curry and it was OK. The only good part was the Dosa and Uthappam. Dining in this restaurant basically a YMMV experience.
