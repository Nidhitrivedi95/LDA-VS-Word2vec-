Pair that with Garlic Naan and you are in for an otherworldly experience in your mouth. Oh-- and the Chicken Tandoori. Oh my!  We've been here four times in the last six weeks since discovering it because we literally crave this awesome food. The waiter who serves us is always the same guy--very friendly and always eager to get whatever you need. The spices are amazing and a multi-dimensional experience. This must be a family-owned business... I just get that sense because there really seems to be a pride of ownership both with the food preparation / presentation as well as the service.  I simply don't think Indian food can get better than this! I used to think Thai food was my favorite... Not anymore!
