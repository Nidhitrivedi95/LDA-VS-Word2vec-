TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I took my cousin to try this place as she had never had indian before and was interested in trying it. She loved it! We ordered the chicken tikka and a lamb vindaloo. Both were excellent, but the chicken tikka was amazing. I was pleasantly surprised to see my old friend Vimil (Vick) working here now. He took great care of us. I love the location of this place, right next door to my favorite gay bar. I need to go back to try the lunch buffet. 

If you love indian food or have never tried it, I highly recommend this place. Ask for Vick and he will help you figure out what to order.
