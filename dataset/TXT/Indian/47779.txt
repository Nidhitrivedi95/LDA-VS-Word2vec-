TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw India Palace just doesn't stack up to the other lunch buffets in town.

The decor is nice. (Misti mentioned MTV India on the TV, which is really cool!) The buffet selection can be more interesting than our perennial favorite, Mint. And having samosa on the buffet is always nice. But the service was sketchy and the flavors felt diluted compared to Mint or Mt. Everest.

I would really love to find a truly great Indian lunch buffet in town but this just isn't it.
