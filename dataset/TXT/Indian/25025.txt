H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ Best Indian food and prices reasonable. We used a Groupon.  Amazing Gobi Manchurian, had the Paneer  Butter Masala (Delish) & Baingain Bhartha.  All were equally good.  When I thought of taking a picture, I had eaten all the food.  Beer was a little pricey. I read previous reviews of the service, we had a very good experience, our servers were very prompt and courteous, food came out super fast.  We did get there at around 6:00pm on a Friday, it wasn't busy.  I will definitely come back to this place, fantastic food. Yum!!!!!
