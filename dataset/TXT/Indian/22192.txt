GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw The food is average here but this restaurant has very bad service. It's run by un professional staff.. I wish I could give a rating below one star.. I went with family here on Memorial Day weekend. I entered the restaurant at 955pm gave order by 1005pm and was served food at 1110 pm.. Had to wait more than an hour for the food of just 2 dishes.. Had to several times go and ask the staff for my order. And just when I was about to leave they got my order. The food was ok but by that time mood was ruined. N to put icing on the cake they charged us with some dish which we didn't order..
Please avoid this restaurant and go someplace else if you don't want to ruin your evening..
