OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Service wasn't so great, but the food was good.  Madras chicken was nice and spicy but not too hot.  The onion naan was very good also.  The saag paneer was very good too.  My wife liked her chicken tikka masala as well.  very small place - make sure you have a reservation for a table unless you want to sit on cushions on the floor.
