pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Three of us went for the buffet on a Saturday evening around 7 pm.  We waited for about 10 minutes in the foyer-area and were then quickly seated.  Taking the advice of other yelpers, we all decided to have the buffet and weren't disappointed in the least. There were many choices, both vegetarian and meat, from which to choose, including soups and desserts.  Naturally, some dishes are spicier than others, which makes for a nice treat for someone who like hot and spicy food.  While my companions were able to try nearly everything on the buffet, there were a few items that I was just too full to eat. (Next time!)

Over the course of the hour or so that we spent in the restaurant, I noticed that buffet items were constantly being replenished by the kitchen staff.  (This, I suppose, explains why all of the dishes I tried tasted fresh.)  My only complaint is that it took quite some time to order a glass of wine from the fully stocked bar.  The waitstaff seemed more interested in seating people than waiting tables, so I'm not sure how easy it would be to order off the regular menu on a busy evening.

Overall, it was a really enjoyable and delicious meal.  I'll definitely return for the buffet again.

TIP: You pay the gentleman sitting at the bar in the front of the restaurant, not your waiter.
