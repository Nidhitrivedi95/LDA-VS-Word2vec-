RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg There were empty seats and it took 40 minutes to get drinks and we weren't even able to order food. We kept asking if we could order and they kept telling us the kitchen was too backed up for us to order--but there were a ton of empty tables! An hour and a half later we decided to call it quits and just get the check. It seemed like they were prioritizing take out orders to dine in orders. Worst restaurant experience in my life.
