I recommend going here for lunch over dinner, because you get a better deal for the price. Dinner gets a little expensive. Venue is one of those interesting houses on east bvd...with a nice outdoor seating area. Great atmosphere on the inside, nice authentic servers, and interesting music throughout your experience there. Think I heard some club music once...but hey it got you ready to eat some naan and rice. 

They have traditional and modern options on the menu. I stick to the traditional dishes, which is pick a sauce with a protein. You get soup or salad with that, as well as much rice and naan you could possibly eat. Having tried all of the sauces, which are all good, my favorite two are the tikka Masala and the vin d' alho (spicier dish). If it's your first time try the tikka masala, the sauce is unbelievable. You won't want to stop eating it...especially when you dip your naan in there. I make sure I make it there at least once a month...sometimes more. Trust me you'll love it.
