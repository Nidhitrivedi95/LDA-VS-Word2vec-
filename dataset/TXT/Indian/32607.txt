LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA WHAT TO TRY??

Their dosas!! This is my second time here and I love their dosas. 

What appears as a light meal...actually might not be true, my friend. The aloo masala or their potato is actually quite filling. So before you decide to order any appetizers, I suggest you finish your dosa first and decide if you can eat more. 

Each dosa comes with three chutneys and a sambhar all for dipping your dosa. Being known across the board by Indians as being one of the best places to have vegetarian dosas, this is definitely a place you don't want to miss out. There's always a line waiting, tables consistently have reservation plates on the tables and the restaurant is already bustling with people right when they open. 

The taste is very flavourful and if you like spicy, the dosas can definitely be very spicy. The dosas are huge and if you get the paper one, it's extra big and extra crispy. Lots of filling in each dosa and very filling for lunch and for dinner. 

LAST TIP??!

If you want to try the dosa the first time, the garlic dosa with aloo masala is a good choice. When you have more friends with you or if you come again next time, you can try the other ones too! Make reservations!!! Because if you don't, expect to wait in line then!
