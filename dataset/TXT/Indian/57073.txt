xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw If anyone comes to Arizona, what should you try? Fry bread!

At least that's what everyone tells me since I am from California.

Since I already had dinner, I went for the chocolate and butter fry bread.

It's big and be careful when you carry it because you might drop it!!! At least that's what my sister almost did -- what would I have done if the fry bread fell to the ground? :( Probably eat it off the ground! 

So I took a bite into this. My first reaction: Why is this salty? So I was thrown off by the saltiness of it. Some people might think the chocolate and salt compliment each other but I didn't feel it. I love the chocolate on it. 

When you're on a diet, never go to any fry bread house. There's swarms of oil dripping from the fry bread. 

And please share it with your guest. Do not eat one by yourself. 

Overall, it's decent but I wasn't the biggest fan because I didn't like the saltiness of it. (I love chocolate though!)
