cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw Being a big fan of Indian food, and having eaten at almost all of the Indian restaurants in the GTA, I have no doubts in saying that this place is a mother of all.. literally all!  :) 

This is not really a fancy place to dine, but end of day what really matters is the food we get, and i have to acknowledge this is the best ever India food you could ever taste. Almost all of the BBQ dishes are amazingly delicious, Lamb/chicken biryani is a must have. Yummyyy! .. and all the curry's with naan are a delight .. so to sum to all .. FIVE BIG STARS !!
