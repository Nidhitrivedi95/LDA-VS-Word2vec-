iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Coming from surrey (suburb of Vancouver bc) I know good East Indian food. This place is very very good! Up to standard in my books. Last time we ate here we got take out but we decided to eat in this time. We didn't have to wait for a table but it was very busy which was a good sign. Food came out fast and hot. It was fun to see our food being prepared in non-enclosed kitchen. I would have given the place 5 starts but for me the prices were on the high side from what I am used to paying for Indian food (I think the prices are high because it's in paradise valley). I also think you get a larger portion for take out. Will order again but will be take out this time.
