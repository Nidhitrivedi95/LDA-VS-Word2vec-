h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Great authentic South Indian food.  There is a great variety of choices and the lunch buffets are awesome! The dosas are great and the malai kofta is probably the best in the valley.
The only thing put of place is the fact that Hindi music is played there instead of Tamil music. That would be like going to an Italian restaurant that played German music..
