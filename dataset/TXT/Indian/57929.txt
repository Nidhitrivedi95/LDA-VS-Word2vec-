yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Terrible Customer Service! Two hours late delivering my food and they refused to cancel the order.  The person who answered the phone kept telling me the food would be there in 45 minutes after I waited for an hour even though I was asking to cancel the order. They refused to give me their name and they refused to give me my money back. Then! Worse! They refused to let me pick up my order instead!! I am furious! There are dozens and dozens of Indian restaurants in the Tempe/Phoenix area. The Dhaba will not be seeing me again, and I will tell everyone this story. Spend your money at one of the courteous Indian restaurants instead.
