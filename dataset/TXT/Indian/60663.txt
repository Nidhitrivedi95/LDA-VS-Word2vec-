zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Amazing.  I am afghan too and can cook all these so it's hard to impress our family with traditional good. this place is the only authentic food I go for. And not to mention very reasonable prices. As long as you make it there before 8. We just moved to AZ and so glad to find this place.
