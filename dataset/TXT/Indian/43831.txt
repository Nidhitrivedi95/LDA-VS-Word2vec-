RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg don't get me wrong--i absolutely love this place.however, my only complaint is the same thing someone else mentioned: the service. true, there are worse things than overly-attentive service, but when you've got 12 different guys coming up to your table literally every three minutes to fill your nearly-full glass of water or take away silverware you're not done with, it gets really annoying. i know, i know, it could be worse, service-wise, but it's...well...annoying. 

that said, the food is excellent, and right on par with what you'd find in bigger cities. i've never had a meal here and come away disappointed. plus, with them having handed out 15% reusable discount cards, who wouldn't be pleased? hell, just writing about it makes me want to go ;)
