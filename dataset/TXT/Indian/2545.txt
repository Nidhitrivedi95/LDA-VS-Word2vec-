02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ A friend invited me to the buffet they have here for our birthday. Unfortunately it ended 2 minutes after we walked in the door at 4:30pm.
So we opted for 2 complete dinner. It was allot of food, which I enjoyed for work the next day.
Everything was delicious with the exception of some tough as nails plant in a very bitter/chemical like sauce. They should drop that item from the menu. It was just a small side dish and might be preferred by some, but I'd only serve it to people that ask for it.
The Tandoori Chicken was outstanding along with the Shrimp Masal we had. Honestly, I would have been happy just eating the sauce. 
All in all it was very good. I will go there again. I would recommend they serve their buffet a little later and they might get more just after work customers.

PS: They have some lovely Indian beers to enjoy. Try one.
