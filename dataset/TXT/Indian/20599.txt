The food is absolutely delicious and is the main selling point; this is the tastiest Indian restaurant food I have had in the US. The service is great, although sometimes slow. Portions are generous and the price is extremely reasonable. They even give you a papad with chutney for free while you are waiting!

There is one complaint I have, however; I almost changed my rating to 4 because of this. I have written this elsewhere before, so I'm copying and pasting: They serve rice with almost every dish and do not allow substitutions. To be fair, this appears to be the general practice in all Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh that I've been to; this is remarkably pointless and inauthentic. It makes absolutely no sense to serve rice with a majority of the dishes on the menu, especially the dry dishes. If you work at Bangal Kabab and you are reading this, I sincerely suggest that you allow your customers to replace the rice with some basic butter naan. If that is too expensive for you, at least include an option to upgrade the rice to naan for a small price.
