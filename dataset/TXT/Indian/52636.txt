uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ I have eaten here numerous times and the food and service has always been great. This has to be the best or one of the best Indian restaurants in the city. Its very well designed and decorated and very clean.  It's a 2 minute walk from Chester Subway and Green P parking on Chester.
