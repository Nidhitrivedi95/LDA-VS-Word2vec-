gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I LOVE this place!  I've eaten here many times and they've never disappointed.  The food is delicious - I almost always get the chicken tikka masala, but the chicken tandoori is to die for (spicy without being too much), and the naan (I've had garlic and regular) is fabulous.  Really, all the food I've had here has been excellent!

I also love their lunch buffet.  It's a good deal at $10.99, and there is always great variety.  I've been able to try many things that I would have never ordered (goat curry - yum!) but there are also always some of my favorites.  Their dinner menu is reasonably priced (especially with a Groupon) but the lunch buffet is definitely the deal to get if you're in the area at lunch time.

The first time I went the location was a little scary - it's on the corner next to a gas station and Mariana's supermarket and the outside is not super bright.  I was a little nervous, but as soon as I stepped inside I felt much better.  It is a cute place - tablecloths on the tables, well lit (not bright but definitely not "shady"), and the people are SO nice.  I've always had excellent service - definitely the nicest servers I've had in a long time!

I definitely highly recommend Mt. Everest!
