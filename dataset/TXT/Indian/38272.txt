oKDzHRuV3bYNE3LUAXuv5w While in Edinburgh on holiday, I went on a curry tour. See, I eat spicy food like you breathe air. Back home, I get my take-away and add both Habaneros and Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce before I eat it. My spice tolerance is ridiculously high. I've also eaten curry on three separate continents, so I know my curries pretty well. So, I picked a different Indian joint each night and went on a search for the most flavorful and spiciest curry.

I came onto this place midway through my adventure. It is very much a diner-style Indian restaurant with a VERY casual, laid-back atmosphere. It is family run - the father in charge did most of the translating to the staff that prepared and served my food. There wasn't a vegan-friendly Vindaloo on the menu but there were several meat-based Vindaloos, so I asked if it would be possible to order a Vegetable Vindaloo. The father quickly assured me that would be okay so I ordered it extra spicy with Rice and Chapati. 

Now.... I don't want to gripe. The prices here were VERY cheap, and the food was flavorful as anyone could ever hope for. Seriously. But, what I ate wasn't a vindaloo. I wonder if maybe the chef just made me a Vegetable Curry instead and hoped I didn't know better? So, It was very delicious and I won't complain about that. But it wasn't spicy and it wasn't a Vindaloo.

Luckily I brought along three Thai Chile Peppers to spice it up.

Of course, Thai Chile Peppers to ME are about as spicy as cinnamon to most people. But still, it definitely helped bring out the inherent and distinct flavors of the dish. So, the food wasn't spicy but I'd come again just because of the place's affordability and their willingness to accommodate customer wishes. Good on you, mates!
