The Trini lady at Coconut Grove made me a wonderful stewfish roti, and carefully packed it up for my trip to the airport.  She helped me figure out what would be tasty and easy to eat on the plane and was careful to make sure I was familiar with Trini hot sauce before she dosed it.
The place was very clean. The customers were charming.
Roti wrap was fresh and tasty.  Stewfish was a nice sea bass that had itself been lightly breaded and sauced. Potato, lentil and other nice things  made it a very good roti.
People in the airport lounge looked at me enviously as I ate it.

Also, great selection of sweets and Carib beverages.
