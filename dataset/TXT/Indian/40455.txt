PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA I'm really not sure if I was eating the same food as everyone else leaving reviews? Or maybe they haven't had good Indian food? Heck it wouldn't even of been good on non-ethnic levels. The food was all equal amounts of disgusting and/or bland. The chicken tikki masala was extremely dry and had a sour taste to it, I hope it won't make me sick later.  I honestly don't have anything nice to say other than the staff was friendly, and the place looked clean.
So I'm sorry to say, but I will never come back here again.
