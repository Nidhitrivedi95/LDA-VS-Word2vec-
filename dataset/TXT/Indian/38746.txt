OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We didn't know that they start serving dinner at 6PM. We showed up around 4PM and yet the owner opened their doors for us. 

The chef came out to meet us and have a good conversation with us. How often does that happen when you go to a restaurant? 

My daughter loved the mango drink and shrimps so much and they gave her a little extra when we asked for refills. That was a nice touch to make a small person very happy!

The foods were delicious! It was my first time to eat Indian foods and it really left a great impression on me.

We will come back for sure!
