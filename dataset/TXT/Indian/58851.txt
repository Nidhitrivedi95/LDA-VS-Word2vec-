YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA Totally disappointing.  Went for buffet dinner on a Sunday night.  Have had better dishes in a food court.  Samosa and pakoras were soggy and did not seem freshly made.  Most of the buffet items were full of sauce and you had to search to find any meat in the butter chicken or curry chicken.  All of it was very bland and one note.  No love in the food here! And agree with other comments, something too sweet in some of the dishes.  Very utilitarian food so cannot recommend and won't be back.  Side note, something didn't agree with me or my dinner partner either afterwards!
