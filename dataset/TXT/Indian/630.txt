-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q I used to go to the Mirch Masala on the square very often for a good chicken tikka. They have moved to this location since then, located above the well known bubble tea shop on state street.

They have a pretty good generic Indian dining menu which is expected. From the popular tikka, tandoori, samosas, pakoras to any "curry" dishes that people like.

However, they do a $9.95 buffet supposedly 7 days a week. I went there for Sunday lunch and was offered that or a regular menu and decided to try the buffet. The buffet selection was decently sized with a number of good selections for both vegetarians and meat lovers. There were soup, samosas, pakoras, 3 vegetarian curry dishes, goat and chicken options, tandoori chicken, rice and nan. Bonus is the the selections of chutney and also papadum! Also if you are into Indian sweets, there are the classics as well! Very good value and tasty food at the same time, will definitely come back again!
