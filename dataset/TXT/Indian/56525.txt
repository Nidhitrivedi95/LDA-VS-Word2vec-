xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw New favorite! I'm so glad it exists, because the food alone would make this place amazing, but the owner boosts the good feelings even more! We ordered ahead for take out (gave ourselves 40 minutes, strong recommendation if you want take out.)

Things I loved:
-- THE FOOD: We ordered aloo paratha, shahi paneer, kadhi pakora, and samosas. The shahi paneer lives up to its name: Shahi means royal, and the sauce was perfect. The aloo paratha melted in the mouth. The samosas were the perfect amount of spice, without being overly greasy as samosas that sit under a heat lamp would be.

-- The preparation: The owner mentioned with pride, nothing is frozen and everything is fresh made. It's noticeable, because the sauces were like the ones my friends used to make, fresh where every bit of spice is noticeable. The samosas were not frozen then re-heated. Even the rice was just cooked!

-- The Owner! He is so friendly, and came out to sit with us when we waited 5 min for the rice to finish cooking. He brought out veg pakoras and chatted with us about how he started Tiffin, and adventures in cooking. He didn't have to bring out the pakoras (WHICH WERE AMAZING, Great ratio of potato and onions). He didn't have to sit with us and get to know us. He didn't have to tell us his stories in a kindly, fatherly manner that made us feel at home. But he did!

Things I did not love:
-- Trying to find it, the store sign needs to be a little bigger, but that's no reason to take a star off! They've just opened. 

-- The location is kind of weird (although conveniently off of 480!) and I can't believe someone took a star off for it.
