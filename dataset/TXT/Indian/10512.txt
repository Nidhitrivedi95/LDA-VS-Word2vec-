9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw This place cut off the protein pinnacle of the food pyramid to make a depressing food trapezoid. 

Pros:
Wide selection of vegetarian options... including the meat ones.
There is adequate butter in the butter chicken. 
Within walking distance to better burritoed food options.

Cons:
Poverty protein will catabolize your heard earned gains.
Made to order = long waits, stiff vegetables.
Spicy scale depends on how you're racially profiled. Can vary from Michael Cera harmless to subcontinent fury.
The bright signage keeps me up at night.
