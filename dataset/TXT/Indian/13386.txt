bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Worst service ever received in entire Canada... I am a big time foodie and love to try different places. This place was so disappointing. 

I went there with a friend and we were starving so badly. We visited it for the first time by checking reviews like 5 stars so it's obvious that we expected more but it was not good at all. We reached there 45 mins before it closes and they already started cleaning the place. The waitress was not even welcoming us and we felt so bad but had no option so wanted to atleast try the food. We ordered couple of items which were Luke warm as if they prepared it a while ago. The waitress wanted us to leave before we started our food. Even though we mentioned we want it spicy they made it sweet which was unacceptable. The behaviour was so bad and they were mopping the floor which smelled so bad that we couldn't even finish our dinner. 

I never gave bad review for any place but yes this is the place which I would never ever recommend to anyone.
