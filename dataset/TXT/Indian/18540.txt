The rice tasted stale and the tandoori chicken.....man, I don't know what was going on with that but I couldn't stomach more than one bite. The chicken in the other dishes were hard/overcooked. The naan was pretty substandard, as well. They only good food item they had was the dessert rice pudding.

I really wanted to like this place and I would have given it another chance had the lady asking for my feedback at the register handled it appropriately
