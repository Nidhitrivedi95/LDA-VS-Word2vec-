They just instituted a $15 minimum on credit cards which is going to cut down on future visits. Lunch buffet with a lassi comes to about $14.50 - already a splurge for lunch. They made an exception for me since I didn't have cash. But I don't like to hassle about if I have cash on hand before going out, and there are plenty of other restaurants that aren't going to fuss over a credit card. I'll probably head to Udipi instead when I'm feeling like something vegetarian and Indian. They don't have a buffet, but I dare you to try and finish an entire lunch there!
