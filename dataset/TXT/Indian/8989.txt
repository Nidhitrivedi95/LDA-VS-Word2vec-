82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA OK, the last night in Montreal we were exhausted and wanted to eat nearby.  We couldn't decide where to eat so we tried Le Taj on the theory we wouldn't eat as much- boy were we wrong.  We started with the Salad Katchumba,  which was very large so it was a good thing we split it.  I ordered the Chicken Korma and it was outstanding, as good as our favorite restaurant.  My Husband ordered the Lamb Vindaloo which was SO hot.  I tried it but it was too much for me.  My Husband, however, loves hot food and he really liked it.  I had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which paired perfectly with the spicing of the meal. For dessert I had the Halwa "cake".  It was nothing I expected, texture was sort of like couscous, but the flavor was outstanding.  The tab was $92 and worth every penny as the meal was outstanding.
