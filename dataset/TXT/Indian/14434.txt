C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA How do I love Toronto? Let me count the ways. French bistros with German names in Little Italy serving crisp, dal puri thin-crust pizzas; Nanettes - personal-pizza-sized naan-bread-pizzas; wild mushrooms cavorting in flagrante delicto with thyme in a risotto of dreams. 

No, wait, that's all in just one Toronto restaurant. 

I was introduced to Kalendar by my poet friend Flanagan. Have returned many times with my wife who develops cravings for the dal-puri pizza from time to time. Just celebrated my baby girl's 16th birthday there. Go! Buono appetito!
