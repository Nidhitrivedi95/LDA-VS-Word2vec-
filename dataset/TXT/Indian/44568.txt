ry_c9N_E4zmB3VlyLDE26Q Great value for money at this restaurant. I'm not sure if they still do this but they used to have an indian dancer in the restaurant at the weekend. V. good food but the surroundings are a bit dated and the location is not the best. Not somewhere that i would travel a distance to visit nut used to stay close by and as a local curry house was definitely worth visiting
