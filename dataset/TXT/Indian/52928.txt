v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug We came here looking at 3 star rating and no expectations. We ordered both vegetarian and non veg starters, tandoori rotis, chicken curry, malai kofta and mango lassi. Everything was really good. 3 stars for the ambience. But food was one of the best here in Pittsburgh. I would definitely come here again!
