DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ We went today for the lunch buffet and tried a little of each dish.  Every one was delicious!  The naan was the best I've ever had, it was so fresh and warm.  Although I'm not a vegetarian, I easily could become one with the variety of vegetable dishes on the buffet.  My favorite was the chana saag (creamy spinach and chickpeas).  We were impressed with the curries, none of them was too overpowering, they had just the right amount of flavor and spiciness.  The mango pudding was heavenly, creamy and not overpowering.  We will definitely be back for the lunch buffet and we want to come back for dinner sometime.
