J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Best Indian buffet I have ever had. It's got some spice to it and the food is always hot. You can hear the water boiling inside the steam table.

I love their mango salad...slightly underripe mangoes sliced thin and tossed with shredded green leaf lettuce and a light sweet dressing.

Their spinach is incredible...it is cooked until it has totally fallen apart but it still has its color. Their yellow daal reminds me of paripou, the staple curry in Sri Lanka.

There is always fresh fruit, lots of salads, and various flavors of scoop your own ice cream...including mango!

Hubs loved the gulab jamun. They were springy, not mushy.

Great food all around.
