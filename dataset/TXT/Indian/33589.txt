Firstly when we arrived it was unclear whether we should wait to be seated or just sit down where there was a table available. We decided to wait to be seated..whilst we waited several frantic members of staff rushed by us without acknowledging we were there. During our wait one member of staff brought us a bill, we hadn't even seen a menu!
So we were seated, and given some menus, our order was taken and our food came very quickly (less than 10 minutes after we ordered) and before our drinks. The food was very good, very tasty and great for sharing. 
The main reason why I only gave it three stars was the service. This place obviously lacks structure and organisation. It was all very chaotic and each member of staff seemed to be rushing about but not doing very much (tables were left uncleared for a long time). It was quite busy so was very noisey when we arrived, which in turn gave me a headache and made it quite difficult to hold a conversation. 
I would like to go back, and I really hope the second time that the service meets the standards of the food, if it doesn't I don't think I will return a third time. 
P.S This place is a B.Y.O.B and have a very limited soft drinks menu so even if you aren't drinking I'd recommend taking your own saft drinks.
