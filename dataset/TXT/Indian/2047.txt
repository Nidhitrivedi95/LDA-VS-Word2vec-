_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg Love the buffet.  I'm a lover of their butter chicken.  Took my coworkers here and they are from India.  Their response was-  ok food reasonably priced.  I go for the butter chicken.  They could make the buffet filled with food because they seem to run out of food really quick here.  Love their Indian market...
