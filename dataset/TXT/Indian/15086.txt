CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw One of the better Indian places on King St. W. Really soft naan, flavourful curries, and the saag paneer doesn't skimp on the paneer like at other restaurants. But service has been consistently abrupt the last 2 times I've been here. They seem irritated if you don't order wine or a lot of appetizers and just kind of plop the dishes down in front of you without saying anything.
