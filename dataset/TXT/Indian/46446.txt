SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Really delicious food and great staff.  The soups are actually tiny (and by tiny i really mean it), but tasty. And quite enough for a starter just before the tasty veggie courses ( sorry - vegetarian here, so i tried only those options). The neighborhood is not the best but the restaurant is really close to Las Vegas blvd. 
Overall is a good place to eat with indian beer :)
