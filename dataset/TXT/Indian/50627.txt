UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Super good. Ordered a chicken korma combo at dinner - came with potato curry, Dahl, rice, pakora, naan, papadam, and rice pudding. 14.99 for dinner and it was a HUGE portion. Everything was fresh - good spice. Really really recommend it. Service was quick- and they had my take out order made and packed up in under 10 minutes. This is my Indian spot from now on!
