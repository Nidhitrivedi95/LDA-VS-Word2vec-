iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Me and my wife couldn't believe it when we first heard about this place because when someone says a burrito the first thing that comes to mind is Mexican. We ordered Chicken and Lamb burritos, while we were waiting we ordered Masala fries and Mango Lassi. The masala fries unique (made us remember Indian street foods) and the Mango Lassi was a disaster as it tasted like it was made out of spoiled yogurt. Out of the two burritos, we realy liked lamb and chicken was sub-par. 

Bottom Line: Its a unique way of eating Indian food and you can give it a shot, if you like it then it might be your go to place instead of Chipotle.
