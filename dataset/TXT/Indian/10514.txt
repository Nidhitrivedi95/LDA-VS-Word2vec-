9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw I am on a butter chicken phase and had been trying a lot of different butter chicken roti's downtown but this is by far the best I have been to. Recommend their signature butter chicken, it's delicious, their spiciness level is the real deal, and the portions are appropriate. Highly recommend it if you're an avid butter chicken fan!
