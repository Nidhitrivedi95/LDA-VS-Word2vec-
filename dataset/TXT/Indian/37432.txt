OAmRh1fSiTgtR1e0D4JsVQ Good place to get fresh and quick Indian food.
Very few places serve this authentic Indian in reasonable price and fast service.
However, I would like to suggest them a couple of things

1. Chola Poori combo - Poori is  too less for the quantity of mix veg and chana masala 
Will be good, if they serve bigger poori or 3 pooris

2.Butter chicken and spicy chicken combo is okay.
Should give more quantity of sauce on the rice.

3. I tried their new introductory dish Chicken Biryani which is flavoured meat rice.
I would suggest them to increase the quantity of the rice they give. $9.03 should get you sufficient amount of rice to fill you up .

Tandoori chicken looks yummy, I am going to try it next time.

Overall, this is a good place to have a quick delicious treat.
I would go back here.
