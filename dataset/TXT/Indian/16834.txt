DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg This used to be my favorite Indian restaurant. My sweetie and I would go sometimes as often as once a week (once we hit them three times in seven days). We've tried a sizesble portion of the menu and have loved all of it. I do food somewhat spicy, he does food spicier than I (but not Thai hot), and their food fit the bill perfectly for spice level. The staff were friendly, water glasses kept full. Excellent.

Two weeks ago, I went with my young son and ordered muter paneer bland for him and vegetable manchurian for myself -- two of my favorites.

Both dishes were hotter than anything I've ever eaten there. My son just ate plain rice. My stomach burned for a couple of hours. The waitstaff didn't come over to check on us. When we were finally able to flag her down, she apologized, comped his meal, asked if he wanted something else (no).

Went tonight with my beau. Got those same two dishes, and again, they were painfully hot. Noses running, eyes watering, not at all enjoyable. Definitely not eating the leftovers for lunch (as per our usual plan). Mr. I Like It Spicy agreed that the food was uncomfortably hot.

Again, no attention to the table between food being dropped off and the check being tossed onto the table.

The difference was stark enough that I wonder if they changed hands, or if a new person is making decisions, because it ain't the old Udupi, for sure.

Maybe it'll change back, but I won't be there to find out.
