KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA The best authentic karahi chicken I have had in GTA. I have been there twice in the last one month and had food catered for my small get together. In- restaurant atmosphere is basic design,but the food makes up for it...catering experience was outstanding, arrived on time! Infact I got a call when the food left their premises.
We have tried their seekh Kabab, their new entry dhaha Kabab, karahi chicken, both with and without bone, and daal. All delicious. Biryani leaves something to be desired.
