Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A The worst restaurant I ever been in my life, I went there in 2012 the owner is a miser even for a paper plate, at that time the place was like a devil house and owner used to charge money even for extra paper plate. I asked him for an extra paper plate and that owner told me that I need to pay a dollar for that. The food was worst and it smelled like hell. See how crazy he was and later I went last month and I thought he changed but he didn't actually I ordered chat and asked him to make it hot, he replied me back that they won't make the items hot. Man I been in almost 7 countries and went many restaurants all over the world but I never had the worst food and worst hospitality to a customer like this, please friends better avoid to go there.
