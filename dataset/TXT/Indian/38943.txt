OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Food is authentic and on point...reminded me of family gatherings at my grandmothers house.  Jose made some really good cocktails...my wife is super picky and she gave him a flavor profile she liked and he whipped up some purple concoction that she like so much, she had a 2nd one.  Our server Ed was great and attentive.  We had a 6p reservation with a group of 6 but as we were leaving around 8, you could see some tables waiting quite some time for service.  It looked like there were only 2 servers for the whole place, and it was 80% full.  I'll definitely be back but would encourage the owners to fix their service/staffing issues as even really good food can't overcome poor service.
