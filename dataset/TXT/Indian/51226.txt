utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw We went for the buffet on a Sunday morning, and are so glad we decided to give it a try!  My husband's favorite is Chicken Tikka Massala - which they had on the buffet.  I'm pretty new to Indian food, but there were so many options and so many things I liked!  

The service was amazing!  Our water glasses were constantly full, which is good considering some of the food is really spicy!  We're not from that area, but if we were in the neighborhood, I would consider going there again!
