b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA My gf and I had dinner at Sahib's since we both like Indian food.  We were not disappointed!  The food was excellent and the service top notch.  Beware that when they have a double chili icon next to the dish, it really means it's spicy.  I had that and loved it, but it was probably at the edge of my tolerance level :)
