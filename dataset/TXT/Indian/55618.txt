x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Great place for Asian cuisine. If you order fiery, have a glass of water next to you - it really will be fiery! Overall ambience is very nice however the music killed the mood. It's a very warm, cozy next to the fireplace type of ambience with Rihanna playing in the background. It was out of place. 
Overall great place for lunch and dinner with friends and family
