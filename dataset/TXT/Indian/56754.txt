xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw My older sister kept raving about this place and by kept raving about this place I axed her to stop talking about it because she kept putting it on higher pedestals and I feel that things shouldn't be built up so much.  She stopped talking about it until after I finally told her I went and man, was it worth all that hype.
I went to Phoenix to see the White Sox take on the Diamondbacks and I flew in that Friday morning.  After I got to the hotel I quickly found my way to the light rail which took me north to Indian School Road.  And then I caught a bus for a quick slide over to 7th avenue.  I ordered a red taco AND a green taco thinking that they weren't too big but perhaps I should have paid attention to what was on other people's plates.  They were both really, really good and if I had to pick a better one, I'd say that the red chili was slightly better than the green.
The red tamale was OUTSTANDING and next time I go in there I'm a gonna order at least 5 of those.  Did you read that last sentence?  I repeat, the red tamale was OUTSTANDING.
The inside of the place wasn't much to look at but if your food is that good, then who really gives a fuck what the decor looks like?

Helpful tip:  Go there really hungry.
