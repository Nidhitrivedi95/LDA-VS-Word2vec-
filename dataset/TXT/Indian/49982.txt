U2SepNV2djq1hgk4WxL1mQ Don't let this place fool you just because it's in the food court of a mall! 
The food was OUTSTANDING. Very fresh and flavorful. The service has been excellent each and every time, even if it was only a 2 minute encounter. 
I always get the vegetarian option with rice and a side of aloo (potato) something or other. It was reasonably priced and delicious!
My only complaint is that they don't have a full service restaurant that I can frequent...hint hint. 
Support this place because they are awesome. Awesome food. Awesome workers.  And not a chain/ corporate, which makes them....
awesome.
