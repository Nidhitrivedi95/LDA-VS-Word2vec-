kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w So bad! I lived in the UK for 10 years and trust me the standard of Indian food there is second to none - but Charlotte eeek! the standard is appalling.
I ordered a Vindaloo which would normally be too hot for me as my heat level is a Madras but the one from here had no spice I mean none at all - it was closer to an Irish stew than Vindaloo!!!
