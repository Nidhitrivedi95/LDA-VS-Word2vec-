LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA The experience was a little beggardly.

They have reduced the number of dips that come with their crepes.  I went here last year, and my crepe came with a potato dip that was really good - but it is gone now.

*They do not accept American Express*

I was overcharged on a dosa compared to the price that was listed on the menu. Isn't that illegal? Is that how you roll in South India? Haha. 

You can save on a crepe dip, charge me extra unlawfully, and save yourself one percent by not taking Amex. It's alright. Your food was okay, not that good, and I am not interested in whatever shenanigan you might surprise me with on a later visit, so I am not planning on coming here ever again. 

Too-da-loo
