I can't make it over there during the day so we went one Sunday night for the dinner buffet--awesome!  Many, many veggie indian dishes along with a few for the carnivores, masala chai, and plenty of dessert and naan options.

I also love the atmosphere--they have Bollywood videos and music playing, and lots of colorful lanterns and string lights.  The service is a little slow for those of us who like it spicy--at one point I felt like I was going to die because my water glass had been empty for so long and I have an unfortunate affinity for chili peppers.

Other than that, this place is perfect and it might have just been because they were SO busy.  Because it's awesome! :)
