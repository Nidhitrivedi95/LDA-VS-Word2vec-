GYmdm_Vy7sf9tji7WUcohg I've only been here during weekday lunch hour for their buffet.  It is one of the best value lunches around.  $10 per person, taxes in.

The selection is somewhat limited, but I found the quality of what they have to be very good.  And because the selection is limited, what is there moves quickly and everything stays fresh.

Butter chicken is on the sweet side--if that is your thing.  It isn't my thing, but I still go back for seconds.  Goat curry, is also quite tasty, and I'm not really a goat eater either.   

Samosas are good as well, but the nann is kind of weird.. tasty, but totally different than most other restaurants.

It is family operated and the service is always outstanding.  It looks like it used to be a small house, so seating is limited, and it fills up rather quickly during lunch hour.
