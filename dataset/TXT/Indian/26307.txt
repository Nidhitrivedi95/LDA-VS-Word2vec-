Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw I was surprised just how good this place is!

A few months ago, I had a Groupon, so I thought I would try out Kathmandu at its new location.  It shut down at its old location.  I went with a friend.  We were both amazed!

From the beginning, the service was excellent.  In fact, I wish I had written down the server's name, because he was courteous, attentive and prompt.  He explained each dish in detail, especially since Nepali food is unique [although some people confuse it with Indian cuisine].

In general, when going to South Asian restaurants, if you want to taste the best dishes, avoid the lunch buffet and instead, ask the server about a la carte dishes that are either unique or specialities of the restaurant.  Which is exactly what we did:  We asked about uniquely Nepali dishes.

The food was delicious and different in taste from Indian cuisine.  I love Indian cuisine, but I also enjoy the distinct tastes of Chinese, Thai, French, Mexican and Italian cuisine--especially their regional differences.  So, my friend and I were about enjoy the Nepali food for what it is.

We left a generous tip because the server deserved it.  Overall, there is no doubt that Kathmandu is one of the best South Asian restaurants [including Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan] restaurants in Toronto in terms of taste, service and value.

Bravo!
