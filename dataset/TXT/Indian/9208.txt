86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ We visited this restaurant yesterday and ate Paneer tikka masala, Vegetarian Biryani with Naan and whole wheat roti, it tasted good. The owner an ismaili whose parents are from Dar-es-Salaam was very warm and welcoming, although the ambiance of the restaurant needed to be upgraded, but still worth recommending a visit for tasty food.
