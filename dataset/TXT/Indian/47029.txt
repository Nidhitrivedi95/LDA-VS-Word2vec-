t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Ordered Hakka King on UberEats. We had the vegetarian Cantonese chow mein, chicken balls, general tao chicken, and vegetable fried rice. The chicken balls and general tao chicken had a terrible after taste as if they were deep fried in old oil. The taste and everything was there but the after taste killed it for me! The vegetable chow mein and vegetable fried rice was okay. The food would have been amazing if it didn't have that weird after taste!
