H_3zARkuiwPNBIbCaPsRuw This place has great East African food. It had a lot of variety African and Indian dishes. I had gone in August 2014 the owner who is a really friendly man and terrific customer service told me he was selling the business cause he is retiring I hope the new owner is as great. 
I ordered the zanzibar mix, fried mhogo, beef samosas, chicken samosas , beef biryan, kachori, bhajia. 
I only wished they had mishkaki and I would have given them 5 stars. I cannot wait to go back again.
