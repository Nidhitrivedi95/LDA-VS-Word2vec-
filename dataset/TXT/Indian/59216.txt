First impressions were good in the door, it is nicely decorated and clean. We got there about 7 minutes after the buffet had opened but the food looked like it had already been sitting out a while with skins on the tops. We enjoyed the chicken tikka masala, rice and the naan bread, but everything else was pretty disappointing. I was also surprised they had no desserts besides fruit, most indian buffets I go to at least have rice pudding. We ordered mango lassis as well because they didnt have cold chais...which didnt really taste like mango, they were like white, sour, runny greek yogurt drinks. Honestly, I will not go back, there are much better places in town, perhaps sit down is a better experience.
