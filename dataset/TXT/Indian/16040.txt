DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA The experience I had in this restaurant was by far the best I've had in America. It started with the customer service, and then went up from there. The cuisine was so authentic I was really impressed. I had the opportunity while serving in Iraq with some Indian Chefs that would eat late-night with me, and I have to tell you the curry is real  delicious. Thank you guy's, and I appreciate the service I will be back.
