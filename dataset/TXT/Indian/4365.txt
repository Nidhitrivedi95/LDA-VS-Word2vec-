1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw The 4-star rating led me here to experience some good Indian snack. All the food was pretty ordinary and meant to please just the starved students and those unfamiliar with Indian food.
The vada pav was served in a bun, pani puri had almost no filling and served with garlic chutney for spice. The sambar and chutney served with the dosa were lacked any taste or flavor just as the dosas.

Does not qualify to represent Indian or Indian street fare even in Cleveland ....
