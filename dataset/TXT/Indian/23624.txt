gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A The food was delicious. We visited this restaurant first time for dinner and enjoyed the garlic naan, Paneer tikka Masala, samosa, veg biryani and mango lassi. Everything was tasty and prepared well. However, Masala chai was not prepared well and it felt like drinking plain milk. 
We visited again for lunch buffet and weren't disappointed this time as well. Options are comparatively less for vegetarians but again whatever was available was good. Naan could have been better. Would surely visit again when in Vegas. Good option for vegeterians.
