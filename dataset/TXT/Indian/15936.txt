daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ Chicken dum biriyani ,pastry and chai was pretty good ,expected spice level for Hyderabadi biriyani but it'd be great if the chicken is a bit more cooked and provide knives at the table,it was my first time there would definitely go there sometime again.
Overall it's a pretty cool ,neat place to hangout
