2ZmZbmsTRHogSZR-nJY_Fw Went last week for unlimited biriyani and chat.
I liked the samosa chat which had the right spice.
Even liked the chicken biriyani.The chicken was tender and well cooked.Icing on the cake is you get everything unlimited incuding one dosa for $9.
Would defnetly recommended this restaurant. 

Also the manager was very cordial and would defnetly visit the restaurant again.
