jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q From out of town and was looking for good Indian food. Scored with this place. Manny and Natalie were THE BEST. Food was fresh and delicious. Chicken Tikka Masala was some of the best I've ever had. They even learned it was my birthday and brought me cake. So friendly, so delicious. We will definitely be back next time we are in town.
