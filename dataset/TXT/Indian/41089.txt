PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q Decent Indian food. Not incredible, but not bad, either.

I usually go for the lunch buffet ($8.95/person) since shelling out $50+ for a decent dinner for two doesn't give me the food for value I can get elsewhere in town.  As someone else mentioned, they have a late-night 1/2 off deal, but unless you want to eat dinner around midnight, it doesn't make too much sense.

Nothing stands out in my mind as a "must have" or "to die for".... But, on the flip side, nothing is a "must miss", either.
