yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw We really enjoyed our Christmas dinner at The Dhaba. Given it was just two of us in town, I couldn't be bothered to cook a big traditional meal - this was one of the most memorable Christmas meals we've had!

My husband was immediately excited when we pulled up and noticed they have a store attached to the restaurant advertising British food (he's from Scotland).  So in addition to a delicious meal we were able to purchase Cadbury Flakes for dessert. The meal itself was unexpectedly good. We started out with an order of onion bhaji and a dish I don't remember the name of (aloo tikki chaat perhaps?), but it resembled a deconstructed samosa -- AMAZING!

We knew we wanted to try the Lamb Vindaloo and the waitress recommended we also go with the Chicken Tikka Masala. We asked the dishes be prepared based on the chefs recommended spice level. I was shocked by how much my husband enjoyed the tikka masala - not usually his favorite as he doesn't like anything sweet. The dish had the perfect amount of spice and creaminess. I also really enjoyed the lamb vindaloo, the flavors continued to build as the meal went on - and was really good for breakfast the next day.

The service was excellent. We found everyone to be very personable and able to provide great recommendations with some funny stories to tell. We sat near the hostess stand and I noticed that many people with 7pm reservations arrived early. The hostess handled the groups early arrival well, especially given there were two people serving all of the tables. 

The menu is unique, offering much for vegetarians and carnivores alike. I wasn't feeling well and was happy sipping on my Chai tea (so yummy). We will definitely be back to enjoy another meal soon!
