kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w We grabbed food to go. We ordered 3 dishes and naan. Our total was over $50. The portions were not large, and the flavors were really lacking. The overwhelming flavor for all three dishes was simply salt. The rice that accompanies each entree order was mostly hard. Overall, the meal was a disappointment. We will not be back.
