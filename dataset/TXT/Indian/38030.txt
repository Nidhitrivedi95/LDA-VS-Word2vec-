ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Just ate at Origin India on Paradise Rd. the food was fresh and not greasy. The staff was very friendly and it was very homey inside. We has the lunch buffet and being vegetarian and gluten free, there was plenty to eat. Highly recommend it if you want a nice, friendly Indian restaurant.
