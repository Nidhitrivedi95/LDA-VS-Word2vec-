gqiBy1X5n1KHq21D2dawEw Couple of my friends raved about this place for the longest time. My sister and I were in the neighborhood, so we decided to have our lunch there. 

The restaurant is very simple. Few tables and chairs. The owner was our server, very helpful, despite not asking for it. He goes through the details of the food. I can see he is very passionate and knowledgeable about the food. When I saw the menu, I got overwhelmed to see the extensive of list of the menu. I asked our server to help us to choose one. My little sister chose a spicy chicken dosa. The server kept asking her if she is sure of her order because it's spicy. It was getting annoying. 

Finally, we got our dosas! Omg... it was absolutely a delish! It made us forget the annoying server. Especially, the spicy chicken dosas was the best!

All I would say, to be patient with the owner's talking, do go there for the most delicious dosas.
