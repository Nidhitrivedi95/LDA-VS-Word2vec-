JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw Tried their lunch buffet on a weekend. Good to see a balanced options for both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes. Some items (especially briyani) were quite spicy but lacked flavor. If your spice tolerance level is low, then this is probably not your place to try out. Breads and appetizers were relatively fresh and good. The interior was very dull with pretty much no decor at all. It was more like a big hall converted into a make shift restaurant. Overall, nothing much to complain or rave about this place.
