GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Yummy! This is my new favorite Indian restaurant. Ordered #43 Vegetable Curry, #33 Chenna Batura, #29 Masala Uthappam and #57 Malabar Parotta and all were amazing! The Veggie Curry had a delicious sauce and lots of fresh tasting vegetables. It comes with a side a white rice and we used the Malabar Parotta (bread) to mop up the rest of the tasty sauce. The Chenna Batura looks like a huge sopapilla and comes with a garbanzo beans curry. This was a big hit w/the teenage boys who hogged it all. The Masala Uthappam was good, but the least favorite among us all. It's described as a rice & lentil pancake. It looked like a pizza and came with a sauce to dip it in.
I wish I had heard about this place sooner. Excellent food... can't wait to go back!
