rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg I was staying at the Quality Hotel Midtown. That is when I decided I need some restaurant food! Good thing I found THANJAI RESTAURANT! When I ordered their Biryani I ended up ordering the biryani for the rest of the week everyday. The manager didn't look at me weird because I was there everyday too, which was nice. Also I tried their Dosa, which was good. This is Southern Indian Food, so it is different from Northern Indian food. Super good! Five stars!
