z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA This is the best Indian food I have ever tasted and the service is great too. I always get the Chicken Korma extra spicy with Naan bread. The staff takes great care of you and takes pride in this place. I love the buffet too which has almost everything from the menu on it. Please give this place a chance. They get two thumbs up for perfect satisfaction.
