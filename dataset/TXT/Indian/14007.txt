BXeXS9EaNN03AptFwElvjA Was recommend to me by a yoga friend.  Ace on price and comfortable atmosphere and seating.  Ordered chicken madras with a side of tarka dahl.  Was much to rich and sweet for my liking. My preference is for spicy tarte. Chose these as 'safe' options but was disappointed.  Rice was nice..  Most places make the rice too hard. I left with that queasy feeling after eating fatty foods and didn't bother taking away any remainder..  Which says a lot coming from someone who doesn't like wasting food!  Was very busy so perhaps good for others.
