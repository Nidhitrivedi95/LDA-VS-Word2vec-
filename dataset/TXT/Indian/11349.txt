Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w HANDS DOWN the best Nepali/Himalayan place in Toronto. I have tried literally all Himalayan places in the GTA area and this one easily stands out. Chilli momo and Mutton Thali are my two favorites from Himalayan Kitchen. As a Nepali, I'm usually disappointed with the quality of Nepali/Himalayan food in Toronto but can't say the same about Himalayan Kitchen. They are cheaper than other Tibet/Nepali places and have the best food. Staff are super friendly and helpful. Actually, I am craving momos while writing this review. Himalayan Kitchen, here I come. Ciao
