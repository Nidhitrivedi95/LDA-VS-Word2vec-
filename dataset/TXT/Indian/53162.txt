VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw Tried Indian cuisine for lunch today and visited the Taj Mahal Indian Cuisine. It was a bit difficult to locate because we were looking for a large white dome surrounded by four minarets. It is actually located right next to Food City. 

I had my doubts when I saw the flashing OPEN sign from the outside. But once I got inside I was surprised. It was decorated. 

Everybody had the lunch specials, both the chicken methi and the lamb curry. There didn't seem to be much distinction between the two with regard to how they looked. I think the only actual difference was the meat used. The bread they served with the meal tasted good. I was looking forward to rich Indian flavors but my taste buds weren't fully satisfied.

A small salad was served prior to our meal and a co-worker of mine mentioned how thoroughly they had mixed the dressing in and were impressed.

They did ask how spicy between 1 and 10 and one of the guys that was with us who always likes hot food was rather disappointed at their 8 as they were comparing only to a mild Thai restaurant.

The service was excellent, polite and friendly.

The price was a bit on the expensive side at least for what you would normal expect to pay for lunch menu. With regard to their website, I believe it over sells what they actually offer.

I'm rating this place a 3 - "A-OK.", because I feel that a 2 - "Meh. I've experienced better" would be inappropriate since I haven't really been to that many Indian restaurants to justify it.
