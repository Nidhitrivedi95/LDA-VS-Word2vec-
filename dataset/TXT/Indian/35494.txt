Mw4OBWvBQ-L_a0EOFKFDjQ This spot - located in a tiny strip mall, is clearly geared towards 100% carry out (or takeaway as it is know in some parts of the world). Having said that, their menu is by no means limited and you can find most of the Pakistani/Punjabi/classic Mughal style entrees available. I have tried their Biryani items, which I must say are quite good given the price. The quantity is also again quite generous for the price. Spice levels are appropo for the cuisine style, but those who value aromatic food will enjoy it. Basic summary: affordable, but not often consistent.
