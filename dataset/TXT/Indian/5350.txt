2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw 5 samosas for $1!!! 

Who's saying no to that deal?? (My mom that's who!- haha) 

I mean I'm not going to just drive up to finch and middlefield for samosas but if you're in the area getting your eyebrows waxes/threaded in the weekday then stop by... I wouldn't suggest the weekends because the lines quite frankly are absurd. It's like 20 people deep and ordering $40 worth of samosas... Smh 

I've tried the butter chicken and briyani, nothing to scream about besides the prices! 


holla
