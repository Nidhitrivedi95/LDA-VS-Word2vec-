Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg I can't even begin to explain how incredible this place is! My husband and I went there because of the reviews and they don't lie! Both of our dishes were the best Indian food we had ever had! I had Methi Chicken and he had Tiki Masala. Both just over the top incredible! Best service as well!
