rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ I finally have a decent Indian restaurant close to where I live. I ordered take out so I cannot comment on the restaurant experience. The kadai paneer was delicious. I love the fact that you can choose between rice or naan for your side.  I hope to go back again sometime soon and choose between their many choices. It appears that they also have dosas, which will be my next choice!
