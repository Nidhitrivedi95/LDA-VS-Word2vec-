7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ Just back from their lunch buffet and it was the worst I have ever had at Persis. The food was cold and did not look appealing at all. The taste was not very impressive either. No much variety to experiment.

Usually a fan of their biryani, I did not like it much today. The 'Meethe ka Tukra' was horrible.

Hope it was just one of those bad days and they pull up their socks soon.
