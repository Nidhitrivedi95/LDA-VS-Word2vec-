16xoDNtEWbth_s--xqZxrQ Excellent Indian food and above and beyond service. This Sunday the chef made an out of this world chicken dish (Mirapa Kodi) I've never seen thus dish at any other Indian restaurant. The food here is fresh, hot and delicious. We drive by 3 other Indian food restaurants to eat here!
