9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g I went for the buffet at lunch. The food was okay, I'd rather go to Swagat. I think it was the quality of the cooking that turned me off. The food wasn't very flavorful and kind of soggy. When the best thing you eat is the Nann...I guess when there are so many Indian restaurants around, you can choose what you like best. However, I do think that if you want the best Indian food, befriend an Indian family and have them cook for you; otherwise you will never eat the best Indian food out there.
