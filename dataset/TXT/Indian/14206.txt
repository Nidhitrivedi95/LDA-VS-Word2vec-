c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Walking in for takeout about a year ago we we're not impressed and never going to order again. HOWEVER, received a flyer in the mail and decided to give them another chance and they fully redeemed themselves!!
Ordered Dinner for Two and paid an extra $2-3 to make the curry a vindaloo. $30 Meal and we got 2 veg samosas with mint and tamarind chutney, 1 meat curry, veg of the day, 1 rice pulao and 2 fresh and fluffy naans!!
Ordered delivery and it arrived before excepted.
Food was piping HOT! Lamb Vindaloo was large tender chunks, potato was perfect and the portion was awesome!! Not greasy or oily at all as what I have seen in the other pics. Flavourful. Will ask for x-spicy tho next time. Think they are taking the reviews into consideration and implementing changes...or they did at least with our meal!
Veg of the day was delish, cooked to perfection.
I was expecting hard flat naans, but out came large fluffy and soft naans- perfect! And pulao was stardard basmati rice with peas. 
Couldn't believe the amount of food we got for $30.
Will definitely order delivery from them again.
