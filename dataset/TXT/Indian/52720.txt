Uyw1pJ03kt-I1B_tkA3aFg I did not finish this meal.
It was too good! I saved some to take home.
I had the Kadhai Chicken with Garlic Naan and rice and savored every bite. 
It's been difficult to find excellent dining experiences since moving to this side of town but Royal Biryani & Kabob is really good, and it's very affordably priced, too.

They have been open a month and it shows. It is almost a model in disorganization and confusion but the staff and owner are helpful friendly and accommodating as they get their sea legs in this endeavor.

The food is excellent enough to make up for any startup inconveniences!
