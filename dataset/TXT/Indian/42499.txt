r4RCtOZxp0nXpuoN_Usd1w I really wanted to like India Darbar based on the other reviews here, but it just wasn't what I was hoping for. It's not the anything about the restaurant was bad - the service was good, the food was good, the lunch buffet selection was good - it just wasn't great. The location of the restaurant is in an out-of-the-way strip mall off Odana. We were greeted at the door immediately, but the place was empty except for two other tables. I ordered masala chai to drink. I prefer more milk in mine for a richer flavor, but this had less milk and more tea. It didn't have a lot of the cardamom, cinnamon or cloves that make it masala chai. The naan that came with the meal was thin and crispy almost like pizza crust. I prefer mine more pillowy and a little chewy. It had a little spice baked into it, but it lacked the light brush of oil on top for a little extra something. The entrees were like everything else, good but not great. The sauces were thinner than usual - I like them a little thicker so you can pick them up with the naan or eat them with the rice. The entrees also lacked the spices Indian food is famous for. The just weren't quite what they should have been.  When I finished eating, the staff cleared the table and brought the check in a timely but not rushed manner. Though, we had to wait a minute or two to pay with there now only one other table in the restaurant filled. Overall, India Darbar deserves the four stars. It was better than average, but not excellent. I would try it once, but then drive a few more blocks down Odana to Maharaja.
