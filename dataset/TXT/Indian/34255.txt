I went for their lunch buffet one weekend and was very surprised by their meager selection. Their veggie spread was adequate,  but their meat section seemed like an afterthought: two meat curries and tandoori chicken. Their desert selection didn't have  gulab jamun and the like. Usually buffet restaurants ramp it up on the weekend, perhaps Bombay Palace does that for their buffet dinners.

The veggies were all very forgettable, the samosas had clearly come out of a frozen packet. The beef curry was flavorful and the tandoori chicken was very moist and flavored. Major props for that! However, I couldn't tolerate the butter chicken which was disgustingly sweet. The rice pudding was similarly half assed.

The lunch buffet gets a solid two. Bombay Palace needs to step up its game if it wants to compete with the other Indian buffets in town.
