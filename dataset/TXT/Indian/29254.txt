I was traveling with family and I wanted Indian food. I was so excited to see this close to the hotel. I ordered Chana Masala the menu say that it included rice. I purchased my food and went back to the hotel. What I received was a "TV dinner" that they didn't even take out of the packaging. NO KIDDING. and no rice was included. The TV dinner only contained the Chana Masala. AND it was gross. This is a real review. They should be ashamed. Really Ashamed. How do I give no stars? 1 star is to much.
