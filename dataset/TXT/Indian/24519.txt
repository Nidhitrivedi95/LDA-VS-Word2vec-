h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Beautiful restaurant.. Poor service.. We waited our entire meal to get a glass of water.. And I feel like I must have gotten the bottom of the barrel chicken because it was fatty and very chewy. In short, I just told my fiancé that this place has ruined the thought of eating chicken for a while.. High hopes.. Sad face.. We won't be coming back.. I don't want to risk another terrible meal!
