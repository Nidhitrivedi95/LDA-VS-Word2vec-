I had never had Indian food from a restaurant before, just a couple homemade dishes from some friends and collegues from India. The owner was really nice and patient in helping me find something I would like. I literally was amazed how good the food was and I left  wanting to stop there for dinner on my way home from work, and dreamt of eating there for the next few days.
