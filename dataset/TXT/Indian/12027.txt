auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ After a fabulous experience at another Indian buffet in town, my sister and I were very excited to try this place. It is located next to one of our fave thai places close to our house. :D We were not disappointed. 

We came a half an hour before the lunch buffet ended, I recommend getting there a bit earlier because they seriously start to remove food at three on the dot. 

The naan was fresh and delicious, the sweet rice was yummy and the tikka masala was to die for. I could just eat the sauce on rice and live happily ever after. Wonderful cucumber/yogurt sauce and I don't know what kind of crack they put into the rice pudding with slivered nuts but it was addictive. I wanted to take the steam tray full and run out of the door. 

Good service besides feeling rushed to finish when it hit three, and we will definitely go here again.
