iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Desi Burrito is vegan, vegetarian, halal, and gluten free. I'm not particular about any of these although I may consume the same foods. I suggest for those who are, to still inquire. One or more of these diets may have if, ands, or buts i.e. how and/or where the food is prepared in presence of what have they. You know what I mean...

Supposed to be fusion. A yelper friend and I briefly discussed what was the fusion? Tortilla versus naan... Probably so. Quesadillas are also on their menu, but it was not an available item when my cousin had ordered. They also mentioned some items to be removed from the menu, but have not yet been crossed off.

Their lamb burrito bowl was tasty. It was a first and no regrets there. Chicken desi burrito is something I commonly order. I like the flavor and spice. Authentic cuisine eaters may have critique on it. But I find the desi burrito filling and satisfying to my hunger.

Most items on the leftside or middle of their menu can be turned into a combo which includes a canned or bottled beverage with masala fries. My recommendation for potato freaks is the masala fries. One must be able to take the spiciness though. No wimps allowed for the spice in their food here. 

Only outside seating. Trees next to their tables aren't full grown yet; they don't look like it - so shading is minimal. Their space all in all is small. It's a cement foundationed converted mobile structure. There's a drive-thru side and walk up window. I personally like the way it's been painted. Props to the artist.

Here you'll find your quick, easy, spicy and fun food combo on the go. Give em a try.
