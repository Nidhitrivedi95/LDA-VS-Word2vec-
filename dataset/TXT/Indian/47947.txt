TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Superb food...excellent service....some of the staff are limited English proficient...but if you are interested in talking about India a nd food....they take great care of you.   No buffet after 3...but the dinner specials are 4 course meals with way too much food for one person.  My favorite...rack of lamb...best I ever had...cooked to perfection.   Lots of Indian locals come here.    Sunday brunch 14 bucks includes Champaign.  Parking not a problem because they aren't usually too busy.   One block off paradise at sands/ twain.   Don't walk here at night because it's not too safe.  Monorail goes right by and buses but left or taxis are easier
