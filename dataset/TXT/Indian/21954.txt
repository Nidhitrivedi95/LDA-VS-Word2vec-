GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Let me preface this by saying we are regular customers and love their food. If not for those past experiences we would not be able to rate them at all because after waiting 40 minutes for someone to look in our direction or offer us a water we finally left. 

The place was pretty busy but we were seated relatively quickly as no one else was waiting. All open tables aside from one needed to be bused and we were asked if the table nearest the door was okay or if we wanted to wait a couple minutes for another table. We took the table, sat down, and the wait began.

A line quickly formed at the door and the wait staff began running around trying to bus the tables that had also being awaiting their attention. After seating this small rush a 6 top stood at the door for about ten minutes waiting for them to push a couple tables together. Their server was however conscientious enough to quickly bring them water, lucky dogs... They began making their way around to the new tables and getting water out. Us having had a good 5 minutes wait on the other tables sat waterless feeling a little like second class citizens. At the 40 minute mark it was obvious that our business was not wanted so we packed up and decided to call it a night. 

In the staffs defense the place was crowded and there were only two serves and a manager in the front of house. That being said, the place isn't that big and a little direction, organization, and help from the manager would have made this manageable for the staff on hand. For patrons to wait that long without so much as a blink in their direction is unacceptable.

As we headed for the door I looked at a table that had been there before us. They sat food-less with empty drinks and I realized I had made the right decision. I wouldn't be eating last nights leftovers and writing a Yelp review right now, I would be waiting for food.
