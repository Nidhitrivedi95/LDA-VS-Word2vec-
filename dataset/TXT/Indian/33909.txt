m1O3uIJPZelo58EaOsrvQQ Awesome food. Chicken kata kut and Bihari Kababs are our favorite. We also have them do a special spicy biryani for us which is awesome as well. We generally get catering when we have parties and have never had any issues with quality of food. 

Only thing to watch out for: maybe they are busy but earlier we had some miscommunication with respect to details around the catering order. Simple way around that is to get everything in writing. 

Recommend this place!
