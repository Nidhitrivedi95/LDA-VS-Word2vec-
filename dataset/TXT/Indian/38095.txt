ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw The food is excellent, and the restaurant is very clean.   The wait staff is a bit absent and lacks in overall availability.   The disappointment is that they could be so much better.

I think we got ignored as they included the service charge in the final check.....why work for what you get for free type thing...... 

Maybe they are better for lunch as a buffet or for couples.....not sure...
