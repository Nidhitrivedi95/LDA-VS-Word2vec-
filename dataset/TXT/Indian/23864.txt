gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Had lunch buffet here on my back to Los Angeles based on yelp reviews. I'm so glad I picked this one among the millions of Indian restaurants in Vegas. For $10 you can select from mutton curry, chicken tikka masala, pakora, naan, etc. as well as a few desserts. A much bigger selection than the average buffet in LA. Service and ambiance was good, too. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas.
