The all you can eat buffet for $10 is the bomb.com. I dream about their delicious buttery toasted naan and rich chicken masala. The restaurant is clean, and service is fast and attentive - because we are eating plate after plate after plate. Best Indian food in the area. We walk in and make a beeline to the buffet...like, before even finding a table. Where else can you eat within two seconds of walking in?! Nowhere.
