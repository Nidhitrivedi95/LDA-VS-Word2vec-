694ZSZQfbpycmzyMQm-XGw Not bad Indian food. For those people who don't know the different types of Indian food, this is a great option for take home dishes. The food is reasonably priced and portioned decently. I found the food oily (but this can be typical for Indian take out). I don't recommend calling in an order based on the online menu. This location doesn't make everything the online menu offers. We ordered the food based on the online menu and we were sent to another location (waste of my gas and time).
We found that weekends are staffed by people who are not properly trained on how to cook. So go during a week night.
