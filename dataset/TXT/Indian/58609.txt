yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ Casablanca is a new Middle Eastern restaurant that has recently opened on U of I Campus. There are so many different ethnic restaurants to choose from on Green Street: Mexican, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Indian, and American. I was excited to see a Middle Eastern restaurant added on our diverse plate. 

Casablanca is a kabob house, offering many different varieties of kebabs from the Middle East. Meat eaters and vegetarians are all welcome. The menu features dishes with variety of spices in categories of vegetarian, chicken, lamb, beef, goat, shrimp, and a variety of fish entrees. In addition, each entree comes with rice.  

More importantly, you can't forget the irresistible Indian bread, naan. Naan is an oven-bakes flatbread that generally resembles a pita bread. The price of naan ranges from $2.99 to $5, which isn't too bad. However, as a hungry-poor-college-kid-in-love-with-ethnic-cuisine, I wish they gave you a little bit more naan. It's always fun to dip the fluffy bread into the curry and eat it. 

My boyfriend and I ordered the lamb vendaloo (spicy curry with lamb and potatoes) and casablanca chicken masala. The casablanca chicken masala was the dinner special which was $7.99. However, the other entrees priced around $12.99 or more. 

I'm not very familiar with Middle Eastern cuisine, but I have grown to enjoy it. However, I thought the sauce on both entrees tasted the same, except the Chicken Masala had more vegetables added to it. It was good, but basically we had the same entree. I recommend ordering a kabob and a curry entree if you go with another person. Also don't forget the naan. :) 

Overall, the service was good and the food was good.
