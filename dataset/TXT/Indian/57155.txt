XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw So delicious.  I even managed to convert or at least open up the possibilities for my caribbean roti loving boyfriend.  We ordered the chicken roti, saag paneer roti and the butter chicken roti.  All was right with the world. It was spicy and tasty at the same time.  Bonus, we ordered enough to have leftovers to freeze.  FYI, the leftovers thaw nicely and are still super tasty!  
We too experienced no line and the server was very friendly.
