GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw At first I wasn't sure why this wasn't in the "recommended list" from my friends who are experts when it comes to Indian food, but after trying it out, I now know why.

Tandoori's dishes have a lot of "fillers" so the meats we got in our order were very minimal compare to the other Indian restaurants.  The flavor is more Americanized than I thought so it didn't hit the "authentic mark" in my opinion.

Service is horrible, but I didn't have much expectation on this field so it's pretty much the food that I have issues with.  It's fun to try this restaurant once if you are running out of option, but I personally wouldn't go back again.
