QEqMHowTTj5GKvpiKheGlQ It is a very cozy place. Minimal investment to the decore was obvious. I don't think the chairs matched at our table. 
The plates and utensils were almost clean. And the water tasted a little off.  There were tonnes mosquitos. Be prepared!!
With that said... the food was authentic!  Which is the most important part of dinning out! I saw them make everything in the back. There were 2- 3 cooks. And they each specialized in something. It took no time for the food. 
Will definitely go back for takeouts.
