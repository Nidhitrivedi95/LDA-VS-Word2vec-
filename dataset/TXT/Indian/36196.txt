NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ The food is actually nice and worth my 4-star comment. However the speed they serve foods were really slow. We literally saw this restaurant filled with people but with no food on probably more than half tables. And we waited half an hour for our dishes. If you're a starving backpacker then you shouldn't walk in here. Otherwise worth a try.
