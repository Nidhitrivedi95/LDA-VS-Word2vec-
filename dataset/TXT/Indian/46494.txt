SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Yes, okay, so the waiters don't smile.  That seems par for the course at every Indian restaurant I've been to, no big deal.  They were out of the mushroom matar, but the Palak Paneer was so tasty that I didn't mind.  

We were there with one friend who hadn't had a chance to try a lot of Indian food, so my friend and host ordered an appetizer sampler, three types of naan, and we shared.  It was a fantastic experience, everything was yummy.
