02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ $10 unlimited and quality lunch buffet with fresh naan bread brought to the table. It can't really be beat. What's extra nice is the cleanliness and decor of this restaurant. It feels much fancier than you'd think with their maroon tablecloths and dark wood furniture.  The lunch buffet is very good, it has chicken tandoori and chicken masala, but also had all the regular vegetarian options and good chutneys. Everything was fresh and the servers were really attentive. I'll be back!
