PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg During my recent visit,I was fortunate enough to enjoy this restaurant's fine array of Indian food.I especially enjoyed their wonderful lamb curry with channa marsala over Indian-style rice.I also enjoyed their vegetarian aubergine curry(eggplant).The prices for food were reasonable in this fine eatery by Nicholson Square.The Mosque Kitchen has a fine selection of ice cream at reasonable prices.This restaurant is cafeteria-style,so tipping the staff is not obligatory.
