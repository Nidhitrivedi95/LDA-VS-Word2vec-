gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Wow. I like indian food, but I am very picky with it and only have made a few dishes at home which I like. My sister and I walked over here while I was getting my windows tinted a few weeks ago and man was I impressed. Very much so!!

I have never been a fan of lamb, but their lamb curry was to die for. Everything I put on my plate was absolutely phenomenal, and the sweet rice...oh the sweet rice!! I would live on that stuff forever. The service was fantastic, and they were very concerned that we enjoyed everything. The naan was fresh and delicious...I ate two plates full until I was ready to burst. I have decided I love Indian food, and am so happy because I was always thinking I wasn't so big on it.

I cannot recommend this place enough, absolutely DELICIOUS!!
