- The chicken tikka masala was pretty bland.  Not very tomatoey and not spicy at all
- The chicken curry had good flavor and spice
- The saag paneer was very good.  Full of spinach with a hint of heat
- The tandoori chicken was tender and had a nice mild flavor
- The rice pudding was excellent
- Solid service

Overall, it's good, but there are better buffets out there that I'd prefer to go to.
