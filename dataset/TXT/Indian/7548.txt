5vxp6inj3sY4Eb2MFyOOPg I passed by this place many times but never stopped by until recently.  I wish I had earlier.
This place is a hidden gem, as the food is very good, plentiful and service is top notch, as if you are eating in more expensive place.

The restaurant is located in very poorly visited little neighborhood shopping corner, so this restaurant does not receive the customer traffic that it deserves.

I ordered some dumplings and kabobs and they were both excellent.  The service I received at Chopan was stellar and could not ask for more.  The restaurant is plenty spacious and looks like a place I can take my family or friends without worrying about bumping elbows.

I think this restaurant deserves more patronage than it has now, being poorly located.  Only advice I can give to the owner of this place is to use more and better social media and internet marketing.   This restaurant is a hidden gem that deserves to be found by more customers and stay in business.
