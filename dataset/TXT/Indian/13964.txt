Bx59EPpbowZgTBiKZ8JJig Just ordered masala dosa butter chicken and kuttanandan beef ulathiathu.

Dosa is crispy. Chicken is buttery. Naan is fluffy like clouds. Beef is a tidal wave of spices.

I believe this place will do well. It's a smart move of them to branch out to this location if the keep the food quality up, keep the authenticity. Don't water it down to appease the general public. We already have choolah for that.

We shall return to try the roast duck or duck curry.

Second floor is really hot. Probably because heater is situated right there. Gives you a true ambiance of what it's like to dine in India.....!?

The cook is different from the take-out headquarter, so the flavor may vary.

The menu is very similar. I recognize most items. Having photos in the menu will be very helpful.
