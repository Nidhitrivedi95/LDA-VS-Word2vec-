WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA The Host Used to blow me away back in 06/07 now... not "meh"... not so much. I went in September 2014.

Decent sized Naan- won't knock them down there... love the garlic.
Murgh Makhani/Butter Chicken - used to be the real deal, it was not as good recently
Vegetarian curries - mediocre
Ambience - 7/10, its pretty inside... but i swear those bangle decorations were missing when i went, I hope it was temporary
Service - decent enough. Polite.

Would I come here again, given the price and the quality of food I experienced, eehhh.. maybe. If the prices were a little lower, it'd be yes. It is expensive.

Is it good to crave your  Indian food craving if you want a nice dining experience... yes?

If you want a group dinner, they have a nice side room where they will serve you food.
