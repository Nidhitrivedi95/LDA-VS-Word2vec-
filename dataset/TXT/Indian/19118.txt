f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg only went once and tried their zafran chicken biryani, regular naan, raita, and chicken 65. Everything we had was delicious, the setting was very home-like and the customer service was great. The chicken 65 was spicy but alright for us, but it may differ for anyone else, as well as the biryani was very flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Great experience and probably would return if we lived closer to Charlotte, NC.
