gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Our first time eating not frozen meal Indian food so we were not sure what to expect but it was amazing! We came at lunch and did the buffet which is the way to go because you can try a little bit of everything and you also get a potato filled dosa to go with it. I'm gluten free and vegan and they only had a few things I couldn't have but still had a big selection of things I could eat. They even made me a gf dosa! My favorite dish was the dhal curry and the pongal. Also the service was amazing by a young man who took the time to explain everything to us and continually checked in on us. Loved it and can't wait to bring others back here.
