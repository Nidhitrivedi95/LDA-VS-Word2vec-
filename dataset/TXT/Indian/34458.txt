MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g Very friendly staff. They had not problems with us asking questions and taking our time with the menus. The selection is huge! On top of all main course chooses, they have deserts on display that are gorgeous. You can even choose between egg and non egg made for those that don't eat them. There is an ice cream bar and more treats on the other side. The samosa were amazing! Plus the strawberry mouse was heavenly!!! The inside is clean and has bright colored paintings that could make this a really trendy place.
