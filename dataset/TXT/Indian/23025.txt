gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We went here in our May 2012 trip. We are generally pretty picky about Indian food as we have eaten in India and almost all across America in many Indian restaurants. We were craving for some Indian food in Vegas and decided to try here. From the outside, it didn't look that inviting. But once. we were in, the service was awesome.

Every food we ordered was authentic and to our taste. Tandoori Chicken is one dish that I am usually never satisfied in most Indian restaurants in the states. But the tandoori chicken here just rocked, it was juicy, scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Just like the clay oven cooked chicken in India.We love it.

The host was generous in proportions and very friendly.

Its a little gem in vegas.
