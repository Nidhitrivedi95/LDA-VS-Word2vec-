YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A Found an elastic band in my biryani!! We've been ordering shrimp biryani from you for the last 2 years coz we love it so much. But today, after a tiring day at work, we were so looking forward to jus getting into our pjs and having home cooked food (yes, thats how much we love the food) and only to find a piece of disaster in my meal! We are so disappointed and now skeptical whether to order in future or not. Its so easy for us to order from other indian restaurants like jaipur grill, aroma etc but your food was closest to home. Having second thoughts!
