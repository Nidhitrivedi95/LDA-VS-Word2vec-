9A-y0TWBKqqP5vsn_CwI3g Having just watched "100 Foot Journey" at the movie theater up the street, we were in the mood for Indian food.  Thanks to a quick search on Yelp and we found this restaurant within 300 meters!  We ordered cheese and garlic naan, samosas, Chicken Korma, and Chicken Biryani. The food was really good!  We will be coming back often!
