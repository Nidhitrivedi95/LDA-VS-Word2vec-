Service- super rude and obnoxious 
Delivery- 1.5 hours, even though I was told 25-45 minutes. I was not told that it is cash only. Items from the order were missing , when I called to inquire- no reaction at all
Was charged $10 for delivery, even though Yelp page showed less. 
Food- horrible; dosa was very soggy and thick. Very limited options for chutneys. Food lacks basic flavor.
