llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg I love this place. The staff always greets us when we come in, the complementary chutneys are fantastic, the entrees are top-notch... and at the end of the meal, they always give us a hot washcloth. I feel pampered when we go there, and that's a great feeling when we go out to dinner. It's not fancy, but the atmosphere is pleasant and we've never had to wait (not sure what it's like at lunch time, though.)
