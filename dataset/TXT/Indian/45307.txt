1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

This place deserves its 5 stars.  Perhaps the friendliest service of the many Indian joints in the Valley.  After a few years hiatus, they're back, and I'm very glad that they are.  

I've been to approximately 10 different Indian lunch buffets in the Valley and I'm going to go out on a limb and say that, on the whole, this is the best.  From variety to quality, it hits all the right notes.  The friendly staff adds that much more to the experience.  

I don't mind places that have bone-in chicken in their curries, but bonus points to this place for using boneless.  Their chicken tikka masala is excellent, as is their garlic naan.  I'm a sucker for kheer and their's is particularly good.  There's a great mix of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, complimentary chai masala also helps.

Until I find something better, this is my go-to Indian in the Valley.
