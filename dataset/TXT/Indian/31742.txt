kXXeD5QOg3GKyyl9QWMifg Tasty Corner, though literally a minute from my house, has never intrigued me - until this past weekend. I stopped by there for lunch, and while it was pretty good, I wasn't blown away. 

From the outside, Tasty Corner looks a little sketchy - not sure what it is that turns me off, perhaps the green and purple color scheme - either way, it's just not the best looking restaurant I've ever seen. But in the spirit of not judging a book by it's cover, I went in for a bite. 

They have a pretty big menu, with breakfast and lunch dishes. While I originally went in for breakfast, I saw their vegetarian wraps and decided to try one! 

We split the "Asparagus Wrap" (asparagus, goat cheese, bell peppers) and the "Avocado Wrap" (avocado, pears, balsamic dressing) and both were pretty good. The asparagus however was prepared kind of poorly - I think it's common asparagus knowledge that you snap off the ends to avoid the stringy gross bottoms - instead I had to search through and remove those end bits. While the avocado wrap was delicious, there wasn't reallllyyy that much avocado in it, and both wraps were over stuffed with lettuce (the "filler" of the wrap world). Those complaints aside, they were still solid wraps.

The service here was kind of "meh" as well - it took way too long to get our wraps, and to have our order taken. As well I had to ask specifically if we got salad or fries with our wrap - she was already walking away - I kind of wonder if that means we would have just got fries (the standard assumption), or no sides at all! 

So, the biggest perk of this place is that two wraps with sides and drinks came to only $19, which is very reasonable! Since the food was decent as well, I could see myself going back.
