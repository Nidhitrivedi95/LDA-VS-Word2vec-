yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Our daughter wanted to take us here because of her many good dines at this restaurant.  My husband and I are new to Indian cuisine.  The woman who greeted us and took our order was so pleasant and kind and answered our many questions.  I must eat gluten free; most of the items on the menu were marked gluten free, and the woman was knowledgeable as well.  Our water glasses were kept full and the staff made themselves available without being annoying.  We tried four different things and were each happy with what we ordered. Out of deference to us "newbies", we all ordered our dishes mild on the heat scale, and the dishes were well balanced and flavorful even without any heat. Our daughter, who normally orders 7 here on a scale to 10, agreed that they were delicious even mild.
