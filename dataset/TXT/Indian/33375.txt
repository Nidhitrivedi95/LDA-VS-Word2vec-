lO-IY5X36bLI8vnQR4O18A Very tasty food. Especially Chicken 65, Biriyani, Dosa, Naan and Curry. They make crab masala and Chettinaad style curry which is awesome. Cakes are also very good. We order cakes very often. Service is also fast and good. 

Very good restaurant for mixed type of food: typical south Indian, Indo-Chinese, Chat and other Indian food.
