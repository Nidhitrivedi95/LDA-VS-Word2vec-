FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ Moved to the Madison Area from Milwaukee, and happen to come across this place when going somewhere else that ended up being closed. Got the Chicken Karae (spelling?) and it was delicious. They offer brown rice, which was made really well. My husband got the special of the day and thoroughly enjoyed it. Would go here again for sure.
