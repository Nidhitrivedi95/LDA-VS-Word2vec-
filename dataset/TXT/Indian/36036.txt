NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ I saw the review in Scene magazine, so I figured I would check it out. The wait time is definitely a problem. I waited a good 20 minutes for my food and the lady in front of me gave up on waiting for her naan. This seems like something they could easily fix with they worked with people that actually work in restaurants.
The chairs and couch to wait on are not comfy and the TV was broken. Ended up walking around the grocery store next store and then playing games on my phone. 

As for the food, it was meh. My mild butter chicken was at the edge of my heat tolerance and the complexity of flavor wasn't there. My husband's tikkah masala had a ton of bell peppers in it and only had 5 pieces of chicken. 5! The naan was yummy at least. 
For $16 it wasn't horrible, but I am going to give them some time to get their shit together before I order again.
