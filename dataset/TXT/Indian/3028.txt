0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw This place makes pretty delicious food. However, I find it to be pretty expensive and I get frustrated with the way they cut corners. If I'm going to pay $17 for a take out meal, it shouldn't be lacking. I get take out here frequently and I hate how they skimp on things. In my meal last night I received no plum sauce (ordered egg rolls/spring rolls) and one packet of hot sauce for a large dish that hot sauce is essential for. There was also long black hair all over my take out container, but not on the food thankfully. There were no fortune cookies. I've ordered this exact meal before (also before they raised the price) and got all the sauces and the cookies. Just a bit frustrating...
