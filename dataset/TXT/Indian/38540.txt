OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We arrived early on a Tuesday evening to discover a 2-piece band playing while a vegetarian buffet was being offered though there were only 3 other customers.  We were told we could not use a Groupon in conjunction with the buffet so we ordered off the menu as we originally planned.  The thin, crispy papadum with mint chutney proved to be an excellent beginning. After reviewing the menu, we settled on orders of garlic naan, butter chicken royale and palak (spinach) chicken that were served with basmati rice. I sent back the "garlic" naan because it was obviously neither "garlic" nor fresh. In a quick flash our server returned with a fresh order of "garlic" naan that was entirely different from what was originally served.  The butter chicken sauce was both bountiful and excellent tasting though both entrees had less than $3 of chicken split between them. The spinach both looked and tasted like it had been recycled from the prior day's buffet table.
