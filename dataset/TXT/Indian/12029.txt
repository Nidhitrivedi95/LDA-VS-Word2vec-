auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I've been here a few times and the great food and attentive, friendly service keep me coming back.

I really enjoy their lunch buffet, mainly because I have so many favorite dishes that it's difficult to narrow it down and choose one or two things for dinner. Their naan bread is tasty; doughy with a light crisp. 

The restaurant is clean and has a great ambiance. The decor, from the wall color to the art is beautiful and tastefully done. 

The staff is warm, inviting and very attentive, ready to clear your plate seemingly as soon as you make the gesture to push your plate to the side.
