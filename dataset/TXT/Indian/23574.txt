gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A New fan FAVORITE!!  We have been in Las Vegas for about a year and we are slowly adding to our list of favorite ethnic restaurants. This place is TOPS!  The owner greeted us and instantly made a friend in my 4 yr old by giving her a high five. Gotta love a place that embraces kids!  The service was fantastic and the food was even better than fantastic. We can't wait to go back!  We devoured the chicken tiki masala and lamb curry. And let me not forget the 2 orders of garlic naan. We left stuffed, yet wanting more!  Until next time...
