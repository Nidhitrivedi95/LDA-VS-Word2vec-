JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ I was driving from Atlanta to Virginia when I decided to stop in Charlotte and have a nice dinner. So I went to woodlands and ordered a dosa. After about five minutes a waiter came over and asked me if I had ordered. I said yes and pointed to the other staff member who had talked to me, but then he wanted to know wether he had written it down. Strange. I said I did not know. Then the original waiter came over and apologized for forgetting about my order. After waiting for another 15 to 20 minutes for my food, I got up to use the rest room. I came back to see they had given away my seat to someone else! So I was left waiting for a table. As luck would have it, my dosa arrived while I was waiting. The waiter had the gall to ask me to sit at a storage shelf and eat the food! It did not even have any legroom or a chair, and was in a dark dirty corner. I refused. So they cleaned up a table and let me have my food, not reheated may I add. Overall the experience left me disappointed. The good was ok, but not delicious. Perhaps someone with restaurant management experience could enlighten me. Is it really that hard for three people and a manager to serve 17 tables?
