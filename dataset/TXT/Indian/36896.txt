nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Two words - PURE GREATNESS. If you love super delicious food without any fancy schmancy schumuck, this is the place for you. I can't wait to go back!!

This unglamorous little restaurant with an unglamorous name serves up five-star quality food at bargain prices. The menu is a prix fixe only for $25 per person for dinner. (Lunch is $20) There is no a la carte option. 

We had grilled quail and butter chicken drumsticks for appetizer. Both were amazing. Entrees were salmon burger - so juicy and huge-portioned! - and seafood pasta - amazing tomato sauce and definitely no skimping on the seafood here!. Desserts were an enormous plate of mango panna cotta and pistacio ice cream.
