KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ I dropped by here on one of my "work from home" days because I didn't feel like Naan and Kabob.  

I had the lunch special (your choice of entrée) which was $7.99 and came with choice of rice or noodles and soup or spring roll.  I decided on the noodles and soup (corn) and decided on the chili fish as my entrée.  

Nothing was overly greasy or overly salty, which is great because I find Hakka places sometimes overdo it. Also, I asked for the fish medium spicy and it didn't kill my sinuses, so that's always a bonus.

With regards to decor, it's not bad. Nothing super fancy, but nothing to be ashamed at either. 

Verdict: Great lunch place.
