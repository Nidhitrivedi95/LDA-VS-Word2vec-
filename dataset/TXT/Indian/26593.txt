I also love that it's a mild dish here since i'm not a big fan of spicy food. I've gone here many times with either my husband for dinner or a bunch of girlfriends for lunch. It is a nicer place though and not as kid friendly as I would like. But the waiters are always kind and willing to help out however they can.  

The entrees are huge! My husband and I will order a single entree of the Tikka Masala for pick up and its enough for both of us. If you do a phone order don't forget to ask for rice and naan. The naan is SO good here.
