7NurnM6G9b_2jTEKpIkQpg This place is a total waste!! I had went here couple of times to buy string hoppers and after waiting for 20 minutes in line, was told they ran out. Once when I bought a chicken kothu Roti,  it tasted like fish! I am allergic to fish! It was disgusting. It also had a dead cockaroache in the middle! Why would people even go to this place! It's total junk!
