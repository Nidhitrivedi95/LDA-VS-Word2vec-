9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g Went with Family for the 1st time: here's the good bad and ugly!!

Good Ambience.
Good Service, it's fast and polite.
Food lacks flavour, quality and variety. Everything is relative, compared to other restaurants the food is just not good,  irrespective of the elevated price. The ambience and service really doesn't help if the food is not up to par with fine dining. It doesn't do justice to good Indian food. My expectations were high given that they have a famous chef backing them but with due respect it's like most other Indian joints pre made gravies spiced up very generic, but not for the discerning palate.
