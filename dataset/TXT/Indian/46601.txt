svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w Came here on a saturday and ordered a thali (biryani) and a masala dosa platter.

Dosa was OK but not crispy.

Biryani was OK but was not freshly prepared.  Curries and sides on the platters were ok, but lacked zing and the fresh pop of flavour you'd normally expect from veggie sambars & curries.

The biggest letdown for me was the dosa, since the restaurant had 'Dosa' in its name.

Not bad for a neighbourhood joint.
