x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag I came here for dinner a few days ago.

We got the fish pakora as a starter. It was very spicy for me (I can't take heat) but it wasn't spicy at all for the rest of my family. It came with a sweet sauce (perhaps plum sauce?) so the heat was bearable. The fish was very tender and everybody enjoyed this dish.

For one of our entrees, we got garlic chicken. They gave us a generous portion so there was more than enough for the four of us. It was a bit bland in my opinion but it didn't taste horrible. 

Next, we got the manchurian fish. Again, the portion was huge and the fish was very soft. I enjoyed this dish more than the garlic chicken.

Lastly, we got the sweet and sour shrimp. This was my favorite this because it wasn't spicy at all and there was a lot of sauce which was perfect for the rice. The portion wasn't as huge as the other two entrees but it wasn't unreasonably small either.

The rice costs $1.50 for a big bowl for the whole table.

Overall, this place was good. The service was great and they cleared our empty dishes very quickly. I would like to see them add some curry dishes to the menu and they'll be perfect!
