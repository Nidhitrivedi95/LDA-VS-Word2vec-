Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I'm giving Indian Delight 5 stars for food! Atmosphere is lacking as can be the service (they are really nice there if you strike up a convo though). Lunch buffets are lunch buffets...i really don't think expectations should be that high to begin with....but their lunch buffet has more options then most around here.

My boyfriend is from India and this is his preferred location for several dishes including chicken biryani (especially the hyderabadi version), both chicken and paneer tikka masala, and samosas. We both are in LOVE LOVE LOVE with their paneer tikka masala!!!! Try it! I would suggest eating it with the garlic naan...making my mouth water now! 

It's such a treat having them in the neigborhood! The take out is quick and always ready in time too.
