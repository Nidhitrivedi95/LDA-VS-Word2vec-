UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We were looking for Indian food while visiting Las Vegas and came across this gem on Yelp. When we walked in we were pleasantly surprised with the lunch buffet and didn't expect to have an all you can eat. 

The buffet had multiple options for vegetarians, vegans and meat lovers like myself! It was DELICIOUS! Very flavorful and delicious! Great environment, polite staff, cleanliness, affordable ($11.99 for all you can eat) and overall a great find. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
