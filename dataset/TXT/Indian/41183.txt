PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ The king of Indian buffet. .. this is 3rd trip to Toronto to enjoy some delicious Indian food. My stops on the food trip to Toronto :- Tim Horton,  Maroli, Tandoori flames, Lahore paan and kashmiri tea, King dumplins, guru laxmi.  I love the buffet and the wide spread of Indian varieties at tandoori flames. The decor is modern-day Indian style, the wait staff is very friendly however very busy to attend each table as well. The punjabi food is finger licking good. Pani puri and chaat is average.  Pav bhaji is delicious but a bit softer Pav would have been great. Desserts are all delicious. .. soups are below average , should put up more variety!!!  Best dish - daal makhani. ... loved it.  Was disappointed that they didn't have idly or dosa but then my next stop was guru laxmi! !!
