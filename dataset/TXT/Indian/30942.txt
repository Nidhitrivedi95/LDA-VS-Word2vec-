kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w My 10-year-old loves Maharani! We've tried a few other Indian restaurants in Charlotte and keep coming back to Maharani because the quality of the food is so consistent. The butter chicken, samosas and vegetable pakora are our favorites. The takeout portions are large and they almost always arrive piping hot.
