Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ My mom and I have been coming here for the Sunday lunch buffet for the last 10 years. The food is always consistent and I've never had a bad experience. I'm not sure why people are saying there's a small selection, there's always at least three appetizers, ten entrees, two types of naan, a salad bar, and at least four desserts. The only entree that is remotely sweet is the korma. Yes, the decor is dated, but my primary concern is the food. The service is very good too, they're not the most talkative staff but they're good about filling your water and taking your dirty plates away.
