MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ Waitress was very weird and pretty much unhappy for no reason? Got irritated over asking difference between two beer choices and how much rice we'd get for sharing 5 dishes as a family of 6. We were the only table there besides 1 older couple at the bar. The food was great but the waitress was just not "with it."
