OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Good food. Good portions. Good taste. We came in late but they allowed us in. Service was a little slow, but it was understandable given we were the last orders and came in after closing time. Our beer was also covered for because the waiter forgot about it for a while. We ordered portions of naan while we were served tandoori roti. We accepted the goof-up as it was late, we were hungry and the food tasted good. 
I would go to the length to say that this was the best indian food I've had in a long time. Over all it was a good experience. 
P.S. The pan shots were really nice!
