7d2LqDc0Cb5dcizil_h34A Food was amazing! Definitely recommend the steamed momos and the chef's special fried rice. We had the Thai soup, Hot and Sour soup (both are tasty if you like spicy food), chicken momos, beef momos (yum yum!), chef's special friend rice with chicken (really enjoyed this) and chicken chilli (we liked this better than the chicken tangra, and they can adjust to your preferred level of spiciness).
