When my co-worker mentioned that the food at Toddy Shop reminded him of the cuisine from his Dad's region of South India, I figured this place would be good. It did not disappoint. We ordered the Hawt Wings (for my son), Queen Karimeen, Rasta Wings, and Chicken Manchurian (an off-the-menu special). My son absolutely loved the Hawt Wings... the heat was just right for him and the accompanying fries were excellent. (I stole a few!) The Queen Karimeen was awesome... moist, flaky, flash-fried Pompano fish with perfect seasoning and a just-right spicy masala. The Chicken Manchurian was great as well. It has a touch more spice than what my girlfriend liked, but it was spot-on for my palette. The Rasta Wings paired well with the hoppy IPA I had at home.

Just to reiterate the other observations here, this place is slightly smoky sports bar. And, of course, it is 21 and over... so no bringing the kids here. But the food is worth any inconvenience you may encounter. This was a beautifully made meal and the attention to detail from the chef was very evident. I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!
