ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. I have not been here in years and after my dinner I am now wondering what kept me away for so long. This is a little place so it is intimate and fun. You can just hang out with some friends enjoy the great food. I like going during the lunch time buffet but we were there for dinner so I was not able to sample as much of the dishes as I would have liked. Still we did pretty good. 

Appetizers:

Paneer Pakora: Homemade cheese chunks deep fried. Of course this is my go to appetizer at any Indian restaurant. I will say that here I did not get as many of the pakora chunks as some of the other places I have ordered this from, but still they were good. 

2 piece Vegetable Samosa: I think that the name suggests it all. There were two crispy turnovers filled with potatoes and peas. Yum. Just the right size. The three of us were able to eat these and they filled us up really nicely. 

Vegetable Pakora: Fritters stuffed with vegetables. These were fantastic. Fried perfection. The sauce that it came with was also really good. I enjoyed these more than my favorite dish of the paneer pakora. YUM. Would get this again if I had to pick only one appy. 

Main dish: 

Ok, I am a little bit of a glutton but I like a good deal. I am trying to find on their online menu what the dish that I ordered was called but I cannot find it listed at all. It is the best deal on the entire menu. You get a chicken or a lamb curry dish, a yogurt dish, a pickle dish, a piece of tandoori chicken, a dessert, and some naan. OH WAIT. You also get a cup of chai tea. It is the best deal on the menu. You can also get this in a veggie dish so you do not have to get meat. It is about the same price as just the curry. Why would you not just for a few dollars more get this with all the extras!!

I liked it here. I had a great time and the food was wonderful. I suggest coming here for a nice dinner or lunch alone or with friends.
