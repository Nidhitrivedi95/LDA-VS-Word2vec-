UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I have been looking for good Indian food, predominantly in the West end (imho all the Indian restaurants in the Junction are mediocre) in Toronto for several years.    I have finally found amazing Indian food here!  The naan is light and fluffy.  The sauces are flavourful and not too greasy.  The service is great - prompt and courteous.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are satisfying.  Plus there is free parking.  All in all we had a great experience and there is a sheltered patio that you can just to sit under with plenty of seating.
