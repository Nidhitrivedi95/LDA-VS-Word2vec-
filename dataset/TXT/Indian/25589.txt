It had been years since I last tried Indian food and thanks to a special friend who is a regular at Mantra Massala, I was able to order with confidence and enjoy a great meal. I was pleased with the level of spices in the dishes. The service was at a slower pace than most other establishments, but it set the tone for the evening. No need to rush your meal, just sit back and relax. I loved the authentic dishes and silverware our meals were served on as well as the decor. I was a bit apprehensive about ordering too spicy of a meal, but I am happy to report that the next morning my tummy is feeling fine. 
I encourage you to try Mantra for yourself I think you will be pleased.
