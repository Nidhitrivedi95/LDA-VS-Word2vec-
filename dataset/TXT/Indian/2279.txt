_nmOWqgx_KdLrj5pehDQmg I decided to try this place out since it's near my place and I had never had Pakistani or Afghan food before. The guy was very helpful with my menu questions about the new food. I got a dish that was a popular one and it was tasty. The only issue was it was loaded with the yogurt sauce. I had to scrap most of it off. I would recommend asking for light sauce or on the side if you get a dish with the yogurt sauce. Otherwise, i will go back to try other items.
