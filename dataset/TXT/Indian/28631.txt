JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg Another one of our favs!  Food is excellent and quality!  Another regular for us until we moved out of area.  In fact we lived them so much we used them for our wedding reception (our second one as we had an Island wedding out of country in Jamaica). Only suggestion is their prawn curry use to be perfect and then it started to get over cooked the last few times I ordered.  Our fav's are the chicken lababdar and lamb vindaloo!
