ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Hands-down, one of the best meals I've ever had in Charlotte (and I've lived here for 10 years). From the service to the ambiance, all the way to the last bite of our dessert, everything was exceptional. Copper is now at the top of my life for any occasion. I cannot wait to go back. (And, Great date night spot- even with the garlic Naan!)
