UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I enjoyed dinner here a lot - the service was outstanding with lots of suggestions and guidance. I ordered the mango chicken - "how spicy on a scale of 1 to 10...", asked our waiter, "...10 being a volcano and 1 being a babbling brook!" I ummm and then ordered 7. That was a modestly spicy curry with a sweet tang to it just as promised. The  stuffed paratha has some potato and peas, but not enough for my Indian colleague's liking ;).

This place is also a hidden gem for beer. The beer menu is extensive, but there were also an additional 15 beers recently added! "Take a look before you choose", said our waiter as he pointed to the table with 20 beer bottles on. So I did. And came back with a pint bottle of Belgian lager. Very nice with my mango chicken.

Try this place. I didn't try the buffet. All in all, the portions are good - my colleague and I shared the curry and rice and we had paratha each. I had a beer too and the bill was $38 incl tip. The decor isn't as nice as the Nepalese place in Pasadena, CA, but it's pleasant enough. 

Our taxi driver didn't know the name of this place but he'd seen it. But, considering Vegas isn't necessarily a place of culture it's no bad thing if Himalayan is a little obscure and off the beaten track.
