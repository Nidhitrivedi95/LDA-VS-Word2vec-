9coZa838egYONxSdTe-wUg July 6th, 2014 - My first taste of Nepali dish at a Nepali Restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA after living in the city for more than a decade. Any my experience was just "A-OK". 

We were driving back from Ohiopyle from a long weekend of hiking and biking - when we decided to stop here for dinner. The restaurant sitting area and a "party hall" was being vacuumed as we walked in. I was told that a wedding party had just ended but the restaurant was still open for business. The restaurant has more of a cafeteria/dinner settings with a row of corner booths.

Now comes the mouth watering part - which we were hoping for. Since it's supposed a Nepali Ethnic Restaurant, we chose to order only Nepali dish. We were a group of five - so we ordered the Non Veg Thali for 2 (chicken and mutton), chicken chowmein, Chicken Momo and Chicken curry with Rice. Apparently they were out of Chicken Momos so we got the Veg Momo instead. Everything seemed fresh and the Manager assured that everything was cooked fresh and from scratch. There's also several Indian Dish on the Menu which was a lot cheaper compared to the Nepali Dish which I can understand but the Thali in my opinion seemed a bit high. As a Nepalese and having cooked and tasted Nepali Dish myself - the food here was okay and authentic to some extend.

Everyone working here was very friendly and the service was pretty good. My recommendation to fellow yelpers if you happen visit this place - stick to the Nepali Dish.
