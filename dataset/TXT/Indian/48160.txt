TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA This place has lost my vote completely .... Used to be an awesome South Indian buffet for breakfast with hot kaapi served with idli dosa and wada and a background music of suprabhatam to augment your weekend into a bliss... But off late the service is unbearable... I used to go as the food was atleast better than the others... Today the food also was a huge let down! Sambhar with no sambhar aroma just daal with tempering of curry leaves and mustard seeds and idli, dosa, wada all undercooked and stone like texture and not to mention cold ..... And a background music of titanic? Really? This has to be a management issue.. Even the rava upma was disastrous ... The table was not even served water! 
I would just like to add is this restaurant was special to me and I used to come here very often... This is a yelp alert to other people to avoid this place and not to get their heart broken like me! 

If you are still thinking to try this place let me tell you they don't have gulab jun the only star entry of this place and have some cheap kesari... 
Thank you for not going and trying out Cora's adjacent to this shit
