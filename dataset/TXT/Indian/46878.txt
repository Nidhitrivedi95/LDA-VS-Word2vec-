t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg The guy who works behind the bar at night is really nice. We got a to go order once and my lamb curry was amazing! My mango lassi was on point as well. During dinner it is kind of pricey like most Indian places (if u don't go to the buffet) but lunch prices are worth the trip. The chicken tikka was great and the naan is so good here!
