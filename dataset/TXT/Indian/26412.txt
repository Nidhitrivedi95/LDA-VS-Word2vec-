ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg We recently went to Copper with some friends. Our friends fell in love with this place after a few visits, so my fiancée and I couldn't pass up the opportunity. Whenever I come to Charlotte we always find a good place to dine. Copper is located in the Dillworth area, the home of so many great restaurants. My fiancée didn't see Chicken Korma on the menu but they made it for her anyway. Chicken Korma is her favorite dish so that made our night. I ordered the Saag Chicken and to my delight it was perfection. All of our dishes were fresh and the service was great. If you love Indian cuisine this place is a must visit.
