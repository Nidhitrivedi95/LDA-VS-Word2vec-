ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I love trying new things. Including ethnic food. We ended up at Copper because my mom was in town and we wanted to be adventurous. She lives in a small rural town where "chinese" is the only real ethnic option. Her question, "Do they have things without curry? I don't like the spice."

So the Mr checked out the menu and found just the perfect thing for her: a dish with chicken in a tomatoey cream sauce. Let's just say that my mom was victorious. She ate it all. Unapologetically.

As for the Mr, he got something with lamb. I tried the sauce and was impressed.

I ordered something with spinach and fingerling potatoes. It was "spicy," but my nose wasn't running 5 minutes in, so it wasn't THAT spicy. The flavors were just perfect.

We ordered the naan, and it's my favorite of all the Indian places I've tried. It's served with a few sauces - my favorite was the fruity one, followed by the herby green one. (Yes, I know, I could look up the names, but I can't even pronounce them!)

Notes:

Service was wonderful. We arrived on a Saturday night at 6:15 with a reservation, sat outside, and were treated tremendously, despite our lack of ordering alcohol. Our server was very kind, thoughtful, offered a recommendation when asked, and according to mom, smelled good. (Always a plus.)

I don't know why other people have complained about service, because ours was just so outstanding.

As we were leaving, the inside was starting to fill up, so reservations, especially on a weekend, are a good idea.

It was a very positive experience for us, and we can't wait to go back!
