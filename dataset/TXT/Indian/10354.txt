9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w We came here with a large group of family on a Friday evening. The staff was very accommodating of our group, especially since we arrived at different times. 

All of the food was all delicious, but the paneer tikka was A-Mazing!! Best paneer I've ever tasted. I had to stop myself from eating more because I knew we still had several courses coming. Do yourself a favour and order it! yum yum yum.
