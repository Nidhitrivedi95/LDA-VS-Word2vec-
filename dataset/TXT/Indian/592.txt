-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw Hemant Kishore aka the 6-Pack Chef is making delicious Southern Indian specialties in this unassuming locale. Tucked in the back of the Inn-Zone gaming bar off US-95 and Rainbow, Hemant serves up authentic Kerala street food. 

Having lived in Singapore for some time, I was taken right back to Serangoon Road when I tasted the curry leaf in the Kappa and Konj. Beautifully spiced prawns on a bed of creamy mashed tapioca. Loved the heat! Probably the highlight of the meal.

Masala chicken chunks perfectly seasoned and tender with basmati rice = a classic biriyani (served in a clay pot added much appreciated presentation). 

Though not often pointed out by most diners - I love when a chef executes a perfect, simple salad. A light ponzu dressing of hand selected lettuces, elegantly seasoned with picked red onions.

Hemant is a consummate professional, executing top notch cuisine. His unique expression of regional Indian cooking is informative, inspiring, and give us a taste of India far beyond butter chicken, dahl, and naan.
