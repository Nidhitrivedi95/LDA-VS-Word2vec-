Besides the lack of variety and quality of food, customer service is a myth in this restaurant. And is was our bad luck that the restaurateur was there that day. Here are few snippets on what happened on my first visit:-

Scene 1:-
Me - We are 3 of us, I think we will sit here (the center table).
Restaurateur - If you sit here you gotta pay for 6 as it has 6 chairs (LOL). You should sit there.
Me - But there are 4 chairs there. Does that mean we have to pay for 4?
Restaurateur - I'll remove one chair so that you don't have to pay for the 4th (And he actually did so, ridiculous)

Scene 2:-
Me - Can I get a spoon.
Restaurateur - All the spoons are there in the counter buddy (And waled away)

Scene 3:-
Me - (I took the plate with me for a second serving unmindfully, students you see :-P)
Restaurateur - You don't follow buffet etiquette, do you? You need to take fresh plates if you are taking food. (This was too much)
Me - Sorry, I have not been to buffet's where I do not enjoy. This' my first time.

In fact, I was new to the rude nature of a restaurant manager along with bad food. And then, the bill was thrown at us much before we were even done eating.

Except for the helpful waiters, nothing is worth the $11 heavy price. Avoid this place. There are plenty of other options available nearby.
