K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I really like this place. This was my second time there.   The food is very good, reasonably priced and very authentic.    Waiter very nice and helpful.  Very clean and presentation is nice.   Both times I went it wasn't busy.   They also do take out.   No complaints.    The only thing I was leery about is when you go in all the tables have filled water pitchers. You have no way of knowing how long it sat with no cover.  But that wouldn't stop me  from going back.    Great nan ( bread ).  Will go back
