B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog I've had better Indian food, especially for the price.  But, they are in the old port of Montreal, someone has to pay for that rent!  I've also had better service, the waiter was a real jack ass.  The guy I went with did not leave a tip due to the poor service, and the waiter followed us into the street accosting him for a tip.

I ordered saag paneer ($17), it tasted good but it arrived in small quantity, and the naan, while good is expensive at $4 per piece.   Note that they also close between lunch and dinner seating's. 

I do not plan on returning to this restaurant
