jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q The food is authentic from the appetizers to the main entrees.  The customer service was great. Mani our server was fun to talk and laugh with. They had live music by Miko which was enjoyable to listen too. There's a view of the Vegas strip and the planes. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!
