LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I was surprised at how nice the restaurant was! My boyfriend and I ordered the mysore dosa and onion rava dosa both with aloo (potatoes). I was really impressed with the variety of dosas available. We also got mango lassis! The waiter was also very nice and we didn't have an issue with the service. I will definitely be coming back here again!
