DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Great food , large portions. The Gobi Manchurian recommended by our server Judy was the best. Dosas and N Indian items that we ordered exceeded our expectations. Friendly service Nice ambience and spacious for business as well as large group entertainment. With Madras Ananda Bhavan to the North and Udupi to the South of the city, folks in Phoenix wanting authentic Indian Veg fare are well covered.
