qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA To my knowledge, The Red Room, Green Room, Java on Queen, and the new Nirvana on College at Bathurst all have the same owners, and essentially the same menu. Or at least the same way of preparing food (usually with ketchup in the Pad Thai, sadly).

And for some reason, the Red Room is the worst of the four. I've had good and bad experiences there, but mostly bad. I heard through the grapevine that the wait staff are told upon being hired that they're allowed to be as rude as they want to customers because the food is cheap. So, naturally, they are very rude. Not cool.

But if I were in court, that would be hearsay, so here's my real evidence: once, at Red Room, my friend found a ladybug in her sandwich. Ew.

Not to mention the place is usually filled with frat boy douche bags and GTA-ers on their way to see "a friend's band play Battle of the Bands at the El Mo!! Sweet!"

I say ditch Red Room and walk down to Nirvana at Bathurst -- slightly higher prices but much nicer restaurant, tastier food, a lower percentage of douches, and friendlier staff. And no ladybug sandwiches yet.
