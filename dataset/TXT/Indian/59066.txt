yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I was suspicious about the great reviews, but being a lover of Indian food, had to find out for myself. Don't believe the hype and fake reviews. While the interior is nicely decorated, the food quality and selection is mediocre at best. They have about 15-20 selections and NOT the 45 items that another review claims. Surprisingly, they lacked the standard staples of lunch buffets like pakora, samosas, saag, and even kheer. While the naan and chutneys were ok, the currys and dahl were subpar. They tasted watered down and lacked the spice and complexity that they ought to have. According to their website, they were supposed to have some Indo-Chinese type dishes in their buffet but those items were completely absent. For dessert, they had some weird vermicelli served in a warm and sweet milk, reminiscent of kheer, but not tasting very good. Regardless, now that I know better, I'll be sticking with my tried and true favorites, i.e. Mt. Everest.
