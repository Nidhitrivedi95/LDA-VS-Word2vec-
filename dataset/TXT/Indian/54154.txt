vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw I would give 4 stars for food only but service was terrible so overall it's a 3.

We booked a table for 2 on a sunday night at 6:30pm. The restaurant wasn't full but we had to wait at least 5mins to get seated. 

We weren't offered water or any drinks or service until almost 15mins of just sitting there. We finally had to grab any server walking by to let them know we wanted something. Even that, it took him awhile to come back.

We waited at least 30mins for our food after placing the order because I saw the server forgot to punch it in. When the order came it was messed up, some things we didn't order they placed on the table and somethings that we order didn't come. We only ordered 3 things and still they can manage to mess up.

There were only a older and a younger male servers working so maybe lack of staff? 

After we were finished eating, we wanted to grab the bill and pack home the leftovers. Not surprised, it took us 15mins to get a server to do so. After asking the older server which he didn't care and forgot about it so we had to ask the other one. 

I asked for the bill and told him specifically that I need the machine because I was paying by card. He comes back 20mins later with only the bill. I told him I'm paying by card and he walks off maybe trying to look for the machine or doing something else, I don't know. 

By that time I was super fed up, it was just waiting and waiting and more waiting. Before he came back I just paid by cash leaving little tips. I don't understand why there was so much waiting when the restaurant wasn't even full.

However, besides the waiting and crappy service. The food was great! The curry was just spicy enough with a kick to it and not over powering. Naan tasted great, light and crispy. I would definitely go back again for the food itself only!!
