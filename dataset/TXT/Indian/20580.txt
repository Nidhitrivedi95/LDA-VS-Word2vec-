fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw First of all I would just like to state what is required to have a restaurant, just 2 things. Food and service, this place does have both but they are do very bad at both. I stopped in here with my family for dinner and with an empty restaurant it took 5 min before we got sat by a individual that seemed he was at home rather than work. He greeted us with no uniform and wearing sandals, and then pointed to the table he wanted us to be seated, not very professional. Next he took our order mind you wearing sandals and a toothpick in his mouth. The food was edible but as all the yelpers are pointing out its extraordinary and worthy of 5 stars, Far From It!!! Bland and boring Indian food at best. I am guessing yelpers feel pity for this restaurant and the price is reasonable that is what people prefer. I however like to pay good money for good  authentic Indian food.
