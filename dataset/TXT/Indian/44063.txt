RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Have to say that Lahore Tikka House is my abso-favourite for Pakistani/Punjabi food. 

Bring your mental passport, because, when you walk through that door, you leave white-bread country behind you. That first whiff of spices stirs the mirrorwork hangings, and boom-shaka-laka - you're at a lorry driver's dhaba on the Grand Trunk Road. (I mean that in the good way). Take a number at the front counter and walk to a table in the restaurant's fragrant belly - an adventure is about to begin.

My favourite: a lamb biryani with tender cubes of lamb on and off the bone, with a pair of grilled sea-salt sprinkled green chillies for explosive oral pleasure. Their kababs cooperatively fall apart in the mouth allowing you to fit in more in short order. Their palak is lovely - I hate the mush that you find so often in other places - here the fibrous pleasures of leafy spinach are actually left intact. Try the haleem - I describe it as beaten-wheat-and-meat garnished with matchsticks of ginger. The only thing missing is an ice cold beer - they don't serve any alcohol.

Finish with the home-made malai kulfi, pressed around chopsticks to round off your multicultural mouth-and-mind-blowing trip. 

It's a big finish. Walk all the way home. Even if you live in the west end.
