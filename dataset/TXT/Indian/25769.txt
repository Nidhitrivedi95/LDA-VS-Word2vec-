HY5IM3dzUgO8yNgi9c0DIw This place was GREAT. Bring your own wine, cheap prices and good food. What more can you ask for :) I had the butter chicken thali which was delicious and only 7.99 for dinner. WOW. My boyfriend has the lamb vindaloo and mentioned that it was just the right amount of spicy. The servers we're friendly and we left paying only $25 with tips! For dinner, this is really good pricing and you eat well. I would recommend this place!
