8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ Avitania's claim on eating the best butter chicken was true. It was so true that skipping out on my weekly Pilates class made it a perfect excuse. Instead of squeezing and neutralizing my core, I exercised my belly's muscles and satiated my happy emotions by eating yummy Indian food. 

My BCF highlights included and a must order for others:
- Tandoori Chicken
- Channa masala
- Lamb Vandaloo
- Aloo Gobi 
- Naan
- Sweet dessert balls

My love for paneer remains unwavered and I just loved their crispy paneer appetizers. I think I had seconds of the creamy paneer curry. 

The food wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be. However I do recall that we didn't specify to the kitchen that we wanted our food spicy, so they did us a favour by playing it safe.  

My only disappointment: Butter Chicken Factory does not deliver in my area.
