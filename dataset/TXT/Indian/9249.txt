In any case, if you don't mind an informal atmosphere and counter service, this place is great!

The curried goat (we splurged and ordered the boneless at $8.99) was wonderfully tender and came not only with rotis but with doubles, a kind of think taco filled and a chickpea and sauce mixture.  Delicious and our server gave us extras to make up for a slight mistake in the order.  Another member of our party had the curried chicken which was also wonderful.  Rotis were nice and soft and hot, and you can have them either on the side or as a wrap for your food.  They also sell packaged Caribbean food items ad even CD's.  The goat meat was flavourful and butter tender.

Atmosphere is worn, but who cares with such great food at bargain prices.

The lady who took our order was very friendly and helpful.

They have a lot of unusual soft drinks from the islands, too.
