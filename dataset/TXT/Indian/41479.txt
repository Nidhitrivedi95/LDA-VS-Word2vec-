Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I love this place! Nice and very friendly staff. My sister is a regular (and I would be if I lived on the west side!).  If you're craving Indian and do not know what to order, the lunch buffet is where it's at!  I'm one of those picky types, where decisions are difficult for me, so a buffet is perfect.  Plus, if you're not familiar with Indian food, then it would no fun if you chose something from the menu and ended up not liking it!

And this place crushes all stereotypes of a buffet. It always is clean, the food is ALWAYS fresh (no crunchy rice), and they serve a wonderful variety of dishes. Chicken masala is my favorite with the vegetable fritters.   And they always bring the naan out right away, and it's so warm...mmm, just what you need on a cold day!

Cheap too, I always leave stuffed and ready for a nap!
