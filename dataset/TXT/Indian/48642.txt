Came here for one thing, their Falooda. Total came to about $4. This cool and sweet dessert is made up of Rose Syrup, Vermicelli, Basil Seeds, Jelly, Tapioca Pearls, Milk and Ice Cream (Kulfi). It pretty much has everything under the sun in it. It's one of my favorite desserts and not a lot of restaurants prepare it. I am so glad to have stumbled upon Pak Centre. 

The restaurant is incredibly clean and the decor is modern. The cashier was friendly and quick. I will have to go back to try the food. 

If you are unfamiliar with this dessert and enjoy trying new things, definitely give it a whirl!
