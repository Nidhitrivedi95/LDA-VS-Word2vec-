ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ Easily my favorite Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. I was introduced to People's by a friend about 16 years ago. He grew up eating Indian food and told me that people's was the best around. Now that I have traveled and tried Indian food in many different places, I have to say I still favor people's. 

Also, aside from the quality of food, the staff is always very kind and the restaurant is always clean. And the price of the lunch buffet is awesome. I especially recommend the lunch buffet for first timers who maybe don't know what they want, but are interested in trying Indian food. 

The samosa are the best and I can't get enough of the aloo gobi!
