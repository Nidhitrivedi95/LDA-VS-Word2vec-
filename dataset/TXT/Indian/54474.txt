W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg My friends and I enjoy going to this restaurant because of the authentic South Indian food. However, in the past two visits, we have always been rushed by the same waiter. While we were still ordering the main course, he wanted to know what we would like for dessert! There was still two hours left for the restaurant to close! Next time we went, he took away our plates while we were still eating. Before I could tell him to leave the plates, he disappeared into the kitchen...What's the hurry!?  Food is great, but we have been disappointed with the service repeatedly. I won't be recommending this restaurant to my friends, or visiting it again soon.
