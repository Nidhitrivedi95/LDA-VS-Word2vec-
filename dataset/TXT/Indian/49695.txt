tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Wow.  I don't even know where to begin with this review.  I will not rattle off all of the names of the dishes to try because quite simply every single dish I have tried at this place is absolutely fabulous.  We always go for the buffet because its the best way to taste a little bit (or a lot) of everything and the price is unbeatable.  The staff super friendly and courteous!  The spectacular food and a nice tall cold Taj makes for an unbelievable dinner...or lunch.

This place is five stars all the way!   When you compare what you get for your money elsewhere, this place takes the prize.  Every person we bring to this restaurant is amazed and you will be amazed too!
