5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ Definitely putting this place on the rotation. I had the chicken saag and lamb samosas. Both were fantastic. This little gem is hidden away in chesterland but I hope more people find it. The interior has a slight diner feel (probably what it was before these guys moved in)  but the food and the service are both fantastic!
