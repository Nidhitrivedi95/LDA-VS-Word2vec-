7RiNqNy0pbqlR3-uG9rNUw I've had Indian food across different continents around the world and have to say this place has the best Chicken Tandoori, Goat Curry, and even Mango Lassi I've ever had. Great, quiet little restaurant, never crowded and service is awesome. Check this place out when you're in town next. Not too far from my flat in Stuttgart either.
