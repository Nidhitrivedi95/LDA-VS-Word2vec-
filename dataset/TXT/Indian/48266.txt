ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA All I can say the place was clean and comfortable we went for dinner ordered drinks and several dishes to split all the food was awesome . Knocked off a star because  never saw waiter again after we ordered too see of we needed more drinks . But a very nice lady maybe owner did come by and see if everything was ok . This place is a big yes to go to . Food arrived in a timely manor and was very good
