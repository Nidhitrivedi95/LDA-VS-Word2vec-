DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg Went here tonight with 2 friends. The beef samosas are amazing. We ordered the chili chicken which took 40 minutes to come out. We were pretty much ready to leave. Had to ask for water multiple times before we got it. Asked for napkins and only got the one wrapped with the spoon and fork. The chili chicken was lacking in everything. It wasn't even hot, the top looked dried out and there was way too many onions. The chicken itself was dry and not spicy or very tasteful. i'd go back for take out samosas, thats about it.
