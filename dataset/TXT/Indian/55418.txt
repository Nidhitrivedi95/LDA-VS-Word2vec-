X-sqtBx78QDbX8kVbqF-dg We couldn't be bothered to wait 30-45 minutes for either Maison and Punjab, but our lack of patience and growling stomachs took us to Chand Palace. 

We saw a dude waiting in front of us carrying a bottle so we were like AWEEESOOOME!!! And we were the second group to be seated so we were like SCOOORE!!!  We were afraid that the food was gonna be gringo-fied, but it wasn't so we were like HAIL YEAAA!!!  You get the picture.

We got three mains all delicious - palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, lamb biryani and garlic naan - all for $35 inc tax and tips. Pretty amazing! We got super jealous when everyone at the table next to us had the little lunch box tray. Aw well next time! We'll definitely be back.
