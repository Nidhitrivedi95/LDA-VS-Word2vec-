ezDMJGONUEy1DyGSJ3vUJw In the mood for Indo-Pakistani food?

Come here on a weekend and you will not be disappointed.

Each and every time my daughters attend a weekend birthday party, my wife is the one that takes them.  Where does daddy go?  I go to Copper Kettle for a lunch buffet.

I am very fond of the seemingly endless combinations of flavors and textures Indo-Paki food presents.  I am no stranger to spicy food.  I love it and it loves me.  Whenever I get a chance to go to Copper Kettle, I am in my "happy place".

Let's say you are a first-timer.. All you need to do is tell the server and he/she will take you on a tour of the buffet tables and give you an impromptu education on the cuisine.  I know this because a few years ago, my wife felt very inquisitive and asked about the dishes they were offering.  She found the waiter to be very helpful.

The best way to can "break the ice", experience and learn about another culture is to eat their food.  Give this place a try.  You'll be glad you did.
