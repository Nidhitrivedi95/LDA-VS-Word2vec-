TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA We dropped into here for supper on a whim and were pleasantly surprised.  This restaurant is in a converted house on Craig Street in Oakland.  It's clean and well kept with hardwood floors and maybe a dozen tables.

The art on the walls caught our attention right away.  There were two large paintings of flowers, one with the anatomy of the flower below, as you might find it in a biology text book.  They were bright and strong and a pleasure to look at while eating.

We took a look at the menu, and I was pleased to see there was a large vegetarian section.  I forget the full name of my dish, but it was potato cauliflower curry and it had fresh cilantro and ginger in it.  I ordered the medium and I wish it had been a little hotter.  I ordered a roti to go with it, but was disappointed that it appeared to be made out of white flour, though the menu said it was to be whole wheat.

My dinner compadres ordered channa masala and a lamb dish and some creamy vegetable curry.  I tried the channa masala, it was okay, but again, could have used some kick.

I know what you're thinking... if you like kick, order HOT!  Well... the lamb dish we got was hot, uncomfortably so.  Apparently what we wanted is medium-hot.  Oh well... you never know on your first visit to a restaurant what they mean when they say hot.

This place gets four stars because the meals were fresh and the service was prompt and courteous.  I'll defiantly go back again, and next time ask for medium-hot.
