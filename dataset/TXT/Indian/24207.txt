gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg Charkha, thank you for serving great food and being so close to where I live!

Fun fact: if you look at Charkha on Google Maps and do street view, you can actually look INSIDE the restaurant! Try it - you can go "inside." Thought this was pretty cool.

I walked into Charkha one afternoon, desperate for some Indian food and a place to study for the GMATs. This was sometime between lunch and dinner, so the place was pretty empty. The servers were really nice - I told them I was trying to get some work done, so they gave me a larger table even though I was by myself.

I was a bit boring and ordered the Tikka Masala, but it was extremely delicious as well as filling - it came with rice, and I ordered some naan to scoop up the excess sauce. The meal came out really quickly, so I didn't actually get much work done, but it was super delicious and perfectly spicy (they ask you what level you want). My waiter frequently checked on me and refilled my water (very necessary), and was exceptionally polite.

I'm going to be back - I'd like to see how their lunch buffet is.
