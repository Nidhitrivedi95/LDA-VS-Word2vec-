Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg I wanted to really like this place.  The food was good and I would go back for it.  The atmosphere was dark.  A little too dark; we couldnt read the menus.  We were brough minature flashlights to help us out.  Appart from that the decor was quite nice compared to other indian restaurants I have been to.   I would recommend the naan bread; some of the best I have ever had.
