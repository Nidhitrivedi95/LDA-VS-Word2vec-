5Ua5a941Wf5pTmUNz_MSsQ Uh oh, this one is on the struggle bus.  I didn't check Yelp, but rather, just stumbled upon it while looking around downtown Charlotte for a quick lunch.   I walked in and a man behind the counter gave me a spooky stare, which persisted the entire time I was looking at the menu/dishes (not sure what that was about).  I asked him if he had any vegetarian options (couldn't really tell from the menu), to which he replied: "you should try goat".  Nope, but how about the vegetarian biryani?  He said, oh yes, we have.   I got it and it was funky monkey, sort of like rice-a-roni with some poorly fried veggie things hidden in the luke warm center.  I was ridiculously hungry so I still ate about half of it; maybe I should have gone with the goat?
