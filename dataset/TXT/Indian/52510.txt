UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw My wife and I am eating the lunch buffet here about 4-5 times and totally love it. The owner is very friendly and very sweet person. Their dishes are very flavorful I would highly recommend you check this place out because some of the other places in the area are not good at all and this place really rocks! My only wish is that they had a buffet at night
