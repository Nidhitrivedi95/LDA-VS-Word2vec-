UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Good Indian food can be hard to come by in the Cleve, so I'm jazzed to have found this little curry cave on Euclid! The outside of the joint doesn't do it justice, but once I went in I could tell by the aromas wafting from the tandoor that I was in for a treat!

On my first visit a friend and I split an order of the chicken tikka masala and the palak paneer (my go-to bellwether for assessing any Indian place); it was impossible to decide which was more delectable! The masala was so smooth, creamy, and flavorful as to inspire an addictive response and the palak paneer was so fresh that I could taste each of the individual spices and aromatics (ginger, garlic, onion, chili, garam masala) on my palate in each bite. 

This first visit surely won't be my last and I look forward to trying more of what Indian Flame has to offer!
