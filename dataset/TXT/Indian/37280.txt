O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Such a wonderful place! They have a great, comprehensive buffet, and the owners are so nice and helpful - read about their story in the other reviews. It's delicious Indian/Nepalese food not just for Ohio, but in general. And their naan bread is amazing. I support this restaurant so much!
