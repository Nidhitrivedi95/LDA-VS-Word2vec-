uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw Ordered food, person at front didn't seem like they knew what was on the menu. Had to point out they served butter chicken. Ordered food at 10:15. Told me it was a 15 - 20 minute wait. Came back at 10:35 and person at cash explained it was another 20 minute wait. Went to discuss with the rest of the group if they willing to wait. When they said no, I went back to cancel the order and apparently now it only took 5 more minutes. So decided to entertain the idea. Every 5 minutes they kept stringing me along saying it's done and coming up. Lastly, at 10:55 I was upset and ready to demand my money back. He said only 1 minute and surprisingly it came out. We ordered a chicken roll, chicken Briyani, and butter chicken. The chicken roll and Briyani was cold. The Briyani was lacking flavour. The butter chicken was hot. The food at best is average. Definitely wouldn't go back again. Overall, food wasn't good, service was a nightmare, and nothing special about pricing. Wouldn't go back, and wouldn't recommend it either.
