A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA I love this place. The food is fantastic and you can't beat the value. The servers are very accommodating and always sweet to our kids. 

The dosas are exceptional as is their masala chai. My kids love the paranthas, and I'm also a fan of their chili pakoras.

And if you develop a craving, you can always get delivery through Uber Eats.
