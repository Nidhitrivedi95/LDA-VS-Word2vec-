kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA Kalpna offers vegetarian dinning to the street of Newington. Although it's location is a bit bizarre (and parking can be an issue) it's quality is still great and service very efficient.
What really bugs me about this place is the decor. It's going for an Indian-Style but man is it busy! All the walls are covered top to bottom with little mirrors which in my point of view is a bit tacky and rather distracting. Other than this I am not big fan of the interior layout, the tables giving a feeling of limited space and too clustered together. 

However, it's a decent vegetarian Restaurant in the area.
