UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I have been here multiple times and have never been disappointed with the food. Their dinner menu as well as buffet selection is great. The food is very authentic and to be very honest they serve some of the best Indian food in the country. The only downside is the service. During my multiple visits what I have observed is that they are understaffed. Just one server most of the times taking orders! And I guess that level of stress have made them to act rude sometimes. Long delays in service still hasn't stopped me to visit here again and again. I would be great if their service improves.
