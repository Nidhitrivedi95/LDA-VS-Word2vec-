The food itself isn't bad. I ordered chicken tikka masala mild because much as I love spice, my stomach makes me pay for it days later. Better safe than sorry!

Their chicken tikka masala isn't laden with sugar like other places. In fact, it's the opposite. Tons of fenugreek and methi in it makes it almost sour/bitter, but still in a good way. 

Portions are HUGE for what I normally get in a lot of Indian restaurants and prices are proportionate to serving -- thank you so much for that. I wasn't a fan of their Onion Kulcha because it had a slightly bitter taste that didn't go well with my CTM, but on its own, it was fabulous. It was also piping hot - that's hard to find in a lot of places.

I'd come back and try their buffet.
