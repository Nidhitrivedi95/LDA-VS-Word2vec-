5eDg_Y2N6aU_k7tIxoFXTg I arrived to the restaurant at 8:55 pm not knowing it closed at 9:00 pm, however, Mo, the owner, welcomed us in and invited us to take a seat. The restaurant is airy, new and you will never feel claustrophobic. 

They have a all you can eat special where everything is cooked to order. The food is fresh, flavorful and authentic. The owner surprised us with a complimentary order of onion rings and the Indian tamarind sauce. Very nice touch. 

I was blown away with the taste, presentation and attention to detail. I will highly recommend you pay a visit to this new restaurant and offer Mo the opportunity to delight your palate with the authentic taste of India.
