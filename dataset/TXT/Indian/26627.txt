ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Came here last night with a few of my friends after just getting back into town. We showed up around 8 and were placed in the front room facing the street. First off, it was extremely hot in this room. My guests and I were sweating during our entire meal. It definitely put a damper on the evening. We looked at both the regular menu and the restaurant week, we all opted to go with the regular menu. We started out with the gunpowder prawns, good but nothing special. When the food arrived at the table I noticed my order was incorrect. I apologized and let her know it wasn't what I ordered (chicken tikka masala) and she apologized and took the order back. Around ten minutes later our server brought the same dish over (sesame chicken) and told me that's what I had ordered, I'm sorry but no, as a server myself I know that's something you never do. One of my friends doesn't like spicy and he told her that the sauce on her dish is already made and that it wasn't that spicy. Now I love spicy food and told him I wanted mine spicy. Her dish was way spicier than mine. Honestly I enjoyed myself and probably will return if I'm in the area again. Hopefully it won't be as hot next time!
