fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Initially, from the reviews this sounded like a great place to to, so a friend decided to join me on this culinary journey to Markham. 

We arrived early for dinner, no-one was there, we then started to review the buffet, and the first thing you notice that's not acceptable,  was the food was just warm, not hot. Makes you feel it's the lunch offering transformed into dinner. However, there was a modest amount of dishes to choose from, including buttered chicken, and a mysterious curried chicken. You have to wonder what kind of curried chicken are you offering? non-descript and unpleasant.  Perhaps offering kormas, madras,  or vindaloo curries would have stirred my interest.

There were cold pakoras, I did try one, but it lacked freshness. The key to great Indian cooking is fresh ingredients,  quickly cooked in ghee or mustard oil, and onions well cooked until they are brown, and a garlic/ginger paste for additional flavour. This gives the base for curries then you add curry leaves and your assortment of spices. Since this is a lunch/dinner buffet, It's more cafeteria style than anything else.

Nan was brought to the table, it was okay. Overall, this doesn't cut it in any way as an authentic Indian offering, but if you like cafeteria style food you can eat your heart out
