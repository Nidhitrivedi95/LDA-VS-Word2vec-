EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg I and my Mom were looking for desi food in Vegas, closest to the strip. Recommended by a few Pakistanis, I went in the hope of goat meat dishes prepared in our typical Hyderabadi Biryani style. Last 2 days of our trip, we had food there. Both days, I had bad motion, obvious stomach disorder and on return immediately, fever due to infection. I spent 12 days in Vegas during the New Year 2017, but 10 days I was absolutely in top condition. 
I had ordered chicken kabab and mutton curry on the first day, while mutton biryani and curry the next day. My mother also had stomach disorder the second day and threw up while in flight. Though the taste of food is reasonable, but its not worth a stomach upset. Please don't take the risk folks!
