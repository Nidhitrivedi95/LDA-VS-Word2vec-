kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A Soooooo I really built this place up and had it on my list of must go to places. This review is based solely on the weekend breakfast buffet in comparison to Anjappar Chettinad and Saravana Bhavan. 

To start off with, the service here is horrible:
As an example, there was one waiter and one person behind the counter. There were no plates upon our arrival and we had to search for the waiter who was in the kitchen for quite a while. Unlike, Anjappar, this place does not have free coffee and it had to be ordered separately. The waiter sent us to the person behind the counter and that person asked us to ask the waiter. When we explained to her that it was him who had sent us - she huffed and took the coffee order. This costs extra! 

The food was ok - we definitely preferred the puris and the dosas but the sambhar, potato bhaji and Rava kesari were quite bad. This is definitely not a place we will be returning to.
