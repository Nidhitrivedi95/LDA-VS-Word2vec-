49sbCG7F2jvqJsfG6-N8Rw This is one of the best Indian restaurant experiences I've had in a long time. 

Food; variety of Indian dishes spanning all points of the continent. Food was hot, fresh, and at the exact spice level we requested. The Baingan Bartha and Samosa chaat in particular were the best I've ever had; easy to eat and perfectly prepared. Portions are enough for 2 people. Even the naan is thicker and larger than other places.

Location: easily accessible from the highway and only 10min from downtown Pittsburgh. Convenient street parking. The Inside is clean and modern w/ traditional Indian accents. This place easily works for a causal dinner with friends or an intimate setting.

Service: This staff understands customer service; they were organized, attentive, friendly, professional and truly add to the experience. 

This place is a Can't Miss for Indian food in Pittsburgh!
