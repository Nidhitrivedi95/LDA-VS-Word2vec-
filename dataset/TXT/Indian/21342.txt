GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA This is hands down the best Indian (yeah I know) food I've ever had. However, the service is a hit or miss. One day we can walk in and get seated and helped and served promptly. And literally the next day, or later that day (don't judge), they will take our order and 20 minutes later we find out the they forgot to put it in and we'd have to reorder (there's one specific guy but I don't wanna put him on blast). 

It's totally worth it though. Just don't come here on your lunch break or you may have to try to convince your friends that an Indian restaurant is to blame for your getting fired. Trust me. Just kidding. But not really.

If you don't want to be a mainstream bandwagon loser and get the chicken tikka masala like everyone else at your table I'd suggest the hara masala or palak murg. 

It would be a game changer if they had a buffet doe
