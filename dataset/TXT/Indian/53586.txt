vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Admittedly, I haven't really made the healthiest food choices since moving to Montreal, so I've been looking into more vegetarian/vegan places to balance out some of my meat intake. Luckily, one of the first places I found was Pushap! 

I've had veggie Indian food before, but Pushap truly specializes in it. The Thali for the day included a lentil/daal dish, a potato/carrot/chickpea dish, a tomato-based dish, along with rice and bread. Everything was full of flavor and spices, and made me forget entirely about the smoked meat poutine around the corner at BellePro. I also got a Mango Lassi, which was a perfect accompaniment. 

Not quite walking distance, but a block and some change from the Namur station, so I hopefully I can make Pushap a regular thing!
