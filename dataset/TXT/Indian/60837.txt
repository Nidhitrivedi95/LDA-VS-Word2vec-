I had the veggie curry combo. Veggie curry, rice, samosa, salad: $5 tax included. Mostly cabbage, some potato, eggplant, corn, green peas. Rice a bit oily. Salad was mostly cabbage with a couple pieces of iceburg lettuce. 

I have had the chicken briani here before too. Also $5. Good if you're hungry and only have $5. Not good if you want to eat delicious food.
