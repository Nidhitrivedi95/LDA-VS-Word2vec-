ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw I was very excited about this place, especially i thought a great add to Dormont...but a big letdown.  Gave it a chance food-wise and drink-wise and it was a big disappointment. The customer service was not that friendly by any means.   Average over-priced drinks and food. I usually give things many chances but the experience was so bad that I won't return.
