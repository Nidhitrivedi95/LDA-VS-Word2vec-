yjBKddxPSOV4vjxWRCX0ug I had the spiciest curry EVER in Bombay Bicycle Club for lunch one day and I don't think my tongue has ever recovered!  This restaurant serves authentic Indian cuisine and there is a really lovely and homely feel to the inside. 

Situated in the Tollcross area of Edinburgh, Bombay Bicycle Club is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach. 

Their lunch menu is truly awesome, and they offer a wide range of Indian dishes. I had the onion bhaji to start which was very tasty followed by chicken with a chili and garlic curry sauce. They give little warnings next to each dish stating whether the meal is mild or hot which is handy, but I paid no attention to it and went charging in and ordered a 'hot' dish and boy was it hot! The curry was really delicious and full of flavour, but my tongue had gone pretty numb after a while from the heat and so I couldn't taste much. I feel I should just warn you that extreme caution ought to be paid to the menu when you are choosing your meal and the next time I go here I will definitely play it safe and order a mild curry! 

Bombay Bicycle Club serve tandoori and biryani dishes, as well as the more traditional curry's such as madras. There is also a good selection of vegetarian dishes on offer. Takeaways are also available here and they offer a FREE home delivery service - amazing!!  

Bombay Bicycle Club is a fantastic curry house and one I will definitely be going back to.
