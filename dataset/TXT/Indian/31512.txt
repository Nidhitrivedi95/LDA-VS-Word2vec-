KvRh-exPg_KegOM_HXeskw I ordered a curry dish and an appetizer to go for under $10. You can't do that anywhere else for this kind of quality food. This is the first time I eat here. Flavor and texture of food was great. Don't change anything Curry & Scoop! I'm coming back to try your ice cream and bringing a friend.
