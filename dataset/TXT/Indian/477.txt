-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g I like to visit Indian restaurants whenever I can, and this is one of the best.  The food is a little on the spicier side (which I love), and has a South India flare - the dishes are definitely not what you would find at your usual Indian Buffet.  Plenty of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices, too. This is one of my favorite places, I highly recommend the lunch buffet.

New ownership has improved both the menu and the resturant/ambiance as well.  Five stars.
