CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A Went to the Taj a couple weeks back and I left unsatisfied. I typically eat until I can't eat anymore at other nearby buffets but I didn't even want to keep eating. The food selection was small. The dishes offered were mediocre. And the thing that worries me the most is that the food wasn't warm enough which isn't good for any restaurant especially those that have food sitting out for long periods of time.
