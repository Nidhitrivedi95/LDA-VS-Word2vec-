HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A I had never tried Indian food before eating at Saffron Patch and I am so happy my husband convinced me to try it. It is now one of our favorite restaurants and we love the laid back atmosphere and service. The lamb melts in your mouth and I love the chicken tikka too. It is fairly expensive but it's quality food with an upscale atmosphere. Please do not judge on outside appearance because it is in a funky location (bottom of an office building) it is a MUST try especially for a Cleveland eastsider!
