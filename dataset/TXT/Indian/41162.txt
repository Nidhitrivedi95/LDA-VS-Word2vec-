PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ People had a good review about this restaurant in brampton.  I wanna check it out myself, so went there with my colleagues yesterday and was so disappointed.  First of all the service was very bad & the food was even worse. Starting from appetizers until the desert everything has no taste at all. I would not mind if I have paid a resealable price for the buffet but $28 for this kind of food and service is not acceptable at all. On top of that to make it the worst they charged me $2.50 for gratuity. Worst experience ever. Never ever gonna recommend to any known people.
