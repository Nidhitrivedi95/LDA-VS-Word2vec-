IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA This place serves Iranian (Persian) style Middle Eastern food. The wife and I split the Tasty Kabob Combo...kind of pricey at around $30 bucks, but does serve 2. This combo allowed us to sample a little bit of 3 different types of meat: beef sirloin, chicken kabobs and Koobedieh (kind of like hamburger meat, but on a skewer).

This place was kind of dead on a Sunday night with just 2-3 other tables being occupied...kind of sad considering the excellent food. The atmosphere went along with the drab classical music soundtrack playing throughout the restaurant.

The only part of the experience that kind of killed the mood, the owner (who was also our waitress and cashier) was giving direction to a seemingly new bus boy and we could overhear her reprimanding him for doing something wrong. However, we could also hear her praise him when he did something right. Either way, this conversation should be out of earshot of the customers.

At the end of the day, the food is why we came here and would definitely go back again.
