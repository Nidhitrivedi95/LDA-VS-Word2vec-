The food was excellent. We ordered chicken 65, chicken dum biryani, chettinad chicken, Naan and Haka Noodles.
Nice place to eat and the service was excellent.
The dining room was well kept. Very good authentic indian place in Cleveland.
Execellent place highly recommended if you are looking for good Indian food.
