MWcN6qLWTfRJqLySxwJNqQ I am from out of town and was missing my regular Indian restaurant. My grandparents took me here, as they had been wanting to try it out as well. When we walked in, I thought the atmosphere was very interesting for an Indian restaurant, it was "casual  dining". I thought this was a great idea! We went up to the counter to order, and could eat at our own pace without having to feel too formal.

The food was very good. I ordered the Vegetable Byriani, which I think was a special for the night. I loved it! The flavors were great! We also ordered Vegetable Samosa,  Alu Tikka, Okra Bhindi (also on special), Dal, and Lamb Chops. Everything was delicious! I love Vegetable Samosa almost everywhere I go, and this was no exception.

Overall, great restaurant!
