RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w How did this place get good reviews? No qualms about the atmosphere. It's grungy but different and fun. The service was great. Unfortunately, the positive comments do not extend to the food. The palaak paneer was the worst I've had - watery tasting and very oily. We also ordered beef kiryani on our server's recommend. The beef was tough and the dish bland, despite us having requested extra spiciness. The vegetarian sizzler combo was ok, much better than the other dishes. The naan was also just ok, but I expected a stretchier, tastier bread.

We will not be back and didn't even take the leftovers home.
