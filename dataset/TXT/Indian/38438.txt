OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g The food was okay not so good. I had better Indian food. But there was this server who over charged us on our naan and when we tried to tell him then he completely ignored what we were saying and still charged us. We paid and we tried to tell other server and he said that he can't do anything bcoz he is his boss. The guy had so much attitude in him. I am never going back there bcoz of the food was not great either, naan were old and stale. Don't waste your money. Go to Mint or Gandhi they have better food. I hated this whole experience so much that I downloaded the app to write this review otherwise I am not a review person at all
