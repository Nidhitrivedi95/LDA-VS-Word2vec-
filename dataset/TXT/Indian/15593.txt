cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w What Toronto really needs is good distinctive high end Indian places. This place fits the bill. It is classy yet esoteric. We are vegetarians so for us there was a limited but still reasonable selection of dishes. The eggplant fries served with mint and yogurt chutneys was amazing. Each of the three of us ordered a different dish - I got the Sindhi kadhi which is unlike any Kadhi dish I've had - much spicier almost Sambhar like. My wife ordered a jackfruit and vegetable stew which was excellent. Our son ordered a bottle gourd kofta which was very interesting - not the creamy tangy variety you usually get - but in a lentil base instead. Dessert was a hybrid of gulab jamun and donut with saffron ice cream.
