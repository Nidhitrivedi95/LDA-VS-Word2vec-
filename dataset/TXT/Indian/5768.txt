3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Can't give minus stars, so starting with one star.  This is my first review ever and thought it might be helpful for anybody walking in with family and small hungry kids.  Service was so poor that one of the starters (chicken soup) was delivered after 35 min and the other starter (Pani Puri) after 40 min. Not to mention that the Pani puri shells were stale and smelled/tasted bad.  Food was delivered after one hour and don't even want to discuss how it was.  One of the servers realized and offered us gulab jamun, appreciate that, but fact is fact and if you are hungry and with impatient kids, please look somewhere else.
