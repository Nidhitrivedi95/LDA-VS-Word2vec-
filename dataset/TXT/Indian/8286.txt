7m8MoWuudrxU98fEw7iBIw Finally some interesting food in this town! My husband had the goat khadi and I had the lentil curry described as a delicacy. Both were excellent, but I enjoyed the lentil curry flavor a little more than the goat. Like the other reviews say, it is lighter than most Indian food, but it is still plenty of food. We had leftovers for lunch the next day. The menu says they have beer and wine, but they didn't have a beer and wine list. I'm unsure as to why; might be something with the license. This may eventually be a five-star place in my book, but I need to try it at least 1-2 more times to try more things and determine its consistency.
