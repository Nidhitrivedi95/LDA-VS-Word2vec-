TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA A good place for some decent indian food in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere inside is average and all the photo frames inside are slightly crooked but overall food quality is nice. 

I ordered the paneer tikka masala. The sauce was nice a rich and the meal came with rice and dal. The dal was nice a light making it a great pairing with the paneer. The rice was regular jasmine rice. 

Only issue I have had at this place was that the waiter was charging me extra for a side item that came with my meal and was charging me for the item because the menu had a misprint. That was slightly annoying to deal with.
