llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Last night my wife and I tried India Palace for the first time. We used to go to a different place for years that closed so we were looking for a new regular place for Indian cuisine.

My wife ordered Paneer masala and I got the saag lamb, we shared a side of basmati rice.

Flavors were awesome, very potent and aromatic. Both dishes seem to have more onion in them than I'm used to but the flavor wasn't affected.

The reason for my 2 stars isn't the price or flavors, but rather the fact that I'm writing this at 4am after a long, very painful night of food poisoning. I'm thankful that my pregnant wife didn't eat my food (saag lamb). She's fine.

We may come back but it certainly won't be for a long while. I can't risk that with my wife.
