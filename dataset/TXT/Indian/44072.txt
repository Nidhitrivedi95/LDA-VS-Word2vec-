RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Came here tonight for dinner (table 80 at around 9:00 PM), they don't give you a bill but just tell you to bring your number up and pay the price they tell you. 

We had: 

Butter Chicken $12.99
Lamb Biryani $14.99 
2 regular naan $3.00
1 butter naan $2.00

When got to the register she told me I had to pay $54.00 and that was not including any tip (which you have to leave in cash only).  I paid by debit but didn't do the math on spot and only realized after the fact that I had been ripped off.  I tried calling right away as i was driving home but of course no one picks up the phone here.  If someone does not contact me I will be making a complaint under the Consumer Protection Act.
