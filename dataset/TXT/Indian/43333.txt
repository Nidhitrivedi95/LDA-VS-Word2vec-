With the same owner and almost the same menu, the interior of this place is now more sophisticated, plush and cozy with spacious booths lining around the walls of the restaurant. 

I remembered fondly from my past visits, as this was my favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas, the delicious and creamy "korma" entrees. Be it chicken, lamb, or vegetable, korma is always amazing on top of fluffy basmati rice. There is no words to describe the taste and the feeling of the first few spoonful of lamb korma and rice. Really, you just have to experience it. Indian food just isn't the same after tasting this item because you'll want to come back, again and again, for more of this delicious and heavenly korma curry. 

I don't know if I can ever order anything else on the menu here - I'm too spoiled by this item and I'll just want what I love, over and over again. Sure, they have really great curry and chicken tandoori, creamy spinach, cauliflower and carrots. But addiction has its limit as my tummy is only limited in space. THE items to get here, if you ever come here, is the korma (lamb, chicken or vegetable), creamy spinach and cauliflower. 

Trust me. You will not be disappointed. This has to be the BEST Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. That is all.
