xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg We went for dinner and ordered ala carte . Good varities of Authentic indian dishes and the food  has good flavour for most of the curries. I ordered samosas and they were so crispy and yummy. Chicken biryani is must a try . Ambience is neat and Service is excellent . The price is little expensive but overall I would give a 4 star rating.
