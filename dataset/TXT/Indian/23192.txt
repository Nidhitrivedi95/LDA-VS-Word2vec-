Wow, I was a little surprised.   I had heard so many good things.  Perhaps this was just an "off" day for their lunch buffet.

Let me explain that we were not treated badly, we were just ignored for the most part.  I tried almost everything on the buffet and I enjoy eating Indian food and was looking forward to lunch here since the day before since I had never been.

That said... 

I have been to several different Indian places here in town and after reading other reviews I didn't know exactly what to expect.

The service was barely there and the lunch buffet (about an hour and a half into service) was messy.  The steam table was occasionally being "refilled" instead of changed out.  At least, theoretically, the food that was there at the beginning would only last till the end of the lunch hours. There were a few other cleanliness issues but I'll leave it at that.  

The tap water served in the cloudy glass could not be overlooked. 

The items on the lunch buffet itself, some overcooked, were just okay at best.  Other items bear only slight resemblance to the preparations I've had at other Indian places.  I really do enjoy Indian food and I really went into this WANTING to like this place.   

There are a lot of Indian lunch buffets in Las Vegas and if you have the means to go to a different one... *sigh* ...go.
