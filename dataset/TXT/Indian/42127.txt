qGW6A2w5E0rfQV-0f5jrVQ Finding a vegan friendly spot that's open after 2am is quite difficult, even in vegas so I am absolutely ecstatic that this place opened up! I have only been here once, and I ordered the vegan chana masala. I love that the cashier notified me that although the vegan masala comes with naan, the naan is not vegan. It is great to see restaurants that are knowledgeable on various diets and restrictions. Although it was after 2am when I visited, I was completely sober so I can say with the utmost confidence that my meal was delicious! I was with 5 other friends, and they all enjoyed their food as well. All of our food was reasonably priced and well portioned. I cannot wait to come back and try the rest of their vegan options.
One note: Please please make a vegan mango lassi available!
Ok, another note: The restaurant had "Sohn Munda" by Sunidhi Chauhan on repeat (yes, we Shazam'd it)...so maybe have more than one song playing? lol
