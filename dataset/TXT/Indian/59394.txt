z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA The food is amazing. Its a general rule that you can judge the authencity of ethnic restaurants by the number of patrons that match the ethnicity of the food. This place is always packed with people of Indian descent. I definitely recommend the chicken tikka masla. It's always good and you can tell them how spicy you want it. Easily the best Indian restaurant in Charlotte.
