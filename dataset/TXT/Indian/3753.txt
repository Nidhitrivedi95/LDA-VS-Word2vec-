0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ All I can say is... I'm addicted to this place! I tell all my co workers and friends about this awesome Hakka Chinese restaurant! The food is always fresh and DELICIOUS and the portions are huge! The owner is very friendly and the waiters offer above average service. I love the sweet garlic chicken, sweet and spicy crispy chicken, crispy beef, Pad Thai, fried rice, pakoras, and the honey garlic wings are killer! Cue drool**
