-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA I had written a review about my experience at this restaurant over the Diwali weekend.
The review is missing - I am not sure how but I did get an e-mail  from the owner stating that they will take good care of me next time. They also wanted me to read all the good reviews which are posted.  If bad reviews are filtered  -then all reviews will be good. The owner  should work on improving the quality of your food not just filtering bad  reviews.
I would like to  give details about my food I had on Diwali weekend.
   Gobi Manchurian - I wanted it to be spicy - they added Sri-Racha sauce to  dish which overpowered  everything else.
Mango Lassi - It was so thick we could not drink it with a straw. kids would not drink it .
Kothu parotta - this was on the Diwali special menu - wanted it spicy - so they added green chillies which were  raw. every bite had raw fennel seeds.
 I have  visited this restaurant in the past and food was much better.
But I was disappointed this weekend.
