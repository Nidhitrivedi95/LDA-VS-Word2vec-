Look at the menu closely and some items will jump at you; I'm taking about the Karaikudi Chicken Curry, Eral Varuval (Shrimp) and Kerala Fish curry. Not having eaten these dishes in recent times, I was really excited to try them. But then having been let down by so many Indian restaurants in recent years, I was very skeptical when it came to deciding whether or not to try one of these dishes. I went ahead and ordered Chicken Curry and Eral Varuval anyway. The wait was not long and I was pleasantly surprised at how well both the Chicken curry and Eral Varuval tasted. Though both the dishes were toned down in their level of hotness, they still retained their authentic taste and flavor. 

The Bad Part:
I went back a couple of weeks later and ordered the chicken curry and a dosa for takeout. As I started eating the chicken curry I could clearly tell that there was something amiss about its taste. It just didn't taste like the first time. Was it a quality or a consistency issue? Going by my experience of Indian restaurants, I had a gut feeling that it was both.

I'm not going to review/comment on other items (like Chicken Tikka Masala or Masala Dosa..etc) on the menu since a lot of them can be found at almost any Indian resturant and they all seem to taste more or less the same.


Now coming to the weekday buffet, which I can tell you straight up that it is very mediocre and not attention deserving at all. The spread is limited and selection of dishes for a Friday lunch buffet was very poor. The taste was slightly off for a majority of items and the entire experience was a little disappointing. I'm just hopeful that the weekend buffet is not the same.
