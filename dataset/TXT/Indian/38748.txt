OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Went for the lunch buffet with my family and food was awesome. Dal makhani, Channa Masala, fresh cut salad, papad tawa sabzi was great in the veg section. And butter chicken, goat curry and tandoori chicken fantastic in Non-veg. 

In desserts we were offered gulab jamun and fruit salad which was not only delecious, but also took me back to India.

Last but not the least, service was cherry on the cake. Thanks KESHAV & GURINDER for making our time memorable.

When ever I come to Vegas again, will definitely be coming back to dine in.
