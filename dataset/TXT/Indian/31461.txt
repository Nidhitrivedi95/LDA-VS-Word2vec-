KtNPcK6x9Dxj3aYGis5wgg My favourite Indian take-out in north-west Toronto. Hands-down.
The chicken tikka masala and chicken biryani will not disappoint you, I promise. 
The service is always great too. The last time, they said my nhan bread was burned, and insisted on giving me a credit on my next order, even though I repeatedly told them the nhan looked great.
