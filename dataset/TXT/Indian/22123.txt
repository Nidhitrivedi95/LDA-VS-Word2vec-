GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw It's clear the owners are trying, but they are definitely stuck in a hard place with pricing. $13.95 for a lunch buffet had better be far and away better than any competition. Instead, the buffet is at best the same quality as nearby Indian buffets. And an extra charge for naan with the buffet?? Get out of here. Expect to spend $18-20 on a single lunch. That makes the cost DOUBLE that of others. It is not bad by any means and do take note that this could be a 3 or maybe even 4 star review at a more competitive price point. The bottom line is, lowering the price would bring more customers, allowing greater volume at lower margins.They may not get rich quick, but they probably wouldn't be headed toward bankruptcy so quickly either. Won't be back.
