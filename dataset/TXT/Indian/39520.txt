P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I LOVE THIS PLACE!  After a terrible Indian food experience years back, I was convinced that I didn't like Indian food.  Since it was so close, I decided that I'd give it another try...and I'm hooked!  I've had the buffet every time that I've been here and every time it's been amazing.  Everyone that works here is super nice and the food is great!
