PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA The last dosa place we went to in Vegas charged us around $4 for rice.  So we came here looking for a new dosa spot and weren't disappointed.  The dosa was all that it should be, and the coconut chutney was light and refreshing.  (My fiancee is obsessed with coconut chutney, so he didn't even bother with the tamarind chutney)  I had an order of naan, and ate it with the sabar (just had lunch somewhere else).  The best part for me was the mango lassi.  It's just the way I like it, which is not overly sweet.  I'd go back just for the lassi, my fiancee will return for another dosa.  Def rec.
