-qfZdXO2c-GpvOhr0KmNCg We went here because of the MTL a table event. It's a good time to try new restaurant since we already pretty fixated with a few Indian restaurant. 
The menu was fixed, 21$ for three courses with naan and rice. I have to admit it's a bargain but it's the point of this event.  As usual, we chose different items to share.  The dessert that came with our main dish was not on the menu nor what we ordered. We asked why, the waiter said they didn't make the other two desserts today but he didn't say anything when we made the order. However, I saw other table having them. So the waiter lied about the desserts. I just don't know why. The coconut flake cake we got wasn't even on the actual menu. It seems cheap than other homemade desserts, especially I already had my expectations for the other two traditional dessert. 
Nobody like being lied to. I just don't like dishonest business. It was a massive disappointment for me. 
The appetizers we had were one salad and one fried veggi. We liked them both. The sauces were flavourful. The main dish we had was lamb madras. Lamb cube in curry and coconut flake & milk. This is another reason why I  hated the dessert, having coconut in my main course and as dessert. Not to mention the lamb was too soft, felt like they were left in the cooking pot forever. The curry sauce was tasty though. 
Still holding my grudges.
