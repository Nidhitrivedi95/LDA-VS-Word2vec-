The Vindaloo was spicy! It comes at a 10 spice level. I took one bite and my head decided to go swimming. In my sweat. Good thing is they keep the place extremely chilly and serve water in these metal cups that keep the water ice cold. Service was also great. They kept that ice cold water refilled as I was trying to put the fire out in my mouth.
