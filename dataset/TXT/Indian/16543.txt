DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg Decided to try this place, but was disappointed.

Greeted by a wall of smokiness, which was due to the lack of ventilation. Opening a door was a great idea, but the door was an "Emergency Exit" and behind a group of approximately 14 who immediately closed the door as soon as they got cold.

Waited over 30 minutes to get our food, and tables that had sat down before us also did not have their mains out yet. As well, the two female servers would regularly go into the kitchen to help with the cooking (very probable), so if you wanted a water refill or the bill, for example, there was no one to ask from time to time.

The food itself:
-Mattar Paneer was served in a watery sauce, but otherwise okay. 
-Karahi Chicken lacked the ginger taste; there were thin slices of ginger, but they were tasteless. There were also no visible tomatoes; maybe they were in the sauce. However, the sauce itself had flavour and was not watery.
-Naan was slightly burnt in a few places, but were large pieces

Atmosphere:
While the restaurant was nearly full, the tables were almost crammed together, with just enough space for the waitresses to walk between. There was unused space between the eating area and the kitchen (other than the washrooms) that they could have broken down the wall, added some space and a few more tables.

While drink service was okay and the bill came to under $30.00, I will not be going back soon.
