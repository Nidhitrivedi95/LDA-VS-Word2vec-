DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Amazing food, outstanding service. Since becoming vegan I've had to venture outside of my old staples, burgers and pizza and a friend brought me to Sangam's. Food is consistently outstanding with fresh flavors and they definitely know how to bring the heat! Prices for diner get a bit pricey for one but I always make up for it with the lunch buffet which has solid rotations on a daily basis. If you like Indian food this is a must try in the LKN area.
