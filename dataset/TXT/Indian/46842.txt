t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I went yesterday, Saturday, to their buffet.  It is not a big buffet but it was very good and had a variety of choices.  The Tandoori Chicken Wings were Out Of This World GREAT! And, the curry dishes were very good.  I even tried one called Goon Fish Curry and it was probably the best of all.  Very good curry dish and the fish was very tasty. You can get regular or garlic naan bread with your buffet... I got the garlic and it was really good, hot and fresh. The place is very nice and clean. I went once on a weekday and once on Saturday.  The buffet is on Wednesday through Saturday and the weekday wasn't very busy but there was a nice crowd on Saturday.

I will definitely be back!
