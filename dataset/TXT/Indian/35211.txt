MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg GMP regulated facility (which means it is regulated to a higher degree than restaurants are) which shows as people are wearing beard nets and hair nets. Good food and good prices. Don't cheap out and buy the small somosas. Buy the big ones for just a few dimes more. I don't like Indian sweets but they have them too. Very very busy so make sure you go early.
