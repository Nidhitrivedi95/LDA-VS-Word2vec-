ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ Disclaimer; this was my first visit to an Indian restaurant. We went conservative, and got the mango chicken and chicken tikka masala.  We really enjoyed the food.  It took a little while to have our order taken, but it did seem like they were working on a petty big catering order. The prices seemed a touch high relative to the quantity received, but that is comparing against non Indian places as well, so may not be a fair comparison. Next time we go back will probably be to try the lunch buffet option.
