PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g It was my birthday yesterday and we had made reservations over 2 weeks ago for 3 people.  We requested a specific table as it was a special occasion.  We were ensured that it would not be a problem.  We arrived for our 8pm reservation around 7:50pm.  

They had a hard time finding us in their system. Then here is the WORST part!  That table was NOT available!  The brilliant person who took the reservation failed to add it in the notes!  Lovely!  I was pissed to say the least and so was my boyfriend!  We didn't call 2 weeks ago to have to deal with this nonsense.

As they could tell I was pretty upset, they offered another table, obviously.  They also offered us to sit at the bar for drinks on the house while they set up another table.

We were seated within 10 minutes and our server took our drink orders.  The manager or owner came over and apologized for the mix up and even went so far as to get me a little potted plant that he brought to the table.

The Naan bread was also complimentary.  We ordered the chef's platter as an appetizer which is what we usually get and it was good for 3 people to share.

Our mains were:  Curry chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, and some yummy rice with peas and currants or something in it.  We had garlic naan on the side.

Service was very attentive and the food came out quickly.

All in all it turned out to be a nice Birthday dinner and we really enjoyed ourselves.

Here is what saved them:  They acknowledged their mistake, they offered drinks on the house, comped the Naan, gave us attentive service.  They made sure to make up for the issue with the reservations. 

If they hadn't made a gesture, we would have left and never gone back.  This place is our neighbourhood restaurant that we go to often.   I am happy to say that we will return again.
