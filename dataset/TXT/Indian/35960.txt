nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ Decent indian food with fast service. I have had the following dishes:

1. Channa bhatura - Channa is good and while bhatura are large, they are WAY too oily. They drip in oil when they are served to you and I feel like I'm eating a heart attack so I can't enjoy my food unless I pat it down with a stack of napkins for 10 mins. It tastes good though.

2. Butter chicken - the sauce tastes great (nice and thick and just enough spice) and the chicken is pretty consistent, although a bit on the dry side.

3. Garlic naan - always dry and thin but has a generous helping of garlic, just the way I like it. It would be better if it wasn't so dry because it cracks.

4. Samosas - average. Can't complain.

5. Goat biryani - lots of large pieces of meat. This dish is so flavourful and worth the price. The goat melts in your mouth!

The service is great for take out or dine in.
