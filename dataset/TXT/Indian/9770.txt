9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw I've been a few times. Once for dinner and the other times for the lunch buffet. The food is really good. I like the more mild side of Indian food, and they have a dish or two to satisfy that! 
The main server lady who always seems to be in charge is really nice and on top of things. For the lunch buffet, I wish the staff was a bit more on top of things. Naan must be delivered to your table and cannot be self served and HELLO naan bread needs to be aplenty for a buffet! The garlic one is delicious.
