ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Finally dined in, instead of slinking off with my take-out for one. The atmosphere is cute, and the wait staff was wonderful. The food continues to be really good, but BE WARY of what you order if you don't like spicy food. I always get the mildest chicken korma they'll serve me, and it's delicious. The plain naan also has a really nice basic flavor, which pairs well with the entrees. But dayum - they have some spicy stuff here, so folks like me have to tread lightly. I'll be back again & again! =)
