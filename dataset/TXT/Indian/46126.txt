sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ If I was to leave Toronto, this is probably the restaurant I would miss the most. Nobody else anywhere makes roti like this, and it's addictive once you adjust to the spice (medium is my limit, and I like spicy food). Required eating for a full sense of Toronto cuisine, and great price point for a large meal. Now that I'm older I can't eat my saag paneer leftovers for breakfast without paying for such richness ... but hey, that's life. Best veg option: saag paneer or malai kofta. Best meat option: butter chicken.
