tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I am surprised by all the positive reviews.
We love Indian food.
However, this place missed the mark. The Naan was burt and soggy, the chicken Korma was greasy, thigh meat seemed a little under cooked, slimmy? The chicken in the chicken tiki masala was very hard seemed old? Rice was dry. 
Mango Lassi, great. 

Otherwise not impressed.
