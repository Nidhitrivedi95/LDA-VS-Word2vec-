C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Went here for a night out with a girl friend. Great atmosphere! Great food! There were so many options I wanted to try. Great options for vegetarians, pescatarians, lacose intolerant... (I could see why they would advertise as the "best first date night spot") I will definitely be back. 

After tax and tip my meal (soup and a shared appetizer) was only $15.
