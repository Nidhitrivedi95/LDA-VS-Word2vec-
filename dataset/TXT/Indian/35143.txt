MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw This is fairly a new restaurant. My and my friend family decided to go. It was a great indian cousin experience with delicious food. We have ordered appetizers, main course and desert. I highly recommend their chicken pakora and chaat papri. I have not eaten this clean and nice flavored chaat before. I am bit disappointed with serving size but overall taste was excellent. In main course dum biryani and sekh lamb kebab were amazing. Also, gajjar hawala and rad milai, I would give 10/10. Over all customer service was excellent and will go back again. It's bit pricey but quality of food and service you get it won't hurt. Thanks
