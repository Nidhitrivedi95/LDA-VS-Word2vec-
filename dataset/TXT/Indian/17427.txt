DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Good food, OK service. Tasty food, and the Kashmiri naan is amazing. But - I feel it is expensive for what you get, and the service is not quick. So, if you're looking to be out of this restaurant within an hour, either go during the lunch buffet, or order your food take out.
