ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Definitely one of my favorite Indian spots in the University area. They offer a lunch buffet on the weekend and it is truly something special. Everything is so fresh and they keep the buffet stocked and clean. I usually do take out of the buffet or just an entree and everything is made to order fresh, not to mention some of the best plain and garlic naan around.
