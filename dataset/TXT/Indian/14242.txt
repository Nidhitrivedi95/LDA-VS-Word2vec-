c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Got some takeout from Makkah. Everything was okay, but most items were not particularly tasty.

Bihari kabob was flavourful and tender. 
Naan was good.

Also tried a thali combo with 1 meat, 2 veg:
Chicken tikka was fine, but nothing special.
Dal was so-so, not particularly flavourful & had a sludgy texture.
Mixed vegetables were not exceptional, but nice enough.
Salad was standard and uninspired. Rice was standard.

If I was close by and needed food, I might or might not try Makkah again. I wouldn't go out of my way for it.
