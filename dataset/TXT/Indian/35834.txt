nKpBO-XDKv_n6n-JR2Z1Jg Terrible buffet. Just go somewhere else for buffet. BBQ was cold on the inside like it was reheated. Not nearly as many choice as other places. And the food is not nearly on the same quality as others. Probably leftover from what they don't sell during the week. Go to a dedicated buffet place like continental. I dont even have high standards but this place was still dissapointing.
