XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Food was tasty, but not fantastic. We ordered the pan fried kothey chicken momos (8 dumplings) as an appetizer, but they took very long and arrived about 2 minutes before the main dishes. Only 3 tables taken at the restaurant, ours + 2 more, and we all walked in at the same time. The other tables had their mains served before we even got our appetizer. 
Had the chili chicken (very nice) with rice, and the special chowmein (ok, but was missing some kick or maybe more sauce). Good size portions, but had no leftovers for 2 of us. I also tried the Tibetan butter tea, and enjoyed it, salty and all. 
Service was friendly, but the main dining area lacks in ambiance and could use a good cleaning (e.g. vents were scary). What you can see from the kitchen is a bit run down, and I truly hope the state of the washrooms is not reflected in the kitchen area. Yuck! 
Can't comment on the patio, as it was the middle of winter. 
All in all, being my first time trying Himalayan food, I was intrigued enough to want to try other places, but probably won't go back to this restaurant.
