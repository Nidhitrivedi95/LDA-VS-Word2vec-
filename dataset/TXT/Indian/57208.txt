XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw The texture of the food was an issue for me. I ordered takeout (saag paneer and chicken tikka) from Mother India recently. The service was great, the flavor of the food was good, but the texture was a little weird. (Specifically the paneer was cut large for my liking and the herbs were very woody and coarse). I really wish I'd had a better experience :(
