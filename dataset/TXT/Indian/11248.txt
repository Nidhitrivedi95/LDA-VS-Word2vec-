aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q I would like to copy Ed S. from NY's November 14 2011 review verbatim!  It's SO much like how I feel about my experience at NY Subway that I'm actually beginning to believe that I may in fact BE Ed S. and not Mick M. as I have been led to believe by those I have trusted all my life.  I know my parents lied to me before so who's to say they were telling the truth about this?
