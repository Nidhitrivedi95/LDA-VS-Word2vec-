gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I came here based on all the great reviews I found on yelp. But it would be an understatement to say I was disappointed. One of the worst Indian food I have ever had. There was not even a single item that stood out. Seemed like everything was stale food. The tandoori chicken seemed to have been painted with red color. Even the Naan was not good. Even before we settled down the server brought the Naan out and by the time we came back with our plates it was already cold. Please stay away from this place.
