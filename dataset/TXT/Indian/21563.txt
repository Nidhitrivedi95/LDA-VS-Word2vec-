GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Traveling on business to chandler, so happy to find this restaurant. The food is authentic, I ordered a bel puri and a masala dosa, which is a lot of food for 1 person. I took half my dosa back to the hotel. The chutney bar is a great touch and I sampled the coconut chutney and tamarind, both were super good. I will be coming back, lots of things I want to try including the kulfi.
