rYziPPEILDXJ_F5uKR--YQ LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!  It is completely awesome to have another Indian option in this particular part of town.  Service was awesome.  Went straight in, place my order after talking to the staff about the vegan options (THIS IS A MUST) and immediately got my food.

BEST thing about this place is price value.  You can get an appropriately sized serving and the price is outstanding.  I look forward to returning!
