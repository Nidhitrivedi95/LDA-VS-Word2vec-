VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Hubby and I wanted to try something different for lunch so we tried TT. It was kind of an odd experience, wondering if it was just an off day. We waited a very long to be greeted and to get menus. We aren't familiar with the cuisine and the menu isn't very descriptive. We asked about some of the dishes and generally speaking, we felt like the servers were sort of coolly detached and didn't offer much info. 

In the end we stayed safe and chose two chicken dishes (saag and vindaloo). While waiting I went to the ladies room but it was out of order and there was a sign that said to ask for assistance. So, I asked for assistance and was asked to wait for another server. I sat wondering what kind of assistance Id be getting with the bathroom, then a lady walked over and got a key out of the register. She motioned for the bartender to follow her to show him where the bathroom was, too. I then embarked on a journey out the door, across the shopping center, up a flight of stairs and into a vacant office space's dimly lit bathroom. With a restaurant server and bartender in tow. I took care of business and walked back to the restaurant where lunch was waiting.

Why 3 stars you ask? Because the food saves this place. It was awesome, I mean really really good. Loved every bite. 

Perfect? No, but that's why they invented carry out.
