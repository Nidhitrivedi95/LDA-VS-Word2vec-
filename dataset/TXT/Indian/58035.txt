yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I tried this because I had a gift certificate.  I ordered the Gosht Rogan Josh with  lamb and a chicken with rice, raisins and nuts dish. Gosht Rogan Josh was spicy.  I only ordered this because I made this dish using a mix from a box bought at Lee Lees but I think the boxed version was much better.   I loved the garlic naan, though.  One couldn't go wrong with this. The chicken dish was aromatic and filling. It was a large portion.  I'd go back to try other dishes, though. Parking is tight.
