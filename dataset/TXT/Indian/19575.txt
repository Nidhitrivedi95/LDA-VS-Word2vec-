FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg My family has been getting take-out Indian food from Bombay Bhel monthly for the past 15 years; I've also dined-in here once.  It's the best tasting Indian food you can get in Markham.

We usually order the Butter Chicken, Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tika Masala, Amritsari Goat Curry, Palak Paneer, and Tandoori Chicken.  Each entree comes with basmati rice or naan. My personal fav is the Butter Chicken - the curry is pretty much orange liquid crack-cocaine.

Though it's the best tasting Indian food in Markham, it's pretty pricey, so make sure you have enough funds to support your newfound addiction.
