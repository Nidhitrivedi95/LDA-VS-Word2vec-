The ambience is nice and comfortable. They usually have a differnt welcome drink which i think is seasonal and is complimentary plus also yummy.
Now about the food - Very high quality food, well  presented and delightfully tasty. Their meat dishes are well cooked and sumptuous. 
Their menu changes quite often and is seasonal. So there is a new surprise each time you visit.
Strictly advise you to make reservations ahead and they are usually very busy.
