Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Wonderful food.  It was buffet night because so many people booked - they could only serve that many people buffet style. No worries everything tasted amazing.  Try the mango lassi- 
Staff was so friendly too.
It is hidden in the back of the food court at the Polo Towers on the second floor don't miss this place if you love Indian fare.
