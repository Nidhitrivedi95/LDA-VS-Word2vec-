CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ The best dosa I have ever had. Period.

My girlfriend and I went by on a busy Friday night at her suggestion. After living 2 minutes away by drive I was very excited to finally be going somewhere I've heard a lot of good about but had been too lazy to visit because it was so close and because I hate paying for a la carte indian food (they do have a lunch buffet).

The restaurant is very cozy and extremely laid back. Staff is attentive and quick. The menu takes some time to read if you're not familiar with the items on it so I would generally suggest their sampler, a dosa, and a third dish of whatever.

On this evening we ordered: ghee paper dosa, aloo gobi fry, and palaak paneer. Firstly I would say the seasoning is excellent. Food comes out quick and neatly. Prepare to use your hands. I think if you're open to going to an entirely vegetarian restaurant. I need not say more. Come give it a try.

The dosa is the truly special item.
