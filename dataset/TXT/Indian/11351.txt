afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w I really like hoppers (Appam) and this is my go to place in Toronto to satisfy my cravings and appetite. I got milk, egg hoppers when i was there and they served it with coconut sambal (Grated coconut with chilli and spice). Hoppers and sambal is a very traditional Sri Lankan dish that I have had the good fortune of enjoying very many times. However, the sambal served here did not really hit the note right. Something was missing - which was unfortunate.

For appetizer, we got fish pattis (A dish made with fish curry similar to empanadas) and it was hot and spicy. We asked for hot sauce and they gave us an almost empty maggi chilli sauce, which did not seem so professional. The combination was great so no complaints.

Finally to finish off the meal, we ordered tea and I felt that tea had way too much milk than tea. Again, another classic item did not hit the note. Even with all these small misses, i was still a happy camper! Prices are reasonable and food was served quick. (I'm always hungry when i order food so appreciate getting food quick) :) Great meal. Go to hopper hut to get some of the authentic Sri Lankan foods. One caution though, if you are not used to hot/spicy food, please make it a point to ask your server to make it mild.
