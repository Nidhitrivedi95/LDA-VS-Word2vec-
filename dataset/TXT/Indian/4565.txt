2-Y-kNEbrP_m1U9Hc2xH7A Excellent Indian and Pakistani dishes! Had the goat kahari (sp?) with medium heat and WOW tender goat, delicious sauce and perfectly titrated heat. I'm still burping deliciousness as I write this.  

We stopped here on the way back to Lancaster and while the place has some frayed edges like the bathrooms and forgetting to give us the chick peas side, they nailed my dish.
