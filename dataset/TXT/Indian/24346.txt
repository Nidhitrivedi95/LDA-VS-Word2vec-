GyHJAwBQ58L3ORBLm0G-hg I'm not a fan of buffets.  This one appeared to be small (though larger than some Indian buffets I've seen).  Our group got a mix.  Some ordered off the menu, some got buffet.  

All the food was consistently good.  I can't say it was my favorite of all time (it's not).  But it was good.  And they had a few different dishes one doesn't normally see (or at least I don't remember seeing them before).

Staff was friendly and helpful.  We even got a YELP check-in coupon.

Overall a solid place to have Indian food.  Prices seemed about average for most Indian restaurants.
