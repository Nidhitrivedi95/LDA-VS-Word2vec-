P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg I rarely write reviews, but decided to write one for china cottage because this place never disappoints. Now I say avoid the Chinese Indian safe choices like sweet and sour chicken and chicken with veggies. Just because you'll be missing out on of the restaurants gems. Hakka squid and chicken 88. I was a little skeptical when my cousin ordered it for me but when he did I was soo happy. I HIGHLY recommend those dishes. Large quantities for a fair price this place is a Scarborough jewel.
