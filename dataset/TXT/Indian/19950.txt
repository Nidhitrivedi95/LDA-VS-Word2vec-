FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q We've gone here multiple times since our last review, so we thought that we'd write an update.

First of all, we've been here at least 8, 9, maybe 10 times, and the servers are always VERY friendly.  They've gone out of their way to bring food out of the kitchen for our son and they talk to us, too (though we admit that our son gets more attention than us).  Maybe they're only this friendly to people they've seen us a lot.

The food is very good, too--granted we've only been to the lunch buffet, but I'd be happy with the quality of this food even if was ordered a la carte.  Naan tastes fresh, tandoori chicken is moist (most of the time), sauces are flavorful (most of the time) though they don't necessarily pack in the heat that you'd expect from Indian food, tasty chutneys and curries.

We usually have a great experience with Maharani though every so often we'd come across a day at the buffet where some of the dishes lack the flavor.  What's weird is that we'll come on a day where EVERYTHING is good and then the next time we'll come on a day when maybe half of the dishes are worth raving about.  But we've had enough good experiences where we can forget the 1 or 2 bad days and come here when we're craving Indian.
