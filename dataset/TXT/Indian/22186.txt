The wait staff were quick to welcome and sat us in a quiet corner booth. The restaurant picked up after 6, but the noise level was minimal. The busser came by to refill our drinks and cleared the table of dirty dishes promptly.

The dinner buffet was lacking for $17. There were minimal choices and some of the dishes were room temperature. The tandoori chicken had a nice flavor, but was dry. The chicken curry was flavorful and the meat was moist. The cauliflower in curry sauce was one of my favorite dishes, but there wasn't anything else that stood out. with a total of 10 dishes on the line, you will have no problems trying everything. There are better Indian restaurants in Las Vegas.
