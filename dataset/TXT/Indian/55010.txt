Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw After seeing countless movies that depicted Indian food as extremely spicy. I was very hesitant and scared to try Indian food for my first time. My sister insisted that I come along with her to this Indian restaurant- Delhi Palace, for their lunch buffet. I picked her up from work and off we went. 

I went through the line of the buffet carefully picking my meal. I managed to grab myself some Lamb Curry, Basmati Rice and salad. I came back to my table and the waiter served us our drinks as well as some delicious naan. Delhi Palace toasts the naan as well as adds a garlic kick. The naan arrives to your table steamy hot!
I finally dug in too my food and was so pleasantly surprised. After feeling like I could take on any type of Indian food, I went back to the buffet for seconds and tried more dishes. ALL of the dishes exceeded my expectations. 

I definitely recommend going to the lunch buffet it is well worth the money! More bang for your buck! 

The restaurant is also very conveniently located next to the ASU-Tempe campus. So if you're a student and you're looking for some delicious Indian food during a class break, you should check out this hidden gem!
