e5wnDsSarDwttYwie1dGGA I don't need many more excuses to love Stockbridge, but if I did, the fact that this take out joint is a stone's throw from my little house? Bonus love.

On any given day, at any given hour, I want Palak Paneer. Fact.

It's been a personal mission to find a great spot that serves up this dish since I landed. I've yet to actually FIND one, but the investigation has been delicious.

Sitara Spice takes the closet contender with its Saag Paneer. All the elements of a tradition palak paneer but this specific dish is made with a spicy red sauce. Either way, it lives up to its cousin dish in delicious. It's one of those handy little orders that makes you feel like you're being healthy (it's spinach based after all!), without actually HAVING to be (cheese. so much cheese.)

I also took down the lamb Ceylon curry (cold indian food left overs are my weakness!). It's wickedly spicy - a plus for me, but perhaps a warning note for anyone else - and although the lemon/coconut elements were interesting, i'd likely pass on it next time around. I found it a little bit greasy, and a little bit heavy. Delicious? Yes. But as previously mentioned, I had ordered a paneer laden first dish, so I would have opted for something less in-your-face unhealthy.

The two dishes plus rice came out to a fair £15 and I had enough for late night snacks and the next day's lunch. The order was quick - 30 minutes total - and the online ordering process is a snap.

I will still seek out my good ol' go-to spinach goodness (any suggestions?), but in the meantime, i'm pretty darn happy my culinary investigation led me to this solid, neighbourhood spot. Worth a try.
