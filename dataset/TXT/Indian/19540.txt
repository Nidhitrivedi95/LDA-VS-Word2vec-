FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg Food was quite flavourful and service was not the best, but just underneath it. Fried Brie for appetizer is a must, as is the butter chicken for main. They also have some great choices from the tandoori oven. Didn't stick around for dessert because the kitchen closed at 9:30, but we will absolutely return to check out their other items. 
Definitely check them out!
