t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I would totally recommend this restaurant. The ambiance is nice, the service was good and the food is excellent. 

However, the food portions are a little small. If you plan on sharing order a few plates. If you cannot make up your mind I would recommend the mixed platter which was delicious. It includes a bit of everything, chicken, lamb, shrimp and pork. 

Also the spice is very hot. So if you dont like heat make sure you get it at a 0 or 1.
