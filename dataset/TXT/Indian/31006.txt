kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I had the lunch buffet there yesterday. I stuck to vegetarian options and especially enjoyed the palak paneer. So many restaurants load their palak with heavy cream, which I think dilutes the spinach flavor. This one did not and I went back for a large, second helping. 
Service was odd. We walked in and they couldn't seem to decide where we should fit. The server seemed a little...grumpy?
