llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I took my nephew and sister out for Indian at Indian Palace. The food was excellent! I could taste the love it was made with. Not only that but it was made with fresh ingredients, and they don't charge for garlic naan. It is all you could eat for only $9.99. They didn't even charge for my nephew who is 6 for a small plate. They are not here to rip you off; rather they are genuinely in the hospitality business.  We've been here several times and we will continue to come back. Definitely recommend coming here if you like Indian.
