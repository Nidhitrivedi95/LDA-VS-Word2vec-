5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ Located near UNLV, seems to be  solid lunch option for students and staff- many other reviews mention the lunch combos, but either they've done away with that or it's not available on weekends, because I arrived to menu of made-to-order entrees. I liked that there were so many vegetarian options, but without my favorite saag paneer available (or tikka masala, for the non-veg options), I chose the special of the day: lamb curry, with the cumin rice, and a samosa.

Service was polite, food was made to order and packed up for takeout, price ($12) was reasonable for the portion size. I asked for a 6 on their spice scale (1-10) and found it quite mild, but the curry sauce was thick and there was ample lamb. Food had a little more grease than I had expected, and I poured some off of the curry rather than ingest it. Samosa was just okay. Quality is better than some of the other student-focused places on this side of the street.
