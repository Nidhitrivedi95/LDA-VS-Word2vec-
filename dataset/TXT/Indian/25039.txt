H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ I really wanted to like the food here because I love, love, love Indian food. However, it was OK. Nothing was over the top flavor wise and there wasn't a wide variety at the buffet. It was good, but it wasn't great. Southern Spice, The Dhaba, and Madras Ananda are over the top flavor wise! The service was good.
