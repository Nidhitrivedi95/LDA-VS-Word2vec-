U3Ah385YhvlraXsKcEeZ4g I usually enjoy getting the vegetable and chicken pie... you can never go wrong with that. I also love the dressing that comes with their salads. 

I tried my friend's bulgogi, but we found it to be way too sweet. You'd be better off going for the real thing at the surrounding Korean restaurants.
