TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ This is my go to dinner take out since it's super close and never disappoints. 

Great prices, large quantity, tasty and flavourful, and friendly service. Would strongly recommend any/all of their chili dishes. 

Only complaint is the kitchen service. It usually takes at least 40 minutes for an order for us. Had 1 bad experience with a super long wait time, but that was only once awhile back and they threw in egg rolls. Also, they usually have only 1 person at the front of the house taking calls, waitering, cashing out, etc. so it can get slow when it's busy. Would recommend delivery if possible.
