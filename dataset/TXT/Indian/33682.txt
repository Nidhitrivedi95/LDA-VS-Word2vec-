lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw Lunch with friend..
very refreshing interior..fast casual style
dine-in customers are given a small tower weight-like thing..
mix of authentic and contemporary
Ordered the chicken frankie..thin naan like bread with chicken curry stuffed inside with salad, along with gunpowder fries!!..best fries eaten ever..curry is flavorful.
serving size is very good..a little pricey for lunch, but very good flavor and serving size. Curry could have used a little more salt (this is coming from someone who usually prefers salt on the lower side)
Host is very hospitable..comes around with tea, served in typical indian street-style glasses
Tea is very flavorful.
Nice selection of entrees. MUST GO!!
