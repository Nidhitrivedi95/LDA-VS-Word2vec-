Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ I ate here a little while ago and I can't say that the experience was very satisfying overall. I will admit that the food was tasty. I favored the chili chicken over most else. The sauce had the  combination of sweet and spicy and the chicken was cooked very well. They also had a delicious array of sauces made to top the fluffy breads that they offer. However, the food lost some of its rich flavor as I started looking more around the room. With the hand prints covering the door and mirror near the entrance, 'stuff' on the floor, and a bus pan of dirty dishes near the buffet area, I can't bring myself to consider this place clean. Unfortunately, the lack of cleanliness isn't this restaurant's only turn off. The staff also needed some work. Rather than being welcomed to the restaurant, I felt as if I were intruding on a private party. The wait staff were very short with me and showed me that they wanted to spend the least amount of time possible talking with me. I can't say that I will ever return to India Garden due to all of this.
