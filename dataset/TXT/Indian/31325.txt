Preetty good, preetty, preetty good!  Based on these reviews, I was a bit skeptical, but the flavours are definitely there.

If you're gonna visit, I'd recommend you come here with at least 1 other friend, so you can order different items to try.  My friend & I had the following combos:
-  The Go-To (Butter Chicken w/ Rice), they had run out of the Chicken Biryani + a choice of samosa + pop
-  Punjabi Cheeseburger w/ fries + pop

Both combos were $13ea.  (And yes, the fries taste like Costco fries as per Barbara's review!)  They are battered and were still crispy afterwards and I detected some slight seasoning (masala?) on them.

You can tell the patty for the cheeseburger is fresh, as opposed to frozen and it reminded me of koftas, but with slightly more Indian spices.  Bun was soft, no complaints.  Butter Chicken had a really good flavour, BUT rice was a bit watery at the bottom of the paper tray.

My friend choose the Jerk Chicken samosa 'cause it was something different and it was good, although I found it a bit on the salty side.  Samosa is a nibble, adequate when sharing and eating other things.  

Depending on your appetite and comparing to what you may get at a dumpy Indian place, you may find the portions on the smaller side.  I thought they were ok, especially for health-conscious millennials.  Butter Chicken consisted of 2-ok, but smaller portions, whereas Cheeseburger fit within the confines of a standard Dempster burger bun.  No leftovers here 'cept for the fries!

Points for uniqueness!  Would like to go back, but area is a bit out-of-the-way for me.  It's ~10mins NE of Heartland, but within 3mins NE of Cineplex Courtney Park.
