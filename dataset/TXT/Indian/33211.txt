llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Went for dinner rather than the lunch buffet.  Service was a little slow but they were pretty busy (Valentine's Day) so it made sense.  The lamb curry and chicken vindaloo were very good.  The basmati rice was delicious.  Both the garlic and plain naan were excellent.  The portions are large.  One entree and one rice dish would have been plenty for two.  Otherwise, there's enough left to take home for lunch the next day!
