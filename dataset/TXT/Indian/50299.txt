UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w I had dinner here Saturday September 1, 2012.  I've had dinner here before but this time I was on my own.

I can't tell you what I had (I'm not being a smart ass, I'm serious) but it was good.  We had something that looked like chili beans, another that looked like green peas and another that looked like lentils.  The kitchen staff picked out our food which turned out to be great as all of it was good - it came out delicious, fast, fresh and hot, but don't expect a smile when it gets there.

The value is outstanding.  The ambiance is simple and competitive when it comes to getting a seat at a table.  And finally, the service is efficient but not so friendly but it doesn't matter, the food is good and it's affordable.
