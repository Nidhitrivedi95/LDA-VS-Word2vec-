x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA I made the mistake of hitting the buffet at 1:30 pm. I think it would have been good around noon, but I was stuck at work. Anyway, I will take some responsibility for my tardy lunch. Over all the place was clean, the staff was great and the service was very quick. The food, I assume because it was past prime lunch time, was not the greatest. I don't know how to pronounce or spell what I ate, I just know that it was sitting around for a while.
