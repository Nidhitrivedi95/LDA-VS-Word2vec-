GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Trust me, you don't go here for the ambiance (there is none). Well, unless you count the tons of Indians who frequent the joint or the occasional office troupe that takes over one corner, or the couples in for dinner... well basically it's a good place for anyone. What makes Woodlands stand out from the other Indian places in Chandler (some that DO have 'ambiance') is that Woodlands brings the heat. The chutney bar has a white coconut chutney that both cools and has a slight kick, a red tomato chutney with a low soft burn and good flavor, and my personal favorite, the green mint chutney that will knock your socks off. I only come here for the Dosas, the Masala Dosa and the Mysore Masala Dosa are both very good.

It seems to me that they use frozen vegetables, but the masala has never tasted bad so there's really no downside. Everything is nice and hot when they bring it out, although sometimes the sambar (a soup-like dish) might not be if it wasn't as freshly made. Their vadas (spicy, savory fried lentil cakes) are pretty good too. I haven't tried much else but why deviate from what works? The owner is really nice and will chat with you on what to get, family history, etc if you want. I wish they were open later (and on Tuesdays!)

If you're used to sit-down 'classy' restaurants and waiter service, well, you might find this place 'lacking' but honestly, these sorts of places focus on what matters - what's on your plate rather than what's on the wall.

This IS pretty much as good as it gets in Chandler...
