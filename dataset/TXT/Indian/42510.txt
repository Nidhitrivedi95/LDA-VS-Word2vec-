r71RUi85E60aGuhVqXWjKA I don't understand all the negative reviews here. My parents and I went here for lunch recently and we thought everything was just fine. Yes, the portions are a little smaller than at some other places, like Super Hakka, and the Chili Chicken was not spicy at all, but it still had flavour. The female server who greeted us and took our orders was very friendly and nice. The male server who cleared our table and brought our bill did not smile, but I wouldn't say he was rude, just neutral (neither nice nor not nice). They did not automatically add the tip to our bill like some other reviewers mentioned - although we were just a party of three, maybe they do this if your party is larger(?) 

We ordered from the Lunch Special Menu. I had the Bombay Chicken (dry) - $6.95, my dad had the Mango Tango Beef - $6.95 and my mom had the Chili Chicken (dry) - $5.95. All lunch specials come with a vegetarian spring roll and a bottle of water.

The spring roll was average sized. It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was filled with cabbage, onions and carrots. It was pretty standard. I loved my Bombay Chicken. It was spicy hot and had a great combination of spices in it. I loved the dry chrunchy bits. The Mango Tango Beef was tender and came with green and red peppers as well as slices of sweet ripe mango. The sauce was sweet and was a nice contrast to the spicy Bombay Chicken. The Chili Chicken had flavour but it wasn't spicy at all. I don't understand why on menu the Chili Chicken is rated as spicy as the Bombay Chicken (2 chilies). Anyway, the Chili Chicken was my least favorite, but it was still OK and my mom who doesn't like really spicy food actually really liked it.

The white steamed rice was nicely cooked but not all that plentiful. Portions are a bit smaller than other places.

Overall it's a good place to go if you are in the area and have a craving for Hakka food. Lots of free parking in the strip mall parking lot.
