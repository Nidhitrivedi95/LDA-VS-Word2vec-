gXLiBVCHIqoPEw2CaP3QmQ i would give ZERO stars if I could! SLOW AND UNORGANIZED!! If you're going for a quick lunch, reconsider! The food was good, till we were getting ready to leave and out "lunch special" cost 3x what it was supposed to because the person taking orders "doesn't speak English well" and put our order in wrong... It was also very warm inside the restaurant. I WOULD NEVER RETURN OR REFER ANYONE HERE!
