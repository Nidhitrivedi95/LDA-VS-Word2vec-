jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Rice was dry, Nigari, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Chicken Makhani all have the spices but smell and taste like soy sauce....can't imagine how much soy sauce you need to use in order to cover up the aroma of Indian spices. Nigari was very salty, but not as bad as the Paneer Saag. It was so salty, bitter, and fiborus (should be creamy, right?) so it was simply inedible. Chicken Tikka tasted OK, but it was the size of two cornish hen legs. Garlic Naan, not garlicky.Worst Indian food I ever had....Not impressed!
