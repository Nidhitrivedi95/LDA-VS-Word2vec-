RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg It seems like the Bombay on Green Street and First Street are the same franchise but this Bombay on First Street seems cleaner and nicer than the other one on Green Street. The place seems very intimate and quiet -a nice place to take your hot date lol. Each table was set up nicely with utensils, folded tablecloth, plates, and water glasses. Also one of the staff would lit your table with tiny tea candles as you get adjusted. I think the nice staff and the environment made the food even more enjoyable. 

My boyfriend and I shared a Lamb Aloo Ginger Curry entree with butter na'an and samosa. The Lamb Aloo Ginger Curry had tender pieces of lamb and potatoes in some kind of ginger curry sauce. I really liked how the curry wasn't too hot but hot enough to enjoy the flavors. Also, I think Bombay makes the best naan in CU. You can't forgot about naan! I have a penchant for naan at Indian restaurants. Bombay's naan was so soft, fresh, and warm. A great addition to your meal.  

I also recommend people to try the Samosa. They are crispy crab ragoon-like shaped appetizer, stuffed with potatoes & green peas.I loved how everything came out fresh out of the kitchen, and our whole meal was perfect for two people. I think two curry entrees can be a little too much. The price was eh a little too much. I think the price at Indian restaurants can be a little too much, but this meal was too enjoyable to complain about the price of the meal. The staff was friendly and the food was great. I am a fan of Bombay Grill.
