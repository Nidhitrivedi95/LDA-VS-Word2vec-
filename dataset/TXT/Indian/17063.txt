DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew From the outside the restaurant doesn't look to inviting but once you step in it changed your perspective. Staff was knowledgeable of the items and had good suggestions. I went with the vegetable spring rolls and lamb vindaloo while my girlfriend ordered the samosa trio and chikka masala with garlic butter naan bread. I also ordered one of their house cocktails, the curry mojito. Appetizers came out quick as well as the drinks. The cocktail was a little disappointing. I was expecting the curry flavor to be more present but the flavor of the drink was flat. Definitely enjoyed the trio. Our main entrees came out as soon as we finished our appetizers. I fairly enjoyed my vindaloo while my girlfriend enjoyed her masala. Probably just a preference in food types. Definitely a good place for lunch and portions weren't too big. Will be back to try other dishes.
