A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ Lunch buffet is just $10 ($10.99 on weekends) and dinner is $12 ($12.99 on weekends) so the value is simply unbeatable. But not if the food isn't good but that's not a problem! The food is outstanding!!!

It's a fairly wide assortment of your usual Indian favorites, and always fresh in my experience. And most importantly, delicious!

Desi Spice has become my new go-to Indian place. I very highly recommend it!
