S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA I've been a fan of this place for several years.  My trips to Las Vegas are not complete until I've visited the buffet.  The quality has been the same all the time, the taste has always been great, and the people there are very friendly.  I don't frequent an indian restaurant in Los Angeles as much as I have in Las Vegas.  Looking forward to more food next time I go.
