llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg My husband and I have visited Swad twice since moving near by--and it's very very good. We both love Indian food, and so far Swad has not disappointed. 

We began with an order of vegetable Samosas. They were very fresh, hot, and were very tasty. They had a good spice, but were not spicy. The first time we had them the tamarind sauce was good--it had a little body to it. More recently, it was a little watery.

We also ordered chicken tikka masala, mixed vegetable curry, and plain naan. Their tikka masala is a stand-by for us, and theirs is very good--huge hunks of white meat chicken, creamy sauce. The first time we ordered it we asked for it the be between mild and medium. More recently, we asked for it to be prepared in the same way, but it was a good bit more spicy. We asked for the  mixed vegetable curry to be medium. Both dishes ended up having the same amount of heat--which was a bit too much for me. Next time, I'll ask for mild. At the same time, they are both good dishes. There are tons of vegetables in the curry. Just thank god for the water!

This place is becoming  our to-go place when we want Indian.
