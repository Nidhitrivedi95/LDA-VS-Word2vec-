5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q Tried this new Indian place. Predominantly South Indian cuisine. They offer thali (multiple dishes in small portions, pic attached)  at resonable price. We tried Dakshin and kashmir thali. Dakshin thali had sambhar, vada, veg korma, kal dosa, seasonal vegetable and plain yoghurt, reasonably priced at $9.50. Kashmir thali had chicken curry, lamb rogan josh, rice, Roti, raita, papad and seasonal veg. Not a bad deal for $10.50. We also tried dosa and veg biryani both were ok. Masala lacked salt, dosa is not crispy and chutney is very runny and very tiny portion. 
Rest of the food tasted average at its best. The rice kheer was terrible. 
If you are in the area and just want to eat a quick simple Indian meal, you can give it a shot.
