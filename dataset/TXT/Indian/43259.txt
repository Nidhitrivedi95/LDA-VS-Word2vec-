RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg The service here is pathetic. The servers are pretty rude and seem to not really give a flying fuck about anyone when taking orders or asked about something. The only gentleman who was friendly was the person serving water. The manager here is exceptionally unfriendly and doesn't seem interested in greeting their customers or even caring about anything. On a plus side, the food was pretty good. Hopefully the chefs attitude is unlike these people who are in the front. 
Will never be visiting this indian restaurant again.
