PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA In Vegas craving for indian food, all indian restaurant closes at 10pm. Wth... It's Vegas ... Anyway found this place in a food court inside of riviera casino that's open 24 hours a day.  The food is ok not great but the fact that they are open 24 hours and I got my cravings satisfied.  I did like the chicken Tika masala. The dal was a bit old. Other than that it was satisfactory meal that's why it gets a 4 star.
