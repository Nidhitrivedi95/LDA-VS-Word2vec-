auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I always get the veggie platter whenever I eat Indian food. It's just fun to have some variety. Since there was no dinner vegetarian platter I ordered the appetizer vegetarian sampler. When it came everything was fried. It was good, but I felt disgusting by the time I finished. The veggies were basically potatoes and starches. Ugh. Not what I had in mind. I've been there for lunch buffet before and it was really good. I think I'll stick with lunch.
