zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA Just meh. The nan was glorious - fat, soft buttery pillows of yum. Side salad comes with all combos and is essentially iceberg lettuce. Had the tikki masala lunch and received 5 small chunks of chicken in a very mild sauce - no seasoning whatsoever. Service was attentive, decor is clean and modern. The menu was very limited and way overpriced for the quantity. Won't return.
