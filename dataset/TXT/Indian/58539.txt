YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q I actually like the food, but the owner is rude as hell. I ordered delivery a few times and always asked him not to ring the doorbell. He always did. The last time I ordered, he took almost 2 hours to get to me and then rang the doorbell 8-10 times, like a child. I still would have ordered, except now he says he doesn't deliver to my address, even though his delivery zone on every website says he does. This guy doesn't deserve your business.
