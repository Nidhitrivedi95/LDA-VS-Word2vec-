FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA I am giving one star coz I don't see an option to give something lower than that , we visited this restaurant when they were just a few days old and totally we're excited to try , But it was such an unpleasant experience. We reached around 8:30PM and they would come to take an order only by 09:00PM ... We did place the order and until 10:00 PM we were not served. Not just that their entire system is so chaotic that during our wait they tried to serve us items that we hadn't ordered. Here is why I would never again visit this place .. After our one and half hour wait the chef( place being a open concept kitchen he could see the customers from the kitchen ) finally realized that we weren't served , came to us apologizing for what happened and also mentioned that he just got our order and he was gonna make it in the next ten minutes ... Well honestly we were very tired after the one  and half hour wait also with water dripping from the crappy air conditioner on my husband's head , we had to cancel the order
