HVK_m2JUL24hV-w5q_d2Rg I was reluctant to try this place because I wasn't sure if the place had new owners or whether Nataraj had just renovated and changed its name.  Nataraj was okay, but I would go out of my way to Banjara instead even though Nataraj is only a 3 minute walk from my house.  

I was very pleasantly surprised with how great the food is at The Indian Kitchen.  I ordered my standard butter chicken, saag paneer, and plain naan and rice. It hit the spot - very good sized portions and tasted as good as it gets!  I can't speak for the service because I got take out, but they seemed nice enough. And I agree that most Indian buffets are mediocre (trying to please the common denominator), so I wouldn't judge this place by the buffet.
