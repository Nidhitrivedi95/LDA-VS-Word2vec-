KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Been wanting to check this place out for a while now and finally got the opportunity to. We ordered the Punjabi burger, butter chicken mac n' cheese, and the beef samosas. All I can say is EXPLOSION OF FLAVOUR. Everything exceeded our expectations and our favourite was definitely the mac n cheese. We will definitely return to try the loaded fries and the tbolt.
