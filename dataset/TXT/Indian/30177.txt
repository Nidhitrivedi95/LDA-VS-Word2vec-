JziBbXfW_SRE8hAV9vzq8A Great restaurant in Thornhill.  We have had a number of different dishes. My elderly parents love the rack of lamb. My mother says the french fries (which are flavored with sumac) are the best she has ever had.  Vegetarian offerings are great and salads are very fresh.  We haven't done the all you can eat option because we are not huge eaters but I think it would be a great option.  Servers are very helpful and attentive.
