U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw Had been craving Indian Food for a couple weeks. This place did ok with fulfilling my fix. What i enjoyed was the friendly service. It's a Sunday evening and hubby and I found the $10 for $15 deal on yelp and decided to give it a try. We were the only ones in the place so the young lady was able to give us her undivided attention. She explained the dishes i was curious about and actually offered up a couple samples. I absolutely loved the chicken sheesh kabob that she highly recommended. I asked for spicy and it was! It's minced chicken w green chili and Indian spices rolled into a shape of a sausage. Not on a stick. We also tried the Chicken Boti and the Chicken tikka Marsala (we like chicken) those were good just not as spicy as I like it to be. We plan to return to try the lunch buffet.
