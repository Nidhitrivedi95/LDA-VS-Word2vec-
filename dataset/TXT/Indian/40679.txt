PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw We were on way back from Las Vegas on a road trip and randomly selected this restaurant out of many in Phoenix for a lunch. We had an absolutely fantastic lunch in the form on Veg.Biryani, Paneer Butter Masala and hot butter naans straight from Tandoor. These guys are amazing and really appreciated their hospitality. Must visit place again when in Phoenix.
