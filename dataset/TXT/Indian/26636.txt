So when my friend suggested this place, i was really looking forward to eating Indian food again.  When i entered the restaurant,  i saw lots of empty tables with piles of dirty dishes still yet to be cleaned up.  Then i proceeded to the counter where they displayed all their foods in buffet style.  There were many to choose from.  Also all around the walls there were lots of picture menus to browse through.  I ended up choosing a chicken kebab meal.  It came with 2 skewers, salad, and naan bread.  The kebabs were dry, and the salad looked sad in its wilting state.  The naan bread was ok.  
It really was not the most inspiring meal i ever had.
