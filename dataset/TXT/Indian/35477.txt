MVLQkoWx-uHFVyOBBFfvyQ Delicious vegetarian dishes and excellent service.  I was only two nights in Brampton but enjoyed it so much the first night I came back for the second night.  It was excellent Indian cuisine prepared with spicy but not overly hot sauces.  I would say if you're a strict low fat vegan you should ask for the dishes to be made "low oil" since by default they are fairly heavy.  Also many of the vegi dishes have paneer cheese as an ingredient so you may ask them to make it without paneer.  However the chef is excellent and all dishes can be made to your desires.  I did not try any of the meat dishes but I am sure the tandoori dishes must be quite good.  I tried the vegetarian Jaipui and it was really excellent. The Aloo Tikki Chat appetizer was excellent with the chick pea sauce being spicy and delicious.  The next night I had the Chana Bhatura appetizer which although fried was done just right.  The outside was delicately crisp and the inside just the right texture with amazing flavors.  I had the Navraton Korma which was much milder in flavor but still very tasty.  Next time back I'll have to try the dahl dishes.   They hve a decent beer and wine selection and the prices are OK.
