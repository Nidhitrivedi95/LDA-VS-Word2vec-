-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw Excellent cafe food. It's typical Punjabi home cooked food neither too oily nor spicy. Definitely easy on the wallet. For our road trip to Grand Canyon we packed roti,dal and rice. Even after 7 hours the food  was fresh and tasty.
We also dined in prior to road trip. The lunch thali is a great deal all fresh sabji. Their parathas are super sized and yummy especially cauliflower paratha.
The ambience is not what you are here for just go for home cooked simple meal done with a lot of care and affection. They may be a bit slow in the service but their food is top class. This is a vegetarian place so don't expect anything else. Their rotis are super soft and fresh only 89c. This is truly a hidden gem that none of the pricier competitions can even hold a candle.
