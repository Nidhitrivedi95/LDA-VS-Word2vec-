zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q This is seriously a hidden gem.  I mean it's not hidden, its like, right on the front of 24th  st and Indian School by a bus stop, but, I probably would have never given this place a second thought had a coworker not suggested it a while ago. 

I find myself obessed with their Chicken Kahari.  It is just so freaking good.  It's like crack. So many complex flavors that I just can't comprehend.  It's under the curry section of their menu, but don't expect the typical creamy coconut based curry that we all know.  It's actually like a puree of tomatoes and a bunch of other awesome shit.  I know I'm not doing this dish justice at all so I'm gonna stop here, but please believe me when I say that you MUST try this dish. ( Get it SPICY)

I also like their Chicken Tika Masala.  It's similar to the Indian version, cubes of chicken breast immersed in delicious sauce, but again, this version is NOT creamy.  It's very dense in spices.

Oh and each entree comes with a huge naan (bread) the size of your face x 2.  And their portions are HUGE. 

Service is very friendly and efficient.  What an awesome find in Phoenix, the city of not so awesomeness.
