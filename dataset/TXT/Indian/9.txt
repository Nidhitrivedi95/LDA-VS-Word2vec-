-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g My fiancé and I tried this place for the first time tonight and it was delicious. Definitely one of our new favorite places. We had the tandoori chicken which was to die for and they specially made mushroom saag for me. The service was excellent as well. We will be back for sure.
