PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g I went to this restaurant with a Groupon deal ($25 for $50!), and left utterly impressed with their food!

Their chicken tandoori was to die for. Their chana masala and aloo gobi were also pretty good. Their menu items are priced slightly higher than most Indian restaurants; I feel that it's justified with their classy and intimate setting, and their superb food quality. Our server was very attentive...it would have been a 5 star experience if she was a tad bit friendlier.
