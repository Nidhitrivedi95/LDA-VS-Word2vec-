AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw A couple words about OM: it's super clean, nice ambience, the staff are super friendly, the prices are SUPER reasonable (where else can you get dinner for $6?!), and I love how this seems to be a favourite hangout spot for the Tibetan community.  I also like how they offer Indian food.  

However, as my second ever Tibetan food experience I've come to realize that I'm not a huge Tibetan food fan.  If I was, I would definitely give this place 5 stars.  

We ordered momos - usually I'm a dumpling fan but perhaps being raised on Cantonese-style dumplings and gyoza I find momos to be slightly bland - the vegetable ones were very perogy like with a very thick skin and the chicken ones were almost like the Cantonese ones, again except for the skin.  I did however, enjoy the hot sauce on the side.  

Mango lassis were great, and we also ordered fish pakoras which were a tad like eating fish sticks (except with a tiny bit more spice.)  - they were unfortunately, slightly soggy.

I would give a higher rating to OM but I felt that the food could be slightly improved.
