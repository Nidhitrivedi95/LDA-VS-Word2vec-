jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Lamb and beef are the same so dont bother asking for any of em specifically 
The manager one of the worst people I've ever met 
Food is 3/10 staff members really nice
Dont go there with ur family if u respect them cz the chefs are perverts
If u want a good Indian authentic restaurant i would recommend kabob n more on the strip next to wynn casino
The prices are way beyond what they are actually worth
