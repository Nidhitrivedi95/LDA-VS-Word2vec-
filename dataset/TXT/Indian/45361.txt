s8N66BJ9P-sqhisX47o1Sg Roti Time is another west-end take out option that satisfies my need for flavour while sitting on my couch.  Much like gandhi roti downtown, Roti Time delivers gigantic roti filled with classic indian dishes like spinach paneer or butter chicken. The roti are good, but they are so gigantic and rich that I find it best to order a few kinds and share so you don't get butter chicken overload. Overall, a yummy roti worth trying.
