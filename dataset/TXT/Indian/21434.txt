GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Was in the Tempe area and visited CC to try out their Guy Fieri recommended tandoori chicken. The restaurant welcome us at the door with an immediate aroma and we found the last available table for two even at 3pm on a Saturday.

In between college kids and a sprinkling of Indian patrons, the first thing to visually be distracted by are the loud TVs set to the food network but a lively atmosphere regardless.

As today was yet another fiery day in the desert, the owners decided to let us sweat some more by having on a half working AC (a huuuge gripe for me on summer days) and not enough fans.

As we have a pretty high bar for Indian cuisine, the tandoori chicken was indeed moist and charbroiled well. You get two chicken legs per order along with a side of naan or rice. Hubby went for the tikka masala but he was surprised that there was no question of the preferred heat level by our waitress. It turned out a mild variation of what he's used to and a bit lacking in depth of spices. 

Their naan was more on the thin crispy side so by my standards a 3 star effort at best. And if you're not a huge coriander lover, definitely ask for the curry sans the pungent leafy condiment as CC does tend to overindulge. Hubby's side was the saffron infused rice which was al dente and a good texture.

We probably won't make a special trip out just for dinner but both our meals summed up to definitely less than one dish at our regular spot in north scottsdale, so those on college budgets should continue to feel comfortable with CC being their go to Tempe curry joint!
