UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I choose this place based on all the other good reviews on yelp. I ordered delivery and I decided at 5pm what I wanted and when, so I placed the order at 5pm for delivery at 8pm. My food arrived by 9pm and was colder than I would have liked. The quality of the food itself is good, however I would not recommend ordering delivery from this place considering that they are not capable of delivering on time and hot food, however if you go to their restaurant I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
