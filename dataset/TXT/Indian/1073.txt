-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw Ok for starters, I like this joint as they filled the void for a decent Indian Carry out joint in town. I do not like the exorbitant prices they charge though. You could add a dollar to most of their menu items and that would be the lunch buffet price at other joints around town. I tried their Goat biriyani and was surprised at the amount of fat that was in the food. If you are looking to clog your arteries, go ahead and try the mutton biriyani here.  Surprisingly they had a better quality when I visited the place around their launch period. Like most Indian restaurants in the Valley, the quality seems to have deteriorated over time.
