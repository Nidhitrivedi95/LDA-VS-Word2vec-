GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I have been eating here for more than a year now since i moved to AZ , had couple of incidents with them where they gave me the wrong order or my order will be missing sth , i told them about it and they didn't do anything about it
This time i ordered the mixed grill, yummy stuff, but it wasn't cooked right, the chicken was raw  
I gave up on this place 
I don't recommend this place for customers who are looking for consistency in food and service
