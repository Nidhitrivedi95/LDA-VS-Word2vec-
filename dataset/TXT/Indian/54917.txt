WnRqXZN_tR058EufqS1kAw Sanjeev Kapoor is a big brand name for Indian cuisine. Visiting this place means you are signing up for some real differentiated food and  a great service. You come here with expectations and obviously have a standard that the food needs to match up to. The good news : Yes, the food is nice, ambience is awesome and the staff is friendly. The sad news: There are a few better Indian restaurants in the GTA (not near this one though) that beats this place hands down on service, ambience and food. We were the only ones in the restaurant that evening and it took them for ever to prepare the food. Service is incredibly slow. Also, I am not sure why they would play some punjabi dance music for that ambience - just did not go with it. I thought some nice melodious bollywood music would do the trick. The folks are also worried about any additional ask. We asked for some raita and also some onions. We were immediately told that it would cost us extra (LOL!). I'll give it a 4 star given it has a Sanjeev Kapoor brand and the food was different. I am hoping that they will address some of their teething problems as they operationalize the restaurant and live up to Sanjeev Kapoor's fame.
