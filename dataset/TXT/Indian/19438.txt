fEymsotOKc5V6-z7pZLPrw BEST CHINESE FOOD EVER. Ordered take out from here a few times and have never been disappointed. The restaurant seems a little sketchy from outside but their food is verrrrry good. They give you huge portions that are made fresh for very cheap, will definitely be coming back.
