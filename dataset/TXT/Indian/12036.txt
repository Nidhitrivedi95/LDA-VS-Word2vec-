auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ So with the colder weather, how can Indian food not come to mind to warm you up? Well that is precisely how we stumbled upon Taj Palace recently after looking up reviews in the area.

Upon arriving, we were a bit concerned because it was pretty much empty despite how big the interior is. We liked how clean it looked so we opted to stay and we are super glad we did!

So first thing is first.... not much goes better with spicy food than ice cold beers. And we were pleased to see that there was a pretty sizable selection including Indian varieties as well. Only thing that goes almost as well with spicy Indian is the mango lassi which we were please to find upon checking in on Yelp that we were entitled to one complimentary. It was creamy, tangy and delicious!

We were starving when we arrived so we quickly ordered a couple of appetizers while we pondered the menu. We ordered samosas as well as curry mussels. The samosas were a bit dry so we weren't crazy about them however the curry mussels were spectacular! 

For our entrees we opted for both the tikka masala as well as the vindaloo. Oh and of course some garlic naan. Both were delicious and warmed us from the inside out. 
Decent size portion so we even left with extra for lunch the next day!
