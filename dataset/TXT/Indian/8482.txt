7NurnM6G9b_2jTEKpIkQpg After coming here for lunch for a few days now, I must say that my favorite thing here are still the veggie samosas! I get some of those every time I come here, they are so good! and Spicy!

What I really like the most about this place is how quick you get your food, the service is as fast if not faster than going to a fast food place. Plus the food is so much better! I have always really liked Indian food, the spicy flavours, the variety of vegetables, its so nice to find a good Indian food place like this one. 

I will mostly likely be here for lunch many more times. For the samosas, mutton rolls, nan, rice, veggies... I like it all.
