HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Late Saturday night and my sister and I were starting to get hungry, so we headed to Red Lobster.. Wait what? That's right, we went there for endless shrimp. Unfortunately (fortunately?), the wait was too long so off we went to Saffron Patch!

We got there right at the end of the rush, and were seated immediately. The menu is extensive so we perused a while before I suggested we just get the "Dinner for Two" option under the vegetarian dishes. Two appetizers (samosas and papadum), three curries (names of which I have no idea), other random items (dal, naan, ect.), rice pudding, and a pickle dish (which was disgusting) came with the meal. WE WERE STUFFED and HAD LEFTOVERS!

Service was lacking slightly for what I would consider a classy looking restaurant, but no matter. We were pleased! My personal favorite was the curry that had some sort of cheese and veggie ball. It looked and had a similar consistency of a meatball. The sauce was a creamy pink color and spicy. I wish their website menu was up to date, it would make it easier to recall the dish names :(
