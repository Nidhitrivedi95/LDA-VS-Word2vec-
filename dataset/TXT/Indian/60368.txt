ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Weekend lunch buffet is totally worth it, even though it's not extensive or overly ambitious. There is always enough to make me full and happy. There are at least 6-8 veg items, including rice, daal, Chinese fusion noodles, 2 curries, fried onions and a chaat bar. Their chutneys are good and plenty and the naan is refreshed often. 

The prices are very reasonable, less than $10/person for the buffet. 

The interior is small and crowded. If you are unlucky enough to get a table in the middle, expect the buffet line to wind next to your table. Don't wait to be presented with the bill; you might sit there for a while. Just head up to the register and tell him what you had and you'll get checked out a lot faster.
