f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I thought this food was both different and better than at many of the well known local Indian restaurants.  They certainly use a greater variety of spices.  The saag was very tasty, as was the chicken tikka masala, and the chili chicken.  All in a buffet!  The bhindi (okra) was prepared in a different way than I'd had previously.  I recommend this  restaurant highly!
