jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw The food was really good I had the chicken tiki masala with plain naan and I got it to go. I went during the day so it wasn't busy. The young lady at the counter was very nice. My lunch was ruined by my dog when I got home she dumped the chicken onto my carpet and the sauce got all over her just bathed paws. So yes I will have to go back and dine in. But the food is worth it.
