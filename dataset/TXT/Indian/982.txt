-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw I frequent this place since it was opened.Dum biryani is my favorite on the menu. Having said that, the owner has really lowered the quality lately. Most of the time it was not fresh, especially on Monday through Thursday. You would be lucky to have fresh and delicious biryani on weekdays.

The owner gets rude if I asked him whether the biryani is fresh. several times he claimed to be fresh but it turned out that the biryani must have been leftover from at least a day ago.
