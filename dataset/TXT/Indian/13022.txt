b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw My fiancee and I walked in to Namaste almost on a whim- we were hungry and craving Indian food! From the minute we walked in, we were immediately hit with a very strong smell of spices. We started off by ordering the Gobi 65, which was delicious! I ordered the Vegetable Curry, with garlic naan. My fiancee ordered the palaak paneer. Both dishes were delicious and very filling- we went home with a little bit of both. The vegetable curry was a little spicier than I typically like, but still very delicious. My fiancee said that the palaak paneer wasn't as spicy as she would like, but it still tasted good. I also ordered a Sprite, which was very syrupy and not very carbonated.  The bathrooms were well maintained and clean. All of the staff was friendly. Overall, it was a fantastic meal and I would definitely go back again.
