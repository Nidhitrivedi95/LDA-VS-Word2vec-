ezDMJGONUEy1DyGSJ3vUJw The food was great! I loved goat and lamb curry ( I forgot the name of the food).
The price was quite high for lunch buffet that open till 3pm (its about $12). Its the same price if you go to Pasific Buffet but you can get more choices ..lol.
The only thing that less interesting was the service. The guy who working as a cashier served us that time. He didn't smile, didn't answer everytime we said thank you (I mean, you should be polite to customer, at least, right?!), and he didn't care about our water drink until we asked for it. Even with those experienced, I like to give 4 stars just because the food was very very yummy! Delicioso!!!
I would like to go back (but might be in different time.lol..who knows, I might get another waiter that more friendly than that man..lol )
