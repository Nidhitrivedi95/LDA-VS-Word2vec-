LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw I have had the lunch buffet here before and decided it was fine but nothing to write home about. However we went there for dinner tonight and had an experience worthy of getting the figurative pen and paper out. 

We entered shortly after they opened and we were promptly greeted by a very friendly middle aged man. Not sure if he is the owner because I have seen him here every time I visit. After reviewing the menu we decided to splurge and get the Maharajah feast for two. 

We started with mixed vegetarian appetizers and it was fun to sample a little bit of everything. I knew I was in trouble during this course - we had just started dinner and I was already getting full. Everything on the vegetable appetizer plate was fried which was good but heavy. The meat appetizer plate came out next and the lamb was my favorite. I am super picky about lamb and it is a testament to how delicious it was. 

Next our mains came out - the chicken tikka masala, chicken bhuna and the mixed vegetable curry. The chicken tikka masala was full of wonderful spice with creamy aspect to cut the heat. The man who greeted us served the entire meal and made sure to offer us additional nan and rice. Like we needed any more food at this point!

We ended with a delicious kheer which I could only take a couple bites of since I was so stuffed. There was plenty leftover to take for lunch tomorrow. The service was attentive and the food absolutely delicious. I would recommend this for anyone craving Indian.
