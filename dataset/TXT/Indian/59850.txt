ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg We were impressed with the service, ambience and of course-food! The lamb was fresh, the onion kulcha was incredible and their chicken was to die for. Even the sauces on the table were fresh.It is nice having Indian cuisine so fresh and close to home. Don't fear vegetarians, there's a menu just for you. The owner told us they are very close to obtaining a liquor license, even better! Can't wait to dine here again! Cheers.
