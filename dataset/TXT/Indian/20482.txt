fVbZptKCH2lIRS56M1zc6g We gave this place two chances.

It's -15 C and they keep the front doors closed. We had to walk all the way to the side door with a child. I asked them why they keep the front double doors closed and their excuse was that customers on the door side might get a draft. The purpose of double doors is to keep cold out. I guess they didnt read the instructions. 

The food sucks! No taste, just bland. Blah! 

The side door is right in front of the menu so the food is was dead cold. The naan was not edible. 

Service was non existent. 

I don't think the food is worth more than $10 per dish. I would steer clear.
