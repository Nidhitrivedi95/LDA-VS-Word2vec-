ffWkln-XUcOyh_K9SK5oBQ The restaurant was recommended to us from a friend in the neighbourhood so my girlfriend and i decided to check it out! The atmosphere is very tranquil and has lots of positive sayings and material to discover while visiting. The staff was very nice and talkative which is really great. The food was reasonably priced but i feel i was left wanting more flavour. I ordered the masala Dosai and my gf ordered the squash pea soup, basmati rice and mixed vegetables.

I would return here to give it another go and i do not want to discourage other people from going because it was a pleasant experience.
