IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Hidden gem! We've been coming here for years and the food quality has been consistent, along with the generous portion sizes as fair prices. My husband and I mainly order the kabob options, along with koobideh- always so flavorful! The basmati rice is delicious and always perfectly cooked. Their baklava is amaaaaaaazing- my only complaint is that I wish that portion side was bigger- it is addicting! Great place if you're looking for something casual, relaxing and with the feel of an authentic, home made meal!
