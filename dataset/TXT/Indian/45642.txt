scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Food at Haveli is always delicious. They have the friendliest staff in the surrounding Madison area. Great for take out or dine in. I absolutely love the vegetable masala, but you can't really go wrong with any of their dishes. I'd even go so far as to say Haveli might be the best restaurant in Fitchburg
