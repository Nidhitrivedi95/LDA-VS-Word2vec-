JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Why are some Southern-Indian restaurants called "Woodlands"?  In the United States, they are usually located in gritty urban environments, far from any forested areas!  This one's actually situated not far from some random clumps of trees, but shabby strip centers and even a demolished mall are more prominent nearby landmarks, rather than any real woodlands.

But enough of that.  Whatever the genesis of its name, this Woodlands is very good.  

We went for the weekend buffet.  As advertised on Woodlands' street sign, the restaurant serves "pure vegetarian" cuisine.  (I think the word "pure" is meant as an extra warning to those folks who, as incredible as it seems in 2014, remain unsure whether fish and even chicken (!) qualify as "vegetables.")  The buffet itself isn't that extensive: a couple of soups; a few starchy items like vada, uthappam, and paratha; and four or five veggie items like dal and palak paneer.  This stuff was mostly delicious.  But best of all, you get a complimentary masala dosa.  This was the highlight of the lunch:  It was griddled perfectly, with a nice balance of chewiness and crispness.  

Good stuff.

The decor at Woodlands is somewhat dreary--it's dated and dim, but comfortable enough.  Service was efficient but a little stiff.
