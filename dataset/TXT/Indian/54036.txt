vrAZ6qenlYwHfgzSSlmkiQ Went there for the first time 2 weeks ago after a friend recommended them to me. The buffet table is huge and each dish was HEAT hot ! Had two large plates of their delicious food, easily, the best Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at in Toronto and after I left, I quickly got online to inform others of this establishment. Going again real soon!! Dishes such as the Tandoori Chicken, Channa Masala, crispy Naan Bread and baked Veggie Samosas are as good/great as it gets in Toronto. Service was friendly, glasses constantly filled, and the food kept coming out of the kitchen, quickly. Can't believe Regency slipped under my radar as it's not far from where I live. Worthy of REPEAT visits !
