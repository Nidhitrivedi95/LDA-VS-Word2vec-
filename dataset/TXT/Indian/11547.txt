ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ You guys. I have an addiction to dosa and so any time I'm in a close vicinity to a place that makes dosa I HAVE to go there. Luckily Evelyn W knows me well and planned our lunch outing at Madras Masala.

Have you seen the pictures for this listing? The dosas are so giant there is no way I should be able to eat one all by myself. But, they are also so delicious that I did just that. And I'd do it again. I ordered the Madras Masala dosa because I figured if they named it after the restaurant it had to be a signature item. It turns out that number 89, just called Masala dosa, is the original, but after just one bite I didn't care.

The place was pretty empty when we stopped in for a late lunch, but the service was spectacular. I also loved that they had a kid's section that included dosas shaped like Mickey Mouse and mini versions of big meals. 

And now, I'm dreaming of dosa until my next fix...
