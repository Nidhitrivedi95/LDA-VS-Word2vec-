i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ Yesterday went to this restaurant loved the menu selection, I ordered andhra spicy coconut dosa, dosa tasted very nice but was not happy with the watery chutneys they offer with it..... Plus no coconut chutney but I liked they offer different podi n pickles with it..... There service is quick n nice...... Would love more if they give nice chutney with dosa
