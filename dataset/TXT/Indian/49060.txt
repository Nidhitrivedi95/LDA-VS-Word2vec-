TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw THE BEST INDIAN FOOD IN VEGAS!
My girlfriend and I were accidentally one of the first people to eat at Namaste. We were in the area and are very familiar with the great places in the tucked-away Commercial Center. As I recall we were considering going to Komol, one of our favorite Thai food restaurants and hangouts, when we saw that Namaste was finally open. We both love Indian food as she primarily eats vegetarian and Indian restaurants are easy targets for us.

THE LUNCH BUFFET FOR $9 IS NOT TO BE MISSED! Indian buffets are hit-or-miss. Some will put out the standard dishes and only have one or two really yummy entrees set out. Not Namaste! They pull out all the stops and have many favorite dishes out at the same time. 

Mind you, the place is new, and many new places will start out this way and then go downhill, but I don't think this will be the case with Namaste. Chef and owner, Om Singh, has a reputation that precedes him in the culinary world and I suspect that the quality at Namaste will endure.

We have eaten here many times since it has opened up and every meal has been outstanding. Most notably, the VEGETARIAN DINNER FOR TWO ($40) is perfect. From the first course to the last it is exceptionally yummy. The main courses are all super good and it was so plentiful we had a lot of left-overs for lunch the next day. And the dessert, especially the carrot one, is REALLY GOOD.

The wait staff is very friendly and are constantly circling the floor. The atmosphere is decent and comfortable. I attend a discussion group every Sunday afternoon and we usually go out to dinner afterward. Komol is one of our regular haunts, but now it seems that Namaste will be our new default location.
