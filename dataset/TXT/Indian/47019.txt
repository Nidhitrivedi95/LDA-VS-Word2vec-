t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Went with a friend as everyone raves about this place.  We shared Kung Pao Chicken, Szechuan Beef and the Mixed Manchurian Fried Rice.  Spicy and fresh, but low quality meats.  The beef was quite chewy.  Also, tried to ask about ingredients, as my friend has a gluten sensitivity.  They had no clue what I was talking about.  Overall, I've had better.
