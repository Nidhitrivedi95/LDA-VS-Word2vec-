UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg My partner and I ate at Banjara a few days ago and I'm still dreaming about those delicious onion kulchas, the creamy butter chicken, the crispy papadums and the delectable chicken samosas. 

This was our first time at Banjara and it was completely worth the trip! It was Saturday night so we expected it to be busy, but we managed to grab a seat at the "bar" get a couple of Indians beers and wait until a table opened up. The 25 minute wait flew by as we munched on complimentary papadums and watched the guys in the guys in the kitchen work their magic. 

When we were finally seated the staff were courteous and attentive. Our meal took a bit longer then I would have liked but we were in no rush and as stated earlier the place was packed. The food arrived piping hot and absolutely delicious. The only problem we had was that our eyes were bigger then our stomachs!  Leftovers were taken home and demolished the next day for lunch.

I have given this place a 4 instead of a 5 only because the kitchen lost our order and our food was took longer then I would have expected. Also the decor could use a little updating (you can still see remnants of the old Donut shop). 

All in all the food was terrific, the staff were polite, and all importantly: the bathrooms were clean.
