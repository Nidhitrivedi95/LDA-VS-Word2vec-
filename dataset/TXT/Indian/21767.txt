He welcomes every guest and makes them feel special. Food is really good and I highly recommend Chicken Garam masala, Prawn poori, Methi Chicken and Saag paneer. You can take your own booze, so that's an advantage as well. The only dampners are repititive music (Really they must buy some new CDs) and garish interiors.
