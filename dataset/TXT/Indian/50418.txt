UbZePypGiEf11l1X7mv2SQ My family and i came here to celebrate my cousin's first pay check as a doctor. I know. Any excuse that we can come up with to see each other is great lol! We were around 26-28 people and they had more then enough food for all of us. Believe me when i say that our family of small, little vietnamese people, we CAN eat like champions! So... We chose to come here for the lunch buffet. At only 12,95$ per person, it's quite a bargain!

Now for the food. The buffet offers a small variety of classic indian dishes. Amongst other things, you will find the samosa, the tandoori chicken, the veal masala and the infamous butter chicken. All the dished that has sauce in them were way too salty! It felt like it was done on purpose so you would fill yourself with naan bread, dry basmati rice and water. I'm pretty sure it's a trick that some buffet restaurants do. It's too bad because the flavours were there. The cool thing was the 5-6 different sauces-condiments! 

Recap.Service is nothing out of this world. 
Food was very salty. Prices are very reasonable! Will i come back? No. There are much, much better indian restaurants in Montreal. I know. This restaurant is in Laval. But the Lachapelle bridge to cross over to Montreal is 2 minutes away :)
