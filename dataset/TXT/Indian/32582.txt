LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA delicious food, I had the 14 piece idly, which was very flavourful, there was also a powbhaji dosa and a kids meal dosa that was ordered. there were no complains about the food but the service was horrible. 

we were seated at a table and felt extremely rushed to place an order when we hadn't even gotten our water yet. the host kept coming back every few mins with "ready to order?" and then because we were taking "too long" we were asked to move seats as the area we were sitting in was reserved for a party. WHY seat us somewhere knowing you have a larger party coming in? it was extremely annoying and to top it off, the staff started moving tables to the side of people who were already eat. I was so annoyed by that. 

after getting moved tables our server changed and had a very hard time not only understanding us but also answering questions - we asked if we could have another person but that never happened. 

overall, great food - but horrible service, this is my second time coming here and experiencing the same problem, not sure how I feel about returning.
