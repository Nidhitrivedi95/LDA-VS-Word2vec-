ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w I've been going to Strats since... well before I should have been allowed in bars. They have gone through of alot of renovations and many staff turnovers but still is a decent place to grab a drink and a bite to eat but not pay out the ass or end up in the local dregs. 
To call Strats a divebar makes you either a prude, hipster or a person who grew up way too privileged. The staff is for the most part friendly and there are locals that you can always count on for a decent chat. People from the local carpenter, famous writers, obscure music legends and even a teachers party or 2 from local schools. 
The butter chicken is quite good and their wood fired pizzas and calzones are out this world.

Strats is a good old haunt that you can't go wrong with.... would you rather be at the duke?
