You can request your spice level, at the time of ordering and the chef/owner seasons it accordingly.  I am Indian myself, and we cook goat curry at home all the time. I'm happy to find a place which knows how to really make it , and is not resorting to short-cuts or using the same sauce base for everything.


Interior of the restaurant is simple cafeteria style decor and is very clean. 

It appears their samosas are also very popular, judging from the numbers of orders they get.  They have a good selection of chaats, vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Will go back for sure!
