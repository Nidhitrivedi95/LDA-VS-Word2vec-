yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Came with my vegan dining partner. We came at lunch and they had only the buffet but we told them we were vegan so they let us order off the menu. Although we announced we were vegan, I ordered a chai tea, and they brought me a chai with creme :( so it was quickly exchanged for a plain black tea. The spice was a tiny heavy for a 6 of 10, so use caution there. Very yummy, easy menu and good value. Very close to UNLV! Worth a try.
