I've had 1.5 takeaways from Mr. India Haveli, located inside Mr. India Grocers, a fairly new, Indian grocery store.  Whenever I drive by, the parking lot appears empty, so I have been a bit hesitant to try it out.

Samosas:  Edible, but not great.  Stuffing is uneven, so at some bites, you'll get more crispy wrapping than you will potato/peas/whatnot.  Reasonably priced at $1 for 2 samosas.

Chicken Biryani:  I just finished eating it.  Visually, it was a bit of a soupy mess!  Rice was long-grain, but not as thin as basmati.  Rice was rather wet and overcooked, so they added too much water.  Chicken was moist, boneless, not sure if it was cooked with the rice itself.  Flavours are decent, but again, too mushy/wet!

Fish Pakora:  Not sure if this is what it was called, but it's the shape of a burger patty and has some kinda minced fish.  Tasty, but a bit too salty, and mushy/wet again.

There are daily specials each day.  I believe Tuesdays is Chicken Biryani for $5, usually $5.99.  So unless this was an off-day, you're curious, or really hankering for Indian food, and are in the area, there are better places around!
