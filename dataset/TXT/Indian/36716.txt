NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg A good take on fast casual Indian food.  The quality is not akin to a sit-down restaurant, however it is priced well and tasty nonetheless.  The service is wonderful and there is a selection of bottled beers available.  I had the Indian beer Kingfisher and the local brewed pilsner, and would say the latter went better with the meal.  Good, open ambiance, and a great environment for a quick meal, takeout or a meetup with friends.

The biriyani bowls are made with a breaded shell like a pot pie.  This is the first time I've seen that, and while it is a novel concept it didn't enhance the meal.  I also had the chicken tikka masala and found it to be delicious.
