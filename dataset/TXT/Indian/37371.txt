o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Food was pretty good. First time doing take out, horrible wait service. Wait was 45mins, as told, but waited an additional 30mins when I got there. It wasn't like there were a lot of people dinning in. There were more take out orders, and everyone had to wait additionally while we were there. Food finally  was ready, but there the garlic nann was a small single order, so I added 2 more. Was told it would be another 5min... it was like 10-15mins! How is there not just a ton of garlic nann under a warmer ready to go! Poor people in he restaurant were waiting forever for their food too. I don't think anyone was actually eating. Will not be dinning in or take or ever again with them!! Should have just gone to Blue Taj.
