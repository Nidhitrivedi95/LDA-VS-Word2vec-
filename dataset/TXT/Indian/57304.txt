Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ We were heading back home (Altoona) from Pittsburgh. Must say, they are one of the best Indian food in United States. We ordered Veg Samosa and Aloo Puri Chaat for starters, bread basket and Paneer Tikka Makhani for the main course and Ras Malai for desserts. Food was delicious and clean. Ambience is too good!
Must visit.
