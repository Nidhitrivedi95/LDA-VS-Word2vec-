J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I tried Little India a few days after Trimurti, I like both but i think that Little India just shades Trimurti in overall choice and ambience. 

It took a little longer than I would like to get our order taken , but once that happened the food , a hell of a lot of it in big portions came fast and furious.
