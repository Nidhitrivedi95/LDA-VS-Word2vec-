xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg We went in on a Friday evening and it was pretty slow but the server was very attentive and friendly.  I liked the big screen TV they had playing also.. overall the portions are very good and while I wasn't a fan of the biryani I thought the flavor of the korma was spot on and their rice had a nice subtle flavor too.  We will definitely be back.
