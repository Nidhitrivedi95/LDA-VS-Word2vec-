QMB3hmb_Yv6Vk-HLiM2cdA I've been here twice and got the combo platter each time. There was so much food that it took me two meals to finish it all. The staff are friendly and explained what each dish was. The dishes are packed with flavour and I really like the flat bread that comes with it. My favourite thing was the halwa dessert that comes with the meal. It's fluffy with the perfect amount of sweetness. The second time I went, there were some different dishes to try.

My only comment is that I wish they would have a greater selection of less spicy dishes because my tongue isn't very good with hotness.

And as Ryan D commented, the address listed is incorrect. They're located at 1410 Victoria Park at Sunrise.
