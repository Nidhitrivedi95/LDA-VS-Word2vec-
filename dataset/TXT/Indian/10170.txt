9MpWhQOYziJ38EB7MctxcA I have dined at dozens of Indian restaurants from California to Minneapolis to Florida and this is among the very best you will find.  This is far beyond the cheap Indian restaurants you find with generic oily "curry" that has no authentic indian spices.  Cafe Tandoor is the real deal with high quality ingredients and a real tandoor oven.  You can taste the difference, and yes, you will pay a little more for the real thing.  This place is a bargain for authentic Indian food.  Try the butter chicken if you are not familiar with the cuisine and go from there.  AMAZING!!!
