NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw I love this place. I went there after various friends gave it rave reviews. When people hype a place too much, I'm always a bit hesitant...  Overall, I was very impressed with the food. My mattar paneer was so good - and I pretty much have it at every Indian restaurant I go to. The paneer came in huge chunks and it was delicious. Overall, the food there is excellent - it has good layers of flavours and the prices are reasonable. It's becoming my go to place for Indian.  
The only negative about the place is that its small so you should make reservations and the service is a bit slow.
