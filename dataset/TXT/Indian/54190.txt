vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw When I think of Indian food, I think: "You can't go wrong. Everywhere is the same." Amaya is a different story - but in a good way,  I promise. I'm usually a fan of Banjara, but Amaya offers up a more Haute look at traditional Indian food - and I like it. I went here for the last day of Summerlicious (today) for lunch. Ordered the Chicken Tikka appetizer, Crispy fish "bento box" and mango cheesecake. Summerlicious always means reduced servings sizes, so my hope is that these ridiculously undersized portions are normally larger - because trust me, that is the only complaint here.The chicken tikka was mouth-watering, succulent and extremely tender and I even liked the mint sauce ( I usually hate mint). The crispy fish was a piece of fresh-tasting cod (very small), crusted in a spicy coating and served with a small salad and a chutney. I teased the waiter about this not being a "bento box" or even a "box" but i dug into the flakey moist cod with its crispy, perfectly seasoned crust and was in heaven. It paired perfectly with the green chutney and I could offer no further critique on the presentation after that mouthful. I'm extremely picky with fish and this was as tasty and as far from "fishy" as it comes. The mango cheesecake for dessert was divine - with a crunchy brown-sugar butter crust that i could have eaten on it's own. Once again - only complaint: "I want more!" The kingfisher beer was an excellent choice with both main and dessert. I've been avoiding this place, thinking the price tag couldn't possibly justify the food, but i was wrong. I will be back here again - probably to purchase an entire mango cheesecake.
