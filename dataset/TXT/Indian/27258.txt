Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q The chicken in Madras Chicken was very dry. Dal Makhani was very watery and not flavourful at all.  The delivery time said 50 minutes, but it took additional 25 minutes for the food to show up. My stomach was upset for a day after having eaten the food from this place. Never again!!
