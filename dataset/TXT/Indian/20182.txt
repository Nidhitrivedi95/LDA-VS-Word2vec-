fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA I came here on a Saturday night for their buffet ($13.99). They have a decent selection of food with an especially large variety of goat dishes.

What I particularly love about this buffet compared to other places is that they have a waiter who brings fresh naan to your table.  Also, there's is constantly a waiter or a waitress passing by in case you need anything. The service here is a A+.

I highly recommend this restaurant and I'll be coming back here soon!
