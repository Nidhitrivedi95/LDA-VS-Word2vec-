UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I came here for dinner so i have yet to try the lunch buffet. I came with two friends and we got the Indian prix fixe tasting for two and got an order of chicken tikka masala as well. Our server was nice and friendly and the food came out in a timely manner. I liked how we were able to tell them the level of spiciness we wanted for our food. That's the thing with the Indian lunch buffets, you get what's there and sometimes you just want a little more spice. The food came out in these small looking pot things and I was worried it might not be enough. It was a lot! Those things are deceiving lol we did ended up getting more orders of rice and naan bread because you just need that to soak up all the great sauces in the dishes. I can't wait to go back and try their lunch buffet next.
