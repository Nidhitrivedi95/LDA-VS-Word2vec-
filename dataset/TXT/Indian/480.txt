-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g I've had plenty of Indian food but never had chicken tikka masala with tough stringy weird texture in several of the pieces. Given that they give you only 6-8 pieces this makes a difference. Not to mention the yuk factor as to maybe the chicken wasn't cooked properly? I didn't get sick so that's the good news.
