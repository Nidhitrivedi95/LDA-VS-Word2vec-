eRxkg193gzTGoKaj-7Wyig The dosas here are still 5 stars. But after a recent dinner here, I do have to amend my review slightly.

I'd only ever been for lunch before. The lunch menu has a much larger dosa menu, with at least 6 different vegetarian and 6 different meat dosas. These dosas are "smaller" and by smaller I mean the size of a small baby. They have lamb dosa, mushroom dosa, two types of chicken. So good. And only £2.99 for a potato dosa (masala dosa).

The dinner menu only has 6 dosas total, and the only meat options are chicken or prawn (small prawns at that). They are also 'bigger' and by big I mean the size of your entire body. SO big. Equally delicious, but I was really disappointed when I asked if I could see the lunch time dosa menu and they said it wasn't available. It was a quiet Monday night, and if they were making chicken tikka dosas I didn't see why a mushroom dosa would be out of the question.

The service was very proper, but a little confused. The girl who served us seemed very shy and unsure and had to re-check several times, and then took quite a while to take our order. But it was still nice, they were friendly and eager to please.

The restaurant itself is a bit worn and tired, and bizarrely posh looking. Very fancy, like out of the 80s / 90s attempts at being fancy. The floor, both myself and my dosa-date noticed, was beautiful. Old fashioned marble-esque black and white tiles. I do think the decor could do with an upgrade.

But the worst part was how cold it was. It was a cold January night outside and whilst the restaurant was warmer than outside, we both had to dine with our jackets on. And my toes were as cold as ice cubes by the time I left. And our food went cold very quickly. It really was far too cold to be comfortable to dine in.

I will still come here for the dosas, and the dosas alone. They are wonderful, quite authentic and unusual to any other Indian restaurant in Edinburgh.
