GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw So I ate here like three months ago. i might've been 1 out of 3 other customers that cold january afternoon, but when I walked in, i didn't get greeted (probably due to my shy quiet nature) and sat down at one of the tables. It took a minute or two before anyone realized I was there, didn't think too much about it, they were all flummoxed about me just sitting there with my kindle reading. but I came in knowing what it was that i wanted to eat, the Chicken Tikka Masala (by far favorite all-time dish). ow to kinda jump away from the review a little bit. I moved to Phoenix June of last year, into an area that has a high concentration of Indian restaurants, but it took me a little while, going from shop to shop trying to find the best chicken tikka. Tandoori Times 2 hit it on the head, the chicken was tender, the sauce was spicy but not overpowering, slightly citric and sour (but really freaking good), the naan was crispy, but folded really well while scooping up sauce and chicken. but this place has won me over for when I need to get my curry fix :D
