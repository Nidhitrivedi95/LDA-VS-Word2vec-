P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I came here for a Saturday late lunch. The lunch buffet was priced at $10 (but with $1 discount for students). I thought there was good variety. The buffet consists of a salad bar with various chutneys and dressings. There are also your basic entrees like chicken tikka masala, goat curry, tandoori chicken with staples like garlic naan and basmati rice.

As you can expect from a buffet, the quality of the food is not as good as if it were freshly prepared for you. The chicken tikka masala was dried out and the naan was a bit soggy due to being trapped in a steamed catering tray. However, I still enjoyed my meal very much.

It's hard to beat All India, especially given its price.
