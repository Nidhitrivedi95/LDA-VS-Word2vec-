LgqGDQsUurUh6qUocPeSsQ I came here with a group of fellow food lovers.  The place was fairly full on a Thursday evening, but a table for 8 was available. 

We decided to each order a different dish, and try a bit of everything.  The chicken tikka was great - the chicken was tender and flavourful and the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  The saag paneer, a spinach dish with paneer cheese, was delicious - fresh pieces of ginger gave it a nice bite.  We also had the goat curry.  The goat was tender and moist.  We mopped up the delicious sauces with fresh buttery naan bread or let it soak into the well cooked basmati rice.   
 
Service was friendly and efficient, and the staff has a good sense of humour.
