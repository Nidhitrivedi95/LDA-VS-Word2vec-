EvzFhESmKKNksjcsWxIDnQ Awesome service. I catered for 20 people today and although they were closed they took my order and delivered to my door right on time. food was great, I had asked for extra meat on the veal pulao and was not disappointed. Chicken Karahi and the Tandoori naan was phenomenal. Thanks Desi flavors.
