NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ My son & I found this one day & have been back many times since.

I've never been to India before, but I'm guessing this is as authentic as it gets.

We've tried just about everything on the menu and haven't had anything we didn't like.  My son really likes the Chicken 65 & if you like spicy, you should give it a try.
