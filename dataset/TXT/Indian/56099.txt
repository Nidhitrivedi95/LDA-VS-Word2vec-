xihEFvukZaHPwCPMNR2qRA Loved the food! Food was fresh and servings are large. We had the chicken tikka rolls and the chicken biryani.  Spice level was good and the taste was pretty authentic.  If you're comparing Amaya to an Indian restaurant then yes its expensive but it's in a mall, and they compete with Chipotle and BigSmokeBurger so I think they're pretty affordable in comparison.
