KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ This is my regular go-to with my bros, because it's the only place we can all agree on when we get together for some grub. 

Don't expect a fine dining experience, the atmosphere (especially at night) is definitely not first-date material...but the food is good, the options are plenty. 

It's not cheap or very quick, considering the food is ready and out, I'd say average prices for a Pakistani/Indian restaurant. But, getting a good, genuine desi food experience downtown, though it's becoming more available, still, this place does it right. 

There are always people there, any time of night, and there's usually some Bollywood film playing in the background. It's a very no-fuss kind of place, and I always leave completely stuffed and satiated. 

I see this place being on my regular-visit list for a long time.
