0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw This is the worst indian restaurant I have ever been to in my entire life.food is so awful, tasteless,flavourless.Not a single item is good.we had lunch buffet n there were samosa,kachori ,veg and non veg curries but not a single item was good.i wonder how people come n eat there .mostly students from ASU visiting because price is cheap.But I Wil never go there ever again.
