ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Seriously super good Dosa, We were craving for Indian Masala Dosa and found Origin India to be the only spot serving dosa during lunch, off strip. It was a quiet lunch for them with one table and then us. The hostess was welcoming and when we asked if they serve Dosa, instant answer was best in town. 
I agree
We ordered two masala dosas and boy they were delicious and very good size too. Value for money for what you get. 
Will be back with Dosa craving, would like to try more dosa styles
