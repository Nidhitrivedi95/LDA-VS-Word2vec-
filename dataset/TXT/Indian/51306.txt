UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ This spot offers amazing, authentic food served by kind, hospitable staff. After my visit, I could not have asked for more. I personally favor a homely, familial type feel with places I eat at and Kabob Express did not fall short from this. I ordered the chicken Tikka Masala and it was, by far, the tastiest chicken Tikka Masala I've ever had. The authenticity and tremendous flavor of the dish completely took me away. I recommend this dish to any visitor, regular or first time. I also ordered the chicken biryani and mango lassi -- these dishes together made for an amazing meal. Overall, Kabob Express is my go-to spot for authentic Indian, Pakistani food and I couldn't be happier with this restaurant! Beautiful food, generous staff
