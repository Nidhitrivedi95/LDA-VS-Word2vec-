FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg I'm here very frequently, and this is by far my favourite restaurant.

Today I stopped by for the lamb korma, and I am also having some okra.

Nobody makes a korma like Bombay Behl!  It's a nice thick sauce that has some very rich deep flavours.  

I stopped ordering Kormas years ago at Indian restaurants because most restaurants served pale meat in a lifeless sauce.  Not at Bombay Behl.  They have put a new twist on a dish and made it come alive!

I also often have the lamb chops which are both juicy and tender.  The lamb chops are cooked nicely in the tandoor and served with a little char.  I was not a big lamb fan, but this changed everything for me.

I eat the butter chicken here often which is a perfect complement of salty, sweetness, and creaminess.  All this and they do not use food colouring to get their red colouring.

This place has it all contemporary looks, good service, value for dollar, and friendly people and top notch food.

The music is pleasant in the background and not too loud , and the food is always good and hot.  The Spicing level is always good, because they ask.

There are a lot of seats, so this place is ideal for parties.  I also bring business associates here every week for meetings.

The staff know a lot about allergies.  I cannot eat several different things, and they have always found ways to make sure that I am well fed with many many options.  They are good for helping with nut allergies, dairy intolerances and understand how to prepare gluten free food well.

All this, and very clean bathrooms.

One of my favourite restaurants by far.  Five stars!
