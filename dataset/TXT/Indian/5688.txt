3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ This was our first visit for buffet lunch and we knew the moment we walked in the door that we must be in the right place because we were the only non-Indian guests. And the dining room was almost at full capacity at 1 pm on a Friday! Due to the rush, the service was a little slow and it took a bit to get naan - but I'm willing to let that slide. The steam table had so many selections that you can't try them all in a single visit and I'm already looking forward to next time! There was one curry that I wasn't a big fan of, it just wasn't my flavor, but everything else was delicious. My favorite was a curry with carrots, yams (I think), and peas that had a savory sweetness that made a good counter balance to the spicier dishes. There were also several offerings that I've never had before, so there were some new experiences, too.
If you're in North Phoenix you should check them out!
