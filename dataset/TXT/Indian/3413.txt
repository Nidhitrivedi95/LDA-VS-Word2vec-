0nJgoF9hAi6f2K7XInr1hQ The box meals consist of a few teaspoons of curry with a pound of rice.  The samosa's were not fresh and everything was slopped all over the container.  The salad was a thimble of vegetables that tasted like chemicals.  The order was of unacceptable quality therefore called the restaurant who refused to assist and couldn't care less about customer service or satisfaction.  Use to be my favourite restaurant but I won't have my family treated with such disrespect as I experienced on the phone and $70 worth of food that's a complete disaster.
