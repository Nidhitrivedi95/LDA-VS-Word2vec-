jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Worst Service 

The service was really horrible, they should just get some new staff. We went in for an evening snack and light dinner. The first person who came to take the order was staring at us as if "why are you guys even here". We were around six folks and since we just ordered snacks and light dinner I suppose the number of items were few and he was not pleased with it. The service just got worser from there, they never came near the table when we needed something and since it was evening the sun was shining right on our faces and the guys didn't care. They just stood far off near the kitchen and it was difficult to get some attention and close the window curtains. 

To top that when we ordered tea they brought cold tea whereas the item was supposed to be hot Indian tea. Again we had to get their attention and the get the tea re heated which took like 10 minutes, one of us just drank the cold tea not bearing to wait to get their attention ( we had order 2 tea and both were cold).

The rest of the food items were good for which I would have given a 4 star but the service was just horrible.

And the really worst part was they added an automatic gratuity of 18% when they deserved none.
