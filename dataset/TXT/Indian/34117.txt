m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw I know a lot of townies were really sad to see Escobar go, but I have to say I love this place! I'm so glad there's a spot downtown for Indian food, but it is honestly now my favorite place to get Indian food in the whole area. The thali lunch special is amazing and offers a lot of variety for the price. Everything I have had though has been amazing. Love it!
