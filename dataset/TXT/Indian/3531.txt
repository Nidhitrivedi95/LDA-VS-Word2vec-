0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I had my first Hakka cuisine experience at Chilli Chicken House when I was at Mississauga recently. I was really amazed by the food. It was a spicier version of chinese food and tasted a little like south asian cuisine. Loved their chicken pakora!  The shrimp pakora was wonderful too and the pakora had generous amount of shrimps! We ordered the Spicy Shrimp, Manchurian Chicken with the Thai fried rice. I love my food really spicy so I loved the Spicy Shrimp. 
To me the Manchurian Chicken sauce seemed the blander version of the Spicy Shrimp sauce so it was my least favorite of all the food ordered that day.
Kids seemed happy with their Pad Thai and Hakka Rice Noodles.

The owner and workers were very friendly, helpful and checked on our group frequently. Oh, it is a cash only service.
Decor was just ok but it was neat and clean and living in southern California i have seen worse.

Definitely 5 stars for the food and service.
