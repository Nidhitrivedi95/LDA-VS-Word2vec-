dBF_CJt0XDLbLVVr_oXkbw Wok With Yu is right off of Warden Avenue with windows looking out onto the street. Like a lot of the stores in the area it shares the building with a couple of other restaurants. Inside was a big square box with a selection of booths and tables and little bit of Asian-styled low key design. The menu featured a host of Chinese inspired items and a selection of Hakka styled dishes at reasonable prices. We ordered a selection of dishes including some hot & sour soup, some veggie and shrimp pakoras, the Manchurian tofu and the garlic shrimps. The food which is generous in portion size (larger than we expected for the price) arrived quickly and efficiently and although the food was heavy on the sugar and corn starch it was delicious. It was a pleasant new experience for us all.
