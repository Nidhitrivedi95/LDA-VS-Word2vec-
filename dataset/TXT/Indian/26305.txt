Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw I bought a voucher based on the review of about average of 4 stars.   I was disappointed.   I don't understand why other people give 4 stars average.

I thought this is a high class restaurant based on the voucher price but I was disappointed.   They claim the original price is $40 each person which I expect a good meal.   I found the renovation not good, need update.   The food is salty.   The entries are very small, smaller than the appetizer.   There are restaurants which give you small portion if you have a voucher.   I believe this restaurant is one of them.   They charge 4 small shrimp for $19 which they called jumbo pawn.   Just 4 small shrimps, nothing else.   The shrimp is not fresh, just salty.   I should have taken pictures to show how small it is.   If I order the entree alone I will stay hungry when I leave.
