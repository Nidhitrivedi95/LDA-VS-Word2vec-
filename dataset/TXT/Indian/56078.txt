xhc-bSw2Cz2Inskzjve3Rg I'm on an Indian food kick. Can't get enough! I feel like a broken record while reviewing the various Indian restaurants around Madison--but Kangchen has DELICIOUS food!! And they have a great selection. You'll probably have to visit multiple times in one week (cough*likeme*cough) to get your fill. 

If you like to try many dishes, I'd recommend the lunch buffet. Not sure yet if they rotate their selections daily, but today the highlights were:

- Chicken Cherrinad: Richly spiced, different in the best way. Beware of bones.
- Chicken Tikka Masala: A favorite. This version is extra creamy.
- Paneer Saag: Cheese and spinach never tasted so good!
- Tandoor Chicken: Great pepper flavor.
- Vegetables: I appreciate the fresh veggies! Nothing special, but they cut the richness if everything else and are great to have.
- Beet Root Halwa: Yep, beets for dessert! I was floored, and then went back for more. 

If you fancy a sit-down meal, here are some other highlights:

- Paneer 65: Spice and chile flavors meet. Bite into a crispy outer crust and experience the smooth, creamy paneer inside. I'm becoming that dramatic Yelper... and I don't care.
- Lamb Rogen Josh: It's just great when lamb, curry and creamy yogurt come together. 

The interior of Kangchen isn't super romantic or anything. You can tell it used to be a salon with its bare white walls, but that's not going to keep me away.
