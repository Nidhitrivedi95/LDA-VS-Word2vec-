pbnZqw5tHkZZBG5Ryys0yw I was lured into Delicacy by their incredibly cheap lunch offering of Butter Chicken for $4.99. I set my bar to a medium height, as I am a butter chicken fiend. I only order butter chicken when I'm on my own because, well, I want it all to myself. Greedy, yes, but at least I'm honest. Back to the meal. A reasonable portion was served, reflective of the price, served in a bed of rice with a garden salad on the side. My first note was that the chicken had very little spice to it and a stronger tomato flavor than I've experienced with the BC. That's a nice way of saying it needs a lot of work. 

I'm sure I'll be back here again, I'm hoping for some improvement to the dishes. The interior is clean but could use some more personal touches and the staff are friendly. If you're looking for some butter chicken to savour, try Mother India just down Queen St in the meantime.
