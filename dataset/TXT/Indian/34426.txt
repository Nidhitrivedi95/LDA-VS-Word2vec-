MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g Please DO NOT expect a good meal here.  All the appetizers are way too oily. If you want to come here for lunch, please expect to wait at least one hour for your food. The staff is extremely rude and unhelpful. We ordered to go and ended up waiting for an hour. When we went to ask what the delay was, we were told they forgot to write down the order. I ordered bisi bele bath to go and was given just half the quantity of what they usually serve. This is just a horrible place to eat in phoenix
