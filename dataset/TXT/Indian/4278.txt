1S6eB9Ag2VMx3Ab7LHORJw Thumbs up just for being a South Indian restaurant. I am South Indian so there is no way I am going to compare to home cooked food. We drive quite some way just to have a night of satisfied full tummies. We have at times driven quite out of the way just to get take out and stock up our fridges for a few days!

The dosa and uttappam could be made more fresh and crispy otherwise the food is crave-able. Prices are completely reasonable and even cheap by Indian food standards. Got the standards North Indian dishes for those who aren't as adventurous as well. As a recommendation to spice-a-phobes, be sure to ask, and a lil secret from me....drink some yogurt if it does get to you! :) 
Don't worry, it's all in good fun!

Champaign is lucky to have this place at it's disposal. 

I will speak for colleagues who said the service is poor. However, in my personal opinion I have never been treated with anything but good service even during busy hours and late nights. I also called ahead when I knew we would be late and almost at closing and was greeted with a very easy  "We are here for you". 
How could I not be pleased?

Docked one star because I feel like small changes in food quality could still be made and it would upgrade the place by a lot.
