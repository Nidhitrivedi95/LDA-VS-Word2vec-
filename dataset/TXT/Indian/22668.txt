GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw I'm sure this place has changed ownership. There used to be (years ago) 2 woman that seemed very invested in the restaurant. Was very cute and the Indian food was spectacular (very fine ingredients). My last visit was mediocre. It was a combination of Thai and Indian and not of the original quality. The new version may be a better option for the lunch crowd coming from Sick kids but not as much of a go-to destination for dinner.
