Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I discovered this place by total accident. After passing a few super expensive and other dirty shady restaurants, I found this!
Clean and friendly, price is "ok" considering their fancy atmosphere I think this type of price  ($13 and up) Is acceptable.
I'm taking one star off for selling rice as a separate item to curry. That's like charging for buns  separately when selling burger!
Their pani puri is the best I've ever had.
Tandoori chicken is also of good size and excellent taste. 
These folks know what they're doing.
