OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Ok restaurant with ok food. Not a very good spread for the money they charge. Not excellent in terms of service too. I helped one of their staff pick a plate from the table as it was on the far end, and he would comment that they are taking applications. Although the other girl helping us was very helping. Decor is good. Do you have to make it, No ! There are other Indian restaurants better than this in LV like Delhi Indian Cuisine or Mount Everest India's Cuisine. They are both excellent restaurant's with better service and spread.
