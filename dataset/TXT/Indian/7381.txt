5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q Visiting for a conference and was honestly waiting for another restaurant on mothers day with a ridiculous long wait so we decided to see what else was in the area so we decided to take a chance on this. Walking by we saw it was pretty dead but decided to give it a try. While the wait for food was a little bit we ordered the samosa chat, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka masala. Our meal was amazing! Everything had so much flavor that we ate our entire meal. If I lived in Vegas this would definitely be our go to spot. Hoping we can stop by again before we leave!! Thank you for being so nice to my husband, myself and our 9 month son!!  

UPDATE-we went again last night and my husband tried a different thing and everything was so good if not better than the other day. Wish I had a place like this in Dallas! It's so good!!
