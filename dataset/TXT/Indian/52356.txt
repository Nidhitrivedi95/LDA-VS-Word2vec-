uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA Great place!  We first went to the Sheppard location and then Babu opened up closer to us on McCowan.  The food is inexpensive and tasty.  We especially love the meat Lumpri - you get a choice of one meat and 6 curries on a bed of rice.  It's all wrapped up in a banana leaf and heated up.  Delicious and spicy and definitely enough for 2 people!
