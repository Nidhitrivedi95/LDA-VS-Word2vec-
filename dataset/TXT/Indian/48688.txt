The 3 stars are because the service was good. 
The food itself - decent. 

Gobi manchurian was a good appetizer. The butter dosa was good too. The sambhar not the best I've had, but not bad. I didn't like that they put the bowls of sambhar and chutney on the dosa itself, rather than bring it on the side. If you're particular about hygiene, let them know. 

The paneer tikka masala was RED. I think that's food color, but could be wrong. Was not bad but I wasn't impressed. The chettinad was also decent. Like I said, decent food. Nothing bad. Except made me feel a little sick. 

Nothing wrong with it. But nothing to make me return.
