gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A 1st time here today,because   of the stellar reviews sent me in mt everest direction. Mmm I wasn't very impressed,the food was fine,but nothing made me say outstanding. We were on the road and we were hungry.it definitely was not bad at all. I liked the salad bar and. The tamarind chutney. Just not spicey enough for me, alot of the vegetarian items on the buffet are made with cream, or butter. So i end up eating the few items that dont have dairy.even though it was not my favourite i would come back. What food they have was good, and the soup and salad are a welcome part of the buffet. Service was nice very attentive and friendly ++ on that
