Although, you can't really blame me considering the location of this place and it's unassuming appearance. 

The Saag Paneer here is so BOMB!!!! By that I mean it's awesome, but it also means that every bite is an explosion in the mouth, especially when you order it spicy. The spinachy, creamy, spicy goodness is out of this world. The size of the roti is pretty darn good too. It's big enough to last two meals. Eat one half for lunch and the other half later on. Just don't eat it as a late night snack unless you want the spicy burn to wake you up. 

An interesting personal note is the fact that this is probably the only restaurant I've visited multiple times that I never ordered a meat dish. That truly is something coming from a carnivore.
