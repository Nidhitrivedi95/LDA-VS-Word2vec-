JkIeLz9_hjUa0sFnyPzCSg The moment I entered Mayura, I was impressed. The ambience is very relaxing and welcoming. Note there's no buffet for lunch. I ordered Anders Aalo, Dal Tadka and Garlic Nan. They were all amazing. Very unique taste and not like other restaurants where they all taste the same.
