Ordered samosas (good), these fried dough doughnut shaped crispy things (delicious) and pakoras (delicious, but very crispy). Everything seemed to be veggie (GOOD FOR VEGETARIANS). The pink samosa sauce was delicious. 

They had entire cases of Indian desserts too. Everything comes in brown paper bags.
