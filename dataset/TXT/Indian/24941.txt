H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ We went here a lunch buffet and found the food awful. The food was stale, greasy and tasted bad. The food tasted old or spoiled. The yogurt rice dish they had was positively gone bad. The fruits were old , dry and smelled like onions possibly they were cut with knives which were used to cut onions and not cleaned. The Naan bread was hard and chewy . Food was running out and not being stocked. They also charged us an automatic 18% tip for party of 8 for a lunch Buffet!! There was absolutely no service except for the water jug they left on our table. No one bothered to ask if needed anything else to drink. We had to stop by their cash counter to let them know that they did not have enough glasses on the table. All this when the place did not even look busy.

The restroom was not clean , smelled bad , floor was wet and paper towels ran out and not stocked. You can tell the cleanliness and hygiene of a restaurant from the way they maintain their restrooms, i would stay away from this place. This place should be checked and cited by the state health inspector.
