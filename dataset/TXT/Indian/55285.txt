Wvst5nUM1Yd64cdjIPOD6w Totally worth the drive from Nebraska. Our family orders roti by the dozens. Whenever anyone visits GTA they pick up a few dozen for the people back home. Today we walked out with roti, pine tart and cheese roll. Yummy!  I am a little jealous of citizens from Brampton who can walk in and grab some pepper pot or curry from the freezer. Not to mention someone making your roti for you. Look forward to my next trip to the GTA so we can hit up Alima's.  The prices are pretty affordable too.
