rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Delicious food. Super tasty. Must try. I got chicken chettinad at the cashiers recommendation and it was sooooooo good. My girlfriend got chicken tikka masala and said it was the best she has ever had. My only complaint is that there is not a lot of meat compared to other Indian restaurants but with that said I was full at the end of my meal.
