Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Came here before a recent Monday night movie night down at the Capitol Theatre...the four of us shared a bunch of dishes.  We ordered samosas, chicken biryani, chicken madras and a meatball-style dish.

Everything was good, but nothing was great.  Naan was pretty standard and the dipping sauces for the samosas were also decent.  They are supposed to be known for their biryani dishes, but I found them to be uninspiring.  My favorite dish was one our dinner-mates ordered...it was a meatball style meat in a rich orange-yellow gravy (I cannot find the name of it on the menu) and it was really outstanding.  I could not get enough of the sauce!

Will probably come back here, since it is very convenient to our new house...but there are plenty of other Indian spots around town I'd choose to go to.
