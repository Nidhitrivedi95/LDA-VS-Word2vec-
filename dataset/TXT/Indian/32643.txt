LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Came here today on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with my family. We had a reservation and only had to wait a couple mins. We ordered a paper masala dosa, channa masala dosa, paneer dosa, and salty dahi vada to start among the 3 of us. 

The dahi vadas were delicious. I don't normally like them but these were so well done that I could have eaten a few orders for myself! We ate them so fast that we didn't even take a picture. 

The dosas here are perfect. The right consistency, texture, taste, and the perfect amount of crispiness.

 All of the chutneys were delicious. I found it was the right amount of chutney and we didn't need to order more. Just a side note that they make these fresh daily and charge $0.50 for each extra chutney. The white and green coconut ones were my favourite. 

Service was pretty good. Food also came out really quickly. They didn't take too long coming to the table and checked on us to see if we needed anything. 

We will definitely be back!
