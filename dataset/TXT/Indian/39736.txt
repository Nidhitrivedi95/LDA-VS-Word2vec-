P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg This place is ALWAYS busy - dining in and take out.  It's a hakka place where the portions are large and the food is great!

I love the hakka fish, shrimp fried rice, sweet/sour soup, beef with black bean sauce...and well a whole host of other dishes.  The menu is pretty extensive...it can be overwhelming and the dishes are definitely share platters.  You will have tons of food if you order 3-4 items for 4 people.  

Also, for most dishes they do party sizes ordering out (1/2 tray or full try) but I believe you might have to order a day ahead - not 100% sure - just call them and ask.  The service is great - everyone has always been friendly and efficient.  The food comes out pretty fast and always tastes hot and fresh

A great place to get a meal for under $20
