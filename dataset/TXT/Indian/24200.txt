gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg A co-worker and I had the lunch buffet at Charkha.  It was a bit unimpressive.  The selections are displayed in chafing pans(no lids) instead of a steam table, so the food was just lukewarm.   The basmati rice was pretty good, as was the chicken curry.  The tandoori chicken was nicely seasoned, but cold & dry.   The zucchini pakora was cold and greasy.  There was also a potato dish and a few other non-descript dishes, along with raita (very good) and 1 chutney and an iceberg salad.  There was only 1 dessert option, which was rice pudding.  Fresh warm naan bread was delivered to the table.  I probably would not return for the buffet, but would definitely consider returning for dinner based on the Yelp reviews.
