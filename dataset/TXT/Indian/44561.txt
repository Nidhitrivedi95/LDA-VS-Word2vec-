ry_c9N_E4zmB3VlyLDE26Q I didn't eat in the restaurant, but got the curry in a hurry take away deal. When I called in the order, I was told it would be 45 minutes, but when I offered to pick up the order myself, the time was cut down to 20 minutes. Does it really take 25 minutes to deliver?


 After all the rave reviews I have heard about this restaurant from friends and coworkers, I was expecting something great. Honestly, it was really just average. Nothing too great about the food and no large quantities or cheap prices that would inspire me to go back. Because of this, I give it three stars.
