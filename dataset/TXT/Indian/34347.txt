MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ Had a restaurant.com coupon and decided to try it for New Years Eve.  Food was good but at the end of the meal the server indicated that the owner would not honor the coupon.  Ironically only 3 tables were occupied but we were told it was a "special day" even though there was no exclusion on the coupon for certain dates.  Two of three dishes were good but pricing seems high.  Due to not honoring the coupon we will never be back.  Restaurant.com asked us to review the restaurant.  Our review is send me a coupon for somewhere else!
