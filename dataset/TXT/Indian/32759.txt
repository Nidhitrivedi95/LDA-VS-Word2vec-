LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I've been to about 10 dosa places in GTA and this is definitely the best that I've been to in Toronto.  The variety of dosa and other options are endless which is also one of the big appeals of this place.  One of the best vegetarian and southing Indian options in the GTA probably.
