pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Some may say that I travel around the world to find the best paneer. Found some! Let's just say the paneer tikka appetizer was amazing!! This is not your traditional Indian Restaurant it's fusion. For someone that loves a good traditional Indian meal this place still hit the spot. I would recommend the paneer tikka (dry) and chipotle chicken tikka masala (with gravy). The cocktails were also good and the service was exceptional! Thanks Rex and team for making our dining experience awesome!
