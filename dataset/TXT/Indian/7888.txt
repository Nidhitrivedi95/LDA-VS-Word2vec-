We ordered the coconut prawn curry and lamb vindaloo with sides of garlic naan and rice. The prawns were just as prawns should be... a decent mouthful. And the curry... smooth and coconutty. Go figure! The lamb vindaloo, now that was my favourite - mostly because lamb anything is my favourite. It was a bit spicy, but my spice tolerance is incredibly low. Mix that up with a bit of rice, scoop it all with a piece of that naan bread... mmmm, I'm drooling at the memory!

Expect to spend a wee bit more, this ain't no cheap Indian buffet. But the "ambiyan-ce" coupled well well cooked food and service to match the higher-endishness of this resto make this a solid 4 stars in my books.
