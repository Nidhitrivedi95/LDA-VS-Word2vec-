llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg I had an intense craving for Indian food, so my husband and I went to Swad for dinner. He's a vegetarian and ordered the Egg Masala Dosa--it was huge, and came with two dipping sauces and a small bowl of soup! It was very good, kind of like Indian comfort food (potatoes, egg, crepe). I ordered the Chicken Mughlai--the medium spice was perfect for me. There were several chunks of chicken breasts, and the sauce itself was perfectly spiced. We also ordered the garlic naan because you can't go wrong with that, can you? The service was good, and the restaurant itself is nicely decorated even though it's in a Monona strip mall. Most dinner entrees are $12-16, which seems pretty on par with other Indian restaurants in the area. On previous occasions we've had the buffet, and I thought that it was excellent.
