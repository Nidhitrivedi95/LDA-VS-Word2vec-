wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw Today was the second time we attempted to try out this new restaurant. The menu looks great, decor is also really nice. Service was probably the worst I've ever experienced. The servers were very polite, but after waiting over 40 mins for nimbu pani and then plainly saying "we misplaced your order", polite is just not enough. Almost all the guests at the restaurant were staring anxiously at the food station hoping for their meal. A few started to get really upset with the staff as they were frantically trying to fix misplaced orders, etc.
Being as hungry as we were, we just left without getting to try the food at all. 
The nimbu pani was pretty decent though. But I don't think waiting over an hour is reasonable for any type of food.
