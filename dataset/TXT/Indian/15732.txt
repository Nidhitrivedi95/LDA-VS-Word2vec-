CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ What a great experience. We ordered the tandoori platter, gol gappe, different kind of naans, chicken lababdar, chicken and paneer pakore. The food was tasty and we kept on ordering more and more haha. Above all the owner/host was great and friendly and inviting even though they were closing soon. Had a great time.
