ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Ok guys, I am an Indian and consider myself a connoissuer. My wife and kid keep complaining I am never happy until I find some decent Indian food. I can tell you this place sucks, the quality and taste of food, that is. The place is clean, good decor and all but the choice of food and the taste is terrible. You maybe impressed if you are a non indian but I wanted people to have an idea what another Indian thinks of it. I usually do not write negative comments but I feel this place should work harder at dishing out some decent Indian food and not rip people off. Almost everything tastewise was awful, I am sorry to say.
