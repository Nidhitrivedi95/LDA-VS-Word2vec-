hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q We went there on a Saturday at 1 pm. There were very items and the quantity was even lesser. I don't understand why they had some chaat, it was horrible and the presentation was bad. I usually start with chaat, so I was disappointed already. The main course lacked flavor and the butter masala was too sweet. Biryani was not the aortic authentic indian biryani. So main course, sucked. Then the desert, it was basically flavored ice. Nothing was indian except the cinnamon in it.
Very bad.
