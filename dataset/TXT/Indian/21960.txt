GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Ordered delivery from here today, as their webpage advertises that they now deliver. We recently had a baby, so this seems like a good excuse to try it. Sweet!

First, the good news: the food was (as always) very tasty. I'm very happy to have such a good Indian restaurant so close to home.

The bad: they charge a delivery fee of $10, plus a fuel fee of an additional $5. This turned a $35 lunch for two into $50. This seems pretty extreme, and given that the place is only 2 miles from home, a pretty bad value proposition.

Get the takeout, skip the delivery and save yourself $15.
