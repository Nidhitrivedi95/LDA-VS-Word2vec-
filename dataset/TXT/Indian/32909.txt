llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg We had been for dinner before but not for their lunch buffet. The buffet is excellent and extensive. They had 2 soups, fresh salad, at least 12 different hot entrees including many chicken and vegetarian choices ,1 beef dish and grilled catfish. They had 6 dessert choices as well. All the food was delicious . The buffet is continually refreshed, no shortage of any dish. You also get warm nan with your meal.
The restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated, staff are very attentive and friendly.
This is by far the very best Indian lunch buffet I have ever had. Give it a try!
 Cost is $10:95 a person with a huge selection of food choices.
