_Q0JeKDrzldpBUgswhlLyA The place to go for foods that are typically from the state of Gujarat and some of the foods that are more main stream popular are also available. 

The most common Gujarati snacks available are Kachori - dried green peas, cooked and spiced with hints of coconut deep fried with batter (5/5), Pattice - stuffed with coconut and variety of different ingredients in a potatoes outer which is deep fried as well (5/5). Then there is Khandvi - a mixture of chickpea flour and yogurt which is cooked, and rolled. The rolls are then tempered with mustard seeds, curry leaves and chillies. (4/5). The Khandvi is too greasy for our taste. And also unlike Kachoris and Pattice are sold by weight. 

Then there are typical samosas, with spicy and non spicy ones. They are also available in two distinct shapes, the typical that the main stream folks see, which we call them Punjabi Samosas and then there are the flatter ones which sometimes are called Patti samosas, named after the wrap. The spicy ones are spicy, so if you can handle the extra spiciness go for it- they are delicious. 

There are other items such as bhajias, fafda and patterwale also available but that is for some other day. There are also a variety of sweets - burfis and laddoos available. 

Do ask for sweet and spicy chutney. Especially the sweet one is the best anywhere west of India 

The biggest beef I have with them is they charge 0.20 cents per debit card transaction which is not posted and they have a sneaky way of not showing how much they are charging on on debit machines. Also do ask for a receipt as they do charge HST but sometimes not show on receipts
