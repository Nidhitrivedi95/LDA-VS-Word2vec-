4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.

Myself and two others went to this restaurant with a coupon from restaurant.com (which advertises on this very page) and after we had finished our rather lackluster meal, they refused to honor the coupon. The coupon was completely valid, they just refused to honor it and stated that there was a $50 minimum on all coupons (despite the fact that our coupon said $35 w/ 18% gratuity added... we had a ~$43 meal). The waiter first claimed that we had to show the coupon at the start of the meal and that it stated this on the coupon. After we showed him that it didn't state anywhere on the coupon that we had to show it before the meal he became very rude and still refused to honor it. He also refused to allow us to speak to a manager and kept saying over and over again that "it is just the owners policy".

After arguing with him for an extended period of time and getting nowhere we finally just told him to tack on the ~$7 to make our meal come to $50 so we could use the coupon. As a further insult, the bill comes back and the waiter applied the 18% gratuity to the entire $50 instead of the ~$43 we actually paid on the meal. He then continued to be rude and refused to reduce the gratuity to apply only to the $43 we actually spent.

We then proceeded to write a letter to the restaurant explaining our position and how the whole point of restaurant.com coupons was to get people into your restaurant to try it out and how screwing over customers was a bad policy. We ended up talking to the owner on the phone and he basically told us to fuck off.

So in short, the owner and staff of Tandoor Indian Grill refuses to honor valid coupons, screws over customers and are extremely rude. Also, the food is really terrible and the portion sizes are a joke.
