DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA The Samosa Factory is my favorite Indian place in Las Vegas. They have a large vegetarian and vegan menu as well as some great lamb and chicken dishes. I recommend the masala fries and tandoori chicken. And the owner is just the nicest guy. I have been eating there for a couple of years and have never been disappointed.
