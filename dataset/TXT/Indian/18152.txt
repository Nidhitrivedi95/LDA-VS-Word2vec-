EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg The owner of this restaurant is an angry, rude lunatic.  I went there with my mom and two other people.  He ordered us to sit at a smaller booth in the back.  My mom, who was tired and has trouble walking asked if we could sit at the table closer to the door and she sat down.  He said yes we can sit there but that table is for 6 and we were only 5.  He kept repeating something about respect and getting more and more angry as the minutes passed.  To be respectful I told him if a party of 6 showed up we would move.  He then started arguing and getting upset and then started screaming uncontrollably saying we have no respect and this is his restaurant.  I told him to stop screaming and he just got more angry and demanded we leave.  The entire thing was rude and beyond disrespectful.  He followed us out of the restaurant and cursed at us (see beginning of attached video).   I'm 39 years old and very respectful of servers and people in the service industry.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me.  DONT EAT HERE.
