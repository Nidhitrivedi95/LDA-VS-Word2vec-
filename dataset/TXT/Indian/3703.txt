0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Husband and I came here and ordered hot and sour soup, chili calamari (chef recommended) and crispy eggplant. The soup is average nothing special. Calamari was way too salty and overdosed with msg. The eggplant was oily and had too much batter on it. I only had a few bite and couldn't continue anymore. Me and my husband left there feeling sick...that's when the msg overdose kicked in. The service was friendly and they give you a huge bowl of rice for $1.50. Overall, see are disappointed and not planning on returning.
