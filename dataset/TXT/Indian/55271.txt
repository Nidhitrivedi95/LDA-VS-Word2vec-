wtODHqs34RYh1Q3bEI4OUg The place is, indeed, dingy. The owner is somewhat kind but for a $9 lunch special, all I get is 80% rice with 2 piece of tiny chicken curry and a bit of lentils. The food is pre-cooked and left without any heat to keep it warm. He offered to heat it up but he was going to put the styrofoam container into the microwave! That releases toxic chemicals!! I immediately said 'no thank you' and left.

The food tastes like re-heated frozen food. Bland, not much flavour. Will not be returning.
