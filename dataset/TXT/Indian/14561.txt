C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw I'm not even sure what I was eating but it was delicious. Ordered the tandoori chicken kothu roti. Amazing value, friendly service and tasty food. I got two full meals out of it! Only downside was I asked for really spicy, and I was given an extra spicy sauce and I didn't even detect a hint of spice. But I will be back for more.
