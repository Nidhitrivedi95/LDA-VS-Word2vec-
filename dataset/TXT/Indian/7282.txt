5KsvP10z9InBcI6hhqjjKg I always come to Buffet Maharaja when I visit Montreal. Maybe not the best Indian food, but much more than passable. Good buffet selection, w/many vegetarian options. Excellent naan; sadly, I'm now tied to a gluten-free diet. And incidentally, Maharaja is not dirty, the waiters don't smell bad, but going to the restroom *is* an opportunity to walk off some calories. Worth trying in a city that has so many fine restaurants.
