Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw if you're planning a nice evening Indian meal I'd suggest you go to their other location on Bloor near Christie but if you're looking for the best Indian buffet around I'd come to this location during their lunch hours. First off you really can't go wrong for $9.99 and it really is the best indian buffet in the city, always fresh and a great selection of both meat and vegetarian dishes.
