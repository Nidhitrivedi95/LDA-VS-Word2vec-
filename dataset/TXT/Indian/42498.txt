r4RCtOZxp0nXpuoN_Usd1w I love, love, love India Darbar.  Chicken Tikka Masala addict that I am, I've found theirs to be the best I've ever had.  The one other dish I've had - Chicken Mughlai - was superb as well.   To me, no Indian meal is complete without a mango lassi and lots of warm, pillowy naan, both of which are excellent.  The service is great as well.  The only negative thing I can say is that the one time I wrote a check (having lost my debit card), it took them almost 3 weeks to cash it - but I can't find it within me to take away a star for it, since having checks "hanging  out there" is just my own neurosis.
