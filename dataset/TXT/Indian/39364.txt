oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q This place is great! I love Hakka food and this place exceeded my expectations.

Came in here and was seated righted away. Food was amazing and service was great.  I did enjoy the Mango Lassi ugh it was to die for!  I'm stuck between Hakka Ren and this place.  Although Hakka Ren also has amazing Hakka food, the service here is a lot faster than it is at the other place.  You do get your food much quicker here than at Hakka Ren.
