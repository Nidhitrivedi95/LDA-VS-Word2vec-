GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Curry Corner is absolutely great! As a college student, I love how cheap it is, but the quality is not at all sacrificed. I love their hummus, and I honestly probably get it at least two times a week.  I've been starting to take my friends here, and they love it as well.  The service is usually fast, though I've had to wait a few times, but that's not a big deal at all. Five stars for sure!
