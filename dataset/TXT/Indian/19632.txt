fHqJZK0D9E91ltD62SwzSw Gandhi's is a great little Indian restaurant just off Lothian Road. I was reluctant to try it at first because I always associated Gandhi as a figure of fasting. I felt it was a bit of an oxymoron to chomp away at an elaborate feast in this place. However, one day I was drawn in by the crowds inside and I haven't looked back. 

Curries in Gandhi's are fresh and delicious. I particularly enjoyed the Bhuna and Biryani. On my last visit ten of us shared a long table and decided to choose almost one of everything. We were very impressed at the high standard throughout and found ourselves ordering more and more okra even though we were stuffed full. 

The staff here are lovely. One trip with a few friends ended up very drunken and we accidently over paid. The waiter was so honest and kind that he ran up to us as we left telling us that he couldn't accept such a huge tip and to take our money back. Service like that makes a restaurant well worth a return visit!
