YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA I work around this area and go to this place occasionally with an Indian coworker.  The decor leaves something to be desired but most of their lunch specials are decent and good value.  For 10 dollars including tax, they have a lunch special which includes soup, rice, naan, lentil, one pakora, side veggies and the main entrees (I usually get butter chicken).

It's cheap food, large portion and a good lunch spot, but not really a date spot
