t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Saffron Flavors of India gets 5 stars for customer service and amazing food.  On a whim, I stopped in to see about take out, they didn't have any menus but offered to email one to me!  The restaurant is on the way home, so I can call in the order and it is ready by the time I get there.

The food is always delicious and I have a weekly craving for the naan!  I really need to try out the lunch buffet sometime....
