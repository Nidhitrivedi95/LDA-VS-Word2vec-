I can't remember the price but I think around $13 you can get a 3 course lunch. I got the spinach saag vegetarian lunch. There was an assortment of things to eat in my tray. Everything was TASTY. The pakora was actually my least favourite thing which is usually my favourite of things...! 
The Naan was massive and there was rice too to get you full for the afternoon. We didn't finish the Naan because there was such a generous serving. The Gulab jamun dessert was pretty good too.

I would 100% go back for lunch again. The service was friendly and attentive, nothing more to say.
