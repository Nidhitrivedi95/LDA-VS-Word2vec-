F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w I went for the lunch buffet during the week and went a bit early (around 11:30) to find the buffet freshly stocked.  I'm not a huge fan of buffets since they can get kinda gross after people have ransacked it a few times so if I can get to a buffet before the crowd, I prefer to do so.  

The buffet and food was on par with the other India restaurant buffets I've tried. I wasn't overly impressed or overly disappointed.  The chicken tikka was very creamy as per the standard at these places.  A little goes a long way.  They had a vegetable korma dish wish I really enjoyed.  The rice was a bit burned and I wish they had more vegetable dishes but it was either that vegetable korma, spinach/lentils (which were bland) or potatoes - which I didn't feel like loading up on.  

I was somewhat disappointed that they didn't offer pakoras or samosas since they had all the fixins for them (brown/green chutneys).  They did offer sweet rice pudding and carrot type hulva (sweet).  

Price was $9 inclusive of tax which I found reasonable.  The place started to get crowded around noon so I would recommend coming earlier if you can.
