4jMMO9J9SEtfL_yZPqxojw I wouldn't recommend this place for a sit down even though I have seen people do that (all you can eat for $7 why not)  but the takeout is excellent. For $5.50 you can get yourself a veggie thali to die for, and if you have random guests coming over, just get any of their entrees to go with naan/roti and your guests will thank you forever.

Cheap- yes! Good - Yes! did I mention the 3 samosas for $1? :D
