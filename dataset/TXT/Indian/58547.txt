YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q I have had mixed experiences with this restaurant. The lunch buffet has been very good at times but whenever I have ordered something it has been a disappointment and expensive. Unfortunately, I ended up here on a date in the winter months and the place was almost as cold as it was outside. We literally could see our breath as we were sitting right next to a gigantic space heater. The staff has always seemed somewhat aloof and it almost seems they forget that they are actually running a restaurant instead of a lounge to watch the BBC. With that said I have had some satisfying lunch buffet encounters so it hasn't been all bad. My short advice: summertime lunch buffet.
