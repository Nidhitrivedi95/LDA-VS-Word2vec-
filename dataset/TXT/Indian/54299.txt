I've been going to Jaipur Junction for years and I have never had a bad experience. 

I mostly order take out but occasionally I'll eat in. Almost every time I've taken out, no matter how long your order, it's taken 20 minutes. Which is really fast! The order is always correct and comes with more than ample amounts of extra rice and naan. Which is awesome because if you're like me and like to wipe up all the extra sauce with your naan, you'll be good to go!

This past time I came in to have dinner with a group of friends. It was empty when we came at 6pm but quickly filled up by the time we left at 8pm. 

We tend to order family style when we come here since it's easiest to try and have a bit of everything. This past visit we ordered alu cheese paratha, alu gobi (amazing veggie dish! You must try it) lamb saag (the lamb just melts in your mouth), chicken tandoori and chicken tikka masala (staple dish!). The meat dishes always come with huge chunks of meat so you can tell that it's real meat and quality.  We always finish off our meals with a Mango lassi to help cool out mouths off since we tend to order "American spicy".  Service can sometime be a little slow but this is a 2 or sometimes 1 man operation and when it gets busy they are hustling to make sure your dishes come out hot!

FYI - they have different levels of spicy so don't be afraid to tailor the dishes to your tastes. They go mild, medium, American spicy, Indian spicy. 

Also note they have now opened the large side room for private parties.
