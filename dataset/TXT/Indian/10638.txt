A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA If you have kids, what a treat! There is a play area near the front of the restaurant, so when the kids have had enough, they disappear to play while the adults can eat in peace! We live in the neighborhood of the India Bazaar, and Udupi Palace is our favorite restaurant. My kids love the gigantic, crispy paper dosas as well as the assortment of lassis and smoothies. I rarely get past the Thali--always different combinations, always delicious--but can vouch for the other dosas and uthapham on the menu as being very tasty. Be forewarned that this restaurant serves no meat or alcohol.
