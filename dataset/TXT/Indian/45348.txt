I came in for lunch today to see at not-so-busy restaurant with beautiful decor.  I was quickly seated and handed lunch and dinner menu's.  I think my waiter was new as he was a little nervous but highly attentive.  I asked him if he was new and he said he was normally bus boy but they had him giving this a shot(nice guy).  As far as the lunch menu goes, there were many choices, but what looked like the best deal was the 3 course special.  $9 for vegetarian, $10 for chicken, and $15 for seafood.  Came with a soup or salad, entree with dal, and a desert.  I was told that tikka masala would be the sauce/style for the day.

I should have gone chicken(tikka), because their vegetarian should just say tofu, not vegetarian.  I hoped for mixed veggies or at least some chick peas, but it was basically sauce with 4 or 5 chunks of tofu in it.  I'm not a hate'r of tofu, i just didn't know it was that common in Indian food that it would be considered a main course without mention.  Ironically, this "vegetarian" meal was served with a chicken soup.  A little grainy but flavor was good overall.  My waiter was spot on, I'd say almost overly attentive if I wasn't always in need of something.

I took a brief look at entrees and they sounded great.  $12-18ish range.  Not too bad for being that close to the peninsula and Lake Norman.

When I walked in the door, I was hoping for 5 stars, beautiful layout, great smell, nice people.  But the food is 3-4 stars with promise.  I hope they advertise well or do something for attention because this isn't the best location for walk-ins.  I'll be back when in the area at lunch, nice diversion from my local go to's for lunch specials(Sushi at the Lake or China Bistro.)
