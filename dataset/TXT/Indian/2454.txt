02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I went to this place on my trip to Arizona and Phoenix. Ambience, location and staff is pretty nice. The food was average. Me being from bay area may be a little rude but the food just had the taste of cream. Ordered for the following dishes:
Malai kofta: koftas tasted frozen
Paneer: panner was good but gravy was all cream
Onion pakoras were awesome
I would may be go there if no other option is available, but then it could be just my taste buds.
