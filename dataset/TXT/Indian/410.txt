-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g My husband and I haven't had Indian food since moving out of NYC over a year ago. I was nervous I wouldn't find a place with food that matched our favorite place in New York. I'm so glad we came here! The food was DELICIOUS and they keep your water glass full, which I find important. We both have leftovers for tomorrow, which I already can't wait to eat. Looking forward to our next visit!
