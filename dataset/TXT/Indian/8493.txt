I felt like the staff would say anything to get me in the door only to badger me later. For instance, I didn't have any cash on me and asked if they take debit or credit. They quickly nodded and seated me without hesitation. When my meal was finished they failed to inform me that not only did they not take debit but there was a minimum for their credit card purchases, awkward. 
I had the vegetable korma the first time which was actually quite tasty but when I came back for lunch their vegetable curry wasn't anything special. It seemed like more an afterthought then a dish that could stand alone.
