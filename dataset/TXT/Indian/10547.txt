9y2MS2VyXZzFRi2zGV0AFg This is an excellent Indian restaurant. I was very impressed by the range and quality of food. The service was fast and reliable with the waiters being friendly and helping me pick out something I would like. The atmosphere was warm and friendly with several other diners.
The value for money is good throughout the day but there are great deals on business lunches. This really is a good place to go for a meal as an individual, a couple or as a family.
