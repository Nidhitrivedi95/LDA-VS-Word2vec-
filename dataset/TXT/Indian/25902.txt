You choose the ice cream flavor for the roll, the stuff you want mixed in before they roll it, and the toppings and syrup you want after. You can go with you gut and choose your own assortment, or go with some menu suggestions that are excellent flavor combos. I had a vanilla roll with snickers, crackers, and Lindt truffle mixed in, topped with raspberries, chocolate chips, and chocolate syrup. It was REALLY good! They also serve really good Indian food if you're looking for a meal with your dessert.
