TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Had an amazing time tonight. Food was amazing as usual. Service was amazing as well by the great Gary. He's our usual server and he always has a smile on his face and is very kind. Always checking to see how our food was going. We are very loyal to this Indian restaurant do to the amazing food and because of Gary. We have become regulars here and it is well worth the drive.
