IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Everything about this place is just wonderful! The owner approached me and had a little chat when I told him how great his kabobs were. I am so picky with kabob places and this is definitely one of the better ones I've ate at! You can just taste the quality of their spices. The meat was tender and juicy and the veggies not too burnt or undercooked. The only other server there besides the owner was so attentive that the minute I finished eating he bussed my table. I just had the most perfect experience here and will be returning often to give them business! The owner is a great guy too and very hospitable!
