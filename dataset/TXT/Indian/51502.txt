UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I went into this place mainly because it was not too far away from my hotel and a quick glance of reviews that told me that this place was going to be ok,   This place serves a combination of Indian and Nepali food (Nepali food gets branded as indian food -even though I feel that Nepali food is more lamb and lentil(pulse) based). 
I loved their unique drink menu. I don't think I have seen spiked Lassis before and that definitely was the highlight of my eating activity there.  We ordered Sambosas for appetizer followed by a few vegetarian entries. Food overall tasted real good and the spice level was almost to the level we ordered  (one was ordered spicy and was mostly spicy and the other was mild). I will definitely stop here on my next trip to vegas.
