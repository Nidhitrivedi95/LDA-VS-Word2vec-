yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Food is excellent, but I would strongly suggest you make a reservation. On our first attempt we were turned away at 830pm without a reservation.  We were in the area and it was early so we stopped in on Sat. evening as we passed by at ~630pm. Several open tables but all were marked reserved. They reluctantly took us and 2 other tables that arrived shortly after us. We waited about 10-15min.  to be served. It was only annoying because those other 2 tables had their orders taken before we had drink order taken. Once we ordered food was out promptly, under 15 min.

We loved the complimentary cracker/bread with sauces to start. Dhaba Chicken Korma & Tandori Tikke chicken were fantastic and worth the wait. Portions aren't huge but we still had leftovers. 

We'll be making a reservation and returning soon!
