_qQYIW24-8nWwjg9-uL0LQ Place is bit small but ambience is pretty good for the new restaurant.  As soon as we took the seat, we been told that main course will take around 20-30 min to prepare since they prepare for specific orders only as per customer taste, and we are okay with it since we were 6 of us and most of us are bit choosy!  This place offers veg/non-veg and alcoholic drinks which have many different varieties for veg and non-veg lovers.  They also have buffet till 3PM. 
Starters/Appetizers came in quick and by the time we are done main course arrived!
