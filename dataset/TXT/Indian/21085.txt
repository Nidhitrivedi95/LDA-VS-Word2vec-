GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I had high expectations for this restaurant after reading all the great reviews on Yelp and it did not disappoint. My friends and I were a bit apprehensive because we are not exactly Indian food connoisseurs but the server helped us order our dishes and we were very pleased with what we got. All the curry was delicious and it had the perfect amount of spice to it, just enough to make you reach for the water but not too much that you lose the taste of the food. The naan was delicious and the portions were perfect for sharing with the whole party. I think we had the chicken makhani, chicken tikka masala, one of their goat specials, and the vegetarian thali plate which was a big sample plate of a bunch of different foods. Oh and it doesn't get better than only paying around $8 per person and being so full you can barely move. Let's just say I am jealous of everyone at ASU who can frequent this restaurant on a regular basis.
