De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA Ordered from here today, because I heard some good reviews - I experienced differently, however. 

-I ordered the cauliflower (which was good, no complaints there... but not 'fantastic')
-The veg biryani they were out of, so I opted for egg... which was overcooked and had a gross green ring on the inside of the egg.
-The onion dosa was soggy and boring... no real flavour to it. I took two bites of the pastry and threw it out.
-Butter naan was burnt
-Gulab Jamun w. ice cream was the only thing I enjoyed... 

Would not suggest this to anyone. Been to Vindaloo on Kingston Rd. WAYYY BETTER!!

Also, this place had horrible/rude service and was out of two of the things I originally ordered.
