u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw Amazing food. Great value. There chicken kabobs and cassava was so delicious. Definitely recommend. Place doesn't have much of a sitting area to dine in, but great place for take out and catering parties. I spoke to the owner and he was very kind and generous. Great staff amazing food no complaints.
