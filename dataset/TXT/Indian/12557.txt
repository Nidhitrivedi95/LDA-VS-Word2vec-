AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw Picked up 10pcs mixed samosas earlier today for just over $10.  I do not get the raving reviews these samosas get on yelp.  I've had many, many samosas and can't say I enjoyed these at all.  There is too much crust vs filling, and they are very oily.  I peeled a layer off the phyllo-like crust, it was drenched with oil in between. The fillings were on the dry side, and I found there was little distinctiveness between the different flavours, perhaps due to the overwhelmingly greasy aftertaste.  I will not be returning - high price, low quality.  Edit - adjusted to 1 star, it was just awful.
