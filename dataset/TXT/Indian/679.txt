-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ Behari kebabs and Karachi style Puri parathas..  The only two items I will spend on, as they bring the original taste all the way from back home. Asked for the owner one day to complement, but never showed up. It was a week day, and not very busy either..  This was a put off, otherwise the best of the best bihari kebabs in Canada.
