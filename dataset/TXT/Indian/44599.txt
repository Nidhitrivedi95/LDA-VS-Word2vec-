S-lTS8UX34-Z7G1uYjVzvw High street, Old Town is one of those touristy places you sort of expect it will be difficult to find decently priced and good food. It is usually one of the two you get.
So, Real Rajput was a very good find. You don't see much from the outside, but it is a large room downstairs. The eggplant dish I tried was very good, but the Lamb Karahi was one of the best dishes I have tried while in the UK. The service was also good and fast.
And did I say it was not expensive given its location?
