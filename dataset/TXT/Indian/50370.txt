UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w Awful service. 

The man at the counter was very rude. And was preaching to me about how I should live my life. I did not ask for it. 

Lots of expired products. Incorrect labelings (weight of dal ). And dals are of very low quality. 

I guess cheap food isnt everything. It comes at a cost. 

Please spend a few more dollars and go elsewhere for your produce if you can afford it.
