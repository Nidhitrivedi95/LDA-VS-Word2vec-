service

I was really disappointed with the service. The staff was unresponsive and super slow. Our table wasn't clean and we wanted to move to a booth, but they didn't let us. We had to wait endlessly to place our order, for the food to arrive and for the staff to get our check.  And yes, the curries are served with a side of rice, they forgot the rice part too. I would be okay with all this if the place was overcrowded and there were too many orders, but in our case, the place was almost empty, there were 3 to 4 other groups but they were done eating and ready to leave. 

The food was good. I specially liked the chicken tikka masala.  Malai kofta was good too. Their spice levels are from 1 - 10. Anything beyond 5 would be really spicy ( I can handle medium to spicy food, but not super spicy)
