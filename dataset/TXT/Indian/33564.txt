LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg I tagged along on one of my husband's work events, as this is a favorite for team dinners. Food is served family style, it's BYOB, and it's got a fun, relaxed atmosphere. The group was seated in a back room, up a small flight of stairs which gave them an area to socialize before and after food was served. The plates are small, but great for sharing, so everyone orders a few dishes and they get passed around. I ordered the samosas, butter chicken and aloo gobi and all three were tasty. I also tasted a bunch of items that others had ordered, but don't know the exact names, but there was a daal and a few other curries, and all were good. This is one of my husband's happy places, so I'm sure I'll be back the next time I'm in Edinburgh. Also, apologies that I have no pictures, as it was way too chaotic to try and capture food pictures.
