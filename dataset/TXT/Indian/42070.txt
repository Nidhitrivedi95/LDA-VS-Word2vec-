QEqMHowTTj5GKvpiKheGlQ and thats how Shahi Paneer is made...they call it Paneer Makhni,though.Perfect gravy,correctly sweetened,soft cheese.And their 'Baingan Bharta' is actually 'Bharta' you can taste and tell.Unlike other dumps of poorly mixed vegetables that are not true to their name.Very well cooked dishes and good quantity too so you are not under served.Someone rightly said in the comments here,it IS  a hidden gem.Hands down,this is the best Indian food joint...why 4 stars not 5? No salad or onions and green chillies that go with Indian food in a dhaba.Plus I didnt get cutlery and tissues.It was a take out...sadly no Indian restaurant gives you spoon or tissues.They cheap out on that.You always have to ask and it should not be so!! These are basic dining etiquette.Please dont forget.
