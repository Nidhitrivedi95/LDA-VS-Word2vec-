zvtkeghW0Px5HY9QkJ4INw Came here for dinner tonight. Got the curry beef special. It was $7.00 for an order of beef, rice and and some salad. Very Very inexpensive and not bad... Decore is pretty minimal and the owners seemed happy to see me. He asked if I was a student, told him "I just looked young", very flattering
