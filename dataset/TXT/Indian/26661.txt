idrN6XWKErG6nKDsEMNbOQ Went there. Food is okay. Waaayyyy too creamy and the only good things are naans. The fried fish was very greasy, the tandoori chicken was cold and rubber like. On top of that they added some 4.50 convince free or something and automatic tip of 15 % for crappy service and food. Wouldn't go there again. 1 star is only for the naans that's it.
