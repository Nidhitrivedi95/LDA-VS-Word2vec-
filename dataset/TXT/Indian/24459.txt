h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ The food is good. But like a lot of Indian restaurants, this place suffers massively from a lack of good service. They used to have a 'Thali' that often came with a couple of dishes missing. Buffets start 30 minutes later than the advertised time. 
One evening, we were seated immediately. The restaurant was a little more than half-full. But no one came our way for at least 20 minutes. Then, someone brought us some water and disappeared. Then, another person brought us the menu and disappeared. After waiting for an hour, they came to us and said, "You can order now, but the food will take another hour or hour and a half to get ready. We are very busy" . Really??
