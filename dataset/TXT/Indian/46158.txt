Heaven in your mouth?
Yes ... yes it is ....

I've watched it grow in popularity over the past few years, and with that, the prices have really increased.

While it's still amazing to eat, it's freakin' expensive now.

Seating is very limited, and it's always crammed packed, so call ahead & order to save yourself 30 minutes of waiting.

Oh, and it's not open on the weekend, which sucks. 

My fav: saag paneer.
