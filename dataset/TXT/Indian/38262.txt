OJLR2T3CgXQkUgFmqrkTwQ Taste of Somalia!!!

I found this hidden gem when looking for different places near my work place. I was up there with my team for lunch. The restaurant is located in a old plaza, this here is a self serve restaurant where you walk up to the front as ask them to make you a plate and then you pay and enjoy your food. 

Service here was top notch, I asked the server how does it work and he was very nice and helped us with making the plate, he explained the dishes. I believe you could have up to three or four items from different areas and instead of choosing those, he offered us bunch of things to try on our plate. 

All the servers were very friendly from the person making out plate to the person who came with drinks to our place. The restaurant has plenty of seats.

Now coming to the food, the menu was amazing so many things to choose from. As I said we had many bits of thing so on my plate, I had Rice, Beef stew, Fried chicken, BBQ sauce chicken, salad and a Somalian dish eaten instead of rice with gravy. I topped the plate with hot sauce on the side. Let me tell you all the meat on my plate was tender, tasty and good to the bone. Loved all of it!

While we were eating, one of the server came and told us, we also get a juice drink with a sit in meal. So I went with mango juice, he was very nice as asked us how the food was and as he notice it was our first time, they brought us some samosas (purely filled with spicy meat and not lime your usual samosas) and Mandhasi (a sweet bread/ donuts) on the house. 

Overall, very good experience!

P.S. They serve halal food.
