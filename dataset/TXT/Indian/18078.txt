eF0AwlWlTp16XneCF50QRA We were there around 6:30 and no one was there. Turns out they've only been open for one month. They had a few pick up orders though. I only got a few things but everything was excellent.  Best Garlic  Naan I have had in a very long time. Thin and light and very tasty. Service was great, three men took care of us. This place is not for people who don't know Indian food. Their menu is a little hard to  understand .   I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Paneer Masala. It was very good food. It's really seems authentic.
