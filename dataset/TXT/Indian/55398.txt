X-sqtBx78QDbX8kVbqF-dg We were really impressed by the taste and quality of our food until the last few minutes of our meal. As the waitress was walking away with the scraps of our food, we saw another waitress walk by and grab our ALREADY USED sauce and serve it to another table. Very off putting and made us question what of our meal may have been already used by other customers. I don't know about you, but to me that brings down an entire meal. Would recommend one of the places nearby. Just as good.
