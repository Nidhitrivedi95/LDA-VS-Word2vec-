N1BTJaWnLsCVsJ3I41EPdg First meal in Scotland and I was beyond impressed. We noticed the great reviews for Dishoom in London, but unfortunately did not have time to fit a meal there into our schedule. Luckily, we perused Yelp Scotland and saw one a short walk from our hotel. YES. 

We arrived around 7:00 p.m. and were quoted a 70 minute wait for a party of 2. No biggie, because there is an amazing bar downstairs to hang out at while waiting for a table. The downstairs bar smelled of incense and had a great selection of cocktails and bar snacks that transfer to your table tab. The Chaijito (think Indian mojito) and Mulled Bramble hit the spot. The potato crisps were great to munch on while waiting. Fortunately, we only waited about 30 minutes before being seated. 

The food was absolutely delicious! Some of the best Indian I've ever had. The vegetable samosas were piping hot and generously filled with peas, carrots, and potatoes. I highly recommend the Black Daal-- so flavorful! The Raita and Garlic Naan helped to cool off the spicy daal and Chicken Tikka. 

The service and ambiance were also great. I highly recommend Dishoom and would love to visit again!
