x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ I went to this place with a bunch of friends. Though overall quality of the food was not bad, Veg manchurian was little burnt. Fried rice and schezwan noodles were decent. chocolate mousse cake with ice cream was delicious.However my only complain is about terrible customer service. There was only girl that too without proper knowledge about the items on the menu.
