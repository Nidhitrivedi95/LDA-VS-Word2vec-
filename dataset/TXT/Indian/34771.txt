Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Five star Indian lunch buffet. I've been here a few times but only for the lunch buffet. 

The restaurant is the antithesis of the Strip. It is at the back of a Hawaiian-themed, courtyard mall with other restaurants, t-shirt stores, Half Priced Tickets, street performers, etc. 

You enter an office building, take an escalator up a flight, and the restaurant is maybe 25 feet away.  Subdued lighting, calming music, wonderful smells. A little oasis in the midst of the Strip. 

Food is very good for a buffet. A little spicy as it should be. Very friendly waitstaff. 

Price at $15 is reasonable for Vegas and even better if you get the 10% off from Yelp for checking in.
