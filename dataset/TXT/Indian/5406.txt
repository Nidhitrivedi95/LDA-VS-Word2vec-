2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw I'm new to scarborough & a friend recommended this place. She told me it was affordable (it was so cheap), & she told me they had snacks, samosas, parathas and a few food items too (they also had mithai & other sweets). She didn't warn me about the delishious smells that fill the air when you pull into the parking lot though. It was a freezing February evening around 6pm. The place was pretty crowded but the line moved quickly. So it's takeout only and after work it's almost always crowded. Hard-to-find-a-parking-space crowded. I got the samosas (tiny puffy things), some kulfi (tiny white things) & some jalebi (fat orange sweet stuff). I would've tried something else but nothing was labeled and the boys behind the counter had a polite but no-nonsense "please don't be one of THOSE customers who ask me costs & ingredients" look to them. Super affordable. I'm not a samosa freak but couldn't resist the warm spicy smells in the car: had like 5 little samosas on my ride back home. They were that good.
