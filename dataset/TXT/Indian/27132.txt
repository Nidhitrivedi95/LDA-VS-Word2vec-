Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Malia Chicken Tikka is plain as can be! Never had Indian food without flavor! 

Beef curry and chicken tikka masala were both very dry and sauce is like paste! 

Dosai was great! 


Also when I mentioned to the waiter the "mild flavor" was hot he says yes everything has a spice! Then label it spicy not mild!!!!
