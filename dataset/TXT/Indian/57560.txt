ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ Bought a Groupon voucher to try out this place.  Here's what we ordered:

- Chicken Tikka Masala......the sauce is good but white meat chicken chucks are kind of tough and dry. 

- Goa Prawn Curry......mild sauce and a little sweet. Tasty prawns but ONLY 6 PRAWNS in an order for $13.95.  Although they use tiger prawns which are a little bigger, but this order doesn't look like a dinner entrée at all, more like a kids meal, only a plate of sauce with few prawns swimming there.  

- Lamb Biryani......lamb cubes are yummy and tender!  Next time we better try Lamb Tikka Masala instead of chicken.

- Garlic Naan & Aloo Naan......both are yummy and good size.  Aloo Naan is my favorite, soft and thick, wonderful for dipping curry sauce.

- Seasoned rice.....great for any curry dishes.

Overall, nice and comfortable environment, attentive waiters, self-serve complimentary chai (milk tea) was pretty good. It was a good experience with Groupon voucher, otherwise it's a little pricey for the entrée portion size.  

Would go back to try other lamb dishes and their yummy Naan.
