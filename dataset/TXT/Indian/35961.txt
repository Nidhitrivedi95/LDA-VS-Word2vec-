nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ We've tried a lot of Indian places, and given that Brampton arguably has the largest population of Indians outside of India it's no surprise that India's Taste is as good as it is.

The buffet opens early, closes fairly late, and remains open all day throughout (even what would be regarded at between lunch and dinner at other buffet places). The food remains fresh and hot even in this mid-meal period.

Service is good but more reactive than pro-active - and the reason for the loss of 1/2 a point (where applicable). The price is also quite reasonable. Paying at the counter after the meal, you're in line with people ordering counter items which can result in frequent congestion. This goes to the service improvements that might be considered. 

Top notch Indian food though.
