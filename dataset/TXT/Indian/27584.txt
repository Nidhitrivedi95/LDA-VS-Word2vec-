Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg This place was amazing! Indian food is one of my favorites and  this place did not disappoint! I had the chicken tikka masala, which was so flavorful. I got medium spice and it was just a little too hot for me. We also got the garlic naan, which was the best I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and get it! Lastly, our server was SO KIND! She made the whole experience great and the owner came by and checked in with us, which was really thoughtful. This place is definitely worth the try!
