o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Fantastic bistro and I'm usually not a fan of Indian food.  Food stands out because of the freshness I think.  Flavors are clean and bright.. not overwhelming like a lot of Indian food I've had.  Food is also on the light side, not overly greasy. 

I've been here three times before and each time the food and service were great.  Atmosphere is clean and bright.

There is nothing I've tried so far that I haven't liked, but my favorites are the Tandoori Chicken Tikka, the fire cracker chicken and mama's cauliflower.  

I'll be back for sure.
