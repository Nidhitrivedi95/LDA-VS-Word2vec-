gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Had a dinner for two here during a weekday and ordered their Mount Everest Thali special for $21.99.  It was just the right amount of food for heavy eaters like us but would probably be too much for the average appetite.  The quality is above average and quite enjoyable, kinda like good home cooking.  The restaurant was quite clean and the service was friendly and prompt despite the restaurant being more than half occupied.  I can't recommend getting their thali combos enough.  It's like getting a tasting menu as you'll get quite a good variety of staple Indian dishes. Overall, I'd eat here again.  You get so much eating satisfaction for the money.
