KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ One of the better indo chinese (hakka) place in Mississauga area (although I'd still rather trek over to Airport/Derry) They have the chilli chicken, crispy beef/chicken, canto chowmein and hot and sour soup. they are priced similar to other places 9.99 a dish or more. 

Really great service :D
