hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Went there today on a whim, the ambiance is zen, the waiter was not bad, like he did his job checked up on us refilled our beverages but didn't seem happy. I would ask a question and his reply and tone would come out dull and rude! Like cheer up dude! What's your deal?! 

Food decent, small portions and a bit overpriced.

I do like the mango lassi!
