QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg I've been here 3 times and it's always what I would consider just ok. Nothing stand out or especially good, just fair to average with far fewer options that other local places like Taj Mahal. I'll come here for the lunch buffet if it's convenient and I'm really craving Indian, otherwise I bypass.
