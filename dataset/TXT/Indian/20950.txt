GaymsFE7jVr9PtLwYRYiAA A nice wee surprise on my travels. 

I grabbed a table and tucked into the Lamb Rogan Josh that the friendly waiter brought over to me. Rice was good, meat was tender and the sauce was spicy, but extremely creamy. 

The service was a little slow. I realise it was a friday night when I visited, but it looked like everyone else was in the same boat. 

Great food, just need to work on getting it out quicker.
