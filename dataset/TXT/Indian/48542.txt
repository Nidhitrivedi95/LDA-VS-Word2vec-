ToU2fHhYJ6_7AVc_MojMRg Ordered from here for our company lunch a couple times and I must say I love it!  They do delivery which is a major plus especially when you're too lazy to pick up the food yourself.  It works great as we get great tasting food for lunch at work!  I always get the lunch special which gives you any one option of chana masala, shahi paneer, daal tadka, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and chicken vindaloo, served with rice and naan for only $8.99.  This lunch special is only up to 3 p.m. but it is definitely worth it.

I've never actually been here since I've always done delivery but it does take about an hour for your food to arrive.  Also, the amount of meat they put in your meal is worth what you are paying for!

Love ordering work lunch from here and won't stop anytime soon!
