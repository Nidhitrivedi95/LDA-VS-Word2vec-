RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Brought some friends here who had limited experience w. Indian food. They just loved it and I have to concur - blue taj has solid Indian food, and I've eaten at most of the Indian places in Charlotte. For appetizers we had samosas, mango chaat, and chole chaat. The mango chaat was excellent - everyone kept reaching for that dish. Samosa was tasty and the chole chaat was beautifully presented (and also tasty!). We had chicken tikka masala (can't go wrong w this one, spice level of "2"), shahi paneer, and lamb rogan ghosh. The lamb blew us all away - it was so tender and flavorful. My only quibble is portion sizes are on the small size for price. Service was excellent and attentive, and I can tell you this is typically a weak point for Indian restaurants, but blue taj clearly trains staff well. Atmosphere is quite nice as well. If you're looking for an Indian restaurant to take guests, you won't go wrong here.
