abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg This place has been on my radar since it opened, but prior attempts to dine here were thwarted by various unforeseeable circumstances. I was finally able to make it on a few weeks ago - and it was so worth the wait.

We (party of four) ordered ten of the dishes (not including multiples of the ones that we knew would be popular amongst us). Almost everything we tried was fantastic. The standouts were the Ismaili beef curry, naan-kebab, cauliflower, and the crispy milk pastries. Other reviews have commented on the small portions, but it is meant to be small plates/tapas style. As mentioned earlier, we ordered 10 plates for 4 people, which was just the right amount of food.

The service was fantastic - attentive but not over bearing. They took the time to describe the dishes as they were brought to the table and our glasses were kept full the entire night. Chef and owner Noureen's dad also happened to be there that night, supporting his daughter, and he took the time to stop and talk to the guests at every table. He described her journey, having made stops at Momofuku, Origins, and Alinea (to name a few), and it was obvious that her dad was very proud of how hard she had worked to realize her dream. It was all very sweet.

All in all it was a fantastic dinner. I will definitely be coming back again and again =) And I hear they will start offering brunch soon!
