The free lassi, chai, naan, and sizzling tandoori chicken served with dinner make this place a more comprehensive meal than most Indian Buffets, though they come with no added cost. My wife and I have been here many times, and while the food is consistently flavorful at a good price, it's not so special as to earn a 5-star rating.
