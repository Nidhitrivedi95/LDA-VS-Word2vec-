abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg I'm glad I stopped into Rickshaw for some nibbles. Ordered a few items and they were all good even if the beef curry was a little salty, but the sesame Brussels sprouts were incredible. A great combination of savoury, creamy and a little tartness from the pickled cabbage (I think). Worth the trip just for this dish!! I should've ordered more.
