tRSUE3l8T2ptsj4LMk8Ysw Had a fairly positive experience when we came here on Sunday night with a few friends. The place was somewhat busy and we were seated as we walked in. 

They have a good menu with plenty of things to choose from. We ordered the paneer tikka Masala (cottage cheese cubes), malai kofta (potato and cottage cheese dumpling in tomato cream sauce), butter chicken, with saffron rice and garlic naans. 

The food was delicious, the naan were crisp and so buttery. There was plenty of garlic and the naan was super savory. The rice was fragrant and creamy (with a good amount of saffron) and both paired absolutely perfectly with the curry. The curries were great, they were smooth, creamy, and sweet. The food were nice and warm which is a plus. Everything we ordered tasted very similar (tomato sauce based) but that is our fault. I also felt that there could have been more pieces of chicken/kofta/paneer in the bowls of curry. There was only 3/4? Malai kofta dumplings, one of my friends didn't even try it. 

The prices are also on the high side. $14 for a bowl of curry is a bit too much. Add a bowl of rice ($6) and some naan ($3), and you've got some expensive Indian food, so don't come here expecting good value. But to be fair, there's plenty of curry in the bowls. I thought they would have had buffet for dinner passing by their lunch buffet signs for years but I guess that's only for lunch. Service could have been a bit better. Water took a while to arrive.

That being said, I would definitely return here again.
