llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g In some circles, referred-to simply as "The Palace," this place has a solid lunch buffet and good service. Priced at about $10 per person for a variety of good Indian food, it's a lunch-time slam dunk every time... although adding a couple more dishes to the mix would be ideal. It's an OK value for dinner, although, in my opinion, slightly overpriced for good, but not out of this world, Indian.
