vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg I have mixed feelings about this restaurant as I did enjoy my food but the service wasn't entirely up to par.

I ordered the butter chicken which at the time honestly did taste more like an italian, rose style sauce with chicken so because this place was supposed to specialize in Indian Cuisine I was a little confused. Also the dishes are not served with rice, this offers more of a selection I suppose but it is also a little silly when every meal *requires* you purchase rice seperately. 
The portions I do feel are large but the food I found was delicious, even if it wasn't the most authentic I did enjoy the meal very much. 

Service wise I was not impressed though, besides that warm and lovely greeting from the host or possible owner, the waitress was not attentive and left us waiting for long periods of time. Another downside to almsot anywhere in Toronto it seems now is parking, the street parking only goes to 8:30 or 9pm I believe so while we were waiting for our server parking enforcment could have shown up at anytime which would have forced us to run over and intervine. Not something you want to be worrying about when your trying to enjoy your dining experience.

Large enough patio was fairly comfortable but there weren't many people when I was there so I wonder how comfortable it would be packed.

Overall though I would say it's a decent place to experience what I would call an Indian "Inspired" meal but make sure you have the time to spend waiting for service
