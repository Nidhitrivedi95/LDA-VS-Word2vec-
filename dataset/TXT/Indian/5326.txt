2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw I would've given this place 4 stars if I came here only once. However, after coming here several times, I noticed some things I don't like about them. Aside from the samosa deal, I wouldn't come here for their dinner dishes (e.g., butter chicken, saag paneer). Although their dishes are delicious (but very salty), they're very stingy with the meat! I love soaking up my roti with curry but I like my beef and chicken too! If the prices were low (which they're not!), I would understand why they're stingy with the meat. With the prices they have, I can get one and half Chinese take out dishes with more substance than one of their dishes!
