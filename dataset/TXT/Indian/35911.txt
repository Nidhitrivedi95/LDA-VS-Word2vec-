Food: great value for the price; 
I ordered an eggplant dish and I enjoyed the smokiness of the flavor. At first it doesn't look like a lot, but in the end I couldn't finish half of it!  I also ordered the naan. Nice large piece and fit well with the eggplant. Couldn't finish that either. My dinner partner couldn't finish his portion either. 

Service: attentive and friendly
They also make good recommendations. 

Decor: Good
Enjoyed the Indian theme paintings hanging on the wall
