VrftSduLIducNfEzITOL5A I have never, and I mean ever had a more disgusting food. I feel compelled to warn others.
I spent 35$ for delivery, ordered chicken madras which tasted like gravy with a kilo of salt in it.
Everything was ridiculously salty, absolutely inedible. I didn't call to complain as I couldn't be bothered to argue but the food went to the garbage.
