GdzCnx5OWURyklzTjaQIPw I think I have fallen into the same trap that others have noted here - that Lothian Road, with its saunas and chain restaurants and it's propensity to the Pubic Triangle - doesn't leap out as a place where you expect food to be good. But there are a few places to enjoy here on the West Side, and Kama Sutra falls into this camp, even if the title of this restaurant and it's neighbours is rather grimly ironic. 

Service was very attentive - and the SR noted that he had experienced similar on his earlier visit, when the restaurant was much busier than it was on our visit - and we were advised on how much to order (portions are generous, so don't over order) which we found really helpful. 

I will note though, they have dosas on their menu - but they no longer make these, which I was heartily disappointed by and ended up plumping for a paneer dish. The boy went with a mixed tandoori which looked big enough for two and went down like a storm. We finished, stuffed and happy with our choice of venue for the night. Definitely ticked all of the good boxes.
