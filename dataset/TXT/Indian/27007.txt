iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA This was my first time visiting this location. I heard about it through social media as it has received a good reputation for great Indian cuisine. We wanted to ensure we ordered a good variety in order to get a good feel for most flavors. The food itself is a 3 out of 5. The flavors were bland, and all three entrees had a similar curry base. If I was doing a blind test they would all taste the same to me. The rice was not fluffy and stuck together in large chunks. You can not choose spice levels. The dosa/crepe was not crispy like it should be, very soggy. I have had better Indian food in the valley this place isn't worth the hype. As far as service, I would rate it a 0 out of 5. I had reservations and two parties without one got seated before ours. The server forgot to give us plates, forgot to bring one of the drink orders, and forgot to bring out the appetizer. Several items we inquired about, he said were no longer on the menu?! What?! Was unapologetic and careless. I drove far to visit this location but definitely will not be planning a trip back. Mediocre at best.
