xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw For real.. place was boo boo. My native friend hyped this shit up, and brought me a supreme damn indian taco. That muddafunka was weak sauce. Not much flavor in the red chili. Beans were meh.. Cheese... Lettuce. Sour cream. Overall plain as fugg.. 

I decided to give them another try, cuz I was craving some damn menudo, and no place has menudo during the week. Me and my coworker Fernando hit up the FBH at 11am. I ordered menudo.. Fernie was in line right behind me bout ta order when some fine thang who reminded me of a Brown Stallion Horse with skates on came up and told the clerk, "skuse me..deyyzz supposed ta be sep-rit oah-duz."

the clerk looked at her like she was a terrorist, and let out a super long, loud, and frustrated, "Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuccccccccccccccccckkkkkkkkkk!!!!­"

The shit was disrespectful as hell.

Whatever.. I sat down and waited for my menudo. You figure it should probably take 5 minutes or less to take a laddle.. dip the muthafunka in a big ass pot of pre-made soup.. pour it into a styrofoam container.. put a lid on it.. put it in a brown bag.. toss a pre-made baggie of onion and cilantro in.. grab a piece of fry bread form the muthafunka crankin out frybread.. toss that shit in the bag.. and shout out a nigga name.

Nah man. Their shitty ass process took 30 fuckin minutes!!! Then I took that shit out of the bag! "WTF is this???" I said. FBH hooked up a midget ass little cup of menudo, and some fried dough for 7 bucks. My other spot does like 3 times that for less money! Stingy ass FBH.. You guys can suck one. That ish didn't even taste good. Work on your broth mane, and throw some damn limes in the bag. Eff this place man. Don't go here-
