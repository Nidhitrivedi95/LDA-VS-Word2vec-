Thali . Unfortunately The food was cold  And I felt the archari  chicken was at least a day old,. Daal was bland and cold as well 

Ordered take out biryani  chicken tikka and daal with naan. Chicken tikka was extremely hard and one could not eat or chew the chicken , we hed to throw it away . Biryani was average the Salan was just water with turmeric . Very disappointed with my take out .

The competition is very severe especially in the bell road area ie notably biryani bites and paradise biryani offering very good and very consistent Andhra home type food and I doubt I will go to paradise chat again.
