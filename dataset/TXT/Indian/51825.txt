The chikken tikka masala, chicken tandoori, and lamb vindaloo were all very good as was the naan, bhaji, and yogurt.  Kheer (indian rice pudding) was also very good.  The Indian dishes that we tried were among some of the best Indian items we had tried.  I recommend the Indian dinner plate special, which is $30 and contains about 7 or 8 items to be shared with another person.
