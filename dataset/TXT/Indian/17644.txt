DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ I really like this place! I came in today.. I thought kwality sweets had the best samosas in town.. this one is up to par. The butter chicken was delicious, unlike kwality.. Everything is amazing but the butter chicken. This place has good desserts too. I tried the bharfi desserts and the vegetable pakora and the briyani and everything was very tasty. Not to over the top spicy, just the perfect touch. Definitely recommend and they are Very Affordable! Most Indian restaurants I go to usually likes to dig deep into my pockets but not this place! 23 bucks for everything! I might even become a regular, jeez
