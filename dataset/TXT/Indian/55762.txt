x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ We went there for lunch on our visit to Phoenix. We were a family of five with two kids 5 and 7. We ordered food and it took hours to come. The service was incredibly slow and the restroom was dirty. They should spend more money on their service and restroom instead of fake ambience. They charged a gratutity of six people even when we were five. Beware of what they charge you, we had too pay way above what the food calls for.
