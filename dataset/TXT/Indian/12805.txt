B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Rather disappointing for how much promise and flair. We opted to get the thali and were disappointed with the quality of the food as well as the freshness. 

Started with the salads where the lettuce was not fresh or not washed properly. 

Moved on to the main course where all three dishes had something wrong with them. The spinach paneer was bland which is shocking because it takes a special skill set to screw it up. The masala veg was a good dish however again bland. The eggplant dish was sub par and lacking any flavor kicks. The goat dish was undercooked thoroughly. 

All in all, it has a good ambience but if you're looking for a good indian food place please avoid this. We surely will.
