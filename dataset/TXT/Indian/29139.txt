JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw My mother and I came here for post-shopping lunch. To our surprise, we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. Our server, was so kind! We ended up chatting with him for quite a while. My mother is learning Tamil which is the language he speaks and he was so helpful and taught us a lot about his culture. I would suggest you get Soda, I did not care for the taste of the water. There was a lot of options on the buffet. I can't remember or pretend to know how to spell the names of most of them. However, I will say that the meat dishes were all fantastic!
