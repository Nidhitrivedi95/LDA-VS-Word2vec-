gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A The Mt. Everest is the best of both veggie and meat worlds!  My wife is a vegetarian and I am on the Atkins diet.  I love the huge selection of meals and Prakash (the owner) is the nicest man.  The restaurant is spotless (table cloths!) with endless attention to detail.  I wish I had known about this place years ago.

Try the Buffet lunch for welcome surprises.  They change the food selection every day.
