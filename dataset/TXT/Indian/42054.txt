QEN53zi2iJAAl3ceR7O68Q So I went there in the morning. Asked for nihari but the guy who baked the naan bread wasn't in yet. So I settled for the breakfast, puri channa. Just before the lady could bring me the breakfast she came and told me that the cook has come so she can give me nihari and naan. I said great! 

A few minutes later, she brought out my food but it was again channa puri. Weird!

The puris were good but the Chanas and aloo bhaji were bland. It needed more flavor. I enjoyed silverspoon's (next door) puri breakfast much better which I tried a month back. 
Also the service was very slow. It took quite some time for the already made food to be served.
