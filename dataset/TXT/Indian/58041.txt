yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Tasty yet overpriced (except at lunch). Also carefully look at your bill! They hide the fact that they add 18% gratuity for themselves by making it look like part of the total amount you must pay, not an itemized suggested amount. 

Pros:
Great variety with a lot of dishes
Good lunch prices
Tasty dishes no matter what you order
Beautiful ambience

Cons:
Dinner prices are higher than most Indian places
Some staff can be truculent if you do or ask for anything that apparently isn't to her liking
Deceitful w/ bills 
(As mentioned above, they print very archaic-looking bills w/ only numbers so you must remember exactly what you ordered and what it cost. But read it carefully!! It is itemized first by food & drink, then food & drink + tax, then food & drink + tax + 18% tip. So it's easy to assume the number at the bottom is your total WITHOUT TIP, which leads most people to double tip them unknowingly. I've seen my coworkers miss this every time. Makes me really wonder if they aren't intentionally making their bills cryptic and confusing... )
