yD2jmBrBPbLJ2yN3lQQHjw Staffs were friendly but they need to have more staffs to work. Only 2 servers and they had to do the cashier, clean the table, bring the food to the table, take the orders on site and on the phone.
The food was not so I would say the extra taste
It was just a regular fast food.
I saw a lot of people take the corn soup maybe something you might want to try if this is their specialty.
