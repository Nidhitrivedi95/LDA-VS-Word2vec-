iXGqaPR7ucNdwK-HapDnCw Took me forever to get waited on - by the guy that sat me! 
Noticed that there were many uncleared tables, not a good sign. 
Once the food arrived I thought that I would give the place a better rating but I just could not because of the slow service.  The food just was not that good to overcome the poor service. 
I would like to recommend, but just can't.
