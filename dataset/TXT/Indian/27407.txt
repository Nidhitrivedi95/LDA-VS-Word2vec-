IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw I used to love this buffet when I started coming here over a year ago, but I've noticed a decline quality in my last several visits.  The curries for the various meat dishes have become thin and watery and lacking of flavor.  The tawa which used to be the highlight of my earlier meals has become underwhelming.  There used to be much more variety in the buffet especially at dinner time, but now the buffet menu has become boring and repetitive.  Not sure if this is due to cost cutting or a different chef, but I no longer look forward to going to this buffet like I did in the earlier days.  What a shame!
