daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ K. So seriously, this is AMAZING.  I've been back 3 times since my first time and we will continue to visit for years to come I'm sure!  I don't know how it's possible to pack so much flavor into one thing, but these people know how. So fast we've tried the tikka special-MIND BLOWING, the tikka pizza-not mind blowing, but close enough!!!!!! The rice is mind blowing all on its own, I just get stuck shaking my head for hours because the deliciousness is TOO MUCHH!!!!!!!!!
