PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Went twice in 2 weeks!  We love it there because you can try bits and pieces of things that you may not have the guts to try at a restaurant (and pay $14.99 for something you may or may not like). 

The first time we went the naan was amazing, regular style and garlic.  The second time we went, the naan was really dense and very chewy.  We asked the naan chef where the garlic naan was and he said he would make us a fresh batch---what a difference!!!  Hot and fresh, soft and savoury.  

The dessert and salad stations were the least interesting to me, but everything else was fantastic.  Pace yourself, go slow and enjoy!  FYI Wednesdays kids eat free!  Get there before 7 pm to avoid a line!
