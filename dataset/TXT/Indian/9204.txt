86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ Met up with my girls for lunch on a beautiful Thursday.  For the busy area they had a few parking spots behind the restaurant for free (score)! There wasn't many people inside but didn't bother me. We were sat by the window on a high table. By checking in on yelp we got a free butter chicken poutine. It was great. They even gave extra sauce on the side to put on your fries. We ordered the bollywood Blitz sangria and it was nice and tangy. Would recommend that for sure. We all ordered the lunch special. It came with a creamy tomato sauce with poppadoms inside. Perfect level of cream and not overly rich. The meal comes in a cute bento box. I upgraded my samosa to the garlic balls for an extra dollar. It was very moist. It had an interesting taste. Not something I loved or hated. I got the Bombay chicken which is a bit more spicy. It had a good level of spice and not too creamy. I tried my friend's saffron chicken and I liked that more. It also comes with a salad, white rice, naan, and a couple pieces of mango. I think next time I'll upgrade to the garlic naan. It was a great meal. The service was a little slow for the amount of people in there but they were very nice. I would come back again for sure.
