I'll be honest, I don't venture too far out of my comfort Zone with Indian Food, the above I had is great and I could eat every day.  

The Staff is polite, the place is clean, and the prices and portion sizes are perfect.  You get more for what you paid for.  

This is now my resident take out place for Indian Food.
