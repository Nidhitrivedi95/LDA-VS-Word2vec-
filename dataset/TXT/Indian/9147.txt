82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA We ate dinner here on 23 July 2014. We love Indian cuisine, and when ever we are away on vacation, we try to find a good example. Le Taj was the right choice!! It was very close to our hotel on Boul. de Maisonneuve which was very convenient. We were greeted warmly by a gentleman who also happened to be our server. He gave us a choice of tables, and we chose the one by the window to the Tandoori clay oven. This was a special experience, because we could watch the chef prepare all the wonderful delicacies. We ordered a few things to share: Beef Vindaloo, Vegetarian Appetizer Platter, a coriander shrimp appetizer ( not sure of the name ) and Garlic Naan. The star of the meal was the Naan. Potently flavored with fragrant garlic and ghee, it was a delight! The Beef Vindaloo, although "medium" was too hot for us, but still edible with lots of rice and raita. The Vegetarian platter was very good as well, although the Aloo Tiki was a bit dry. But the Samosa and the onion fritter was perfect! The shrimp appetizer was special: Delicate flavors, perfectly cooked shrimp, and crisp greens. Delicious! The service made eating here really special. I started off with a chai before the meal came and told the server I would have my glass of Sauvignon Blanc with my meal. He waited until my tea was empty and then graciously poured my glass of wine. Very polite and attentive service! They did not rush us at all and let us enjoy every bit of the meal! For dessert we had Gulabjamun and some other cottage cheese delicacy which was delightful! Overall an amazing experience!
