ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Clean environment. Friendly service. Well priced lunch buffet (available on weekends). Good food. 

Lunch buffet is $11. Expect the standard offers in the lunch buffet. Garlic and plain naan bread options (included in buffet price). 

I recommend the mango lassi (not included in buffet) as a sweet dessert.
