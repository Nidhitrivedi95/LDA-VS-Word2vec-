TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Delicious buffet,  and I have tried several dozens across the country. Decent selection,  good salads and soups.  Free plain or garlic naans made to order, garlic naans were tasty and soft like I like. Spinach were creamy and not watery,  delicious! Meat morcels in dishes were of good quality. Keep it up! !
 This $11.95 lunch buffet totally hit the spot, this may have become my new favorite LV Indian buffet.
