H0IE2OnPSLQSxs3atGEIbw Best Indian in Edinburgh, love love their rogan gosh lamb, my husband ordered other dish which I forgot the name, he said that was his new favorite Indian dish. Food is pretty fantastic. The only thing I am not please is kid unfriendly environment. What a pity ,but anyway as long as food is good, I can always order takeaway
