UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Finally found a great Indian restaurant with a great selection. Ordered the Chicken Saag, garlic and butter Naan, Lamb Saag, and Chicken Tandoori- all met expectations and then some!! Every dish was seasoned to perfection- I ordered spice level 10- was perfect! Hubby ordered level 3, was perfect for his "mild" spice level. It took us awhile to try this place out- nice ambiance, great service, excellent food- who could ask for anything more?
