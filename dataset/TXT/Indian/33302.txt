llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Coming from the bay area where we seem to have an infinite supply of Indian buffets I can only give this place 3 stars because it wasn't bad but there are some things I did not like:

- The naan was too thin and they have mostly garlic naan.  I asked for plain and they said ok, but they brought out the garlic naan again.

- The selection isn't that great and they don't put out that much food.  I only got two pieces of Tandoori chicken which I had to dig out from the rest of the stuff.

- Also, the spices seems a bit lacking.  Not only am I used to food being a bit more spicy, but just flavor in general seemed to be lacking.  And some of the potatoes dishes the potatoes were undercooked (hard).

After reading all the reviews, I guess I expected a lot more.  I'll try something else next time.
