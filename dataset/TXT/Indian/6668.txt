49sbCG7F2jvqJsfG6-N8Rw Went with my daughter for lunch buffet.  This is our favorite Indian buffet to date--delicious vegetarian and meat options and the food was freshly prepared and hot.  There were four chicken options on the buffet (mango chicken, chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala, and tandoori chicken) as well as veggie options (e.g. Malai kofta, muttar paneer, and a few others), fresh salad and pickles/chutney/sauces, and several appetizer options (samosas and pakora).  We had to wait a few minutes for some of these things to be refilled but it was a small price to pay for a hot, fresh samosa instead of a gummy, lukewarm one, and the waits were not long.  Fresh bread (plain naan) was brought to the table.
