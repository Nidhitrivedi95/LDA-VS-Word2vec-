RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Amazing service great food
... We were told about this place by a friend .. We were greeted by the door happily ... My 2 yeaR old was treated like a little king!!! It was obviously our first time at an authentic Indian restaurant and everyone was very kind and informative ...
Yes the plates are styrofoam and the cutlery plastic... But the food and service make everything fun and kinda like an indoor picnic.....
Yum Yum Yum ... So many choices can't wait to go back
