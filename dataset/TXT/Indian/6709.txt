The owners really are the sweetest people and very accommodating and welcoming to us every time we visit here. The decor is pretty with white table cloths and soft Indian music playing in the background. Much more relaxing and peaceful atmosphere than India Garden.

We have tried a variety of dishes at Zaiaka and they are all very tasty with wonderful flavors and aromas. We bring our three children with us and they always get lots of attention and are very much welcomed.  The lunch buffet is also delicious and affordable with plenty of tasty options with fresh naan served to the table.
