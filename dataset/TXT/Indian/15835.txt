One order will have an edible level of spicy, the next order will be inedible because they decided slight pepper meant something else. There is no consistent threshold for spice level even if you choose the appropriate one, it's pretty much how they feel that day. As others have pointed out, they are really cheap with the meat, and channa and aloo. Ordered doubles and one aloo pie with channa, my aloo pie was flat and barely any 'chickpeas'/channa to be seen. Don't get me started on the roti and chicken, you might as well just order roti and potato because they are CHEAP when it comes to giving you meat, you get about 2 very small pieces. Not worth it.
