z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA I dropped into this place for lunch, when they had a buffet.  The food was ok, if limited in choice, but the service mediocre.  Like in the buffet, they had, among other things, tandoori chicken, of which I took a few pieces, just freshly in.  I got the first serving of naans, and had to wait a bit between finishing the first basket and  getting the second.  By then, the chicken had gotten cold.  As for the naans, they were flat, and some slightly crispy, instead of soft.  The tamarind chutney was okay.

In terms of drinks, they are surprisingly limited - only mango lassi/sweet lassi or the sodas.  No fresh lime sodas (lemonade variants) that one would expect from an Indian place

Conclusion: might be worth trying out for a la carte meals, but certainly not the buffet.
