86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ Just went there last week with wifey...

A very tasty variation on Indian cuisine. All dishes we tried were bold and flavourful. Portions were generous. Spiciness level was perfect. Everything was fresh and each bite was heavenly.

The cocktails were also unique, refreshing and reasonably priced.

Servers were friendly and knowledgeable.  Service was prompt.

There are many Indian restaurants that are worth a visit. Believe me when I say, I have visited many since 1993. Nawab is definitely worthy of many more visits.

Only critique was that the outdoor area and entry needed a little TLC. Other than that, a 5-star experience. Oh! wifey agrees...
