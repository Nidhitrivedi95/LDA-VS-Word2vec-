Service is lousy.  I think these positive reviews are from their relatives. Too many Indian restaurants in town to eat at this one and this Mt. Everest is one of the newer ones.  It's not all that bad, but I'd rather try out some other places.  Vegas didn't used to have many Indian restaurants.   Ghandi's went down hill years ago.
