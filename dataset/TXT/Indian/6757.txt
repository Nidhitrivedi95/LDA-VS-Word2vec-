They're a relatively cheap, tasty place to grab some food when you've got a craving for Indian in Pickering. Their chicken biriyani is great (not overspiced, with a good amount of meat) and they have a great chana masala. I've tried a few and they usually make my stomach churn a few hours later, but Food Time's was pretty good.

On the negatives: service is EXTREMELY slow. I did a walk-in once and - OH MY GOD! - never again. I think it took about 30 minutes to actually get my food. I ended up sitting in my car in the parking lot because it took so long and I didn't want to wait in the store and end up smelling too strongly of Indian food.

Always call ahead and place an order for pick-up, if you can. I've never had sit-down service at this place, so I can't speak to that.
