RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w GO HERE FOR AUTHENTIC PAKISTANI FOOD!

My family and I were in Toronto this weekend visiting from the U.S. My dad said he wanted to come to Toronto just to go here, and I have to say it was well worth it. First, I'd like to point out that this restaurant is authentic PAKISTANI food, not Indian food by any means, like some people are saying.

We were sat in a reasonable amount of time, despite the huge crowd of people are waiting outside. We went inside and I was amazed by the scene. From the huge outdoor tent seating to the tandoor they were cooking the naans in; it felt like stepping into Pakistan. My dad being incredibly excited, ordered naan, the beef nihari, haleem, karahi gosht, goat biryani, and afghani chicken tikka. We wanted to try the beef kabobs but were too full, so we asked one of the servers to bring just one out, asking if that was possible, and his response was "anything is possible here." The service was wonderful.

The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and everything looked incredible, and it all tasted even better. My parents both said it was the best Pakistani food they've had since moving to the U.S. That's a bold statement, I know, but I couldn't agree with them more. And they are originally from Lahore, so if that's not saying something, I don't know what will. If you want to try some of the best Pakistani food around, GO HERE!
