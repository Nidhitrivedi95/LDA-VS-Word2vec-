MPusZ5h5ZBHgNCyrqXompw Came by the week of their grand opening and must say the food is really good.  Order the kottu roti and it was delicious. The prices are a little lower than most other Sri Lankan restaurants in Toronto but I think this is likely due to the store being new. In any regard, definitely worth a try. I'll be going again very soon.
