llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Was craving buffet but the asian ones in the area are horrible. Never really had Indian food so I thought I would try it. The buffet didn't look appetizing at all but I felt bad leaving so I thought I would suck it up and just try it. 

To be honest I don't know the names of any of the things I tried lol the chicken with the red sauce over rice was really good. The tikka chicken? Something like that.

Tiny buffet with very limited selections. They had the Indian names of the foods but to someone who doesn't know, that means nothing. I think putting an English description would definitely help.

The dessert which was little dough balls or some sort covered in syrup was good. Something different.

Truth be told, had I known ahead of time what the buffet consisted of, I probably wouldn't have come. But the food turned out to be good and the staff was very nice.

I do have to add that their tap water was actually pretty good! Which is rare when it comes to restaurants in the valley.
