WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA Upon the high recommendation of my dinner date, I tried my first mega roti filled with jerk chicken, spinach, and squash on my first visit to Bacchus. Yummm! The enormous rotis that were served to our storefront window-side table after we ordered up at the counter were filled to the brim with deliciousness. 

Despite how much I enjoyed it though, it proved to be far more than one meal's worth of food for me. I'm pretty sure we could have shared one of these monster roti between the two of us. The piping hot meals went well with our exotic fruit juices. I have to admit that I'm not the biggest fan of artificial flavoured beverages, but the flavour of pear made me curious enough to try it at least once.

While there's no shortage of good roti around town, the extraordinarily neat and clean as well as thoughtfully decorated interior make Bacchus a nice place to sit down and stay a while to enjoy your food.
