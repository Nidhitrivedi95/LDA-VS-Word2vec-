LgqGDQsUurUh6qUocPeSsQ Came here on a particularly icy, cold night to meet up with some fellow Yelpers to get our collective Indian on. Despite the somewhat tacky interior and warbling Bollywood on the tv, the place was fairly full and as soon as I opened the door, all I could think of was getting some saag paneer and beer into my gob.

Each one of our 8 people ordered something differed: 2 types of paneer, a yummy cauliflower dish, tikka chicken, some goat and enough naan to feed a small country. 

The service was fast and friendly, the beer was cheap and the total bill was ridiculously cheap. I would definitely come back here and I only wish that it was closer to my house. Question though, does he show the Catherine Deneuve photo to everyone that dines here? ha ha
