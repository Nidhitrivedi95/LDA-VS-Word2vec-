abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg Great vibe. Amazing food.  The portions like most comments are small however between 2 of us we had 2 starters and 2 plates and that was enough food.  We had the Greek wine which was pretty good.  Starters: cauliflower the marinate was tasty but the cauliflower itself was tad underdone for me, I personally like my cauliflower a little soft.  The naan kabab were amazing.  Chicken coconut curry was may favourite absolutely delicious.  Shrimp makai curry was pretty flavourful as well.  The crispy milk pastry was just perfect ending to a great meal.
