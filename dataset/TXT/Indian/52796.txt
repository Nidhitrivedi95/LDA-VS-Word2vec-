V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w This place is busy like no other during lunch time! Decent Indian food in uptown, ESP on Thursdays for goat curry! It's a hit or miss though bc sometimes u get mostly bones. But the flavors are there!

The menu is confusing to read, I still don't know what the pricing is but I usually get biriyani (mixed rice dish) with a meat (either goat curry or chicken tikka masala) and a vegetarian side like paneer. This is actually more than enough food that you can split into two meals. Either that or just get the rice and meat dish for around $8. 

Make sure to get here before 1pm bc they run out of food quick. And it's all to go dishes, no dine in option!
