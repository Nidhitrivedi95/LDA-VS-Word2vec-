PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ The current trend in the GTA for Indians is buffet's. For the most part the places I have been to have been pretty good. 

The decorations are pretty interesting. They have hung what looked like Sari's as curtains, and used the different colors as contrasts. They have an interesting sort of cross pattern with wood across the windows and the layout of the buffet is good.

The service was ok. It was a buffet, but it shouldn't take like 20 mins to get someone to come by to take your drink order. After waiting for someone to take the order , it took forever for the drink to come. They did manage to clean up the plates. This is pretty important in a buffet, and they do it pretty well.

The food was pretty good. I didn't like the Malai Kofta, but everything else was pretty decent. The food was pretty standard faire for Indian food. I'm not sure if the buffet was worth 19.99 though.
