RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Really nice new Indian restaurant on the east side! Long cocktail list and 2 nice areas with bar seating. Also surprisingly kid friendly- they have a nice kids menu and also a play area for kids next to the seating area- basic, with a few toys but really nice touch. If you don't like kids the place is big enough that you probably won't be seated next to any. The food was good-spice level was definitely suited to midwestern audience so if you order medium it's going to be pretty mild. I didn't try the dosas or tandoori options so definitely want to come back for that but the lentil and chicken dishes I had were super savory. Menu also has pasta for those who aren't into Indian food but I didn't have that so can't rate it. Friendly service and nice, clean decor. Will definitely come here again and this time I'll sit at the bar by the kitchen so I can watch them making everything!
