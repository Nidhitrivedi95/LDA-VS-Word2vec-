4ritTGFnNxmKnKm-UX3kPQ The butter chicken wrap is amazing.  Wish it was more consistent though as some days it's not very spicy, others it's a killer it's so spicy.  

Another issue is that it sometimes takes 5 min, others it can take up to 15. I wish I could say it because they were busy but I was the only one there that day. 

Great staff though and I will come back for sure.
