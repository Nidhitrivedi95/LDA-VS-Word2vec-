IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw I came here for dinner buffet and was very impressed. My main criteria is always just the food. There are too many pretentious places in the GTA. I've tried fancier Indian places and some of them had food that's worst than a buffet. 

Anyways, for a buffet, the selection is excellent. For dinner, the meat dishes were fish, chicken shish kebobs, tandoori chicken, goat curry, lamb curry, butter chicken, and another type of curry chicken. They have various veggie dishes, including one with spinach and mushroom which I really liked. Things were fresh and were refilled in a timely manner. They serve freshly made naan delivered in a basket to your table. 

Food quality is excellent. I felt like I was eating freshly made food. I know some buffets probably "recycle" their food for the next day. I don't think they do that here. Food is full of flavor. The only disappointment is the tandoori chicken which I found very lacking in flavor. 

They have that ball thing for dessert and some ice cream. I guess their rice pudding and carrot pudding are like a dessert too. Good enough for me!

For their selection, $15.99 is a total steal, especially when you factor in their quality. I'm definitely coming here again next time I crave Indian and want to pig out.
