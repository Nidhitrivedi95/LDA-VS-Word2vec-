PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q Food is average. Tamarind on N. Craig has better food....but is more expensive. Udipi in Monroeville hands down has the best Indian food in the Pittsburgh region. The service at India Garden is VERY slow during peak dinner hours on Fri/Sat. I ordered take out and they said over the phone that it would be 25 minutes. 1 HOUR later I was still standing in their bar area waiting for my food to come out. Although the manager apologized, it was still unacceptable.
