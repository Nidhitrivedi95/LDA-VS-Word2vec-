jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Wow this place is my new favorite! This place serves up lots of flavor, fresh spices and ingredients, I ordered a chicken curry dish to go it had large delicious beautifully cooked tender chunks of chicken breast and fresh veggies I ate it for lunch and then dinner it was that much!  I ordered it a 6 and it was just right. I see that other reviewers commented on the prices and gave them less stars, it takes money and effort to deliver a freshly made quality meal and I appreciate that some people are still out there trying to do just that so I'll pay a tad more for that any day, the entree was so big I ran out of rice (so ask for extra rice for your next meal) one of their entrees can feed two people so long as one of them is not Fat Bastard! By the way this place is spotlessly clean! Keep up the good work- I will be back tomorrow.
