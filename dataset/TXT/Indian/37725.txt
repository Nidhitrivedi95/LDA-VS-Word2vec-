OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg We're giving it a 5 stars, mostly for it service, and 4 stars for the food. 

For the appetizer, we shared the Bhel Puri, which was a very solid choice considering how yummy it is (Let's just say we cleaned the bowl alright)! For the mains, we had the Chicken Lababdar (not Labrador, according to their menu!), Saffron Rice and Garlic Naan - all of which were very tasty! We also had the Butter chicken, which we thought was just okay. 

We thought that the service at this restaurant was very amazing. When we arrived, the patio was very full so we decided to stay inside. However, it was very cold and as soon as there was an opening, I asked to change our seat to the patio. Our sever was very accommodating and helpful. I love that there was 1 server dedicated to the patio, even when its almost empty! When it came to packing up our leftovers, the server told us he added more rice, because we only had a bit left. How amazing was that gesture? We think because of that, they certainly deserve 5 stars!
