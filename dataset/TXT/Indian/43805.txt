RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg At no other restaurant have I received service as excellent as I got here.  Your needs are attended to almost instantly, and the treatment is much better than most establishments at this price.  

I originally went here for my birthday, in large part because I was sick and Indian food was one of the few things with strong enough taste for me to enjoy.  I am glad I did.  While I can't remember the specific name of the dish I ordered, it involved Basmati rice, lamb, and cashew sauce.  It was excellent.  The provided chips (not sure of the specific name) were good, and free of charge, as was the pudding-esque small dessert.  In addition, the tea I got, which might have been called "Masala Chai," was a good thing for sick me on that day.

Overall, one of the nicer restaurants in the area, and it cannot be beaten for Indian food out here.
