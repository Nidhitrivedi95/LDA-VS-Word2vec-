kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Stopped by here yesterday at happy hour! Had a late lunch so a friend I shared the carrot souflee (it was good but not quite what we were picturing, guess  we should've asked...) and a couple glass of wine ($4 at happy hour!). Regularly, all the wines are $6/glass or $20/bottle, even on wines that cost quite a bit more at other restaurants. The service was a little on the slow side, but very friendly. Also really like the atmosphere, lime green white and black looks clean and modern but warm. The outside seating area also looked really nice. Will definitely try it again for dinner soon.
