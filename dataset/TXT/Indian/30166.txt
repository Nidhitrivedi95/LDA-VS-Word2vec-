JziBbXfW_SRE8hAV9vzq8A Came here on a Saturday evening and it was fairly empty. It might have something to do with the fact that it was extremely difficult to find. I was confused as to why Google maps was leading me into a condo. Turns out there are a few restaurants right there but is a bit misleading to people not familiar with the area.

The decor of the place was nice and had a hipster vibe. Lots of windows and decent furniture. Only downside was that the sun was beaming directly into my eyes for most of the dinner since they didn't have any blinds. 

Service was good and everyone was polite and offered good recommendations to people who haven't been before. They also gave everyone a complementary small glass of mango lassi while we were waiting for our food. I opted for the lamb skewers, which were slightly dry but still tasty. Although, I still think the food was overpriced for what we got. Also, TIP IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE BILL! It was written in bold on out receipt but only 1 person saw it. Would have been nice if the waitress mentioned something in addition to the big bold letters. 

Overall, nice restaurant with good food and vibe but not sure I would go back since it is pretty expensive.
