ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Visiting and decided to check it out despite the mixed reviews here - very glad I did!

It's in an old house which has an interesting juxtaposition of decor, shall we say, against the historic feel of the house, but still nice and comfortable.

They were accommodating and the meal came out quickly for us:

Murgh Tikka Masala: delicious and lovely with plenty of sauce (yum) and nicely cooked chicken
Saag Paneer: By far the best I've ever had - I could not get enough
Lamb Kozhambu: On the (good) spicy side but imo not as great as the MTM

Overall assessment - try it.  If you're unsure about a dish, just ask.  If you're nice, they'll be nice back :)
