qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Relied on ratings to find this place and you guys didn't let me down!  Not a fancy establishment but the food was very tasty. We had shrimp Korma, chicken korma, and chicken karahi. We got rice with each and had enough left over for another dinner. Would recommend 2 orders of rice for 3 people. The nan was plentiful and delicious.  The food and nan stayed warm the whole meal. This place is a jem waiting to be discovered by your pallet.  A must try if you are in reasonable driving distance!
