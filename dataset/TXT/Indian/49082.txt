TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw I would honestly give this 3.5 stars. We've only had the lunch buffet and their fresh nan bread is AMAZING. The butter chicken was very flavorful and rich, saag paneer had firm paneer chunks and chicken tandori was juicy. They had a decent amount of selection and the food was warm/hot. 

The lady that was serving us was nice and friendly. My only problem with this place is that they put a lot of cream into the buffet (a trick used get customers full faster) and you can feel that when you're done eating. Their masala chai was very bland as well and just tasted like plain tea. 

In all until I try their dinner menu I'm not overly impressed with this place but I have to say their nan bread is one of the best ever and we will go back just for that.
