2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Food: As a party of two, we ordered chicken tikka masala and shrimp vindaloo with naan. The dishes were tasty and we were well warned about the spice level. Easily one of the best indian restaurants I've been to lately.

Atmosphere: The decor is great, and the staff is friendly. One complaint that I have however, is that me and my friend (who is not Indian) were asked to sit on the opposite side of the bar (waiting area? instead of the main dining room). We didn't question this as we thought perhaps there were no more tables for two left in the dining area.. however we later saw many other customers be seated in the dining area. Not sure what to think of this, as I don't want to jump to conclusions!

Overall: Despite the odd seating arrangement, the staff were very friendly and both service and food was very good. Although a little pricey, since all sides (salad, naan, raita, etc were extra), I would recommend this restaurant to others.
