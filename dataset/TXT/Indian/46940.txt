t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Came here with some friends for dinner. This was my first time at this restaurant and I must say, it was delish! We ordered family style--a little bit of everything and shared around the table. Only me and a friend were familiar with Indian food, so we basically ordered for the table. As she is a vegetarian, she ordered all the veggie foods and I ordered chicken dishes. 

We started with the cheese madras, chicken samosa and veggie samosa. The samosas come 2 to an order, but they are pretty big! It was enough to feed our party of 7. Keep in mind that this is just an appetizer and not meant to fill you up before the main course! For our main dishes, we had chicken madras, veggie madras, chicken tikka masala, and butter chicken. Butter chicken and tikka masala are my go to dishes--that is my normal order! The madras was something else--the flavors were so good, I couldn't stop eating! We also ordered garlic naan and cheese naan. The cheese naan is to die for! I want to kiss the hand of the one who thought to put cheese inside the naan! We ordered our appetizers at a spice level 2 out of 10 and the entrees at a level 3. They were both the perfect level of spice for those wanting the flavor and avoiding sweating through the meal!

Overall, the food was excellent. Our server was very patient with any questions and concerns that was asked--as mentioned before, most of the party had never eaten Indian food before. I would definitely come back again!
