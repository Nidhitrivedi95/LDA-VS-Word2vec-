tcclqqE4T8XbgS-02vsl6A This was my first food and cultural festival in Las Vegas.  One of the many benefits of living in a large city is the cultural diversity and what better way to experience it than going to a festival like this.

After a hike, two of us drove to the Clark County Government Center Amphitheater in downtown Las Vegas.  There was plenty of parking when we arrived.  At this festival, you purchase cards in different denominations to be paid to buy food or merchandise.  There was a table at each end of the food vendor area that sold the cards.  I got $20 worth which came as one $10 card, one $5 card, and five $1 cards.  The vendors give you change in cards so all money is handled in one area.

My friend and I first walked along to look at all the food offerings.  The vendors are under the canopy opposite the performing stage at the amphitheater.  The first set you come to were all food vendors and the second set were all clothing, jewelry, and assorted services such as tarot readings and henna tattoos.  

After our walk, we headed back to the food vendors.  We started with splitting an order of chicken momos that came with a tomato based dipping sauce that had some nice spice to it.  That, along with some mango lassi, made for a good appetizer.

The amphitheater has a large grassy area but we set up our lawn chairs under some trees for shade.  After meeting another person, we went back and got some more lunch.  I got an order of pani puri that was something I'd never tried before and it was very good and very filling.  It was explained to me that this was Indian fast food.

Before we left, we watched some of the Raas competition.  We weren't close to the stage but it was better to stay out of the full sun and watch from our seats.

I later learned that the Vaisakhi festival is a traditional Sikh spring harvest festival.  I am certainly a fan of the festival and I'll be back next year.
