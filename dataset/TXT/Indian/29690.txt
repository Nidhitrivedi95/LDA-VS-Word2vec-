jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg My boyfriend and I had dinner here on a Saturday night recently, and it was our first Indian food dining experience. It was amazing, we are so glad we came here!! 

We ordered these potato like appetizers which were so flavorful, along with garlic naan (bread) and soup.  We also ordered a couple different indian cocktails. We went with the server's recommendation and so glad we did because they were both delicious! For main course we got chicken tikka masala and the lamb entree, every bite was savory and honestly the best chicken tikka I've ever had. My boyfriend says the lamb was his favorite and the best he'd ever eaten as well. For dessert we ordered the chai tea and rice pudding, which finished our meal perfectly! 

The service was exceptional as well. We sat on the patio overlooking the Scottsdale Civic center lawn. An adorable hidden gem with authentic atmosphere and knowledgable/friendly staff!! We will definitely be returning here soon!!
