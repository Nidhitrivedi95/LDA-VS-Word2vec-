tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I have clients in the area, and i make sure i dont eat breakfast!
The establishment is VERY nice.
The staff is EXTREMELY attentive, not over bearing, you will not ever have an empty water glass.
The Naan is just absolutely DEEEEEEEEEEEELICIOUS!
Love the curry! and crave it every other day.
The lunch buffet is just under $10 with tax. But always leave a good tip!
That spicy green sauce for the salad, OMG! SO good!
