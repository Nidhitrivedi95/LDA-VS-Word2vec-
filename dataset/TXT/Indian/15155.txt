CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I read all the reviews before coming so I was prepared for bad service. That's why this gets 3 stars and not 5 stars. Service really depended on your server. It was great when we got here. We ordered drinks and an appetizer and were served right away, but had to get our server to place our dinner order, and to pay our bill. It was an hour and a half for the entire meal. There were 3 servers. Two were very attentive and one not and that's who we got.
Food was excellent. One review said greasy and our food definitely was not. One person said salty, and I would say I agree, but not to the extent that it ruined the meal. As far as too much pepper...it's an Indian restaurant, newsflash the food is spicy. 
If you come prepared for slow service, it's good.
