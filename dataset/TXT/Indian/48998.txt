TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw This review is for dinner service and not the lunch buffet. We dined here Saturday night and overall experience was enjoyable. 

The restaurant was fairly empty (two other tables occupying the space) which was slightly worrisome. Our server was also the owner and she was pleasant and sweet. We started off with a bottle of Cabernet and two appetizers: Chicken Pakoras and Vegetable Samosas. I was not particularly impressed with either, but 2 out of the 4 in our party enjoyed both. 

Our entrees were following: Butter Chicken (very good), Saag Paneer (nothing special), Goan Shrimp Curry (my favorite out of our choices, exceptionally good), Lamb Tikka Masala (also good), Chicken Vindaloo (did not try, but rest of the party enjoyed). We also had four orders of garlic naan which seemed a little too crispy for my liking. 

Although not perfect, the food and service here are well above par. I will definitely be returning to sample more of their menu and of course indulge in more Goan Shrimp Curry!
