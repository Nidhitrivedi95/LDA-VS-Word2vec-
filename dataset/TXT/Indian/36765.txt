nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ If you're looking for value, Eat Fresh Be Healthy is it. Huge portions will leave you stuffed for only $25 (for dinner). I have always recommended those looking for a decent dinner without the 5 star price to go to this restaurant. 

All that being said, in my most recent visit one thing bothered me immensely - the salt. The dishes I ordered, the calamari and the lamb, were way over salted. The one bottle of water was not enough to help wash it all down and I could still feel the effects the next morning. I read some other reviews mentioning this and I can confirm this criticism. The food is still cooked well nonetheless.

As others have mentioned, do not expect anything in terms of decor, and plan for your clothes to smell after dinner as you are literally eating next to the kitchen. I'll still come back again but may mention to watch out for the heavy handed seasoning.
