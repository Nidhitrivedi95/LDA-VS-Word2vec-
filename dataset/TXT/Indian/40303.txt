plXrGjtnDxYjHdpZ3wNMZQ BOTTOM LINE: Authentic Indian food, period.

This place can be easy to miss as it's located in a weird corner of a plaza, but it serves very solid Indian food - and by very solid, I don't mean by Whitby's standard, but solid, period. The interior is fairly bare bones, the service is fair, and the prices are good. The chef is an elderly Indian lady who I've never seen so much as duck her head out of the kitchen, but I can tell you that she don't play - her dishes use authentic spices, and they have a lot of kick to 'em. This place is definitely one of my go-to places in Whitby. 

The ONION BHAJIS and the VEGETABLE PAKORAS are light and crispy, and the side sauces are both refreshing and spicy. One of my favourite dishes is the LAMB VINDALOO, with a nice rich and spicy sauce. The CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA is very flavourful. If you can't take much spice, then I'd recommend the BUTTER CHICKEN or the MATAR PANEER (hmmmmm, paneer!). Your dishes come with rice, though if you're in a group, I'd recommend adding a GARLIC NAAN.
