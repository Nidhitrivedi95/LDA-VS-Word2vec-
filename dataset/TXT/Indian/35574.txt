MZgIUrRRF3AuTLzbSgGEIw Tinnels is always among the best patties in the GTA 

This is a Jamaican spot so I am not sure why it says Indian, Pakistani on yelp

Patty and Coco bread for $2 is always great and they serve Manish Water on Friday and Saturday which I have to find my way back for if in Brampton on a weekend

I wish they sold these patties in the supermarkets where I live
