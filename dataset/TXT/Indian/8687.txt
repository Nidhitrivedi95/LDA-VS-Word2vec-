I usually go to Dhaba two doors down and frankly the similarity between it and Aroma is a little striking, I'm wondering if they might be owned by the same people. The decor and layout of the restaurant is very similar as is the food. Fresh, robust taste, and good quality ingredients. The "standard" hotness at Aroma is really mild mind you, while Dhaba is a little hotter. Next time I go I will definitely ask for hot at Aroma because the dishes probably didn't even have any chilis in them. But the rest was so promising I will definitely go back. I still think Banjara is more flavourful, but also probably fattier and heavier so Aroma will have a spot for my pre-TIFF dinners.
