What I can definitely recommend is their palak paneer, which is heavenly. Creamy, flavourful spinach, delicately spiced, and heaped with generous portions of paneer cheese. The best palak paneer I've had in Toronto by a long shot!

I only ever went for takeaway but the staff at their little takeout window was always very friendly.
