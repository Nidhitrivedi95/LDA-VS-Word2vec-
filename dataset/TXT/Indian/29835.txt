jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Visiting from Chicago and had a wonderful experience at Lazeez. Met the owner Mona and she was was very sweet and attentive. You could tell she really cared for the customers experience and you could taste it in the food as well. Every dish we had was wonderful and perfectly cooked and spiced. A very cool fusion of Middle Eastern/Indian/Pakistani food. The decor and ambience was well thought out and nothing comes across garish. Definitely a place you would go to again and again. We are here a few more days and will surely eat there again!
