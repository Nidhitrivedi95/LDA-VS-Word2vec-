A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA ***update, they are two for two in forgetting rice in my to go order!!! Good thing I checked both times!  Good food but they could improve customer service, they are almost like talking to robots. Nan was better this time. 

Original post: Good but not great. I got it to go and initially they forgot to give me rice, luckily I noticed before I left the parking lot. The nan got old and rubbery by the time I started eating about 10-12 min after I left the restaurant. The chicken tikka masala was good and I'll probably go back and eat in to give the nan a chance again. Why is it so hard to find good Indian good in AZ?!?!?!
