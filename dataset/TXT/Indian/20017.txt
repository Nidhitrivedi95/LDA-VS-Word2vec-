FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q Don't know much about Indian food, but the lunch buffet was really good, 9.95 on weekends. I plan on going back. 
Parking is free in a hidden, dark garage. Drive along Broom and mid-block, make a turn into what looks like parking for the condos next to the restaurant. If you've passed the Capitol Centre Market, you've gone too far.
