auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Immeasurably surprised to find quality of food the likes of which I've only elsewhere experienced in New York City. 

Highly recommend you ask for the Paper-thin Masala Dosa.  Even if you don't know what it is.  It's not on the menu. It was actually the best one I've ever had.   It won't disappoint.

I hope they get a better music system soon.  If they do, they'll see a lot more of me.  And most don't get to see me at all.  Oh and better lighting would be great too.  I love to be a bit mood lit when I accompany my dosa.
