YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA Where do I start... This place is the best! Randomly walked in for takeout and the servers quickly handed us a menu and let us sit on the patio. They had suggestions which was really helpful. The restaurant itself is also one of the cleanest amongst the Gerrard India Bazaar. While we waited, the servers brought us ice water and then Pakoras!!! Say what!!! A complimentary appetizer while we waited for take out... Talk about impeccable service! They were absolutely delicious- the rest of the food too. So flavourful and the spice wasn't over powering! God damn!!!!
