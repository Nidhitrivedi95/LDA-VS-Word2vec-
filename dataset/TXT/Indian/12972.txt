b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw GREAT Southern Indian food. I've been a big fan of India Garden's other restaurant in Lakewood, going to the lunch buffet there for several years on a weekly basis and loving it. But not until today have I tried Namaste and I'm really glad I did! 
We ordered two dishes to share, the goat chettinad, and Bagara Baingan (eggplant), plus garlic naan and rasam soup. The soup was AMAZING. They were even nice enough to bring us two bowls when we were sharing one order of it. The Naan was the best I've ever had. So much garlic! 
The serving sizes were pretty big, not huge, but enough to have a little left over since most Indian dishes are very rich. I could've eaten the whole thing, but I knew I would be uncomfortably full.  
The prices were reasonable, a little higher than I usually like to pay, around $15 for a meat dish and a little less for vegetarian. After two entrees, naan and soup, plus tax and tip it was $44 for two people. Not terrible, but not an every day outing. I could sure eat it every day though! 
The service was superb. Very nice people.
