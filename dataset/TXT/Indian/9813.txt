The restaurant organization was the downside of this place. They've only been open 6 weeks and they still have a lot to work on. They are definitely understaffed and the staff are still in training. 
They beer and wine wall was half operational and the price of the alcohol on the menu was better anyway. 
It's not fair to compare it yet to the original Mint of East Flamingo. With a few easy peasy changes, this place could be even better.
