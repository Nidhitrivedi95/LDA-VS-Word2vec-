rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ We were visiting from out of town and came here based on a good review, and we were NOT disappointed. My husband thought it was the best meal of his life. Everything we got was really good-- the chicken was fresh and not over (or under) cooked, the sauces had flavor and enhanced the food, and the naan was perfectly crispy. We got the chicken tikka, garlic naan, rice (huge portion!), and the Punjabi chicken. The atmosphere was also very nice -- trendy but not too in your face. Our waitress was also very good -- helpful and attentive but not too in your face. Highly recommend!!!!
