-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g I've visited Nandini's lunch buffets for approximately 5 times over the last year. Initially, I was really impressed with the spread and the price (i twas 7.99 a year ago). The mango lassi, was good, although sweet. Their tandoori chicken was delicious, better than most other Indian buffets. They also had lamb curry when it was 7.99.

Now, the price is 9.99, and a lot of things changed. I was expecting the food to get better when they raised the price, but they did not. During my most recent visit, there's no longer lamb, the naan was over-charred, and the tandoori chicken doesn't taste as good anymore.

What happened here? Nandini used to be cheaper and better! Now, it's just decent and priced same as other Indian Buffets. It's still worth a try for yourself, but I will stop frequenting Nandini.
