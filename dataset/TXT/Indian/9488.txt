8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I've been to Sitara three or four times now and the food is really good - especially the chicken tikka masala and the palak paneer. The naan bread is very fresh and tasty. The service is great and they deliver too, promptly and cheerfully. So glad they opened up in downtown Urbana.
