o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Love this place!  I've dined here on at least five different occasions, during lunch and dinner service, and I have never been disappointed.  During lunch, they offer A buffet, which I surprisingly enjoy.  I typically don't like buffets;however, this one is well-maintained has delicious offerings and is well maintained and kept fresh.  During dinner, the service is very good and it is an enjoyable dining experience.  Try the spicy naan and the chicken tikka masala!
