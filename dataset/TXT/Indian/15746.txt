CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ I came here last Friday for lunch. The visit was part of my team's weekly lunch outing. 

I drove my co-op students to this restaurant, which is located in a crazy-busy plaza in Mississauga. It houses one of the largest No Frills stores that I have ever seen!

The restaurant is small. Don't let that fool you. The lunch buffet has plenty of selection for vegetarians and meat eaters. There were chick pea and lentil curries, and butter chicken and goat curry. The spice level varies, depending on what you get. 

The food is excellent. Everything I sampled was tasty, authentic, and delicious. 

The lunch buffet is $12 a person on Fridays. You can also order from the menu if you don't feel like gorging. 

I didn't do the desserts. East Indian desserts tend to be abundantly sweet. I passed. 

The naan is amazing here. It's soft, warm, and yummy. The water comes in pretty tinted bottles. You drink from what seems to be copper-like mugs, which was nice. 

We got here just after 1 pm. It wasn't all that busy. Staff are nice. Service was wonderful and prompt. 

I'd recommend coming here.
