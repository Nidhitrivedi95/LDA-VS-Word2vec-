This place is a vegan indian-food lover's dream come true. It is almost totally vegan with only a couple of exceptions -- the desserts are never vegan.  :(   But it's genuine south indian, so what can you do?

The food here is amazing. AMAZING! The lunch buffet has such a great variety and everything tastes good. I wish they had even more dosa varieties than they do. 

When you drive by, it doesn't look like much. Ignore that. Looks are definitely deceiving in this case. Udupi is one of our very favorite restaurants.
