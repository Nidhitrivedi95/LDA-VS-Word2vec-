A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA 5-Star dosas : Good dosas and diverse dosa menu. I would say dosas are @ right price for most extent.  

2-Star service: There was no service other than serving our order. We were trying to shout out for chutneys but no one attended us. They were few customers but service managers were least interested in serving customers. Finally one servicing person came to us and got our chutney request but never got the chutney to us. We never got our chutneys! dosas without chutneys are like junior chicken without ketchup.

2-Star for tipping: Almost compulsory high tipping for no service The visa machine shows options in such a way you would tip very generously. good trick but cheap one.
