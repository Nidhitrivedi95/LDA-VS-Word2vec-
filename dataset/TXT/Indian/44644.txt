S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA We just arrived from Orlando and went to this restaurant. The experience was not great from service to food. We ordered couple of plates of lamb biryani and it did not taste like biryani and tasted like yellow rice turned white and some meat tossed in it. The serves were also very small for the price we paid. We spent over $100 and it was not its value from a quality and service perspective. 
Hope we received better service and quality Indian food.
