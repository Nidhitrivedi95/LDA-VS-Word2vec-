j3YSK-IgpNabCIzWEl7CaA Love the selection, not a big fan of the service. I ususally drive a little further to another market when I need Indian goods, because I'm greeted and offered assistance. At Rajbhog, I feel like an outsider because I'm not Indian. The market is not their big focus, their cafe is. I'm OK with that. But as a non-Indian, I'm not as adept at finding the items I walked in for, and could use some help. Or at least a hello from the staff. I don't get either one. My last visit on Sunday was no different. I went in for a specific spice called Bombay 5 spice, and couldn't locate it. Once I found someone, he led me to the item and then went back to the cafe side. After a few minutes of making other selections, I waited at the register to check out. It was like I was invisible. I finally went over to one of the staff and asked if I could pay for my items. After a few more minutes waiting, he came over and accepted my money.

They almost always have what I am looking for, and they are closer to my home than any other market, so I continue to shop there. I just wish they were a little more helpful and friendly.
