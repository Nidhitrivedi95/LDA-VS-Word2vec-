HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A I am going out on a limb giving them 4 stars - but I feel obligated to.  We have ordered probably once a month since we moved to Shaker including an Uber Eats order.  Each time the food was perfect.  Exactly the same as the last time - no variations whatsoever.  As for the food, it is a milder Indian, probably tamed down a bit for us Americans.  Even their spicy isn't that spicy because they probably feel we can't take it.

Their lunchtime buffet is always good too, pretty reasonable for what you get.  

I would say my biggest gripe about Saffron Patch is the pricing - it ends up being about 12 -15 bucks more expensive for the same order elsewhere.  All that said, it's a good place we will continue to frequent as long as their quality holds up.
