scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg I have only ordered takeout- but the food is always amazing and prepared quickly. The host and servers there are very friendly and already remember us which makes us feel appreciated. I have only ordered vegetarian food, but the vegetable appetizer platter is great to share with one or two people! I highly recommend. The spice levels are also very good, medium is perfect to feel like you're eating real ethnic food and not bland Americanized Indian.

UPDATE: We have eaten in and the service is great. Much faster and friendlier than other Indian restaurants in Madison.
