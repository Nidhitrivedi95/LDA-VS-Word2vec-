pX7ftE5CySOa-5cpuJl_ZA My boyfriend and I came here on a whim before we went to see a movie at Studio Movie Grill (which has gross food and horrible seating btw) and I'm so happy we came here! Right when you walk into the restaurant you are hit with the most pleasant aroma of Indian spices. The inside is very well designed and the staff is very nice and helpful. We got two appetizers (samosas and the paneer 65) and one entree (chicken biryani) to share. The food was super flavorful and perfectly spicy! We both loved our food and thought that this place was probably the best Indian food we have ever had in AZ! I would HIGHLY recommend this place to eat for lunch or dinner. We will definitely be coming back!
