biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg By far my favorite Indian restaurant in Phoenix so far.  (And believe me, I've tried quite a few.)  I have had the lunch buffet here and dinner entrees.  The lunch buffet had a good variety and everything was tasty.  Typical Indian buffet, but done well.  For dinner, I first had to try my standard chicken tikka masala which was creamy with good flavor.  The tandoori chicken was very tender.  Naan was good as well.  Nothing special about the inside of the restaurant.  It just made the top of my list because I like the food the most.
