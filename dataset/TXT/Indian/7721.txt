6aDfalYZOkWzwtVRA2wYaA Outstanding food. We had beef shank, and goat stew. Both were fall-off the bone tender (Not an easy thing to do with goat), And both had delicious sauces. The gulpi (Cauliflower ) Was the best version of this dish I have ever had. All the staff were welcoming.  There's a buffet on Sundays which we will be back to try. For lovers of ethnic food this place is a must!!
