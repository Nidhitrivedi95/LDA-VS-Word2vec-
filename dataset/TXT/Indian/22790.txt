grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg 3.5 stars. Babu is my go-to place for cheap tasty Indian food. I've been here so many times for their lunch combo w/ chili chicken. Their chicken roti is quite good as well; it's stuffed w/ chicken, potatoes, and egg for only 3 bucks. 

Too bad they don't have seating; takeout only. And there's usually a line up but it moves fairly quickly.
