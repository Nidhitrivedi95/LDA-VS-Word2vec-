LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng I really enjoyed the restaurant during my first visit. I loved my vegetarian dish and thought they did a nice job with the renovations. The samosas were good and the naan, a little crispier than I like, but still good. I went for lunch today and it was not nearly as good. They were out of samosas but didn't inform us until it was pretty much time to get our entrees. My sister didn't get her mango lassi until well after we got our entrees (and we waited a long time for those) and only after we reminded the waiter. The waiter didn't apologize or anything for forgetting all about it. I got vegetable biryani and it was both very spicy and very salty. Not nearly as good as what I've had elsewhere. The raita was much thicker than what I've had and not refreshing. The waiter mumbled and seemed like he hated his job and was inattentive about everything. I asked for a to go container for my leftovers and even the container he brought was too small. The other people working there were more pleasant. The prices are expensive for lunch especially considering the long wait for food and poor service. I don't think we will go back.
