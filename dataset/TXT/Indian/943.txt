-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw My knowledge of Indian foods is unfortunatly minimal, I have to confess. But, i've been wanting to learn more, getting a few cookbooks and familiar with things I want to try. A -total- novice; but with Rani's World Foods, i'm -well- on my way to being an expert!

Yes, this place is CLEAN, bright, inviting and OMG...When you walk into the front doors, the intoxicating smell of exotic spices and deliciousness just hit you like a brick wall! I was in love! The spice selection totally floored me, I mean...I'd only read about asfodita, and now I know where to buy it! 

I want to be a bit different than all the other glowing posts Rani's has here, all about the food. (which is wonderful) But, all about the really unique hair products! I never knew there was such a thing as jasmine hair oil, untill seeing the vast selection at Rani's. These oils are mainly coconut-based, with jasmine extract for gorgeous fragrance. Some will have other natural ingredients for added benefits. I picked out 2, one was specifically for color-treated hair like I possess. After using my blow-dryer to style my hair, I use a small amount of this in my palm, and glide it down the hair shaft. The results are FANTASTIC, with the best part is it's -not- greasy! I was expecting my hair to look limp and nasty as the day went on, but it stays soft and shiny all day. Plus, it's VERY inexpensive to boot. The small bottle? $2.50. The large bottle, for color-treated hair? $6.00. I'm sold on this stuff!
