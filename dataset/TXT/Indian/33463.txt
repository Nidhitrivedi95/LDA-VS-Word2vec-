LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw The first time we ate here, about a month ago, we found the food decent and they accommodated a toddler pretty well (no small thing.) As a transplant from San Francisco, I was surprised at the prices -- comparable to higher-end SF Indian restaurants and nowhere near the tastiness.

Had two dishes: Chicken Makhani and a saag dish. Nothing knocked me out, but all was fine.

The second time we went there, last week on my birthday, we ended up walking out before they took our order. The waitress was in the weeds with only 2 tables and seemed to be preoccupied with computer problems. 

After sitting unacknowledged at our table for 15 minutes we finally left. If she'd made some sort of motion to let us know she'd be over we might have been more understanding, but we were hungry and not in the mood to be ignored.
