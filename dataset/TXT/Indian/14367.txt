c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg Went with my family for a special day out and I was greatly disappointed. We ordered chicken lollipops for starters with the rest of our meal. Gave our entire meal order at the same time cause it was hard to get a server to our table. We realized it would be a while before a server would come again to take our meal order. Well, the starters came much after the meal. Very disappointing! The food was ok but the service - wasn't good at all. People around us were upset too for the same reason. They just wanted to pay and get out after the long wait for food. Thought we wouldn't go there again.
