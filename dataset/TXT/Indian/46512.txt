SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A I love this place! The lunch buffet is a must do if you're anywhere in a 20-mile radius!  For about $12, you can sample some of the most unusual yet complimentary flavors you've ever experienced.  The service is excellent, the atmosphere is quiet (but not stuffy), and there's a real probability that you will leave uncomfortably full and totally satisfied.  I've never had to wait for a table, and if I'm in a rush, it is easy to get in & out in 20 minutes or less.  Some people might be tempted to grab a quick meal in the McDonald's at the leading edge of the parking lot, but those people probably couldn't appreciate the quality of this place anyway. :) 

If you're in town and love new things, you have GOT to give this place a try!  You'll soon be a regular, too!
