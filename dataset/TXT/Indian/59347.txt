z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA I've been here a good handful of times now and have had mixed experiences. I typically get a bowl with the paneer and tomato sauce. The food exhibits good flavor and spice (cilantro chutney). It seems they have issues with heating their food to serving temperature. Last night, my bowl was cold and I asked if they had a microwave (they don't).
