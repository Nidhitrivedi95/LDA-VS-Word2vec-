KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA the first time I ate here, it was just my husband and I, and we got the boneless chicken karahi and keema biryani. it was so amazing that my husband immediately commented that my DAD, who being Pakistani himself has very high standards for what is considered good Pakistani food, would even like this place. round two, we brought my parents, brother and some family friends visiting from Dallas here for lunch. 

we got lamb karahi, boneless chicken Peshawari karahi, brain masala, lahori channa and bihari kabab. let's just talk about their karahi for a second. considering that this dish is the restaurant's namesake, it completely lives up to the expectation. the karahi is brought out in actual karahis, first of all, and you can tell it's made fresh in individual batches. there is plenty of meat and it's coated in masala - not at all oily, like how karahis tend to be at other restaurants. the channa is super authentic and fresh, the brain very decadent and spicy, and the Bihari kabab tender with just the right amount of char on it. the naan here comes out hot and fresh out of the tandoor.

the service here  was supremely attentive. my family can be really high maintenance and has a lot of demands (for example, my brother wanted aaloo paratha and they were out, so the chef made us aaloo naan!) and Sara, the person who served us, was so courteous and very charming, made us laugh. the chef even came out to talk to us at my dad's request. if you're Pakistani and you want to eat some GOOD Pakistani food, cooked with care and made FRESH, go to Karahi Point.
