eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw You have 3 options at this place:
1. Order sweets to go
2. Order food a la carte and sit in a separate area from the AYCE buffet
3. Go for an AYCE buffet (~$24/person on weekends)

I only have experience ordering a la carte, so I'm not going to comment on the other 2, partly because I don't like Indian sweets (I'm biased) and partly because I didn't have a chance to properly experience their AYCE buffet. What I can tell you about their AYCE buffet is that they offer a nice selection of non-veg and veg options to choose from.

My food for a Thali came from the AYCE buffet. I was able to choose from 9-12 different kinds of veg options, including palak paneer, aloo gobi, lentils, malai kofta, etc. I found the selection quite comparable to other vegetarian Indian restaurants.

The service was good. No complaints. My only complaint is the cost of the Thali. $14 is way overpriced for a Thali. $8-$9 would've been a more reasonable price to charge for it.

Would I go back? Possibly, but there are quite a few very good options in Brampton when it comes to Indian food, so I might as well pass on Brar's next time.
