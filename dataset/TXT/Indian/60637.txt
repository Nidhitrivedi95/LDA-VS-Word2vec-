zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q My co-workers and I saw the reviews of this place and planed a day to drive to this place to pick up food! We are foodies and love finding new and local places to return over and over again. I am sad to report that this is not a place we will be returning to again. The food is just A-OK. As one of my co-workers stated, it was just plain spicy but the flavors or lack there of leave much to be desired. The portions where huge, I give them that, but we each paid about $17 bucks for an order of flavorless chicken tikka masala  and vegetable byriany. We just expected the food to be homey, aromatic, and flavorful and sadly we did not find any of that in the food we received.
