LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Wow.  If there is such thing is dosa heaven, this is it!  I ordered one of the trademarked (this is SERIOUS business guys) dosas, the coriander one was just the right amount of crisp and refreshing.  The vadas and idlis were on point.  Vadas were perfectly fried, the idlis perfectly steamed, and the coconut chutney was fresh and delicious.  I also ordered the ginger lassi, which was an intriguing combination of flavours - spicy and salty, yet slightly sour as well.  Service was very accommodating, but once it started getting busy we were shooed out.  

Side note: we went at 6PM on a Tuesday night, which was not so busy, but when 7 hit it started getting pretty jam packed.  I only shudder to think what it might be like on a weekend.  

Tons of parking in the strip mall.
