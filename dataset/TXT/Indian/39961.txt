pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Food is great! I got lamb chops, very well marinated and taste very soft. But service could be better, since it's a restaurants. We called ahead to check if they have tables available and wanted to make reservation, they ignore it. When we came, place was full of people and the long line at the door. That's ok. We waited. Find hair in my appetizer... Wine was too warm. But very satisfied with my food! Probably will give another chance and visit this place someday again.
