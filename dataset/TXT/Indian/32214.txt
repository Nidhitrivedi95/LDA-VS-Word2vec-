LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Solid choice for a good weekend buffet. The price on the weekends is $11.95, and it includes soda, or one glass of champagne. Weekday prices do not include drinks but are cheaper.

The spread here had a nice variety of meaty and vegetarian dishes. Such entrees included mutter paneer, chicken curry, goat curry, chicken makhani, mushroom curry, an unusual butternut squash curry (Quite tasty! I love butternut squash), aloo palak, dal makhani, tandoori chicken, and chana masala. Fried items included potato pakora and vegetable samosa. There was a diverse salad bar, 2 different types of chaat, and various condiments like mint chutney. Dessert consisted of mango pudding, kheer (rice pudding), and gulab jamun. The gulab jamun was decent, but more hard and dense tasting than others I've had. 

In addition to the soda or champagne, there is a self serve mango lassi station which was quite nice. There is also a crock of tomato soup and a cooker filled with rice. Another plus about this restaurant is that they will make fresh, hot off the oven naan for you in a basket. Tasty!

Service was great and drinks + plates were refilled and taken away as needed.

Overall, a good experience, and the food itself was decent. Go for the great deal for what you get, and the variety of dishes.
