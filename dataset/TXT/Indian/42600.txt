Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ Great BYOW Indian place on St-Laurent. The palak paneer was delicious and very flavorful. The meat was on the dry side though (we had the butter chicken), but the sauce was perfect. Naan bread was fluffy yet crispy, and I would recommend picking coconut rice 100%.
Do try the 2 specialty desserts: ras malai which is like a crustless cheesecake in sweet cream, and gulab jamun which is a honey-soaked fried ball of dough. SO. GOOD.

I now want to try everything on their menu.
