rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ Our group of 4 was really excited to try this highly rated resto....and while some of my dining partners would have liked to give this place a 4, I feel 3 is fair all things considered.  It was a pleasant enough meal but there was nothing in it to surprise or impress me.  Every thing was OK to good.  A number of dishes were "too saucy" according to the vegetarian in our group and just about everything we tried was "too rich", to quote our resident carnivore. Over an hour after we finished our meal, hubby and I were still feeling very bloated. 

We did try a lot of the dishes: String chat - meh - "too saucy"; Chicken 65 - nice spicing but a bit too salty and way too fatty; South Indian Vegetable curry - pretty good; Butter chicken - nice but a bit too rich and too sweet; Punjabi chicken curry - good; Beef vindaloo - interesting take on the dish, sauce too rich and again too sweet; French beans were quite nice; plain naan was good (but lots of places make good naan). We had lattes and cappuccino at the end- the lattes were weak but the cap was "really good" according to hubby. The chocolate torte at the end got mixed reviews - hubby and I thought it was "just OK" but our friends raved about it!

Service was excellent; decor and vibe were really terrific.  Acoustics were a bit problematic - we had to lean in quite closely to hear one another.  So yeah, it was a pleasant evening out with friends.
