7IF5cjvH1d97pzvYPnf9Mg We made a reso on valentines day (same day) and they accommodated us without any problem. We got to the restaurant and it was packed! But we were seated right away and ordered rather quickly. Drinks and app came fast but there was a longer period of time waiting for the main courses. Yes, it was valentines and they were busy, we get it. The staff had always a smile on their faces and most important, the food was really good and the prices were very reasonable. Samosas, lamb tikka, lamb roli, pulao, garlic naan, indian beer (cheetah, really good, you should try it!) and mango lassi ... Everything was really flavourful and the portions are quite big, we had leftovers. Next time we have to try the chicken tamarind because it looked amazing on the table next to us. One more thing, the place is quite tiny and cozy, they could do without one or two tables as they were very close together, so much so that my husband ended up accidentally elbowing the waitress in her derriere and the couple two tables down from us upon getting up from their table practically took the entire place setting of the empty table between us, with them.

We definitely recommend this restaurant to lovers of indian food!
