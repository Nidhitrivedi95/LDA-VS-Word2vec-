eiRH93Z6CbVekyyiE0BZFw Overrated and weird.  You don't order at the food truck.  You order inside.  Then when the food is ready you have to pick it up at the truck.  We got burritos because they didn't have rice to get one of their indian dishes.  The burrito was just ok.  In my opinion, No better than let's say a taco bell or something.  I've had much much better food truck food.
