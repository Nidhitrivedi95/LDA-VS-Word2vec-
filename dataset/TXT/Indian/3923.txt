0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw I love this place so much. I live in the West Valley but I eat here almost every time I'm in Tempe. They gave me a coupon for the buffet, which is 2 for $16 for the buffet and includes free soft drinks. That's literally $8 a person for a delicious endless Indian buffet, which is amazing! They also bring out wonderful naan to your table. 

By the way, half the buffet is vegetarian friendly! Definitely support them, you won't be disappointed!
