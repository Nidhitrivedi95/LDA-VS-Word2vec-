eJWTlUL96op0xa8dVPIGzw I will preface this by saying that I have been to 2 other Bombay Bhel restaurants many times.

I came here to take my family of 5 out for dinner on a Saturday night.

Their heating was not working, so we ended up being very cold the whole time. They didn't play any music in the restaurant and the restaurant was at half capacity, so it was very quiet.

We each ordered a thali. The waiter was helpful and able to take our orders, including some special requests we had. Normally a table is given papad in the same way restaurants typically give a basket of bread. However, we had to flag down a busboy after waiting 30 minutes to be given some.

Our thali took 45 minutes to be served. They gave them to us without the naan, which took another 5 minutes to be served. The portions themselves were less than at other Bombay Bhels. Some of the containers were filled ~60% full, and their reasoning was that "some customers waste so we don't fill all the way". Some of the servings were warm, where we would expect it to be hot. The dal was unusually sweet.

When we finished, we asked for a takeaway container to take our leftovers and the busboy gave us attitude.

Overall, we will definitely not come back to this particular location. If it wasn't for us going to Bombay Bhel locations for years we would have not visited another location ever again.
