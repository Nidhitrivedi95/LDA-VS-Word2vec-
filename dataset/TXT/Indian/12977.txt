b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw I've been ordering takeout from Namaste the last couple of years, and it is reliably wonderful. It's not your traditional average Indian food - everything is just a little bit better. Their paneer tastes fresher, saag is ground a little more smoothly, and they don't rely too much on butter/ghee to make the dishes rich/heavy. Their food is more rich and light. It's enough to make anyone who doesn't like vegetables want to eat them all the time! I don't think I've ever regretted ordering from there. They deliver on Grubhub which is very convenient.
