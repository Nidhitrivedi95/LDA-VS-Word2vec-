Ksk5cLav4OtbUtpRGp5b4g India's Cafe & Kitchen is appropriately named.  The restaurant doesn't have much seating, but its kitchen is huge and supports an active take out and catering service.

The restaurant also doesn't waste effort on pretense.  In fact, it gets negative pretense points because the silverware is plastic, and the food is served on disposable plates.  Instead, the kitchen produces food that tastes great.  I'm by no means an Indian food aficionado, but I've always enjoyed the dishes at this restaurant and consistently drive from Cleveland Heights to eat here.

The weekend lunch buffets are not bad but leave something to be desired.  The selection is not extensive - a couple of vegetarian and a couple of meat dishes.  Customer volume is low, so the pakora can get soggy.  For lunch buffet I might recommend India Garden in Rocky River.

I like to patronize this restaurant for its good food and very nice and down to earth owner.  Pass on the buffet and order fresh.  Highly recommended Indian food for dine in or take out.
