86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ The food here is very much laughable compared to numerous of other Indian restaurants in the city. Sure inside is very modern, but no one's there for the decor. People who are not used to indian food could find this place good, but those who know indian food won't step feet inside. They also include gratuity themselves for 4 people - what. the. heck. 
Will not come back unless the city ever goes blackout and by some miracle this is the only restaurant in ontario that has lights.
