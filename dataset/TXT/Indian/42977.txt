rGAv357wiAolbMnmHLLc2w I have to admit, the food here is the best.  Their food is not oily like other Indian restaurants and I find the food very flavorful. I have had the aloo vindaloo, matar paneer, paneer makhani, chappati, chat papri, channa masala, samosas, and the kulfi. All were pretty good. Some of this food I ordered for delivery and the service is friendly and quick. The decor is nice inside. It looks like a place you can bring a date.
