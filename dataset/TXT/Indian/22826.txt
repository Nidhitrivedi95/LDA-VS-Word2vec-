grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg This is a great place for Sri Lankin/Indian take-out food. It's a bit chaotic inside but the staff are always willing to explain the different dishes available. Some of my favourites include chicken kothu rotti (ask for it spicy and it will taste like amazing fire) which is like a densely packed stir fry dish, the dosha which is a crepe-like shell wrapped with curry potatoes accompanied by curry dipping sauces, and most of their curries are delicious (chana, paneer, butter chicken, spicy chicken curry, etc). Plus their food is NOT oily. Some indian places have a icky layer of oil on their curries.

However, I do not like their Singapore style shrimp noodles which they claim are the best in the city (trust me, it's not, go to a Chinese-singapore place instead) and their string hoppers which are like blobs of sticky vermicelli noodles.

Babu is located in the back of a strip plaza in north east Scarborough and it's definitely worth a trip to try it.
