hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw This review is more about the experience than the food. I ordered the Veggie Basil Curry. Now when I order something with that title I assume it will consist of mostly vegetables and a few other things maybe. Well imagine my surprise when I get home with my takeout, open the container and find a couple tomatoes 1 piece of potato and the rest is all beans, meaning everything in it was a legume. Due to the fact that I can not eat legumes at ALL right now, I could not partake in what smelled fantastic. I just wish I had known that it was not actually vegetables, and I would have simply ordered a different menu item.
