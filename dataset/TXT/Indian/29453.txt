JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ If you are looking for excellent vegetarian, Indian food you MUST visit The Woodlands.  I have never had a bad dish here, whether it was eat-in, took-out or on the buffet.  Mind you, don't come here for the ambiance as this no-nonsense restaurant is meager in terms of the dining space, but who cares when the food is incredible!  Plus, they have many organic versions of their most popular items, appetizers to desserts.  I went back to look at the menu for specific recommendations, but I've never had anything on under "Curry" that I didn't love, but I must say their Kadai Bhindi is off the chain!  Oh, and when they say the Vegetable Vindaloo is spicy, they ARE NOT JOKING!  At least two-alarm.  The weekend buffet at LUNCH (they do not have a dinner buffet) is such a deal at $8.95-$9.95.  It's well worth the drive to East Charlotte where folks are just now beginning to figure out how "true" the food is at the ethnic restaurants over there!
