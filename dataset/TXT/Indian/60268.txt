ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I and my boyfriend were here for dinner. They gave us little snack thing with sauces for an appetizer, and my boyfriend was almost about to eat yellow RUBBER BAND that was inside of a sauce. So we complained about it, it was disgusting as hell and was about to harm my bf's health. Saying sorry and letting kitchen staffs know this.. that was it. Be careful when you guys eat here! I left fairly enough amount tip for them for wishing them to be careful.
