yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I would go all five stars but yes, as I am not very picky knowing you can't get perfect with buffet style, the food could be stirred up a little. NO BIG DEAL folks! 

I thought it was very clean and I enjoyed the atmosphere of the music and how helpful everyone was. I am an Italian who knows good tasting food. This stuff was delicious. If people go here expecting typical buffets with a bunch of treats and meats you are crazy and don't belong writing shitty reviews. 

I have seen this place a few times as it is next door to my fav Pawn Shop that my friend works at. I went in and enjoyed the lunch buffet had great service and will def go back again.

Didn't know the owners son works the front but i would like to pass along the thanks for the hospitality and service. 
Keep up the good work!
