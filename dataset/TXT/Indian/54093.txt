VrftSduLIducNfEzITOL5A Just finished eating here, I usually don't write reviews but I really enjoyed the food and the customer service! We usually eat at Regency Restaurant a few stores down, but their service has drastically decreased over the years (closes at 11, but refuse service past 10:30). Glad my friend and I stopped here tonight. This will be our new favorite place for buffet.
