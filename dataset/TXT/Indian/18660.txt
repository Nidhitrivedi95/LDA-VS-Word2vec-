eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Not happy with this restaurant at all. Placed an order for take-out, and every single dish had an issue. We ordered paneer & potato masalas and palak aloo. Unfortunately, the best part of our meal was the plain basmati rice. Our masalas were made with the most disgusting over-microwaved potatoes I have ever consumed. The sauce was pretty good, but a little too sweet and since the potatoes were rubbery, tough and dark, it made it difficult to eat. The palak was even worse. We had to keep removing some ingredient that was woody and fibrous from the sauce. It was under salted, extremely bitter and tasted more like ginger and cream rather than spinach. I love ginger, but this was so overwhelmingly bad. For some odd reason, the potatoes in our palak were not microwaved like the masala was. I know that the paneer & potato masala is not on their menu, but I'd much rather them say that they cannot make it rather than give me something so awful. I'd expect so much better after paying $60 bucks. Sucks since this is the closest Indian restaurant by far. I'll just have to drive the distance next time. Boo.
