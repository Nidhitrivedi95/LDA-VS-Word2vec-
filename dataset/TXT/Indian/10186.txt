9MpWhQOYziJ38EB7MctxcA I usually don't prefer to give negative review, but I changed my mind  after  yesterday's visit to this restaurant  .
 I ordered malai kofta  and garlic naan , my husband order chicken biriyani both were dreadful   . One of the staff who was serving us  , he asked  me about  taste   , I told  him  Panner rolls in the curry wasn't cooked at all ,gravy is pretty bland and I don't prefer to eat . he said that he  would check with chef and guess what his  answer is  " This is the unique taste for this dish here "   and he left that's it ,he showed up again after we paid the check . 
My husband asked Rita(most of the indian restaurants would give this side for biriyani)   ,they surprised me adding this  to the check for 3.50bucks ,we thought this was free and the staff who took the order  never mentioned it is chargable .
 After spending over 45 bucks I had to leave with empty stomach .  After my hellish experience I would really suggest any one to think twice before heading to this place
