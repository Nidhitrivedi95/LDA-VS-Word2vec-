Food stinked really bad.
Me and my girlfriend were sitting in the waiting area for 10min to be seated then another couple came after we have already waited for 10min and the host got them seats and when I asked the host that what's going on his reply was(in a VERY rude tone): "Wait outside i will be with you soon". Then he finally called us in and there was no apology whatsoever but we were hungry so I was like never mind. He said we have a buffet going on and you can help yourself, so we did. Now when got to the buffet station something STINKED really bad, I didn't realize it was the food that was stinking, I thought it must be something they used in the mop or other but then we took the food back to our table and I ate one bite of the naan with alloo mattar and I figured right away what was stinking. I told my girlfriend to not eat the food because we don't want to get sick. I asked the same rude guy to get me our check because whatever they do, even if they are serving old food, I made the call to go to this restaurant because we got lured in by the decorations outside the business so I still want to pay them, regardless of how much it is. They guy asked me what happened I told him that the food stinks, I ate a bite and I know you're serving old food and you know that too but for now, just get me my check so that we can clear our dues and still not get sick. He said ohh in that case you leave the food and just go, I asked him are you sure? He said yes and I am sorry. We walked away, just because he didn't charge us and apologized for serving old food and acknowledging it I am giving 2 stars. If you consume old food, especially old Indian food which is mostly curry based it will make you sick in a giffy and that's not right. I even checked in while I was there and even took a photo.
