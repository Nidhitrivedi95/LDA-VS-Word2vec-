Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w To start out, I can only really rate the food as I have only ever used the carry out option. As far as that goes, the experience I had was excellent. The food was ready on time, order was correct, and everything was hot and smelled wonderful.  It was everything someone can hope for when ordering food for carry out. 

Now onto the food, quality of the dishes was great, and the overall flavor was intense. I do mean intense, I have never seen my friend or I go through so much water in one meal.  It was actually quite hilarious, because the first few bites it was "alright, this isn't too bad" few minutes later "I might be regretting this". So it is a slow burning heat that strikes with a vengeance. Thank goodness for the marvelous Naan and rice. This is my cautionary tale for anyone who is on the fence and worried about heat or has a low heat tolerance.
