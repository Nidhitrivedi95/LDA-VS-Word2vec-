0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg Bullshit place. Fucking expensive for the amount and quality of food. It is self service, you have to clean the table yourself when you find one. They make you wait unnecessarily for so long, So that once you are fucking hungry you like anything you eat. 
Even the quality restaurants with FULL service doesn't charge this much. 
They have very small glasses for drinking water and since it is a self service you have to make few trips to water fountain struggling with others in that small place. 
Absolutely not recommended.
