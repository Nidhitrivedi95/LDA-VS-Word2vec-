TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw The food was good. I had keema nann, samosa, and a keema curry. It all tasted great. I thought the service was a bit rude and lazy.  I was standing out in front of my hotel waiting for them. I missed one call from the driver (who was not there yet) because my phone only rang once. I then got a nasty text from the manager saying he tried to reach me multiple times to say they were on the way.  I called them back to say I was already out front waiting (even though they said they would just call when they got there). When the driver arrived he did not even bother getting out of his car. He just honked his horn at me to come over and handed me my good threw the passenger window. I did not even have a chance to top them.
