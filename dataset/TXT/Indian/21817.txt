gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Great food!!  The best fresh pita I've ever had, and the rest of my meal (chicken gyros and hummus, with kulfi for dessert) was really good, too.  It's basically a little hole in the wall joint, but with enough decorations and stuff to make it feel rather homey.  The staff was friendly enough, but then I am a single white woman so that might have made a difference, as per the other reviews.  I would recommend this spot for a good quick bite when downtown!  Man cannot live on 99cent shrimp cocktails, ya know...
