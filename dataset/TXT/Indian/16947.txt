DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Second time here and unfortunately service is horrible. They need more staff for dinner. Been at my seat now for ten minutes and not even water. 

The food was good then hopefully it does not disappoint this time. 

Hopeful!!!  ^_^

Initially gave 2 stars

Update:
Service got a little better because the placed cleared out a little. Food is good so will return.
Upping to 4 stars.
