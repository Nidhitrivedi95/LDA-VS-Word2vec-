g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Me and my husband like the boneless chicken biryani from here.its very tasty and spicy. We have tried samosa chat ,samosa,vada pav,dahi batata puri,chicken tikka pizza , everythig is good and reasonably prized.
In main course we have tried non beg combo,vijaywada biryani,keema biryani,fish biryani. Loved all of these.their pastries are soft moist and yummy too.
I would highly recommend if anyone wants to try chat and biryanis and pastries.
We ordered our daughter's birthday cake. With frozen theme from here.it was expensive but very very tasty.my daughter still talks about her cake how yummy it was.
Service is good and staff is good and helpful.
