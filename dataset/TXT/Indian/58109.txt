yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This place has now become my favorite Indian spot.

I have to express, again, that their system of placing a reservation is very needed and essential. Parking is extremely limited in the area (as it's a shopping center as well). I noticed a couple come in without a reservation, and were sort of put off by it.  They do have a little seating area if you forget, and wait time seems to be about 10-15 minutes or so...

That aside, let's talk about the food:

I always leave VERY full here, with leftovers for the next day.
Their Kormas are divine. I will recommend the vegetarian option as it comes with cashews and golden raisins...a little spicy, sweet, and tart, and savory --- basically a perfect meal.
The girls (servers) here are efficient, without being pushy, and attend to each table flawlessly. 

It gets an extra star from me, today, for the decor. Restaurants really underestimate the power of nice surroundings. The Dhaba definitely took this into consideration when selecting the tableware, the lighting options, tables ect.

Oh, and P.S. get the Groupon, or check in on yelp/foursquare to score some amazing deals (I don't know why they keep doing this, because they're giving away food for free...but yeah, ya know, not complaining at the moment).
