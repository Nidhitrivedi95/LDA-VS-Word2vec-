kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I have been here multiple times and the chicken tikka masala never disappoints. Also had the butter chicken tonite and it was equally as good. The chicken kabob appetizer was also on point. The garlic naan is great too. The service is fast and pleasant. It's my go to Indian restaurant for sure.
