NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg This place is honestly so amazing. I can't get enough. I always get the chicken tikka and an order of the samosas and every time I am more than satisfied. The best part? I never feel sick after! The food tastes really fresh and high quality. Kudos, Choolaah! You make a hell of a product. The building is also awesome-great atmosphere.
