RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA Very tasty Indian restaurant in a good location near the University. Red Fort has decent prices, and student specials are available for both lunch and dinner. We were a large group of about 20 people, but we all managed to squeeze into the reasonably small restaurant. We were given a two-course set menu, and the choice was good enough for everyone to be satisfied.

I had vegetable pakora starter and chicken korma main course. I feel the main course portion could have been bigger, but both dishes tasted great. Staff were quite helpful and efficient, and it was a BYOB setup, so we had plenty of beer and wine with us. 

Will be back and would recommend.
