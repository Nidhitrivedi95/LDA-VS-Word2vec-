NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Overall very impressed with this place! They did fast food Indian right with a very affordable menu. The decor is super trendy including a hand washing spa and a very confusing pop machine. 

The food was overall well cooked...we tried the chicken tikka plate which was very flavorful, next I want to try the salmon tikka. The chaat was also delicious. The biriyani was only so-so (I wouldn't recommend). The sides were pretty good...some at our table thought the lentils were bland but I liked it. 

Will definitely be back and am looking forward to other potential locations!
