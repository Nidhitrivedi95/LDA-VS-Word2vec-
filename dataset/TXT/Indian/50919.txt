uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw If you're in mood of Biryani, this is amongst the best you will get !! We have tasted many but keep returning to this one. 
They have several combos available with curries as well. Honesty not much of a fan of their curries but a die hard fan of their Biryani, it comes in Mild and Spicy, so you can pick as per your taste as well. Each Biryani costs $7.50+ taxes, higher than the average take out joints. The quantity is good and makes worth the price. 
They also have Paratha Rolls, again they are good but not to compare with Biryani. The Parathas are oily and heavy as well. Try the Chicken Chutney Roll but avoid the Cheese Roll, it was too greasy the last time we had it. 
If you are doing take out, many a times they may not pick up the call as they are very busy but keep trying, they are open till late as well. 
Dining wise they have good seating, the staff is cooperative as well. 
To sum it up, a great place and excellent Biryani !!!
