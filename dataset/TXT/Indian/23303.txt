gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Ok folks, I'm not an employee nor was I compensated for this review. This was my first time here and this place is absolutely going on my return visit list.

OMG, this place is amaze-balls! If you're lookin for some down home Indian cuisine, this IS the place. The food wasn't too spicey but you can talk to a server and have em dial it up, I'm sure.

For the price and quality, you cannot beat this place!
