The food prices are economical.
Food taste was awesome.
Service was quick
Staff was friendly.
Not a great atmoshphere but food was excellent and tht's all wht matters.
Beleive me the overall experience was much better then India Palace (rated no. 1 indian resturant in Vegas......hunh)

Highly Recommended.....
