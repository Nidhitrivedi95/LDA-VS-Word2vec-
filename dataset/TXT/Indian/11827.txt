arP20rlnrGuX1Xker6xPzw I got the mega scoop sundae (4 scoops) for $6.78. The flavours were there and definitely not artificial. I had the chocolate, pistachio, strawberry and mango. It came with green and red jelly at the bottom and was topped with peanuts. However, the scoops were very small!!! For 7 bucks I was expecting a lot more in quantity! There were also other savoury sri lankan snacks on the other counter of the store. Maybe I'll try them next time since the ice cream wasn't really worth the money.
