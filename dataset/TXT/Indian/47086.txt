Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Great food and great service. We had tadka dal, palak paneer, malai kofta and naan and everything was excellent. 

I accidentally left my card and when I realized it ~18 hours later, I was able to call and get it back quickly. Will definitely visit again next time I am in Cleveland!
