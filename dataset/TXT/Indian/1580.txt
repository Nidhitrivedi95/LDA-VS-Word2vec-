-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA After staying away from this place for 2.5 months, we decided to give it one last try. We have been back thrice since. We now really like the food here, mainly south indian, haven't had time to try other stuff. Dosas, Uthappams, Idiyappam (rice noodles), Kurma are all very good. Loved the Gobi Manchurian, but not a fan of the fried rice served with it. Parotta was very hard and oily. Service has definitely improved, but could be better. 3.5 stars overall. If you don't know what to get, dosas are the safest and tastiest option :)
