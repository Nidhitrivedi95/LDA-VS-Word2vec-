S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Lots of tasty vegetarian dishes even though I'm a meat lover, I was quite surprised that the lunch buffet was more than enough. Spices were just right, flavorful and a plethora of dishes including dessert. I would have given it a 4-star but the location and atmosphere needs improvement. Be prepared to walk away satisfied and extremely full.
