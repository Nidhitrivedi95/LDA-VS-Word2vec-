gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg I live right across the street from Charkha and I was ecstatic when it opened up. I've eaten there three times now and I was very impressed every time. Their vindaloo is excellent (and very spicy!), their Daal is very authentic, and they make amazing Samosas. I was a little disappointed in the Pakoras, but everything else has been spot-on. The food is quick, the service is great, and it's nice and spacious inside. Absolutely worth a try if you're in the warehouse district. I recommend it!

The service is good, too; we ordered some appetizers to put out at a party we were having and they gave us free rice pudding.

As a note, it is still getting put together, empty TV brackets in a few spots, and there is a bar but they haven't worked out the liquor license yet as of this writing.
