llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I have been eating here regularly since I discovered how amazing their food is a few years ago. It has been one of the few Indian food places I've found in Arizona that compares to my favorite place from Seattle.
I cannot speak highly enough about their food and I love the staff.
My favorite dish is the malai kofta.
