svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w We've been coming here for years, and it is my favourite place for dosas in Toronto! Easy access via the TTC, which, given how good the dosas are at SIDMR, makes the trek from downtown to Gerrard Street not worth it. You can do just as well here.

The dosas are wonderful, the curries perfectly flavourful, and the service exceptionally friendly. Like other small restaurants in Toronto it has the feel of eating in someone's house, which is a nice thing here since the staff is very pleasant. The bright pink paint is really cheerful making it a place that I like to come when I'm feeling down or stressed. But it is the food that is so wonderful -- we've tried many different kinds of dosas and have enjoyed them all.

Also, since the remodel last summer, the traffic flow between the take-out counter and the restaurant is better, making the eat-in dining experience more pleasant than before.
