jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Disappointed with the Butter Chicken, there is more flavor in the frozen dish you can buy  from Trader Joe's, also the quantity I received for 16 dollars was insufficient. The Dal soup was bland and somewhat sad compared to what I've eaten before. My appetizer and Mango Lassi were good but sad to say if I'm buying, I would not eat here again.
