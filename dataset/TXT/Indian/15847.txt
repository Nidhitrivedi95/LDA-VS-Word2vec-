d6XiEFppPRpj5AZk_VzWZA If I could give no stars I would. The food was horrible and made my family sick for two whole days after. Firstly too much salt in the doubles and aloo pie. Aloo pies were flat and not stuffed enough. Also we asked for everything on it(chutney,pepper) and barely got any in the doubles. Literally we couldn't see anything of what we asked for was put in. The roti(buss up shut) was a joke and dry and cut from a bigger piece. So we got a piece of a roti. We certainly will not be returning. They have sacrificed quality for quantity.
