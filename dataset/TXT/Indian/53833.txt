VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ To preface this review, I am a food snob. I have eaten at some of the top restaurants in the country. So I'm not being overly nice or naive in my review. There was no odor to the restaurant, the service was great and I loved the food. In the top three Indian meals I have had. I have eaten here multiple times and the experience has been consistent each time. The tikka masala, karahi and naan are very good. Ignore the hateful reviews and give it a try. This place and the people are great.
