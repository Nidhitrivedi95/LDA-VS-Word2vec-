TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Having just moved to Vegas and missing my favourite Indian restaurant back home, we gave India Palace a try, using  a restaurants.com  coupon.
We started with appetizer plate - 5 appetizers of your choice.  I had a lichi martini and my hubby ordered the beer recommended by our waiter.  Everything was awesome! 
We then ordered Lamb Rogan Josh and Goat Curry, basmati rice and garlic naan.
It was all sooooo good!  Very fresh, very flavourful.  Nice, clean restaurant, with lovely atmosphere and wonderful wait staff.  Waiter then directed us to YELP for the coupon here.
Can't wait for my next craving!
