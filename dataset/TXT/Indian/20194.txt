This place has been a favorite for me and my wife since we stumbled on to it back in 2010 when we were planning our wedding at a nearby hall.  We don't live anywhere close to this place, but we will go out of our way and travel here when we have a craving for Indian food.  The quality of the food and selection is amazing considering how little you're paying, the service is good but could be a little slow when the place fills up--which is to be expected.  The atmosphere is pretty casual, although I'm not a huge fan of the led lighting...it gives the place a cold look.  The place is always filled with sounds and sights of Bollywood via the televisions which play back-to-back Indian music videos.
This is an ideal place to take someone that is new to Indian food as the selection is plentiful.
