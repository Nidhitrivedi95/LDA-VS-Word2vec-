VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ We had a really nice time here. We used the on the floor seating tucked intimately away from the main dining area. It was really, really nice. Quiet, private, and relaxed. We watched an Indian crime drama on the TV hung over the bar while dining on a large wooden table with our feet stretched out beneath.  

The food was great. Some of the rice was scorched, but we ordered extra so it was a non-issue. I had vindaloo at "medium" spice, but was actually very mild. I am not complaining. I am sure they could have killed me with spice if I'd asked for it. Most vindaloos that I have had suffer from taste to spice ratio. The less the spice, the flatter the taste. Guru Palace did not have this problem. The flavor was there, but not the spice. 

I would recommend this place for dining. I don't know about their buffet. For dinner -- especially as a date--, sitting in the "on-the-floor" seating section, it was special.
