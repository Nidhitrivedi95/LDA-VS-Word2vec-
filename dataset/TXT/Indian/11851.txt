AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ I came here with high expectations on a unique fusion culinary experience. Ended up very disappointed. Place had a handful of customers. You'll see why: Dishes are overly simple, no twist and a lack of flavor. Selection of beers was scarce too. We had the stuffed mushrooms as appetizer and the  malai meatball and the channa masala tacos as mains. The 2 instead of 1.5 is because our server was good. Would never eat here again. I think the place has potential. I'll give you that.
