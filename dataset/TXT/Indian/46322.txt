sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I haven't been here in so long... they're a short block away from the bike workshop where I volunteer in the summer, and sometimes I'll treat myself to a roti on the way home. One roti is three lunches for me, I am not kidding. Saag paneer is my favourite. (They also have an amazing bhel puri, if you want more than a roti.)

I've ordered mild and gotten very very mild so that I could not detect the spice; but I've also ordered medium and gotten something that strips the paint off my tongue. Crazy white girl who thinks she's a pepperhead...

I may have to take a trip out there this winter sometime, even though I'm hardly ever over there outside of bike season.
