yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw While the food is excellent, service is slow and the kitchen slower.  We have been here many times but won't be back.  Had a 6:30 reservation and didn't get out until 8:30!  After being seated, it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our order.  We waited over half an hour to have the food brought to our table.  Restaurant needs more waitstaff and more people in the kitchen.  VERY SLOW and inefficient.
