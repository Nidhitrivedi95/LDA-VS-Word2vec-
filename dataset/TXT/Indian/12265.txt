auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I've eaten here three times now.  It's close to my house.  The food is great.  The service sucks.  I had the lunch buffet this time.  I was dropped at my table and asked what kind of naan I wanted, given some water then didn't see anyone else until I got someone's attention for the check.  Go here if you want good food and aren't put off by bad service.
