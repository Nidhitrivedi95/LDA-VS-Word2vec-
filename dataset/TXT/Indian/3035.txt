0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw BOTTOM LINE: Seemed more "Chinese" than Hakka, but damn, those chicken pakoras really hit the spot!

Cost:
-$15-25 for dinner (tax and tip included)

Atmosphere/Decor:
-Typical asian decor: drabby but functional.

Ordered:
-We asked the owner/chef to make recommendations because it was the first time we had Hakka cuisine.

1. Chicken pakoras - The best thing recommended!  Juicy, fried chicken balls with a crunchy outside and tandoori-esque inside.

2. Fried paneer with green chutney - I generally like paneer dishes, 
but this one seemed a bit stale.

3. Crispy ginger chicken - Tasted more like "General's Tao's" chicken and had a bit too much breading.  

4. Szechuan chowmein - Labelled as a "Hakka" dish, but I couldn't taste the curry.  It was more like your standard Chinese noodle dish.

Service:
-Owner/chef was friendly and open.  No complaints.

Conclusion:
-Overall a good introduction to Hakka cuisine (especially those chicken pakoras), but now I'm really curious to try the "better" ones talked about in uptown.
