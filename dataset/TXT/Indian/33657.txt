lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw We decided to try out this new restaurant that opened up as the decor was quite nice - cute touches of details on the walls highlighting the origin and inspiration for the food. It seemed to be a family operation. The young lady working at the counter was enthusiastic and cheerful but inexperienced and confused when we asked for her recommendations and in bringing the food to the right table when the food was ready.  We ordered the chicken frankie - this was unfortunately very bland, the haddock - the fish was fresh but again, very bland.  The gunpowder fries were good but the basmati rice side dish was unimpressive (the rice was clumpy and the lentil sauce on top was again, bland). The mango lassi was okay - it just tasted like mango keffir and not the full on mango flavour you usually get at other Indian restaurants.  Perhaps worth trying after they have settled into their new space a little more and let them work out their new opening kinks.
