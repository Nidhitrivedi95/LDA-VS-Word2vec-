kkNWzhSpAjxm0zIxol3IzQ This place is pretty good. The portions are very generous and everything tastes homemade and is VERY well spiced. I had the vegetable dum biryani, which came with an egg, the corn appetizer, and the gobi manchurian. Everything was delicious. I picked it up to take home, so now sure how the service is, but they looked pretty busy and got everything out on time. The food is HEAVY (as most Indian food tends to be), so this isn't some place I would come often, but it's probably my favorite Indian place in Westlake.
