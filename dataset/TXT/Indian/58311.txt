Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g I ordered deliver last night and got the combo with chicken curry.  It took me 20mins to sift through the sauce and pick out over 20 little pieces of shards of chicken bones and cartilage. The eggplant that came with it was so mushy and almost cold that i didn't eat it. The other side was a yellow paste that was over salted. The samosa were good (but hard to screw up really!) thank god because it was the only thing i was able to eat in the order
