RJMblVTTzmEefL8Cge_TrQ Ordered the 6 cheese grilled cheese which comes with fries.  First time, the fries were cold to touch and the cheese was resolidified on the bread.  Had to send it back.  Fresh order came quick, fries were hot and cheese was melty.  Not worth the $14 hotel price. Their Cesar's are quite good with home made Clamato.  Service very friendly, but a little slow.  No discount offered for the cold food.  I'm staying at the hotel, otherwise, probably wouldn't eat here.
