Zcd2yYA5ck-38duDOg6dww Heard about this new little place from some colleagues and decided to go there for dinner. We reached around 7:30pm on Saturday evening and it was snowing. Finding a parking spot in this complex was a fight- which often is a good indication of restaurant's popularity. 

We stepped in and were welcomed by manager with a warm smile. Decor was very nice and trendy. They have a one page Menu with catchy dish-names. We ordered chilli panner, a tiffin and some kebab starters. 

Kebabs were warm and good in taste. I wish they were little more spicy and hot. I will give it 3 stars. They should serve some chutneys on the side which you would usually expect with kebabs.

Chilli paneer was not good as against my high expectations. I read other reviews and many ppl had recommended this dish. It was not spicy which contradicted the very nature of the dish. Panner was not as soft as one would expect in this dish. However, the one thing which put me off was the sauce- if I have to write this in a subtle way, it appeared that this was prepared by an amateur. Sadly, mixed with high expectations and previous good reviews, I cannot give more than 1 star for this dish after my experience. 

Tiffin for $14 is good and I would recommend you to definitively try it. It was served with fresh Naan which was really nice and crispy- just the way we want. It comes with 4 little tiffin boxes. The presentation will just remind you of your college days. If i have to rate the tiffin, i would rate it 4.5
