cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw The food here deserves a 5 star. It is extremely delicious. Best items in my opinion are the chicken tikkah masala, behari kabab(not as good as cafe d khan but still pretty good), khata khan and reshmi kebab.   The reason for giving it 3 stars is because the ventilation is really bad in the resturant and u end up smelling of Indian food by the time you leave.  It is really busy even in weekdays so expect some wait. They also do take out and it takes them 30 mins to get the food ready.  This is the option I like as i don't end up smelling like Indian food and yet get to eat yummy food!!!
