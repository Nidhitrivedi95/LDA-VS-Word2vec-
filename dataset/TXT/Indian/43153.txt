RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA Why hello lunch special. All you can eat buffet for £7? Oh ok then.

I stopped by here for lunch mid-week and quite the indulgent lunch it was. All you can eat lunch for £7 (did I say that already?) gave the option of 5 meat curries, 5 veggie curries, poppadoms, two types of rice, naan, salad and chutneys, tea or coffee and ice cream.

The lamb curry was really quite tasty, as was the veggie curry. As far as Indian curries go it was the usual curry offerings, satisfying, tasty, filled a hole (and then some) and the staff were super friendly. They offered us fresh naan as soon as it was done as we were eating, and were attentive and helpful.

It's in Newington and heart of studentville and I can see how it does well. It's not overly fancy, and an evening meal here would be more about the good food than the surroundings. But it's homely and tasty and a-ok  in my books. Would gladly come back for a second (oh ok, I admit it would be my third - I may have had two servings on the first visit) serving of that lamb curry.
