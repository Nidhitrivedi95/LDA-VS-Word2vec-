2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Only tried the samosas but it was awesome!It was actually spicy unlike some other samosas I have tried in which was not spicy at all. The price was also very cheap. I got 10 samosas there for only $2 I think not certain but I remembered that it was very cheap. Great place to go to with a bunch of friends to grab a bite.There were also a lot of different kinds of food there I would like to try when I return next time.
