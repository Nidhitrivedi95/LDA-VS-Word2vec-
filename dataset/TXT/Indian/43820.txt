RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg I've only been here for the lunch buffet and I'm a fan!  I like coming for lunch because they always have popular dishes available.  I'm always pleased with their curries and sauces, but the naan is probably my least favorite of all the Indian restaurants I've visited.  Service is a little flaky and slow sometimes, but always friendly.
