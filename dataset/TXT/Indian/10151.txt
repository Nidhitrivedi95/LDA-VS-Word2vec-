9MayJXMBLipjf8B_lEb6fA Went to the lunch buffet. Yelp has $$ rating but the lunch buffet was priced as the same if not cheaper than others. The food and service were OUTSTANDING ! Extra stars for spices and flavor. They use more curry and spices than any other buffet I have been to  but NOT too much. Anyone will enjoy their huge variety of dishes. Would def. recommend to both experienced AND novice Indian food lovers!
