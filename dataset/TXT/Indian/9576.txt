8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ Yep... 3 stars as the Yelp average score. I hopes it would be more as I live closeby, but I have to agree with 3.

Take out waiting time is 30 minutes, and when you arrive, you still have to wait 2-3 minutes for them to prepare the order (which was only butter chicken... shouldn't be much faster if this is a butter chicken factory?). First star loss.

The butter chicken is OK, although the sauce is a little bit too sugary, clearly, and the chicken pieces are regular chicken breast cut cubes. SO not cheap, not exceptional... Second start lost... total 3 stars...
