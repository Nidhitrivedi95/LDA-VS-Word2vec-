rnEsf4rD5a_BuaJysOezCQ Cakes n Flakes is right by the Arbor Hills subdivision near Mallard Creek Church Road.

The Indian food is spicy but won't make your eyes water. I have tried samosas, chicken salad sandwich, mango lassi, and they have all been tasty. 

I haven't tried yet but they also sell cakes, pastries and breads. They have stopped selling croissants and the chocolate croissants, though.

The place is small, so coming here with a large group is probably not a good idea.

Out of the Ethnic food places in The Arbors shopping area, I feel that Cakes n Flakes is the best one. The others in the area being Thai Taste, Los Cabos Mexican Restaurant and Toyama Express.
