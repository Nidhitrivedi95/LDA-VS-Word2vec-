RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA We love Taste of India.  Unlike some other Indian food places, when I leave here, I feel great and as if my meal choices were not as unhealthy as they could be.  I always seem to opt for the Tandoori chicken and some naan... But the Tikka masala is another goodie.  

The space is nice and clean, the lunch buffet also appears to be kept in good shape and clean too... A huge plus where buffets are concerned.  I always get the same few things here and everything has been good, and service has been quick and friendly.  

As I write this, I am being reminded that I am due for a dinner here.  If you haven't been here and like Indian food, I suggest checking it out :)
