cJLx99fsYPM0SlNfWLb4Ug Went here Friday night. It's a fairly small place, with seating for maybe about 30ish people, and I'd say they were about half full. So, no wait for a table, and we had quick and attentive service. 

We ordered the samosas, goat curry, spinach paneer (both at "medium" spiciness), regular naan, and garlic naan (along with a couple of Kingfisher beers). The spinach paneer was really excellent: creamy, thick, and with just the right amount of heat and seasoning. The samosas were pretty standard, though especially good because of how right-out-of-the-fryer crispy they were. The naan was just fine. The goat curry was the only disappointment, with not nearly as much meat as I would have liked/expected, especially at around $13. Next time I might stick to veggie options.
