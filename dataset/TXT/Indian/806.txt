-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I went there frequently while I was at Vegas. Awesome place. The initial looks of it might throw you off, but the taste of the food is very authentic. They mainly have thali, in which they serve 3 dishes (or your choice) with rice and roti. Food tastes home cooked. Rotis were great. Not oily, or unhealthy. Cheap. They also have some other dishes which were which equally good. They serve complimentary tea as well.
