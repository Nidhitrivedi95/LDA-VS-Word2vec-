8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg There is so much I would like to say, but will try not to get carried away. The most significant and noticeable issue was that the service and attitude of the staff was appalling. The staff seemed to find speaking to the customers distasteful and avoided it at all costs. When they did speak, it was mumbled. I also caught one eye roll from our waiter when I ordered. When our food was brought to the table, by someone other than 'our' waiter, it was plonked down (yes literally just plonked down). The server did not ask which dish belonged to whom, just walked away without a single word. We had to slide the plates around to the right person. I was drinking masala tea, which was served tepid at best, and water. Our water was never refilled, the waiter never bothered to come back for anything at all after he took our order and we had to wave someone else over to get the bill when we were ready to leave. I ordered Paneer with peas and rice served with sauce. The rice was bone dry and the scant 1/3 cup of sauce sitting in the bottom of the serving bowl was so inadequate that it just disappeared into the food. My husband ordered chicken that was listed as 'marinated and BBQ'd' but when it came to the table it looked like shriveled up sweet potatoes accompanied by loads of barely cooked bell pepper and onion. Awful! Will never go back.
