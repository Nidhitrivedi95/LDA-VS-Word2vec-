TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Yep! I have visited Namaste twice within the last six months, both times for dinner.  Outside of it being in Commercial Center (a relatively seedy side of Vegas) this restaurant rocks.  The interior of the location is very dark and ominous and absolutely perfect for a romantic evening.

We were greeted by the owner who was an energetic as possible.  Our drink orders were placed and delivered within a short amount of time and then the waiter assisted us with our dining options.

We decided upon a Lamb Josh, Garlic Naan and the Butter Chicken.  I have had butter chicken before, but none as succulent as this.  This was very fragrant, juicy and just downright delicious. It has to be some of the best Butter Chicken I have ever had, hands down.  The Lamb was also very tasty and was not heavy at all. The Naan was also very good.

Very few restaurants make you want to try everything on their menu at least once...this is that place.  The food is addictive and when coupled with the ambiance of the location, it just made it a downright special place to go.

I would highly recommend this plae to family and friends.
