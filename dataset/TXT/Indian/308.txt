Seriously. Anyone who says vegetarian food is boring needs to try this place! My favorite is the Malai Kofta, which is CRAZY DELICIOUS ground veggie and Indian cottage dumplings simmered in nuts and a creamy sauce. I've also enjoyed the garlic naan, Samosa Chaat, Mutter Paneer and Palak Paneer here. 

If you like your Indian food spicy, as I do, emphasize spicy/very spicy when you order. 

I happen to agree with others that you really shouldn't have to pay for rice with your entree...but I've found that one order of rice is plenty for two people to share, so that helps. As for those that complain about portion size, they are right, you don't get a huge portion, but then again this isn't Applebee's. Neither of these things are big enough issues for me to deduct a star or stop coming here.

I can't wait for the next time I'm in Tempe as this is an obvious choice for delicious food with efficient and friendly service!
