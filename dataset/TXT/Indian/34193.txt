mfnmy_M3D5ElkgJD_TxoCA I'm looking forward to returning to this new Parkdale spot. We had a delicious brunch today: the omelette special and the poutine hash with Peking duck. Poutine was decadent! Omelette was tasty. Good coffee. Fast and friendly service. I'll be back to try the daily specials and regular menu. There are a lot of different Asian inspired dishes to try!
