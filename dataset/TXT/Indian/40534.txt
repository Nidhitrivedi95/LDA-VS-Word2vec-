PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ After coming past all the good reviews, I decided to take my Asof out for lunch. Having come from indian background, i do have good idea and experience about indian food. The chana samosa was decent but no way it will cost 5 bucks in any other place. My lamb plate came with dry out salad from yesterday and the lamb was too dry and dull. My wife's lamb biryani was nothing but white rice mixed with regular lamb curry. People, biryani is something made after a lot of effort and hardwork, fuming the rice with spices overtime rather than the so called lame biryani i had. Last words, food is made completely for dudes who have never been into indian places before and are completely ignorant about indian cuisine. Trust me, i have had better indian food in Montreal
