gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is a dinner review not lunch buffet. Service and atmosphere was very good. I was really hoping to give this restaurant an honest 5 rating like many others did and also why I stopped in here.. Perhaps in Las Vegas it may be considered one of the best but I've had many Indian cuisine experiences mainly in the valley of L.A. where theres many Indian places. But the food lacked somewhat here. The first thing I was surprised at was the garlic naan bread was not included for dinner, although it was good. First time I've ever seen an Indian restaurant not serve it as complementary. The chicken tandoori was a little dry and mostly smothered in bell peppers, onions, and cilantro. Cilantro??? Had I known about the cilantro I would have requested without it. No basmati rice either although it specified in the menu that it came served with rice. Tikka was exactly the same. Now that I know a couple things about this place I may try again but order carefully. I was with a party of 6 and everyone was eh so so about the food. We were all pleasantly surprised with the service.
