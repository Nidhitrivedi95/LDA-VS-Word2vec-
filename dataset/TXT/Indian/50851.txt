uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w Offensively bad. I have never had worse Indian food. The rice tasted gross and was not basmati. Everything else was flavorless and not recognizable as Indian food. The naan was stale. My boyfriend and I went for the buffet today and left after fifteen minutes, unable to find something remotely good. I've had better and fresher tasting Indian food from the Whole Foods food bar or from a box. If you want delicious authentic Indian food that go to Bombay or Curry House.  Avoid this place at all costs.
