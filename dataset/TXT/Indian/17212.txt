DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Yummy!! This place is great! We just had the (from scratch) naan bread, chicken vindaloo and chicken tiki masala and all three were really good. They offer mild medium and hot spice levels and the medium was just the right amount of heat while still allowing us to taste our food. The atmosphere looked really nice but we just did take out. I will definitely be eating here again!!
