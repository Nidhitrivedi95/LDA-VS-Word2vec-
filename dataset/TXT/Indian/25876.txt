i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ In many ways, this place is at least a 4. Large, open, nicely decorated decor. Very extensive menu with about at least 100 items to choose from.

I'm admittedly a novice when it comes to dosas. I'd have to say that it may seem that a couple of the chutneys were somewhat underwhelming, though. However, there are 4, so you should find at least one you enjoy. I ordered a my dosa with a spicy coconut side - it was almost the texture of a broth. That was quite nice and certainly not lacking any flavour. I also shared a black eyed pea vada. They had a great flavour and were a little more substantive than the dosa.

Going back to the rating, I have to say that I was still hoping for more - a little more flavour and to be more filled up. It may just be that dosas aren't my thing, but I'd be interested in going along with someone who could help navigate the menu, to find how to pick out complementary items and come out feeling a bit more full.
