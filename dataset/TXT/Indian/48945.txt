tt1ERGD9RSfQIwX2ANyJ1g I wish they would bring back their traditional restaurant style of service like they had in their old location.  This has gone way down hill since moving to this location.  The food they offer is decent but nothing like they used to serve. The menu has been scaled down tremendously.  Please bring back the original Bombay Spice!!
