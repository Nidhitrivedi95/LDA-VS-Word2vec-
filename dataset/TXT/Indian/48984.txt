TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw This place was so hyped up that I was expecting something out of this world delicious. My favorite Indian restaurant in the entire world is Bombay Club in Harvard Square. Delicious, in my eyes, you can't beat it. So, I came in here with high hopes.

This was the first Indian restaurant I've tried in Vegas, it's right next to Lotus of Siam, and right away that was a good sign for me. Anything that someone in my group of foodie friends recommends that is in a seedy strip mall HAS to be good.

Started off with a kingfisher beer, papadom, and the requisite sauces. Friend of mine got the mulligatawny soup, I didn't try it, but he said it was good! For dinner, I got the chicken vindaloo and kheema naan (lamb stuffed bread). I asked them to make the vindaloo as hot as they could, and I didn't have a problem eating it. Wasn't as spicy as I thought it'd be. I mean, it was spicy, but it wasn't like -  OH MY GOD IM GOING TO DIE IF I DONT GET WATER RIGHT NOW AIGDJGSADJG kind of spicy, na'mean?

Overall, though, high quality food for a very low price. I was impressed with the place and I'll definitely be going back again.
