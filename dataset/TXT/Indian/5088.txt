2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw Ordered delivery from the, via Uber Eats, first time using this service in Brampton and wow what a crap experience. Food was made and delivered on time but thats about all they got right. The Malai Kofta was horrible, like gross, and the Butter Chicken tasted like what I imagine it would taste like if it was made by prisoners in a supermax penitentiary by people who've never eaten the dish before. Just so bland. Ordered Garlic Naan and Tandoori rotis, both tasted bad and were soggy and I've eaten store bought naan that tasted better. Kuchumber salad was basically a box filled with poorly chopped carrots and onions, really bland and boring, not what I was expecting at all.

All in all place was a serious let down so avoid at all costs as there are hundreds of decent Indian joints in Brampton but you should never order form this place unless you have no idea what good India food is supposed to taste like, then maybe you might like it. Otherwise you'd be safer with fast food.
