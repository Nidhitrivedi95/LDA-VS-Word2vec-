XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Oooh yeah, I have to give Ghandi Cuisine the big F U right now!  

:P  j/k... I still respect you, Ghandi.  It's just you are so hard to access by car.. your seating area is so tiny.. and you serve everyone in a tin foil box, even if you are dining in.

Mother India is a legit restaurant, with menu, server, water, steel cutlery, washroom and space for several tables.  I did not get to try the Butter Chicken Roti when I was at Ghandi last time, but went for it here based on strong Yelp recommendations, and I was not disappointed.

Was it the best butter chicken that I have had?  Mmm... not really.  That title would belong to Babur.  But I am knit picking here, because it was still very deeelish.  

And yeah, all the other compliments that went out to Ghandi goes here too--perfect level of spiciness (I had medium, and it was exactly that, medium level of heat), texture, dirt cheap and friendly service.  A fresh!  You can hear the vegetables being chopped in the background.  When your food arrives, it is piping hot!

Definitely a repeat visit.. if you have a favourite roti that you think I should try, shoot me a message please =)
