YFZtDqYdz00E1RlI_Vo89w Very good nepalese/indian food, and at reasonable prices. I got the mixed grill which consisted of Chicken tikka, lamb tikka, a lamb chop, sheek kebab, and a king prawn. They really mean king prawn, the thing was massive! With this they also include a vegetable curry, rice pilaf, and a yoghurt sauce. Got some Naan on the side which was very fresh. Service was great also, very friendly atmosphere.
