KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA The 3rd time is the charm, or so they say. Ever since my friends from Karachi recommended this little place, I have been trying to come here. Once, I drove all the way and found it closed for Eid. Second time, it was the Canada Day long weekend. The third time, we made it and it was well worth the drive!

I messaged friendly owner Adil to alert him of my son's nut allergy and Adil replied promptly to reassure me.

We chose the chicken seekh kebab, a mutton biryani and a half order of the lamb karahi (included a small salad and 2 of the freshest naans I've ever tasted). Everything was yummy but the lamb karahi was truly scrumptious. So tender and flavourful! Just the thought of it is making me salivate. 

Next time I visit, I should try to drag my extended family so that we can order more items. Waiting to taste the brain masala curry and the paneer karahi...
