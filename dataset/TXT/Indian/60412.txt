ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I rarely review anything..but I'm in Charlotte on business and the reviews were good & Passage to India was close to my hotel. While there's not much to be said for atmosphere or decor, the food was excellent..served quickly, fresh and piping hot. Perfect! I only wish they served alcohol.
