J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ So, this is my first ever review. Mostly cause I'm quite lazy about writing food reviews - but today I feel pushed to write a review because my favourite Indian dish (I'm Indian, and this is probably most Indian folks' favourite dish) - Biryani, was thoroughly ruined that I thought I should share the experience with Toronto's general public in order to emphasize that this is not how Biryani is supposed to taste, and most definitely not how it does in India. There are many versions, types, flavours of Biryani depending on which part of the country you're located at, somewhat identified as a classic dish for every special occasion (where meat is permitted). It's a spice flavoured rice, slow cooked with tender meat, could include veggies, herbs and more spices to garnish.. its delicious and spicy. I can go on.. about todays Biryani: The rice was bland, basmati probably mixed with some curry that could've been any curry really, chunks of chicken that just tasted like boiled chicken placed in the biryani as an afterthought.. okay I'll stop here. I paid $13 for this - thats not much, but its just one dish, and if you're an Indian restaurant, you gotta get this one right. Sorry, not going back for this again!
