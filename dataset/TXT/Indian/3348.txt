0IJTf_O_xaYZo7QH6M8mEg While I was in Edinburgh, I decided to do a curry tour - to hit a new Indian joint every night in search of the most flavorful and spiciest curry. See, I eat spicy food like most people breathe air. Back home, I get Indian take-away and add both Habaneros and Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce before I eat. So... you know, use that as a frame of reference. Anyway.

This was an elegant and classy looking restaurant that had a laid-back and accommodating staff. The prices here were comparable to many in the area but higher than a few gems that I found. Even so, it was a quiet and intimate environment, and the food was GREAT. The flavor of the Vindaloo was excellent. It wasn't, however, very spicy at all. At least to me. I had to request they bring me something to spice up the dish more. When I did, though, they brought me a huge dish of pure chile pepper sauce that - after mixing with my vindaloo - DID make the dish at least moderately spicy. That made me happy.

So.... nowhere near the spiciest curry in Edinburgh but a good restaurant that takes care of its customers, and definitely a staff that knows how to make a proper tasting vindaloo. I'd visit again next time I'm in the city.
