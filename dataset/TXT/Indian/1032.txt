-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw finally a great place for curry near me right off the 51! have gone here several times and always impressed. i cant waiver from the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan, but thank god my gf gets the palak paneer so i can get another awesome flavor change. i am yet to see another white person in there when i go so you know its authentic, but very clean and professional. small inside so we normally get it to go and there has never been a mistake made
