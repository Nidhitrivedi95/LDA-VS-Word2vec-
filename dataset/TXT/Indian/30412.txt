KbI5OOTOGUwh8aeiSU4b6A We recently noticed Chaska when browsing on Just Eat after moving flat, and impressed by the reviews and the cheap poppadoms we decided to give it a go.

So far we've ordered from there twice, and had different experiences both times. The first we were impressed! Kip S loved his vegetable korma, and whilst the paneer in the paneer jalfreizi I ordered wasn't the best I've had (it had a slightly artificial taste to it), the curry itself was nice and spicy.

Impressed by the quick delivery, the curries and most of all the price, we ordered from Chaska again last night. What a difference a week makes!

This time Kip went for the vegetable pasanda, and rather than being a nice mix of Indian vegetables, it was more along the lines of carrots and peas. Hmm. I had a saag, which was perfectly fine, though the chicken was a bit bland. My poppadoms were all overcooked, urgh, and Kip's peshwari naan was really nothing to write home about. The mixed pakora was fine.

What a shame! It seems Chaska lacks consistency, which is the opposite of what you want from a carryout. I've gone for 3 stars, as I feel it's a compromise between our two experiences. Back to the old favourite we go!
