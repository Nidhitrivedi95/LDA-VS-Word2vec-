At 6:30 pm, in an almost empty restaurant, she felt overwhelmed because we requested a table change for 4 people. We hadn't even placed our order yet. In anticipation of the live music, we did not wish to sit next to the speakers. While the waitress, tried to find another table, the owner started complaining to the staff about relocating. She did not even stand up from her place to address the matter. There was 1 other family, the entire restaurant had empty tables. Her tone and attitude lacked any form of professionalism, or customer service. Sadly, she had the attitude of someone who likes to bark orders and is apathetic about everyone and anything.  

Service: 5/5 We were waited on by a young lady who was extremely friendly and helpful. She tried her best to apologize on behalf of the owner. It was sad to hear that none of the waiting staff liked the owner either. This really spoke volumes.

Anyways now onto the good things. 

Food: 5/5 We loved the appetizers, very different and great taste. I highly recommend their Dahi Kabab (best thing ever) and Purani Dilli Ki Palak Chat. I felt it was innovative and quite tasty, felt good to try something other the typical Indian appetizers. 

Ambience 5/5: we were here on a weekend, there was lovely live music playing. Song requests are more than welcome. Songs are of the old bollywood classics genre. Felt like this would be a great place for a date. 
 
It's a shame that the owner tainted our experience but I would go for the food and ambience!
