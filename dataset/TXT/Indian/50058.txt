U8tIgXZ0T--8ZNEVoDap0g Absolutely delicious. I don't write too many reviews but I am taking the time to do so. Please try this place. Only ordered three items from here but each one absolutely amazing. The tandoori chicken is the best I have had in years and the fish was meaty with less batter and more fish. The biryani is just right and loved the pricing. The gentleman who was cooking and serving was extremely friendly and even gave me kheer while I waited for my order. I will revisit.
