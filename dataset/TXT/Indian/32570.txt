LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Simply overrated!!
Same dosa...but splattered with different types of sauces from inside to expand the menu items.

This place gets busy...prices are low and so it get busy especially on weekends. 

People could expect to wait up-to 60 minutes for their turn.....to eat this non-expensive meal.

They give you no time to take your time while eating....sit-order-eat-pay-and leave.

Crazy! Not worth it for me.
