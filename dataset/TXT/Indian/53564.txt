vFnzV9uy9nEXFQgkSuv_AQ I stopped by the restaurant a few Saturdays ago for a quick buffet lunch.  The place is generally dark with tables, not booths.  The place is clean, but the mood is chaotic; papers on some tables, chairs stacked, boxes around, etc.  It is difficult to have a relaxing lunch when the atmosphere is simply distracting.

I said about four words to the waiter (literally two thank yous for the water refill).

The food is basic Indian and is good, not great - tandoori chicken, palak pannear, etc.  I was hoping for something unique, or at least a signature dish, but my hope was not realized.

The price of the buffett is under $10.00.  It is worth it, but I do not have a strong desire to return any time soon.
