ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA I have experienced good Indian good and mediocre Indian good. I can honestly say Jannat is some of the best Indian food I have ever had. The palak paneer was fresh and the paneer was soft and moist. The butter naan was freshly baked and warm. 

The service was attentive and friendly. I would highly recommend them for dining in or take out.
