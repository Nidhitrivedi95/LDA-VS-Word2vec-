o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw This was actually my first time trying Indian food! They had a nice sized buffet that my husband ate off of & we were pleased to see how fresh everything looked. We ordered firecracker chicken, tandoori chicken, garlic naan & rice off of the regular menu. The firecracker chicken had such a wonderful flavor but the chicken reminded me of frozen breaded nuggets, maybe they had been sitting a bit? The tandoori chicken had such an overpowering lemon flavor that none of us could eat it. I nibbled off of my husbands plate & LOVED the butter chicken, tikka masala & chicken vindaloo. The rice was a pass for me but I will definitely be back for the butter chicken & garlic naan!
