UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Ever since Nataraj closed, I've been on the lookout for a good Indian place. Time and time again, Banjara comes up as one of the best in the city. I hope it isn't true. The food has no flavour and is way too oily, and the naan is not memorable at all. Why do people like this place so much?
