a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g We got takeout from Motimahal last night and it was pretty great. It showed up timely and was in their own branded paper bags and containers, which made them look pretty legitimate.

We ordered all vegetarian dishes because my wife's sister was coming over and she's vegetarian. They were all good, but I'd say the paneer tikka was my favourite. With the Malai kofta a close second. The naan was good and big. I read a precious review comparing it to pizza dough. It is thicker than most naans, but it has a nice chew and is great for soaking up sauce. The samosas were large and reasonably priced. Actually everything was reasonably priced for the portions you got. We ordered four medium sized dishes for four people and we were all stuffed and have plenty of leftovers.

I would totally get take out from here again. It may become our go to Indian/Pakistani place over Lahore tikka house. A very pleasant surprise for a Saturday night.
