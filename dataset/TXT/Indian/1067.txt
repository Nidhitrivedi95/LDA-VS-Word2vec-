-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw It used to be good but it has turned to be bad, both service and quality of food.
The chicken Bryani always comes with egg. But I ordered a few times since few months ago,it came without the egg. When I called to ask, the answer from them was "we are out of egg!" How can you out of eggs for so many times???? How can you increased your price and reduced your ingredients? Fry's store is nearby the restaurant. If you knew you are out of eggs, why don't you get it at fry's store or tell your customer in advance and give discount??

I ordered tandoori chicken but it came without sauce. I asked whether there is green sauce come together with the chicken and she said yes. But when I reached home, there was no green sauce....

I used to give 5 star but now I edit my review to 1 star.....
