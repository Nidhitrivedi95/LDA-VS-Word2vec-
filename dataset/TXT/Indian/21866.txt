gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Ok.  Unbelievable reviews brought me to this place.  It was close enough to walk too from the California hotel, even in the 116 degree heat.  2 locals even raved about it while my friend and I were in there.  We had come to the right place.  

It was not crowded at noon on the Wednesday we walked in, so we got good service with at most, a 10-minute wait for our food.  We both had the Super Gyros with fries and drinks.  Drinks were more the warm side (couldn't figure out if it was the weather or a crappy fridge) but the fries and gyros was fresh.  But I must admit, that the fries were more impressive then the gyro.  I thought the gyro was just average. 

All in all it was filling for a reasonable price (Greek food can be pricey in Hawaii); the fries were fresher and more nicely fried than most places I have eaten fries (no, not just Greek places, in my life).  I even had to use the bathroom and it was pretty neat. 

I can say this, if this is one of the better Gyros places, I'm only going here.  I'm scared to go anywhere else cause the others must be real crap.
