2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Staying in Mississauga overnight since my flight out of Toronto Pearson was the next day. Yelp came thru again; looked for a good eatery and discovered Avani. Ordered butter chicken, chili paneer, and roti to go. It was a little spendy for just one person, but I wanted more than one dish. Some people mentioned that service was slow; it's very fast if you ask for a take-out order (only took around 10 minutes on a busy Friday evening). Almost all tables were full of Indian folks so I knew I was in a popular local spot. Food was excellent! Butter chicken was smooth with a hint of spice, chili paneer had a little bit of crisp and sweetness with a solid chili spiciness. Avani is at the end of a small strip mall across the street from WalMart... very unassuming and I would have had trouble finding it without the GPS in the car. But so glad I ate here instead of the Subway across the street from the hotel!
