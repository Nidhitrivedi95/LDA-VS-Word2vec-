Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ Finally a decent Indian eatery at Lakeshore. Their food is very good. Very well behaved/ friendly staff and owner. Portions are really good. I have been to TICH around 5-6 times and its always the same i.e. awesome. 
Only thing which they lack is space, and it get really crowded when full, which it is normally.
Overall very good place to eat. 
Definite repeat
