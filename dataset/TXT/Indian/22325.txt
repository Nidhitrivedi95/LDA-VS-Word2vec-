GmMZG6dsDqGVC275ZwD-cw BBQ meat plater is the only thing that is good here. Otherwise palak paneer was sour, Chana was flavorless. Waiter over sold dishes which held no overall value for the money. Restaurant has no atmosphere, horrible service. Outdated tables, washroom was dirty.  I'd recommend trying other places. Went here because of the reviews sadly never again.
