-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg While in the Monroeville area (near Pittsburgh), I decided to use Yelp to find the most popular local restaurant in the Monroeville area.  This search led me to the slightly out of the way Udipi Café.  I have never been to an all-vegetarian restaurant before and per the menu, this place serves "pure South Indian vegetarian cuisine".  While having enjoyed many an Indian dish, w/ meat mind you, I decided to listen to all the strong Yelp reviews and try this place.  

Atmosphere - Simple, Booths, Linoleum, Paneling, Clean, Mom & Pop feel.

Food - I ordered from the lunch menu and went with a curry.  I ordered the Aloo Gobi (potatoes & cauliflower cooked with Indian spices).  This came with a side of jasmine rice and chapathy (to me seemed like plain naan....see my photo and judge for yourself).  When the dish arrived, it was nicely presented with an accompaniment of yogurt that consisted of diced cucumbers, carrots, and celery.  I also received a little dish that contained Indian spices to include as desired.  These spices added some great flavor to the meal.  To wash all this deliciousness down, I ordered water and something I have had before, Lassi (a yogurt drink).  This Lassi however was mango flavored, which made it even tastier.  

Service - Helpful, cheerful, prompt, and patient with a novice. 

Price - $7.50 Combo, Mango Lassi $3.50 over all not too bad .

Overall - A great experience even if I would not mind adding some nice lamb to my Aloo Gobi...I am just saying...
