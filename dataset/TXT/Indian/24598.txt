H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw I LOVED eating at this place, I'd do take out every week and it was consistently delicious.

However today I ordered my usual. The naan was black in some parts and in others very much raw dough. One of the papadam pieces had a hair baked into it. And finally, the sauce that was normally a beautiful consistency was watery. Unfortunately I ate the better portion of it before realizing I nearly ate a hair, and for that reason I will no longer be coming back. I'm a little worried that there may have been something wrong with it and I really hope I don't end up sick as a result of eating it.
