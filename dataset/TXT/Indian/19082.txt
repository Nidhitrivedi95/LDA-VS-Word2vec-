f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I have been visiting Indian restaurants across Charlotte area for years but I haven't tasted such a great north Indian food anywhere. This restaurant offers you the best flavors of north Indian and Pakistani delicacies. The owner is very courteous and makes sure that the food tastes authentic. Only downside is the location of the restaurant but if only taste and quality matters to you (like me) then this place earns a 5 star rating. Our group ordered Zafran Special chicken platter, chicken haleem, chana chat, chicken biryani, pakoras, bagare began and shahi paneer. All items were perfect in spice level and taste. Highly recommended for North Indian food.
