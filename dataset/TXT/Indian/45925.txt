SjmtOnyHgdKFDUkAuyPcMw Heard about veggie flames and decided to check out the hype. They do Vegetarian versions of famous non-vegetarian dishes. Went in and ordered the Kalga chilli "chicken". My expectations were chunks of a soya based products in a typical chili chicken style but to my dismay came some shredded soya thing with unreal amounts of onions. I was very disappointed by what was shown and the product received. Pizzas are good though. Good family run operation where they are pleasant to deal with. The Kalga Chilli "chicken" was the down side here. Maybe try something different.
