gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA One of the worst Indian Restaurants in Cleveland.  Food was below standard. Once I had gone along with my parents for Dinner. We had ordered Bhajjis , Rava Dosa and Onion Utappa. 

Bhajjis were horrible. Panner was hard like rock inside, Onions were soft not crunchy, chillis were old like dead stem.

Rava Dosa and Onion Utappa was way too oily and sambhar which is usually served was watery and chatni I believe the coconut was smelling horrible.

When complaint, they boldly said "This is their standard of cooking" Too rude . We simply walked out without paying a penny.
