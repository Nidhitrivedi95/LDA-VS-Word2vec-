q7fAiwQVfCxLM3Uvk2oslg We were shocked when our order, for 2+ppl, came out to $13 'n change!  We ordered a Chicken Biryani ($6.75), Mutton Kottu Roti (~$2), & an egg dosa (~$2).  Out of the selection, I'd definitely order the Biryani again.  It's not quite Pakistani style, but still good with 2 moist, tasty pieces of chicken!

The Biryani came with something better than Raita!  (I usually don't like Raita, depending on how it's made.)  It was yogurt based with chopped, raw slices on onion + tomato.  You pour it on top and eat it with the Biryani.

Since we were eating al fresco, we couldn't heat up the egg dosa, so it was hard.  It may have tasted better warmed up, but I don't think I'd order it again.  Tastes just like what it sounds/looks!

Didn't have room for the Mutton Roti, so that'll be reviewed later.  Overrall, it was a nice change from eating Indian and cheaper too!  

Warning:  Takeout only.
