vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw Take-Out lamb vindaloo and butter chicken. 

The portions were large, however, there was very little lamb / chicken contained in the serving. The butter chen was very well prepared. The lamb in the vindaloo was tough to chew and the sauce/gravy was not very mature. The spices, in the vindaloo, we're not well blended. There was plenty of heat, however, vindaloo needs more flavour depth than heat.  The offering fell flat to my taste. 

I may try again, as the location is convenient, however, if the same experience persist it will be my final visit.
