WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA I came here for lunch on a Monday around noon. The place was not as busy as I thought it'd be. The server didn't acknowledge us when we walked in. He just continued doing his thing, even though I asked for a table of 2. He seemed busy, but we were eventually led to sit by the windows.

The channa masala was fantastic, though the naan wasn't as great as I expected. Some of the pieces were burnt a bit on one side. My partner in crime had the butter chicken and commented that it was very delicious.

Service was slow, even though the restaurant was not very busy.
