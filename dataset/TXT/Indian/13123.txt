B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ I went to the location in University circle. First of all, this is not an Americanized version of Chinese food or authentic Chinese food; it is an Indo-Chinese fusion. I ordered the Vegetarian momos (appetizer) and Vegetable Tofu stir-fry with brown rice (entree). Surprisingly the entree came out first. While the brown rice was hot, the rest of the entree was not - the tofu was raw and cold (yes cold!) along with some of the veggies. Being disgusted, I pushed the plate to the side and waited for the momos to arrive. Thankfully, the momos were steamed hot - taste just OK; have had way better momos at Nepalese and Tibetan restaurants. I believe one of the managers looked at my table, noticed that I had left the entree pretty much untouched on the side, but didn't care to come by to ask for feedback. Honestly, it was an utter waste of time and money and I will never be walking into this place again.
