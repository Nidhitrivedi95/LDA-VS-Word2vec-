J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Food was great. Portions were good, however I felt that I was being ripped off since they combined both lamb and chicken tikka onto one regular sized skillet after waiting 35 to 40 mins. Service was great at first and the waiters were super nice, but they seemed to stop caring after, nor did they bother to check up on us either. But I guess I'd give it a second try, just cause the flavours were good.
