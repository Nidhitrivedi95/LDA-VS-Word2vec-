( Chilly February Saturday left my friend and I craving for some spicy food)

Service : the wait staff were friendly and courteous, were attentive and water glasses were promptly filled. ( trust me, this can be a life saver when your food is fiery hot )

Food : We ordered the Chicken Briyani , Karahi Lamb , Naan and Laccha Paratha. The breads tasted authentic, no complaints. But the chef was a little too generous with the masala in  the Karahi lamb gravy making it unbelievably fiery and I had to down 6 glasses of water just to wash it all down with the breads. 

The Briyani was a terrible let down.  It seemed like the chef just mixed together precooked rice with briyani gravy and unceremoniously dumped the wet mixture on a plate to be served to us. The spices and masalas tasted raw and it was easily the worst briyani i have tasted yet. 

Not going back. :(
