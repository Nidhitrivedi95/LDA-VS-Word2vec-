3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Tried their buffet lunch for the first time.  After tax, it's works out for $25 for two, which is amazing deal, considering all the food you get.   The buffet has three sections, two for hot entrees and one for fruit/veggies/dessert.  Everything tasted fresh and was delicious.  Servers were attentive and a manager came over to ask how everything was and if we needed anything.  Definitely recommend.
