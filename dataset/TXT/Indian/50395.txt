UBv8heCQR0RPnUQG0zkXIQ I really don't know whether the five star reviews are credible or not, but I being a fan of Indian cuisine was definite to try out a new spot in the valley, but......... A total rip off, waste of money and time. 
I ordered four chicken biryani for go to, and was so enthusiastic while having it on my table, but what I got was, three plain rice with not even a tiny piece of chicken, and only one biryani with one piece of chicken. No salad or sauce accompanied as sides, man how am I supposed to eat your plain flat rice??? Is this your chicken biryani? Where is the chicken?
Well, for biryani I know very authentic places, see my other reviews....
I really don't mean to discourage a new business but please don't fool the people by your name, either it should be called anything else but a " Biryani House ", or for the sake of name, please improve your so called biryani. If it's a biryani house, it should sell the best biryani in town. 
I also have reservations for the portion size, the quantities are not sufficient for an order.
Writing about service will make it too much, but seriously, the service sucks. I ordered way before getting In there, but when I went to pick up, they took another 20 mins to complete. The guy was in a clutter, was running in and out and asking questions again n again and wasn't sure about anything. I guess they are not ready to open the business yet.
