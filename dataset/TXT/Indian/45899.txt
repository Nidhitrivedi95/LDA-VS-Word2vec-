sJ0MYSAIVK28cMzh-s-NPA I'd been to an Amaya restaurant so was excited to try this "express" version. I've got to say, I was pleasantly surprised! Didn't expect to enjoy the food as much as I did, and I continue to go back here. Nice butter chicken, but my favourite is the chicken madras. A bit spicy but definitely toned down for the average Canadian palate. 

Doesn't get much better in a mall food court!
