ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw In terms of authentic taste and service this is by far the best Indian restaurant I have been to. It was very clean and had a soothing atmosphere.

The lamb was perfect, highly recommended. More then enough food too and makes a great lunch the next day. 

Most menu items are on the $16 to $25 dollar range which is very reasonable for dinner and the quality.

I will be back to check on the weekend brunch.
