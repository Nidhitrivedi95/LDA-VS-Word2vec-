aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ I was sooooooooooo excited to try tkre.  I think I set my expectations too high. I stalked them on instagram, I'd salivate every time I passed their "butter chicken paneer"  sign. Let's face it,  butter and chicken are some of my hot words.
When I came in here on pride weekend with my sister, we ordered a beer, a pop, and two butter chicken paneers. Points for selling beer. Points off for a bug being in my beer. For 2 wraps and two beverages, the total came to  $32 and change. WTH, not worth it!
We asked for something non spicy for my sister because she's a baby and they suggested the butter chicken. 
It was too spicy for her.
I ended up eating both.
They tasted bland to me.
I REALLY wanted to love this place, but I just didn't.
