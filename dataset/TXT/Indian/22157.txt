GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw This is hands down the best Indian food in the Valley. I've had most of the menu and everything has been delicious. My favorite items are he aloo tikki appetizer, the aloo naan with raita, the chicken makhani, and the salad with chicken. The kheer is also amazing. They're also very accommodating to different levels of spice. 

This place is definitely worth a try. The lunch specials change daily and include a curry, rice and naan. They're a great deal. Love this place!
