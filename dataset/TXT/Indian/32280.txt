But if you're looking for great Indian food in the Oshawa/Whitby area this is by far the best curry around.  

Some places you go to just have food colouring and generic flavours.  Food Village offers a wide variety of choices, big menu, good size portions and nice depth of flavour.  The naan was excellent... big, fluffy and crispy.  I particularly loved the garlic naan!
