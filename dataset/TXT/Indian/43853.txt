RU6E7WsAfsTRcjXxH1Lo5A This is a perfect place to have fast Indian food that tastes delicious and full of flavors. There is a promotion offer that if you get 2 choices of curry, you get free naan. They bake the naan in the tandoor fresh when you order.
Btw, when you get bowl, you get side of rice or naan and salad and free cookie. :D Portions are large and food is fresh. 
It is near to Harkins theatre.
