P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag The Sunday Buffet selection is usually good however a few times the entrees didn't seem to be as fresh as other times I've gone. I do enjoy very spicy food and obviously not everyone likes it that way but it just doesn't seem to be consistent. Some days certain dishes like butter chicken are  spicier than others such as chili chicken yet even when I order off the menu and specify a level 10 it's still not up to par with the spice level I'm hoping for. Maybe next time I'll ask for a level 15 and see what happens.
