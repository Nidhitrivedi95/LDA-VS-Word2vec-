gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A 1st time eating Indian food. I love spicy. So we chose their 2 of their appetizers (veg. Samosas) not that great. Tastes like it was frozen and thrown to fry. The other is chicken dumpling (forgot the name) which was delicious!!!!!!! Their sauce that came with it was also amazing
Lamb curry and chicken curry as entrée  and I loved the lamb (not much a chicken with fatty person) very yummy sauce. 
Desserts. Never ever loved another dessert from diff ethnicity. Pistachio ice cream is sick! Insane taste. And rice pudding delicious. 
Wow wow wow. 
The only thing I didn't understand is why waiters don't dress the same so you know who is waiter and who isn't. 
2nd- the 2nd appetizer came out after 30 min. Maybe it's because the place was busy. 
It's my first time trying Indian food and only 2 out of 3 people knew how to explain each order

In other words the food was amazing. The desserts were even better!
