ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I went to this restaurant for dinner with a few of my co-workers.  I have few complaints, but before I list them, I would like to say that this place does have a decent tasting food.  So if that's your only concern, please disregard my ratings and do visit this place.

One of the biggest complaints I have is of their staff.  The manager who seated us was very professional however our server was very rude.  He didn't have any patience .   He was talking way too fast and he was picking up plates when we weren't even done.  

When we ordered appetizers, he taunted us by asking, "is that it?" and when we actually got the appetizers we realized he could have told us that we have small portions for appetizers.  

As he was picking up empty plates from our table he is spilling crumbs all over us and didn't have the decency to apologize.
