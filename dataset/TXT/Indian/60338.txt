ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Passage to India is getting behind on its success. This is a great buffet joint near UNC-Charlotte campus, frequented by the local community and visitors alike. At lunch, the place burst at its seams and both the buffet and the service lag behind. Food choice has become more limited and not all is available. It's a pity because passage to India is otherwise a great place with good food for a reasonable price.
