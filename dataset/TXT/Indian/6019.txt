3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA We came here for dinner and ordered from the regular menu, as buffet is only available during lunch. Appetizers were generally priced at about $5, and entrees range from about $11 - $15. So it is a little pricey, but the portions were generous. We ordered vegetable pakora, saag panner, tandoori chicken, and aloo gobi. We also got a free Mango Lassi for our Yelp check-in, and complimentary Galub Jamuns for dessert (served warm)! My husband and I were both full by the time we left, and we had enough left over for lunch the next day. 

The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was very nice. There place was pretty empty, only about 5 tables were occupied, so the staff was very attentive - asking if we needed more water, and checking to make sure we were enjoying our meal. 

I'll definitely be coming back here - only next time I hope I can make it for the $10.99 buffet lunch!!
