JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Vegetarian heaven! This place has been one of my favorites for quite some time. The menu is tremendous, service is friendly and atmosphere relaxed. I have never had something I didn't like from this place. My best suggestion is to order a handful of items from the menu and share with everyone at your table so you can try more! You can't mess up. The staff is always happy to make recommendations if you're feeling indecisive. I love ordering takeout from here too.
