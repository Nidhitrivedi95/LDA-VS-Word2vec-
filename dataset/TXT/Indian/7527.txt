5vxp6inj3sY4Eb2MFyOOPg Whenever I'm in the mood for some good kebab, Chopan Grill is my favourite place to go. When I'm with a group or family, we order the "Party of Four" family pack with the chicken and beef kofta kabobs. The rice is lightly flavoured and very yummy, the chicken is seasoned perfectly. My SO is a big fan of the beef kofta. The chicken curry "Qorma-e-Morgh" is also delicious.

The decor isn't the best, neither is the layout however the space is VERY big (Rainbow Buffet was in this space prior to Chopan's opening). The servers are always very polite but often very quiet. The atmosphere is kind of dreary which is why I have only given it 4 stars.

The food is what you're there for! I love it.
