zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q I've seen this place a hundred times and never gave it much thought until I saw the Yelp! Reviews had been pretty consistent. It's very close to my house and has convenient parking. I'm usually up for trying new things but I was in the mood for Tikka masala so I went with that and it came with a piece of naan and i ordered a side of rice. A good solid 3.5 stars but I was generous and rounded up. The restaurant itself has zero ambiance and the strip mall where it's located is pretty run down, but the food was pretty good. The chicken was all white meat and cooked well. The sauce had a bit of a kick even though I ordered the 'mild' which was actually a perfect amount for me. The food was all hot and fresh quickly made. I'd definitely try it again.
