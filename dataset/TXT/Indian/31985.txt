Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg Atma is really good (Northern) Indian restaurant in a cool neighborhood. A chill atmosphere with great food and attentive service. The place wasn't busy when we arrived, but gradually filled up during dinner. All the Indian menu staples are available, and then some. Get some atchar mango pickles.
