m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Had lunch at Kohinoor at the suggestion of my son and his fiance.  So glad we went, it was the best Indian food we've ever had.  We had Chicken Tikka Masala, a potato dish (I forget the name), Biryani and naan bread.  Great bang for the buck.

I SO wanted to go 5 stars but I am very particular about the cleanliness of restaurants.  The place is nice, just not spotless.  Service was fine, nothing special although the manager came by and really made us feel welcome.

So I gave it 4 stars, I'd go 4 and a half if Yelp had that option.  Bring in a cleaning crew to meticulously clean the place one night a month and it would get 5 stars.  I would definitely go again and would highly recommend.
