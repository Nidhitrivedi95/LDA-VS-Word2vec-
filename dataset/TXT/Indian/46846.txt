t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg im going to wait to give it a five until i dine in, but for take-out, i have no complaints. food was waiting for me when i arrived (was told 15-20 minute wait, which was about my drive time). food was piping hot even when i made it home. i ordered mild butter chicken and tikka masala (my first time for this restaurant... ill be more adventurous next time) and they were both yummy. cheese naan was good, but i know my husband will request garlic next time. and they offer a military discount!

i am looking forward to dining in.
