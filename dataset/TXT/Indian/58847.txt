YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA Really yummy buffet. Went here for dinner with the boyfriend. Restaurant was surprisingly nice: wood floors, nice mirrors,  fancy wood panelled bar. We agreed it was  overly nice for a buffet. food was delicious with the perfect amount of spice. Heineken and Coronas were only $5. We'd definitely come back. Great value.
