LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This place is one in a million. The ambience, service, and staff are great.  So accommodating and so well organized. Everything is spotless and clean! The taste, presentation, and quality of the food is unmatched.  You just can't beat it, or find this anywhere else.  The taste of the dosas are better than any dosa I've even had in India!!  We live in Houston, and we just can't wait to come back to Mississauga just for guru! Everything is perfect, definitely recommend!
