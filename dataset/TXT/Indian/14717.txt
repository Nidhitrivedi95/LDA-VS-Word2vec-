CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A I like trying new restaurants and bought Groupon and decided to visit. Food was not at all good and at the end host behaved very rudely and was just trying to make up reasons to not accept Groupon. After lot of arguing she charged me extra $2.20 and rounded total up to 40. I really did not had energy to argue anymore and paid and got out of there. I wish I could give them 0 stars. I have attached the receipt that she gave me.
