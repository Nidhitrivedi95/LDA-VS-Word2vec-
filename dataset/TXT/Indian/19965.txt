FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q As a visitor to Madison, I was expecting little more than the usual beef potatoes and other carbohydrates that I would normally expect from the late night Wisconsin fare. 

This restaurant was devastatingly good. Not only did they deliver straight to my airbnb, but the food was so satisfying and hearty that I had leftovers for the following day. It was equally, if not even more, delicious.

I ordered a side of rice, a saag specialty item, and the chef's naan. The naan was a meal unto itself. The rice was perfectly done and the curry had the perfect amount of spice. It is also worth noting that this restaurant is very generous with its side-portions.

Say yes to this choice, vegetarian or not.
