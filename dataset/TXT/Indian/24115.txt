Gtw-SpnhyNa0TwNETlysyw Once upon a time, I used to really love Taj Mahal in this same location.  But it kind of went downhill over time.  Seemed like the prices kept going up while the amount of actual protein served decreased.  But now Southern Spice has moved in, and I've eaten here repeatedly for much more than convenience.  Great food and reasonable prices.

The chili paneer has become a staple appetizer for my husband and I.  On a good night, it's got just the slightest hint of a crunch to the edges.  On a bad night, still delicious.   I love both the butter chicken and chicken korma.  And the garlic naan...some of the best I've had.  The perfect balance of toastiness on the outside, chewiness on the inside.  The garlic has never been burnt either (I'm talking to you Tandoori Times).  Entrees thankfully include rice.  I have been getting pretty sick and tired of paying extra for that.

I'm only taking a star off because a couple times I got a piece of chicken that wasn't well-trimmed.  I hate having anything in my mouth that I wouldn't willingly swallow.  So not cool.

But otherwise, I'm a fan and will single-handedly do my best to keep them in business.  I'm generous like that.
