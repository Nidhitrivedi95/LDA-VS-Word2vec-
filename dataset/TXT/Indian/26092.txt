Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw I decided to eat at Banjara after reading all the great reviews the restaurant got however I came away quite dissapointed. My chicken tikka wasn't made in a tandoor and was pan fried. The butter chicken tasted a bit like tomato soup and lacked any flavour. The naan was a pita bread that was heated up. It does have a great location on Eglinton and the staff is really nice and friendly however I'd have to say that this isn't the place to eat at if you know and love Indian food. There are much better options out there including Babur, New Kwality and even Bombay Bhel. 2 stars for the amazing staff.
