LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw I can't believe I have lived in Lawrenceville for three years and this is my first visit. We got the shawarma, tikka masala, samosas, and grape leaves. Everything was absolutely delicious and we spent under $25! The atmosphere isn't the greatest- as its kind of an old middle school cafeteria feel, but the food more than makes up for it! It gets super busy on the weekend but their service is quick and friendly. Highly recommend and can't way to go back!!!
