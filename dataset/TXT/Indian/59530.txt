ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ I am an American having lived in Bangalore, India for a number of years working. Curry Bowl is the closest/best South Indian food I have found in the area. When I brought my visiting friends from south India they gave their stamp of approval. Great buffet. Highly recommended.
