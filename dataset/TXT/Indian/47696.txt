TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Food and service were both excellent. We had vegetable pakoras, the rack of lamb dinner, and fish tikka masala. Pakoras we're crispy and tasty. The lamb and the fish were both cooked perfectly, very tender. The side dishes and the custard that came with the lamb were all delicious. Everything came out quickly and well paced so we never had too much food on the table. Overall, highly recommended.
