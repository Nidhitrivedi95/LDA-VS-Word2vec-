3quopZyL8WuqVFfsCi0z2A I was excited to see that an Indian restaurant was moving in to the old Hamish's space. A group of us neighbours went to check it out, and I've been back several times since. So good, my new favourite Indian restaurant, and in walking distance to boot! I've tried the curry shrimp with rice, curry fish with naan, and a paneer dish (don't remember which one). All were awesome. The samosas are good too. There are so many more dishes I want to try. Reasonable prices, friendly attentive service.
