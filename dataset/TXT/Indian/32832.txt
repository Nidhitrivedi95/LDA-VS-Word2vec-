llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg I enjoy Indian/Pakistani food. I love the smells, the colors and varied textures. Curries run the gamut from spicy, to sexy to mellow. There is always something new to try and many times there is a surprise, a burst of flavor you didn't expect. 

I have been to SWAD five times and the food is consistently delicious. That has not been my experience with other Indian restaurants. I am often disappointed after the first try.

I love their saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, Chana masala, roti, and biryanis. The mango ice cream is the perfect way to end a meal.

Today I went to their lunch buffet. I was reluctant because I generally do not like to eat food sitting in a warming tray. The food was hot, fresh and delectable. I had chai tea which helped to chase my chills away. I would gladly go again.

Service is excellent and friendly. Give it a try.
