KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ SPICY Food! Tried the Kashmiri Chicken Combo. Came with Salad (without dressing), and (soft) Naan, plus a Coke. I don't know why there was no dressing on the salad (maybe the greens where meant to be put on the bread with the chicken?!) The soft Naan was really good, and the chicken pretty hot.

Fast and friendly service, the price was great (13$), and they are open all night! The interior is "Take-Out"-friendly but nothing more. The counter looks great with all the different dishes. At least 30 of them (ready cooked), so I understand why they have to microwave them - always the same problem if a diner offers too many things...
