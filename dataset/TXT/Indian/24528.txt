The service was efficient and ready for my takeout but the food tasted more Chinese than Hakka. It wasn't even good Chinese  in my humble opinion. Iwas happy to find this in the area, but I was warned, don't buy Hakka from any neighborhood in Toronto - It should be bought in Scarborough or Richmond Hill. And in this case this was right.
