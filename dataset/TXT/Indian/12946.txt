b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw The Chicken Chettinad was sublime. I ordered it 8/10 hotness and it did not disappoint. Most of the other Indian style restaurants I've ate ate have been mostly northern so a lot of the dishes on the menu I had not had before. The Chettinad is my new favorite! Paired with a Southern Teir 2xIPA and I was in heaven on earth. Can not wait to take some friends here!!
