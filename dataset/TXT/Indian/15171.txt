CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I have been there for Buffet at lunch and also at night for dinner.
The ambiance is good and waiters are courteous too.

It is my favorite Indian Buffet place in downtown.You get a lot for the price you pay for buffet.The best thing is their wide selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian salads.I usually get full trying all the salads.
I did not like the main course food in buffet.I have been there a lot and it is always the same.They make most of the food in cream so it is very heavy and not very delicious.If you really want to try something,their goat curry is the best.
The desserts choices in buffet is also very limited and always the same.

I think they need to revise their menu and add more variety and up their quality of food.
