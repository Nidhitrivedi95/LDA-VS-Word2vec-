0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Since my last review I have been back here many times and my love for their food still remains. This is as authentic as it gets.....I was told the owners were really chinese immigrants who were settled in Calcutta (where hakka cuisine originated), and now are serving these plates of explosive flavour in a hidden away plaza off burnhamthorpe and creditview. I love this place as it never dissapoints.
