P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA While strolling down Queen Street, I came across India Palace. It is located next door to another Indian restaurant named Little India. This definitely makes for some competition, as each locale had someone standing outside trying to convince people to come in for lunch.

The $10.99 buffet is just awesome. So many tasty Indian treats to choose from and each looks better than the next. Of course I tried a little of each and sat down with a plate overflowing with curries, chicken pieces and rice.

After inhaling all of this goodness, I went back for more (no wonder why I can not lose this belly...no self control!!!). I brought along my younger brother, who was an Indian food virgin, and he absolutely is addicted to Indian cuisine since our visit to this cute little eatery.

When in TO, definitely stop here for an affordable and delicious lunch.
