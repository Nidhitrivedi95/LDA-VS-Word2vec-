GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Worst experience, they don't serve what they mention on their menu. While ordering Paneer dosa, they put tofu in the dosa instead of paneer. 2 time same experience. Owner says they want to cut on cost, if they really want to then they should change their menu item to tofu dosa. They are ruining the customer experience!!!!!!!
