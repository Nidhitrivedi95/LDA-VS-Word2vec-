RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This isn't exactly the place you take some one on a first date or any thing like that, for one the use of disposable plates, cups and even forks. Half the restaurant sits under a tent in what looks the be the parking lot, mind you this is on a slant with what looks to be used patio furniture that was acquired from Kijiji or the side of the road.  You sit down pick what you want, go up and order your food and place a number on your table! Not exactly classy, but here is the thing, they have really really good food! And be sure to ask for the roasted peppers! It's a must!!!! Worth checking out if u go with a friend or two and have low expectations only go for the food! And remember it gets realllly busy so be ready to wait!
