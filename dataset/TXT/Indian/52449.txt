UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg I have yet to try the lunch buffet that everyone talks so much about, but when I come here for dinner its nice, quiet, and low lit. Its great for dates or a nice evening with close friends. The service is great and the food amazing. I'm really into spicy foods so I typically order level 5 spice and its hot but the heat doesn't mask the flavors of the dish which tends to happen at a lot of other restaurants where I order very spicy foods.
