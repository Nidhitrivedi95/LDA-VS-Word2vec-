a7ChC96ZIKh8xY7ugDPktQ ok, I almost gave this three stars but demoted it to two just because yo uknow what?  I HAVE experienced better.  Just not better in the village area.  

I got delivery because a bunch of my friends are vegetarians and it;s one of those menues that are fairly easy for that.  It was a slightly overpriced, considering I know how much real indian food costs.  And the quality was average, at best slightly above average.  If you are totally craving Indian and don't want to drag yourself to little india this place is fine, but if you don't mind going ona little adventure then definitely skip this place for some authentic stuff.

I ordered the meal for 2 and it was 44$ dollars including tip (no delivery charge but you should still tip).
And it came out to two large meals for me and my friend.  So 10$/meal ain't bad, but you could also get that experience in an awesome little hut in little india where you could smell the amazing spices and get the dining experience.

This is a very mediocre choice for the area and I'd say skip it.  the only way they could save themselves is if they slashed the prices by 50%
