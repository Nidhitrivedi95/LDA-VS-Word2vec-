auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Ive been looking for Indian food for some time and thanks to Yelp reviews, I found my new favorite Indian food restaurant. I was really blown away by the freshness and favors. The garlic naan was to die for, fresh out of the oven. Definitely coming back. Don't pass up the opportunity for excellent food, great servers.
