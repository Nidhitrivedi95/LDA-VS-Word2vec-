t4Keeuv3zkLShSgYSRYmdw Coconut Grove went thru an ownership change sometime back and since then the service and quality of food has improved dramatically.  Now having West Indian (Guyanese) owners the food is authentic Caribbean cuisine.  They make nice curry goat, stew fish and veggie dishes for the lunch hour and quite happy to accept take out orders either in person or in advance.

Unlike your typical roti shops,not much focus is on the finger foods like doubles, pholourie or aloo pie.  Its all about a reasonably priced meal that is packed with taste.

If you had a past bad experience, I enrage you to try it again.  The roti is still better than Ritz Caribbean or others in the areas.  If you want the ultimate try Lena's Curry Pot or Drupati they are two of the best Trini Roti shops in Toronto (and no offense to the many others).
