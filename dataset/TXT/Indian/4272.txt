I came here for the first time on a recommendation from a friend and I was amazed at how good the food was! I ordered the sambar vadai for an appetiser and the portion size was perfect (although it was so delicious I would have eaten more!). The chutneys and sambar offered with the masala dosa were well matched and the prices were very reasonable for the quantity and quality of food. I would eat here every time I go out if I could.
