My wife and I ate here for dinner one night and found the food to be "good" without being outstanding. Portions were small, even by the usual standard of Indian restaurants and the total came to close $70 for the both of us for a couple of appetizers a couple of main meals and some naan.

Overall there's a reasonably tasty meal to have here, but for a tiny and sparsely decorated restaurant located in an unremarkable strip mall I expect a lot more bang for my buck.

One of the few Vegas Indian establishments not to offer a lunch buffet.
