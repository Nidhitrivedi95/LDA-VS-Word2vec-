CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ Got food poisoning...

I am not sure where all these good reviews are coming from. We went on a weekend for buffet dinner.

The main course food was decent- except the tandoori chicken which was dry and tasteless. For dessert we got some melon- to my shock when I tried it, the fruits tasted ROTTEN. We pointed this our to the server, who apologized, but did not remove the tray where the fruits came from.

If you want a garlic naan they charge 2$ on top for EACH SLICE.

We ended up paying $50 before tip for 2 people- which is EXPENSIVE for an Indian food place.

What happened after is the bad pafrt- both me and my boyfriend got sick from the food- upset stomach and neaseau for 2 days. 

The only nice thing about this place is service- the waiter was very attentive and fast.

Needless to say, we will not be going back.
