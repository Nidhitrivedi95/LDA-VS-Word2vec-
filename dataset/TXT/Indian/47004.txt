t5ZHxxIAI8P_G-T_uVz9Pw PLEASE PLEASE AVOID THIS PLACE IT"S AWFUL QUALITY! REALLY REALLY BAD. 

I ate here one time and they put so much sugar in my chicken Masala that it was inedible. I asked for a refund but they refused because I had eaten a piece of the chicken. 

Honestly and I'm being absolutely honest this may be the worst Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at. 

You shame every Indian who every cooked.
