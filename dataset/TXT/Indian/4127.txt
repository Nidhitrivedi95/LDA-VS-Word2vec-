1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA We were here in Brampton to visit a friend we haven't seen for ages. His whole family took us to Sweet Palace for lunch! The restaurant itself is really modern, clean and bright. It's a medium size establishment, front left side was the counter where all the sweet pastries and savoury snacks are. In front was also a hot table where you can see what you would like on your thali (plate). You tell the wait staff what you would like and they take your order, when it's ready they bring it over to your table. The other side is the seating area. So it's not a big place, and I heard it can become really busy and packed. 

I can't really remember all the names that was on my thali, so I will just describe them. Salad, Basmati Rice, Yoghurt Sauce, Curry Pea Paneer, Curry Chickpeas, Curry Honey Paneer, & Gulab Jamun. The whole thali was delicious! I couldn't finish it all, so I gave some to my husband. Along that we also had a sizzling plate of assorted meats, Tandoori Fish, Tikki Chicken, & Ground Chicken Kebabs! The meat dish was so moist and tender, it was awesome! They also had fresh naan made in-house, it was so good, nice crisp, super soft and spongy! Also tried the Made In-House Navajo Bread, also super yummy! There was also a Curry Dumpling & some pickled veggies & onions.

At the end I finished my meal off with a Masala Tea.
I was extremely overly content! Would highly recommend this place if you are in Brampton!

They also make Fresh Jalebi next door! Super crispy and delicious! Even when we brought it back home it was still crispy!!!
