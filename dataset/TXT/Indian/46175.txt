sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ *NOTE* It's spelled Gandhi's, not Ghandi's. I'm an idiot.

Do we really need another 5-start review for Gandhi's? Sure, why not?

I can't possibly read all of the other reviews, but I'll try to throw out a few lessor-known tidbits and personal stories for your enjoyment.

- If you've never been to Gandhi's, beware of the spicy scale. Here's a comparison to usual spicy levels at Toronto restaurants:

Gandhi's Mild = Regular Mild
Gandhi's Med/Mild = Regular Medium
Gandhi's Med = Regular Hot
Gandhi's Med/Hot = Regular Suicide
Gandhi's Hot = Regular Kamikaze
Gandhi's Extra Hot = I have no clue because you'd have to be insane to order it.

- Gandhi's is NOT open on the weekend, unfortunately

- However, the owners also run a restaurant called Mother India where you can go if you're going to break down without some of that mind-blowing Gandhi's flavour on the weekend

- All of the roti is made fresh in-house on their old-school roller

- If you and a friend show up to bring back an order of 16 roti for the office they may give you each a can of Arizona for your troubles

- They only take cash, so be prepared (even if your bill is over $200 like our usual office run)

- It's basically a take-out joint since there is only seating for about 10.

- I like the saag paneer, but I keep coming back to the butter chicken. It's unbelievable.

STOP READING AND GO GET ROTI.
