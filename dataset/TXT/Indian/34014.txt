m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw I've just moved from Dubai and after living there for ten years I can honestly say that I've eaten a great deal of Indian food from a variety of cuisines and regions of the country and I know what good Indian food is. 

This restaurant is good Indian food. It's Northern cuisine, so be aware that it's going to be spicy!! That said, the food was done very well; we sampled several appetizers and they were all very well prepared. 

We also tried four different entrées (there were four of us) and except for the chicken tikka, which was very dry and over cooked, these were also nicely done. 

The service is prompt, and polite. The food comes promptly and the plates are put together attractively. 

Price is good value. 

I'm definitely going back.
