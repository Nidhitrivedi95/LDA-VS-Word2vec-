V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w Uptown Indian selections are limited for me.  The place in Latta Arcade is meh. And I don't know where any other places are.  This little joint opened up right across from the entrance of my parking garage, and I had to try it out.  MmMMMMMmMMmmmm!  So great, super friendly staff, and hearty portions.  And they didn't give me beef (ha!) about not wanting rice with my combo.  Super tasty and flavorful food that doesn't taste like it had been sitting there for ages.  So glad to have another awesome option in uptown!  Yay!
