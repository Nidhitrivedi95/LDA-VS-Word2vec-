uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg I have to say this is some of the best curry I've had in the Madison area. I've been here twice and had the Paneer Makhni and the Chicken Tikka Marsala. Loved them both. I ordered to go both times. The naan was delicious and the rice was spiced perfectly. Not only was it "fast" (I got my meal within 5-7 min) the staff was always super friendly. I will be making this a regular spot because there is a very nice sized menu to explore and I have not been disappointed so far.
