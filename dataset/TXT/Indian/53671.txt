vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w I was sure I discovered a hidden jem, but with over 90 Yelp reviews it seems everyone except me knew about this cool place.
I must warn you things here are extreamly spicey BUT if you like hot food this is heaven. An authentic vegetarian / vegan friendly Indian resturant that is also not pricey (6-7$ for a Tali plate) if only it was closer to my house / work. If you are hungry go there and thank me latter.
