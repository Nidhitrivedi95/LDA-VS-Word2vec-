Q55VH2YHdvX4JHUpWCSKrw I used to like spice shack until this incident a few weeks back.. My 4 yr old wanted halwa puri. So we end up at spice shack around noon. It was empty. I ordered halwa puri and sat down. 25 mins down and nothing as yet. Finally a waitress walks over holding up a pack of frozen baturas from the brand Deep. She explained that the grocery next door ran out of puris and if it's ok for them to serve these baturas instead!
I was shocked! 
It's probably just me but when I go to a restaurant I expect the food to be freshly prepared. I can make frozen store bought  puris at home too. 
It made me wonder what other dish items at Spice Shack came from frozen prepackaged meals from the Grocer. 
Anyways, since we had been waiting for over 40 mins and my son was hungry I agreed. 15 mins later we get  burnt baturas along with the halwa. Seems like the cook didn't know how to prepare frozen baturas. 
That's when I gave up. Since the place was empty I just told the guy in the office that we are leaving. The guy then goes on to explain that they are having trouble with their kitchen. Well... That's the first thing he should have told me when I walked in!

No more Spice Shack for us. 

Ps: while we were waiting we were served complimentary hummus with nachos since the wait was too long.
