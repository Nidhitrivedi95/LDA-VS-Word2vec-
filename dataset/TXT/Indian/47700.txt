TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We are local and found this place and was very pleased.  This is one of the most authentic Indian restaurant's you will find.  Chili chicken and Butter chicken are theeee Best.

Customer Service: Very friendly staff!! Manpreet took care of us , Very nice people! And, service is pretty fast! I would say the wait for your food is about 15 mins or less! 

Overall:  MY FAVORITE Indian food restaurant!  Highly recommend!
