J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Don't tell my Indian grandmother this, but it was the best Indian food I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I arrived just before they opened for lunch, but they let us in early and grab food as it came out for the buffet.  They had the biggest variety of any Indian buffet I've been to - somewhere around a dozen meat dishes, plenty of vegetarian items, the first palak paneer I actually liked (loved, in fact - I went back for fourths).  Plus a salad bar, tons of desserts and ice cream.  It was a little pricey at, if I recall correctly, $13.95, but well worth it for the variety and excellent service.  Thank goodness I don't live in Toronto, because I'd be there on a daily basis.
