TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Umm.. YUMM! The Tikki masala is perfect. We got the garlic naan and it was fluffy and delicious! We also got the chicken korma and they use dark meat chicken, which is so tender and delicious! Check in for the mango lassi. It's out of this world good!! Manny our waiter was awesome!! He was Super attentive and took time to give great recommendations. Oh, and he has a great bod, so a very nice view;) They have Indian music videos playing on 3 big screen TV's which is super fun and immerses you in the culture. I Highly recommend!!
