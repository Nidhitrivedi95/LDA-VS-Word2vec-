DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg We initially ordered masala dosai, medhu vada and idly. The sambhar in these dishes was ok; chutney was good. Medhu vada and dosai came out really well but idly was not liked by my partner. My partner and I are Indian and she felt she could make much better ones with lot less rawa than that was used in udupi's idly. Here came the bad part midway through our dinner-- seems their coffee filter machine was broken the time we visited them. But that did not stop the waiter / manager-looking guy with a beard from taking the second leg of our order for a mysore "filter" coffee ( as advertised). Well, right after that I had the need to confirm if they were gonna give me a coffee in traditional mysore/south karnataka style. Halfway through my enquiry, the same guy interrupts me rather rudely (his exactly reply in the form of a question was "what do you mean by traditional?"), later explaining that the filter coffee  cant be made in traditional  style cause their coffee filter machine was broken and hey! he was not sorry about it. Not sorry for almost selling me a different product than i asked for and not sorry for interrupting me! I am not sure if he thought I was making a very special accommodation request when i ordered something from the menu. If he thought so, he would be very wrong about it. Consequently, he lost the business he could have had with us for the rest of the evening. We were going to order much more before this guy spoilt our dinner atmosphere-- our bill could have easily been double and we would have also left the place with twice the satisfaction (and twice the number of stars for them).

Not all service was bad-- there was a girl who waited on us properly and took our initial orders of masala dosai, idly and medhu vada. We left a reasonable tip and we dearly hope all of it reaches the girl.
