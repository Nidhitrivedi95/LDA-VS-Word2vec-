8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Sitara was a pleasant surprise in the Indian food scheme of the C-U area, with good flavors and a casual but comfortable ambience.  The tandoori chicken was pleasantly tender and moist (a hit-or-miss in C-U).  Prices in general are OK, at $9-12 for entrees.  The only complaint is that the staff didn't cut up the naan, which made eating and sharing a bit awkward.  Stop by if you're in the area, for a casual lunch or dinner experience.
