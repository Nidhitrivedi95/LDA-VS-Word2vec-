TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw This was our first venture dining away from the strip & it was a huge success. Truly this was one of the best Indian food experiences of my life... second only to restaurants in Singapore. Fresh, complex, delicious ingredients prepared with care. The breads were outstanding. The vegetarian dishes were superb. And the whole meal was CHEAP. Win!
