yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ Super tasty!  The Naan itself is worth a trip to this place for lunch or dinner.  The rolls are super filling and now they come with these awesome tempura fries!  If you choose rice instead of naan to accompany the entrees, the portion is rice is HUGE so be prepared.  Lunch gets busy and this place is kind of small so it's sometimes hard to find a seat.  And when it's crowded, it can be a little confusing for the server to find your table to deliver food to you, as someone else said, the system for order delivery is not exactly the most effective.  But the tasty tandoor-made breads makes up for it!
