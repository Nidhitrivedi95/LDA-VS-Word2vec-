NRQSeBoEyFpiGJDf3ebtyA If I could give this place negative reviews I would! Absolutely the worst Basha I have ever been to anywhere!! The food is so disgusting, the chicken tastes awful, the salad was rotten, and when they ask you if you want garlic and hummus, they don't tell you that they will charge you an extra $.50 for chooses both (unlike any other basha that I've been to). They charge you an extra $1 for giving you a pita with your plate, and when I took the basha health plate, rather than coming with 3 salads, it came with two and i had to pay an extra $1 for another. All of this and their prices aren't even cheaper than any of the other Bashas! DON'T GO HERE!! IT'S SO NASTY!
