jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Came here got lunch with my wife while visiting from San Diego. We had the lunch special buffet. It was very good and the atmosphere and service were great too. Would definitely recommend. I wish I had a chance to try their burgers and shawarma sandwiches as well, but we were only in town for a few days. Definitely next time !
