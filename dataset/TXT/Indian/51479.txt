UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I think this place far best indian food and most expensive in the town. I and my wife step in to the place with bunch of homeless people harassing to get some change in front of the place. But the place was packed and i was little bit hungry too. Their potions are small and you have to order at least four or five portions to get fillup your self, if you are two people group. do the math!!
Mango lassi wasn't my best choice becos,  of the old taste of mango i felt and other than that food taste was great. here is the critical part of this Indian restaurant, I gave the resturant.com gift card i bought and price went up including the gratitiuty charge 18% for two people..!! TWO PEOPLE GRATITIUTY!! cmon now.... i am not a stingy ass person and i told my wife to not bring that up either. She was angry. You dont want to make lady angry, means you lose your customers. So we are not going back to this place. even though they are good service and such....
