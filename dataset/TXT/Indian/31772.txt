kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA Super delicious Indian!  I've had it all over the world, but this was the best.  Definitely get the Mateer paneer, the peas were fresh!  The coconut rice was insanely delicious.  The main thing we noticed was that we weren't overwhelmed by the spices, the vegetables themselves were the stars.  We even has desserts, and they were all perfect, not overly sweet. Even if you're not vegetarian, don't miss this food!
