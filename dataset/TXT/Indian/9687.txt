8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw I don't get all of the good reviews for this place.  This is like Indian-ish food, very bland, visually disgusting, although served by a very nice woman.  I went on a cold day and the heat wasn't on so I had to eat as much as I could while shivering at the table.  

2 things that I've never seen at an Indian restaurant--tofu and wheat pita.  The tofu was pretty awful and a piece on naan might have saved the day instead of the dry tasteless pita.   I'd go on but I'm getting a little sick just thinking about it..

The 1 good thing is that it is vegan friendly.  But I'll go to the Indian place on 6th and find a vegan option there before returning to Sree's.
