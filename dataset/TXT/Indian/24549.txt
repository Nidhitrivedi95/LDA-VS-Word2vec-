H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ Horrible.

We went to this restaurant as it mentioned Indian Hakka Chinese but the reality of the food was totally different.

We ordered vegetable manchurian which came out to be  a tasteless medley of veggies. The chilli chicken with egg fried rice that my husband ordered was also tasteless.

Only the vegetable noodles and the Singapore rice noodles were tolerable (cus we were exceptionally hungry).

The best tasting thing was the coke can. 

Come here if you want to waste ur money and get a pathetic service as the hostesses are really rude. 

NOT RECOMMENDED EVER.
