45OH7rpeWRzXelgpxs2BRw Soooo disappointed . I had been to this place a long time ago and like it so I thought i would go back. I know I won't go back again. The masala dosa was terrible, the Sambar was runny the potatoes looked like they were running out and added more water., soggy and tasteless. The Dosa was soggy.   Please save you $$ don't eat here.
