QT4Ub4DlaDX52vdnKutD0A Was curious to check out the restaurant that took over the Barzini's spot on Apache. We were very happy with the change. We dined in the early evening, and the server was pleasant.  I had the aloo palak and my friend and palak paneer - the spice level was perfect and we were happy with the portions. The meal came with naan or rice, so the bill was much lower than other Indian restaurants that up-charge for each side dish. The garlic naan was excellent, and we look forward to trying other entrees as well as the buffet.

We will definitely visit again- the food was just as tasty as other local Indian/Pakistani restaurants, but much cheaper.
