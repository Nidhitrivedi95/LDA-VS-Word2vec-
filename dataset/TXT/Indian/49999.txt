U3Ah385YhvlraXsKcEeZ4g Sat in a group of 6 and the food took 55 minutes to start arriving. Also, one of us got told her dish was not available 45 minutes after we ordered. Luckily she ordered a starter so she did not go hungry. 

For some reason they only had 1 waitress running around the whole time. She barely stopped by our table and thus did not see our need for more water. 

Variety of food on the menu and good portion sizes. I like their salad dressing. Had the jambalaya - wasn't bad.

It's too bad the wait was so long..
