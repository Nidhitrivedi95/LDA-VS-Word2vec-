gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I love this place. I love how every time I need another refill it has already been done. They have this chilli chicken dish which is little pieces of chicken covered in their special chilli sauce and cooked for long time to become delicious as it is. I have been trying to find a great Indian place for a while and this one does it for me. I love the service here and will continue to come back.
