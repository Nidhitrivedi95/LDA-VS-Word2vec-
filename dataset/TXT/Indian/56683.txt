xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg We went with friends because I had received an email from Yelp about new restaurants in my area and we were very disappointed.  We went early on a Saturday evening and we were the only ones in the place.  We ordered what we usually eat and while the Chicken Tikka Masala was tasty the Lamb Vindaloo was missing potatoes which have always been included anywhere we ever ate this dish.  Not a place I would choose to go back to.
