FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw This is one of my friend's favorite places to go when we go out for dinner so I've been here quite often. We've almost always come here in a group around dinnertime and, while it is always busy enough to let you know that this is a good spot to go to, we've never had to wait.

I'm really big into curry and I've tried all of Swagat's curries at this point. My favorite is probably their beef saag. My least favorite is probably their fish curry. Their lamb curry is good but I can't taste the lamb flavor very much, so I prefer the beefy versions more. You can't go wrong with the biryanis and tandoori dishes here, either.

Their nans and aloo paratha here are great, especially the paratha. They are a little too oily sometimes but, most of the time, it's just right. My girlfriend asked me to make some parathas at home after trying Swagat's.

What's average here is the ambiance and the service. You can tell it's a lunch buffet place but it isn't off-putting. And all the staff are nice and I've never had a bad experience. These are just two things that don't stand out very much, but could.

Lastly, I really love their complementary papadum and sauces, and the fact that they have fennel seed mix for breath freshening near the exit. It's small things like these that make it feel more authentic.
