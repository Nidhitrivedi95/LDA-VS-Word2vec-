Protip: This isn't it.

My wife and I had been here for dinner before and it was actually quite tasty. So we trucked all the way up to Craig on a weekday afternoon to try the buffet, and sadly, it didn't live up to our expectations based on dinner service.

The naan was still amazing, but the buffet selection was downright paltry. My firang side was pleased with the usual chicken tikka and pakora but I come to a lunch buffet to try a variety of different things.

If Saffron would devote more space and effort to the lunch buffet instead of cramming a small selection into a tiny alcove, it would be worth a return visit. The food quality is actually very good but the limited selection just kills it for me.
