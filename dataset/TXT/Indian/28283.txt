J6Hjazwjl0VB_NrofQZ6kg Went there recently with friends for dinner. Air conditioning wasn't effective and the staff are still learning the menu items and computer system. Overall the choices we had were good, tasty and well priced. 
Will definitely go back in a few months when things are running smoother.
