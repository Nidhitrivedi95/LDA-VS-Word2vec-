RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I still say this place is disastrous in terms of how environmentally UNfriendly it is.  Really?  After years and years of renos, we still have to eat off of styrofoam plates and use plastic cutlery?  At least the building is no longer a fire hazard of wooden planks.  It looks like a more "finished" structure than what I remember.  

I was able to try the following:  

Veggie pakora 
Butter chicken 
Lamb curry 
Curried lentils
Chana masala
Chicken kebabs 
Naan bread
Rice
Almond kulfi

The amount of ghee used is still pretty heavy but all the dishes were very tasty.  This is not a meal for anyone on a diet.  Chana masala was definitely the highlight.  Not greasy, lots of veggies, and extremely flavourful.  I couldn't stop eating it.  

Zero stars for the amount of waste produced as a result of dishwashing savings.
