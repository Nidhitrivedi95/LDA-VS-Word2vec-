auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Been here a few times since my first visit and everything still stands from first review. I do enjoy their lunch buffet, mostly for the variety and choices for $11. Cheapest way to experience the variety of foods without ordering the entire entree. Food is okay, but sits out awhile and can get old and crusty. Not a large variety, but it's about the only Indian food place near where I live so I continue to go back. All in all, it is good but I wouldn't go out of your way to visit, just the only place close to me.

Service however is always great. But maybe they could cut down on their price a little more if they didn't have 4 servers per diner.... just sayin.
