We ordered the Samosa and Paratha and it was delicious.  Had the right amount of heat and left a good tease for the main meal.  The paratha had more heat to it but was nice.

For the entrees, Vegetable Kofta curry, butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.  Al delicious.  Favorite was butter chicken.  

The service was good.  It was a mom and pop type of service and feel.

The owner was extra friendly and charming.  He even brought over some yummy carrot halwa.

Will definitely return!
