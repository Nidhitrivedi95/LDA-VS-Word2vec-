auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I've only been here for their lunch buffet which is pretty decent! It only costs about $11-12 for all you can eat and is relatively nearby if you are in the Henderson nearby. I've been to some other places which cost a bit more and they weren't as good as this place. 

My favorite dishes are the standard chicken tikka masala, vegetable samosa, garlic naan, basmati rice, and the tandoori chicken. They also have this rice pudding (which reminds me of Horchata) for dessert which is pretty good since it isn't overly sweet. 

Service is good overall and the staff is attentive. Check out this place if you want some decent AYCE Indian food for lunch!
