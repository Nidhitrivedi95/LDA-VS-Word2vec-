iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA What a disappointing lunch and it was due to the service.  I think this happens a lot when one goes for late lunch, which we did, at 12:30 pm.

The server brought our meals and promised to bring sauce that goes with one of them but she never brought it.  We had a hard time getting her attention.  She had two tables of six, one table of four and our table of two.  She was obviously busy but we wished we had gotten the promised sauce.

At the end of the meal, I gave her $50 and a man (the host?  the manager?) brought my bill back with zero change.  I approached the server at her register and she brought the change.  But . . . it was short.  I asked her about it and she said we would talk to the man at the front (the host?  the manager?).  I asked him about it and he immediately backed away from the situation by saying, "I just gave $50 to server."  ("I'm just a bystander - not my job - don't ask me" is what it sounded like to me.).   I finally got the right change.

Really, who needs all this hassle when you just stopped by for a simple late lunch?
