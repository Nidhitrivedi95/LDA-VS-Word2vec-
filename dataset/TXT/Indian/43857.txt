Twisted Curry has a fresh, modern decor that is clean and bright. They greeted us immediately and were very helpful with our orders,  offering samples and advice on the spiciness of the dishes. I chose the curry bowl with the chicken chili which was very pleasant and the Coconut-Sweet Chili Chicken which was scrumptious. The naan was wonderfully warm and tasty. Next time I will try the kabobs which they make to order.  Two of us ate for just under $20, and we have left overs for tomorrow.
