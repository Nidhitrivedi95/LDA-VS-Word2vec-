g1yY3v-5C3Xd0laRFFCEZg Horrible experience! Just regretted going there. We got our order after 45 minutes!  And when we got it the biryani was cold which is supposed to be piping hot to be able to enjoy it.  The nihari was just soup without taste. We just wanted to finish our food and we promised ourselves never to go back! The food was not up to the mark considering the competition in that area and a little too expensive for the typical Indian restaurant. We paid the woman at the counter and later realized that she had charged us $10 extra. Will never go back!
