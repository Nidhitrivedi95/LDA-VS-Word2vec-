sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Me and my friend wanted to try Indian food for the first time so went for this place because of the raving reviews on Yelp (plus the roti looks good in the pictues). So we ordered mild chicken roti that's $8.95 plus tax which totals to $10.15.

Let me just say that if you are prone to stomach aches or not acquired to Indian food, I would not recommend this since I got very nauseous after eating it. The mild chicken roti was good, but I feel like it's missing that wow factor and I think it looks and smells better than it actually tastes. 

We took it to-go and shared it since half a portion each was filling enough (I thought the box would be bigger, but I would not be able to finish all of it so the portion is big enough). They were stingy on napkins (one), and only gave us one fork and a knife (I even ask them for forks, plural, but they said it's already in the bag. Because I'm sure me and my friend are going to share one fork and a knife). 

Overall the chicken roti was okay, but what it has been doing to me makes me give them a 2/5 stars. For those who are acquired to Indian food, this would deserve a higher rating but if a newbie, prepare for intestinal problems.
