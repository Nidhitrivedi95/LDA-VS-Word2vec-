LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Thanks Yelpers, for another great restaurant recommendation! The BF and I went last night and really enjoyed our dinner. First of all, the service was excellent, everyone was so kind and attentive. 

I've only been to Indian restaurants a handful of times and each of those times was with "experienced" Indian restaurant-goers, so I was a little intimidated to be in charge of ordering (my bf has never had Indian food before). To be safe, I ordered the "classics": Lamb masala, palak paneer (spinach and tofu), and daal makhni (lentils)... they were all delicious! The masala was probably our favorite. The rice and naan (we got the garlic) were both great with our saucy dishes. Bf had the Himalayan beer (nice a light) and I had the strawberry lassi. I love the sweet, yogurty tartness of it with the flavorful spiciness of the dishes. 

My boyfriend also tried the "Red Chili Pickles" that were advertised at the table. His order was met with raised eyebrows and an "are you sure?" by our server. What we got were not even remotely close to what we know to be pickles... my best guess is maybe some type of bean curd wrapped in chili skin. It was more salty than spicy (hence the pickle name?). We asked our server what it was and he said he had no idea and had never had it before. Ha! They seemed very impressed that my bf ate the "pickles". 

I've successfully introduced and converted my boyfriend into an Indian food lover. We'll definitely be going back!
