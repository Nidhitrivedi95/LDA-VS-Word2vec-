gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw I would have given this one four stars if it wasn't expensive. But then again I am a student on a budget.

A bunch of my friends were visiting Montreal over a long weekend and we decided to try this one out. The decor was well done, the staff was friendly and the service was good. 

The food was tastier compared to most of the other Indian Restaurants in Montreal but I have had better. However they do have a really good variety of starters and appetizers and their dishes will leave your taste palate well satisfied.
