yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg This was my first time trying this restaurant. I ordered takeout I had the Shrimp Curry, rice and garlic naan. It was very delicious. I had the curry done with medium spice level. Just the right kick! Who ever the male was the brought out my food, was very nice. I will definitely be back!
