5KsvP10z9InBcI6hhqjjKg Terrible food, terrible service.  Half empty.  Rock hard balls of grease called pakoras.  Crusty jello, yes, crusty.  Warm sweet lassi.  No one to take the dishes away.  View overlooking a construction waste bin.  Lighting they forgot to turn on, and when they did, it was glaring.

I'm guessing that the positive reviews below are from family members.
