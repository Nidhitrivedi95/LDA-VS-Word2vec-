-qfZdXO2c-GpvOhr0KmNCg Yay! Super yummy Indian home delivery.  

Since moving here from Vancouver we have been searching for some solid Indian home delivery in the Plateau.  Guru definitely fit the bill.  A little pricier, but worth it.  

We ordered the Combo C online.  Food was promised in 45 minutes and it arrived ON THE DOT.  Hot and well packaged.  They even thew in a bonus yummy desert.   Really good portions with lots of meat.  Enough for dinner for two people and generous leftovers the next day.  Three people could eat easily. 

We had the Butter Chicken - rich and delicious. We find all butter chicken in Montreal a bit on the sweet side, and this was was as well, but not nearly as yucky sweet as some we have had.  Solid.

Lamb Vindaloo - Ah, the illusive spicy vindaloo - so hard to find.  Their vindaloo was mildly spicy, but I want my vindaloo to burn a little. Tasty though.  Maybe next time I will see if they can kick up the spice level a little.  

Onion pakoras - plentiful, with a generous amount of yummy tamarind sauce.  

Chana Masala - loved it!

Saag - super flavourful with a bit of spice.

Got naan instead of papadums as listed, but perferred the naan, so happy there too! 

We will be ordering again for sure.
