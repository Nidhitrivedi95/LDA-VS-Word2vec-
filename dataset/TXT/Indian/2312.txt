Large portions, great prices (5.50 for a large, 4.50 for a small), friendly service, and the food is always brightly flavored and, if you want it, legitimately spicy. The taste is completely different from the tepid Indian food one often finds. I couldn't recommend it more for a quick lunch on campus.

You can call ahead if you want to avoid the lunch rush, but I've found that even when  busy the wait still isn't that long.
