GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I am a fan of Indian food and thought the food at Tandoori was alright but not good enough to forget that my chicken tikka masala to go was about $19 including a piece of bread. Usually I have done buffets at Indian restaurants and this was my first time ordering something to go, but I was surprised to find out that it did not come with rice. Having to order and pay for rice separately is like going to an Italian restaurant and finding out that pasta is not included with your alfredo. If the amount of food I got was large enough then no big deal, but it was not enough to justify the price in my opinion. I won't be going back.
