I really like the strong and bold flavors of Indian cuisine, and also the quality of the sauces, which tend to be very smooth, with supporting notes of texture like cashew or other items to provide some 'tooth' to a dish.  I found the sauces here to be very heavy, a bit 'gloppy' and just lacking in quality - the sauces just weren't inviting to me.  Actual taste of the sauces was ok - serviceable, but nothing great.  

Also, lamb was pretty tough, and chicken had small bones (the kinds that should not be in a dish, small enough to catch in one's throat and cartiledge - just unappetizing.  Paneer dish we had was one of the better items, but sauce still had that heavy and unpleasant texture.

I have not yet found an Indian restaurant in Vegas that measures up to Origin India in its heyday.
