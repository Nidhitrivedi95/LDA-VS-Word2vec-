5mG8NptNZtvOJv1wriHCCA the worst indian restaurant experience ever - went there on a weekend for the buffet - there was no systematic seating, people walked in, grabbed the plates, and started eating while standing as there was no seating available.  people who were standing in the line are not fools to just stand and wait. people just walked and grabbed seats without considering the line, and the owner didn't seem to acknowledge the fact that there should be a wait and everyone should follow the line system. 
I cannot speak about the food as i didn't get a chance to eat there, but i was very put off by the whole arrangement, and left without eating.
