eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg I have always been curious about this place, but I feel most wouldn't because of the outside appearance. The service here is OUTSTANDING. Very friendly and very efficient!!! That alone will send me back :)
It is very cozy and quiet inside. They have a dish that sizzles and steams a lot when brought out so it has a fun presentation. Food is definitely good. Not exactly outstanding, but enough to keep me coming back. Five stars!
