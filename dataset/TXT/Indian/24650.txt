H0IE2OnPSLQSxs3atGEIbw Lancers in Stockbridge is somewhat of an Edinburgh institution and has won a number of awards including best Indian restaurant in Scotland. It's been open for quite a few years and the interior is starting to look a little tired now. it's perfectly clean and pleasant just not as pleasant as the food.


 The service is pretty good, although was occasionally a little too keen.


 Theres a fairly varied menu, with a large number of chicken dishes. A number of traditional favourites such as tandoori chicken and chicken jalfrezie as well as a good choice of everything between korma and vindaloo. A number of the dishes are available with either chicken, lamb or king prawn.


 The lamb khatta tarkary (a sauce of chopped garlic and tomato) is absolutely amazing!


 The portions were fairly large which means it's good value for money, even though it's a little pricey (mains were about £9-15).
