vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg As a vegetarian, Indian food is always a special treat because of all the bright flavors that aren't always available with other veggie fair. 

We visited Waterfalls on a Monday evening, and pretty much had the place to ourselves. Our waitress was pleasant but not very helpful with the questions we had about the menu. (There are ALWAYS questions when it comes to Indian food!) 

The vegetarian combo platter (Samosas, onion bajias, veggie pakoras) was decent, but the brown sauce that accompanied it was amazing! We couldn't pinpoint exactly what it was, and considered asking the waitress but decided it would have been a waste of time. 

We also ordered two veggie dishes (Madras Mix Veg. Curry and Aloo Mutter) and some garlic naan. It was all just alright.

Overall, Waterfalls Indian Tapas Bar & Grill was nothing special. The decor was nice, the artwork on the walls was interesting, but when the highlight of a meal is an undefinable "brown sauce", I won't be rushing back any time soon.
