e3D-zDL66uIaTFOdjJv8SQ When I first entered the restaurant and looked at the menu, I thought "wow these are downtown Toronto prices in Markham". 
I went here with family on a Sunday so the restaurant had very few people. 
We started off with tandoori chops. The meat was succulent on the inside and well seasoned and marinated on the outside. Lamb is often overdone when grilled , but this was just right. 
The assorted platter was really crisp and not too oil soaked. 

We then got the karahi chicken. This was excellent as well. Often at some restaurants, being a semi dry dish , one can taste all the individual spicing that went in. Not so at this place, it was well seasoned and the chicken was well cooked without being overdone. 
Our third dish was the navratan kurma. This was very rich and creamy with exotic spices. I am not usually the one in the group that goes "that vegetarian dish was amazing" but I did with this one.
What I also liked was that each of the sauces was unique and didnt seem like the chef makes 3 sauces which he uses in everything (some indian places will do that). 
When I left I no longer though the prices were too high for Markham, everyone in our group was happy with the meal and the service. 
This is definitely among the best exemplars of Indian cuisine I have tried.
