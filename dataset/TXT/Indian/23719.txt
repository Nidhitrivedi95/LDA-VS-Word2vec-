We frequent Indian restaurants in all major cities we visit due to lack of options in Arkansas.  I would say this was one of the best we have been too.  We visit Las Vegas often and we WILL be visiting Mount Everest during our next trip.  Well worth the cab ride from the strip and we just hailed a cab from the street when we left.
