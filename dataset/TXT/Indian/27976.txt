IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA I should have come here every night this week! In Phoenix for work, I always try to sniff out a good Mediterranean restaurant and this one is it! I can't believe how good it was... Everything was perfect. Great service, meal came out within 10-15 minutes and I asked for the salad to not touch the rice or meat and they put it in a little bowl for me. Prices are very reasonable and the vegetables I ordered on the side were fantastic. The only recommendation is to make the salad taste more like greek salad. It was just plain. Other than that, nothing but compliments. I will definitely be back as soon as I can.
