NHDdAZJqS3cf_K6HYxoQ9w Amazing butter chicken, friendly and good staff. I have eaten the Samosas,Chilli Chicken,Chicken Curry, Fish pakora,Vegetable Pakora, Tandoori chicken leg,basmati rice,freshly hand made naan breads. The dipping sauce with samosas is a tamarind sauce and the other one is a green sauce very interesting herbal flavour and spice. As a chef i can tell its home made and made with love. I always go to "Dev" and when you pick up your food you get 10% off and i usually call in my order and when i get there its all nicely packages and ready in a box. Amazing place!
