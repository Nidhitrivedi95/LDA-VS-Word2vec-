I was sold on Lamb Rogan Josh within seconds of perusing the menu.  The boneless pieces of braised lamb in thick, rich curry hit the inside "spot" that only Indian cuisine can.  The slow cooked tenderness of the meat was ideal and required minimal work with a knife.  Hearty and comforting, it was like wearing a mental snuggie.

My wife got the Saag Paneer and enjoyed every bit of its pureed spinach glory.  Their homemade cheese was a bit different than any other we've tried as it was softer, more like buffalo mozzarella, yet it still retained some of that signature firmness that made it undeniably paneer.  Maybe their secret is milk with a higher fat content?  We ordered this dish "hot" which wasn't over the top spicy, but a nice smooth burn from start to finish.   

The $6 vegetable sides were great to see as well.  Many places don't offer a half portion, so if I really wanted Chana Masala, my only choice would be to order an extra entrée.  We went with the Baingan Bharta, basically an eggplant mash which was a nice change up from the other plates.  I also liked that the bowls of rice that accompanied each dish were of generous portions unlike their only nearby competitor a few miles south, which only offer rice in a kid size.

I am curious to see if they stick with entrees for lunch or cave with the rest of the in crowd and go buffet.  That won't deter me from going back during those hours though.  Can't wait to try more!
