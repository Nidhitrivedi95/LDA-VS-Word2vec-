The Mango Lassi (a yogurt drink with mango mixed in with) was fresh and flavorful. The goat meat curry special was tasty. The plain puris/naan bread was warm and buttery. So far, all good. However, the small (free) dinner salad starter was very boring, even with the yogurt based dressing. It had almost no flavor. Authentic? Maybe, Tasty? No.

I can not recommend the chicken curry (#19). It wasn't advertised as boneless or all white meat, so I expected bones. I wasn't surprised when the larger bones are cut in half. I can even go with the flow and accept it as authentic when the chicken wing bones are cut in half. However, when the tiny rib bones are not only left in but cut up into small pieces, that it too "authentic". I had to dig out over ten small pieces of bone from my mouth.

Other than that, the decor is mostly plain and like a small cafe/diner. OK for a quick meal, but not a place you might go for a romantic diner. The service was uneven considering we were only a couple, and there were only 6 other people there. One curry dish came out with the naan, and we then waited longer than expected (5 minutes) for the second curry dish. Both dishes should have been served together. Then we even had to wait longer for the rice. Both curry dish sauces were savory, so the rice was important to our meal to further enjoy the sauces. 

The server was attentive too us, but very soft spoken. The hostess was also attentive and much more people oriented. Prices were reasonable, although the small bill they presented showed the amount charged for tax as if it was another item ordered off the menu, so it did cause a little confusion when paying the tab.
