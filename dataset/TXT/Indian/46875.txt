t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg My friends and I went to Saffron on a Friday evening and we were the first ones there as the restaurant does not open for dinner until 5:00pm. This was nice because we were able to take in the ambiance of warm tones and seating options. As more people began to arrive, I was grateful they seated the families with children in the back area, while seating the after work crowd with drinks in the front. 

I ordered the Vegetable Korma (heat option of 6) and garlic naan. I enjoy spicy food, so the Vegetable Korma was a good balance of spice and creamy coconut sauce. However, my friends who are meat eaters, ordered the Mixed Saffron platter and shrimp masala  thought the heat option of 4 was more than enough.  The paneer in the korma had an excellent flavor and I cannot wait to try other dishes with it on my next visit. As other reviews have stated, the garlic naan is amazing. The garlic had a fresh flavor and the bread was perfect for scooping the korma. 

For dessert, we ordered the galub jamun. You will get three "honey balls in rose syrup" and they are quite tasty. The perfect end to a great meal. 

As a suggestion, if you are going with a group of 4 or more, you will be fine ordering a few dishes and sharing them family style. With 3 dishes, two orders of garlic naan, two orders of  rice, and two orders of galub jamun, there was more than enough food for the 4 of us and we even took some home.
