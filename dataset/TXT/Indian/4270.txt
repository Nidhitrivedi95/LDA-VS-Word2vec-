I finally had a chance to come here for a weekday lunch to try the "Chennai Saappadu" which is the 8 course lunch meal. For 7.99 this is a deal if you like variety. This includes a cup of basmathi rice, a chapathi (wheat flour tortilla the equivalence of naan), sambar (pigeon pea stew), mulligatawny, dhahi (yogurt to cool of the burn from the spice), vegetable koottu, and a choice of veggie curry or non-veggie curry (the butter chicken was quite delicious), and appalam (tortilla chip like thing). It did not come with any pickles. For 2 dollar more you can get a mini appetizer and rose milk or gulab jamun. The mulligatawny or the sambar was very spicy. Otherwise the other dishes were quite a nice variety. One major issue is that the dishes themselves don't contain a lot of curry so I found myself just putting in the vegetable koottu into my rice and using the chapathi to dip the curry. The yogurt was a nice way to knock down the heat. So in summary, nice variety and spices, but lack of protein is a huge downer with the meal

Pros: quick service, lunch special with a large variety, south indian cusine

Cons: lack of curry and protein with the lunch special

Hidden deals:
7.99 for the Chennai Saappadu
2 dollars more for dessert and appetizer with the meal
