yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Went here for the 1st time lately, but always wanted to try it. I had made a reservation for a birthday and they had a large table already set up with beverages when we arrived. The Chai was excellent, the water was served in copper tumblers and ice cold. The appetizers and food was traditional and and it was delicious and you could choose the heat from 1 to 10. My husband chose 8 and tears streamed down his face, he enjoyed it completely. So many choices of Naan and the menu is extensive with great explanations of each dish. The staff was friendly and authentic and brought a yummy dessert for everyone.
