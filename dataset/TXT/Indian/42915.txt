RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Had dinner here and once again I was amazed! I went with a friend who has never been and she was overwhelmed at how great the food and the service was. We both had two drinks, shared two apps and then an entire each. I also had the tomato coconut bisque. Everything about our dining experience was impeccable and I will most definitely be making the drive again real soon. If your not sure what to order, ask for Vickie...he knows how to recommend something that you will be very pleased with.
