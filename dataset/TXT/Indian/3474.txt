0rrxeGhMUXZdyVt16DdKHw I love sultan of samosas because their samosas are always fresh and have great flavour. Their is usually a line but at the same time it is so worth it. I get a lot and I am part of a family of four and it takes us only like 3 days to finish them off. I would always recommend the veggie samosas but the meat are also delicious. Get the dipping sauce because it Is amazing. I would really recommend sultan of samosas always and you should check it out.
