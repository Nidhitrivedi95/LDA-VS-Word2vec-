KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA after all the reviews here you dont need me to say how good this place is. been coming here since 2007 and although i skip out for periods of time, i always end up coming back here. everything i have here i loved, especially the chilli chicken with any combo of fried rice. if you are looking for THE best bang for your buck hakka, this is the place. both the gentleman and lady who runs this place are friendly and awesome to talk to. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!
