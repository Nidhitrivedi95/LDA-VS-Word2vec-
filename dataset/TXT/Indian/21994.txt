GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw We've been here a few times now and every time has been great. Last night we had the chicken tikki masala and chicken makhani with rice and naan. We finished that off and ordered the dessert sampler which was a great way to experience their desserts. Service was great and if I could eat only one dish the rest of my life, it might just be their makhani.
