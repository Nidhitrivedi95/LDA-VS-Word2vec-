nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw Surprisingly good. Directly across the street from the capitol building in a nondescript storefront, but the interior is attractive and serene. Food was tasty, large portions, reasonable prices. Service was quite good although I see from the reviews that it has been erratic for others. My only complaint would be that when I asked for "hot" I got the American hot, not Indian "hot".
