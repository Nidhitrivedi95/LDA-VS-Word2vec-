Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w Love this restaurant. Service is great and really friendly, and this place is frequented by a lot of Tibetans! Their momos are really awesome. I also really like the chole, and their thali dish. The noodle soup is also really good. We live in the neighbourhood and go here frequently. There are many Tibetan restaurants in the area, but this is by far my favourite. You should try it!
