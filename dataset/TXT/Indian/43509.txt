ROUjTKM6H56_hJqIDKrjnw Went for dinner. Really enjoyed it. 

Food: We ordered veggie samosas as the appetizer (it was yummy).  We ordered the chicken biryani which was awesome (the spices and veggies in the rice was just spectacular! The Baingan Patiala was a creamy eggplant and potato dish and it was very delicious. We also ordered the Bengali Gobi Masala, which was a cauliflower dish in a tomato based sauce....Nothing special about that one. Pretty average. 

Spice: We ordered medium spice on everything and it was perfectly spicy for our American tastes. If you don't like spice, get mild. If you don't mind spice, get medium. 

Atmosphere: We came late in the night so it was less crowded. It has nice large windows with a great view of the street. 

Hospitality: The waiter was trying to clean up (at the end of the night), so we had to ask a lot to get things like water. (Ended up asking to keep the pitcher on the table). 

We each got a little sample of the mango lassi on the house at the end of the night, which was very delicious and thoughtful! 

Overall: Delicious food, nothing spectacular, and nothing fancy, but would recommend to a friend :-)
