ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Not only do they have the best Indian food I've ever had, they may have some the best FOOD in general that I've ever had.  This place defines "hole in the wall".

We've eaten at  several Indian restaurants around Charlotte, and none of them touch Passage to India.  I dont know what they do differently, but EVERYTHING tastes good.  We've been back several times and had the food delivered and I almost would say the delivered food was better...which never happens!  And the portions are HUGE.  My wife and I ate for 3 days on $20 worth of food.

This is seriously one of the best places to eat in Charlotte.
