Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg When I headed off to Vegas for the weekend with two of my girlfriends, we had planned our dinners out a week before.  Because we are nurses and therefore love to eat.  Two of us are Indian food junkies and knew we'd need a fix while there.
Great choice in picking Tamba!  We had made reservations for Thursday night at 7, but didn't need them b/c the place was dead when we got there.  It picked up as the night went on, but I think the location (hidden in a building behind the Hawaiian market) makes it a tough find.  We both ordered entrees instead of the buffet.  She ordered a chicken curry and I ordered the eggplant dish.  Both oh-so yum with excellent spice and seasoning.  We also got rice and naan to split, and a $30 bottle of wine.  Our total damage?  About $60.  Cheap for Vegas, huh?
Decor was nicer than the usual Indian restaurant, dim lighting, and I liked the way the restrooms were decorated.  No loud Bollywood music videos playing here.  And it's always a good sign when most of the customers are Indian families!
Our cheapest and BEST meal of the trip.
