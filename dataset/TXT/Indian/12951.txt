b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw I'm already a huge fan of India Garden, so I had a feeling that this restaurant, which has the same ownership, would be a great addition to the Lakewood restaurant scene, too. I was right!

The portions are very large, and like India Garden, not cheap. But totally worth the value. We started with Gobi 65, which are like chicken wings, but made with cauliflower instead of chicken. A great alternative to a game-night appetizer for those who want to be a little bit healthier.

Then we split the traditional southern India cuisine, a dosa. The owner was walking around making recommendations. We were leaning toward the Mysore Masala Dosa, and he recommended the Rava Masala Dosa because it's crispier. It wasn't very crispy, so I wonder how the Mysore one would be. But the filling was delicious - potato and peas, I believe.

We also got an order of the Navaratna Korma, per the owner's recommendation. Delicious. This may have been my favorite thing we ordered. Mild and manageable for the non-spicy eaters. Of course, we also had garlic naan, one of the best I've ever had (super garlic-y). We were completely stuffed with the three orders, probably could have done without an appetizer. 

Check this place out for sure!
