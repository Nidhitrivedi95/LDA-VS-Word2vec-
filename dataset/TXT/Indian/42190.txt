qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ We've eaten at many different indian cuisine restaurant. Everytime we go anywhere we try to test out a different restaurant, but none of them are ever as good as the bombay grill. Their naan is always better than anywhere else and more authentic. The dishes we get there are always more flavourful than any other place we've tried. This is by far our favourite restaurant for indian cuisine.
