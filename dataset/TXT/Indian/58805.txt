YPHUfRvUo44LvsaXRTg4fw Newmarket/Aurora has been in dire need of a gourmet Indian restaurant. Vintage Spice may have answered that call. Newly opened just 2 weeks ago, their menu offers a wide variety of appetizers and mains. 
We tried the sweet corn soup and samosas for appetizers. Both appetizers were very satisfying, especially on a chilly Saturday night. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and really enjoyed it. My friends ordered two lamb dishes: the roganjosh and vindaloo. I tried the vindaloo and it was so good. Everything had a nice touch of heat, nothing too overpowering. We didn't have any room for dessert but did enjoy a proper masala chai - it was not any of that flavoured tea bag stuff and was made the way that chai should be. 
Given that they are a new restaurant, they are still ironing out the wrinkles - we did wait awhile for our mains but received several apologies from our server and another staff member. We were not in any rush so we were fine to wait (except that, despite having appetizers, we were still hungry).
As a group, we would frequent a good Indian restaurant about half an hour away in the north end of Toronto. I'm so glad this restaurant is open in Aurora - closer to home! I can't wait to return.
