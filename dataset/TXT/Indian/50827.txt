ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w Came here for some cheap grub on the patio and it delivered solidly.  We had the chicken briyani and the chicken malai curry.  Both were great value at under $10 a plate.  I say this is definitely a value-play.  The servings are generous, but the food itself was okay.  The briyani had too much sauce for my liking.  I found the malai curry better, but the naan was store-bought (almost pita like).  The service was friendly and got the job done.  The patio is large and relaxed...but there were a large # of smokers out that night, which is a personal detractor.  

I'd come back if I was looking to hang-out on a patio for a pint and snack of some cheap food.  I'll have to try to pizza, nachos and other dishes!
