RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Aah, Lahore, my lovely neighbour... really good authentic food and casual if somewhat chaotic atmosphere.  Agree with most of the other posters :)   Prices are getting a bit 'up there' though.  

We live not too far down the street from them, and my neighbour has a running joke with her husband.  She wants him to finish a reno job, and he says he will get it done 'as soon as Lahore Tikka finishes theirs', LOL.  So far, he's had over five YEARS I believe, and she's pissed, ha ha ha.

Good spot though.  If you want cheaper or delivery, order from Makkah on the Danforth, or Chandni Chowk on Gerrard, they are both really good too.

Cheers!
