I have never really had Indian food before and me and my man went for the lunch buffet.  It is an $8 buffet and while it is not huge, what it had was diverse (at least for me). 
I was up for trying anything, which I did and it was all good!  I loved the samosas and I dipped them in a yogurt sauce that they had available.  I tried vegetable korma which was tasty with just enough heat, and saag paneer, which was different but still good.  My favorite was probably the vegetable pakora... and of course, the naan!!!
 I also tried the desserts, which weren't my cup of tea but interesting.  They have a gelatinous dessert called gulab jamun and I found out that it is soft fried cheese balls!!! i didn't love them, but I did love this place!
