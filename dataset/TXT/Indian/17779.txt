E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw I LOVE THIS PLACE! Prior to trying out Bombay Indian Grill, I had only tried Indian food once and I absolutely despised it. But when I came down to Champaign I knew I had to give it a second shot and Bombay Indian Grill was the place that stole my heart. Their samosas are crispy and cooked to perfection, their buttery naan is amazing, and their Chicken Makhani was so so good. I wish it was a more spicier dish but it was still delicious with tons of flavor. The waiters are always attentive and friendly - if not too friendly. This place gets busy quickly so go earlier or later than a usual meal time but beware of the 3-5 closing time because I had gone between those times not knowing they closed and I was really disappointed. Learn from my mistake!
