xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w I have been going to place for last 2/3 years.   I always liked the place.   I thought I should share my opinion with all yelpers.

This place is in Green Tree area.   Place is really nice and cozy.   They have a party room available on same premises.   If someone wants to have a party for 25 people, they provide you enough private place and cater food.   Parking is a bit struggle though.   It's in a strip mall where parking is shared with bunch of other places.

Staff is very well managed and they are always ready to help you if you are new to Indian food.   The owners are from South India and so the food is inspired by the south indian receipes.   They also are very flexible with how much hot/spicy you food you want.  So tell them up front and they make sure your taste buds are not burned.

They have some great appetizers.  Chicken 65 is my dish.   Other appetizers are also great and sometime we order too much those since everyone has there own preference.   If you like hot/spicy stuff, order  "Cut Mirchi".   These are chiilies deep fried in a lentil batter served with onions and lemon.  Excellent!

The Rice dishes are also very authetic and one should give it a try for their biryani items.   Biryani is Indian version of paella.   They serve pure veg biryani as well. 

Chicken curries are excellent and we always like dish called Chicken Curry.  Chicken Tikka Masala is also another dish you can't go wrong with.    Veg entrees are also excellent and we like spinach with panir, channa masala.   

Breads are also well prepared and you will be happy no matter what bread you get.  I love their butter naan.

Overall they do a excellent job and prices are very reasonable.   I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice Indian food joint.
