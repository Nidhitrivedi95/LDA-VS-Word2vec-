oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw I hadn't been here in years...we took a chance (per yelp reviews) and decided to revisit one of our old "first date" spots before checking out a play.  We wanted Greek and Indian dishes.
First, the place was clean, including the restrooms.  
We waited a very long time (20 min) for a server to appear.  We had to get the host to find her.  However, once we had service, she was friendly and attentive.
We looked at the menu-we could not find our old favorites so I went for something "safe".
We ordered the shrimp cocktail app and it was not your traditional fare.  It was seasoned shrimp in a tomato based sauce that reminded me of marinara.  It was very good, though!
The menu is quite different.  I liked the old menu items much better; I used to always get the chicken Corfu (spelling?) and it was my favorite; while my husband would get the lamb curry.  Nothing under the Indian section sounded appealing, so he also went with a classic.
This time, I ordered the salmon with a lemon-butter sauce and capers, served with red skin potatoes.  This dish surprised me with its flavor; and the potatoes were perfect.  My husband ordered a form of bouillabaisse, only it was called something else; basically, it's a seafood stew.  He said it was excellent. 
He had a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and I had the pineapple "martini".  They were slow to arrive but my cocktail was perfect.  
The atmosphere is nice; except I would not recommend sitting in the bar area by the window as your view is traffic and its loud due to it being a bar area.
The only cons: slow.  It took two hours to dine here and the place was not busy.  We had to find our server.  Also, there was nothing Greek about our food, it was more American.  I would love it if they got the old menu back...
All in all, this place is not The Mad Greek from ten years ago. However, what we ordered was much, much better fare than what we experienced at Rockefeller's and definitely NightTown as of late.
