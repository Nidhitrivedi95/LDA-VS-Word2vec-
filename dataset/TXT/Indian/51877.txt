UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Mint is my go-to place for Indian food in town. The food is great and the menu is massive, and it notes healthy, vegetarian, and vegan options as well. They also have a long menu for drinks, both alcoholic and not. The restaurant can get fairly busy, so calling ahead for a reservation or a wait time is a good idea. Try the pistachio kulfi (or four) for dessert!
