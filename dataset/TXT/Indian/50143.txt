uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA This place is fantastic!!!!  A diamond in the rough for sure.  Very clean, fresh & friendly service. 
Starter:Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower in a indo-chinese sauce) FANTASTIC!! A little spicy as it had red crush peppers in the sauce.  

I ordered Lamb Igaru- DEVINE!!! This was a sweet yet spicy sauce with tender pieces of lamb.  It also contained shone sauteed onions.  Awesome over the batsami rice though I ate it with my garlic naan.  

My man ordered goat curry- HE LOVED IT!!! Now there are bones in this dish so be careful as you eat it.  Also, very spicy so if spice isn't your thing that you may want to try something else.  He ate every bite & didn't share. 

The best part is the price...total bill for 1 starter, 1 garlic naan, 2 entree, 1 mango lasse & 1 chai tea... $42 and we had plenty to take home as left overs.  SERIOUSLY..if you have not come to this place you are missing out.
