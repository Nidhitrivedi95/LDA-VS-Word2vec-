1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g I just had a delicious meal at subba- the Nepali chicken was so flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. My less adventuresome dining partner had general Tsos chicken and he swears it's the best he's ever had. The service was on the slower side, but very gracious and welcoming. You could tell it's a small operation and just the kind of tasty find you really want to see succeed. We even got a free special Diwali treat at the end of our meal. Were already looking forward to returning to try some more dishes!
