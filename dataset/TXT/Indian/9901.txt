9cGvOaA1BYw-ByOXjNbu9A One star is for the arrogant management of this restaurant. I came here at 3:15 and despite the buffet being open, the managers were in a hurry to close shop and made me leave. The official timing was 3:30 pm. Suggest the owner to have someone who cares about business and customer service particularly near to closing hours!!!  Utterly pathetic customer service!!
