yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I enjoyed my trip to The Dhaba.  I have never eaten Indian food before so my wife wanted me to try it, because she loves it so much.  We ordered a veggie platter, which was amazing.  The fried onion treats were exceptional.  The chicken tikka masala was also very good.  

Unfortunately the lamb boti kabab was very disappointing.  It was so dry and tasteless, no joke it was like boot leather.  I even asked the waitress if it was supposed to be that dry and she said, "everything here is well done," but quite honestly that was a disgrace.  Lamb should be moist and delicious this was like steak that you get at Denny's at 2:30am.

As a side note there gulab jamun was breath taking.  I'm not a desert guy but I would suggest this to anyone try.

The Dhaba is on http://www.restaurant.com/ so you can get a great discount and I would give the green light to try it just don't order the lamb.
