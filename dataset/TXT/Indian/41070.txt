PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q We usually come for the dinner buffet since it's the best deal. Depending on when you come there might be full hot dishes or dried up remains. Large selection and generally good quality and taste (when the pans are full and not picked through) but does vary some. 

Service tends to be awful.
