uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA Where do I start?

a) The big signs on the window reading "LUNCH BUFFET" are false advertising.  There was no buffet.
b) It's the lunch rush and your restaurant is empty.  There is ZERO REASON for a 20 minute wait for food everyone knows you have pre-prepped. 
c) $12.50 for a chicken dish is ridiculous when there are only about 4 oz of chicken on the plate.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.
d) bring all the food at once.  This isn't a 4 course meal (at the lunch hour, remember) so there's no reason for the garlic naan to show up 10 minutes after the food was delivered.  

*THERE WERE NO OTHER CUSTOMERS, REMEMBER*

e) When the customer's credit card is on the edge of the table, this is telling you to take it and run it.  Making 10 trips to accomplish what you can do in 2 is NONSENSE.
f) When you finally do make a trip to pick up the credit card and I ask you to bring me a to go box, STOP AND GET THE DAMN BOX!

Listening comprehension is important when dealing with beings that use a verbal communication form.

I am sad that the friend I was trying to introduce to Indian food had THIS as her first experience.  I'll be taking her to Cuisine of India, Delhi Palace, or Priya shortly to show her how it's really done.  Disgraceful.
