0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Great food!  2 families 8 people.. Had 6 dishes of various spice levels.  We notified one of the servers one of our dishes didn't come.  They apologized and served up the dish in 5 minutes and on the house!  Had: manturian fish, shrimp pakora, chilly chicken(dry), crispy beef, beef chow mein, butter chicken.  All of them were very different than the Indian counterparts but were excellent hakka take of them. My personal favorite was the manturian fish, but  all 6 dishes were someone's favorite at the table. 5/5.
