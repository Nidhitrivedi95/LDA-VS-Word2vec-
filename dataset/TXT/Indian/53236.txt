VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg We had our first visit to Tandoori Times 2 on Saturday 3/30/2013 meeting friends for dinner. Please note that there are three of these Restaurants in AZ: the original, #2 and #3, so the reviews could be misplaced. We dined at the location listed--8140 N Hayden Rd.

I did read other reviews before dinning here. One  review warned: "We ordered 2 orders of garlic naan and it was burnt. Not just a little over cooked, the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt."   I "was going to" state: DON"T BURN THE NAAN when we ordered-but I didn't. The result was BURNT NAAN BREAD!

We ordered the Tandoori Shrimp for an appetizer @ $5.95 and it was very good. My wife ordered the Mumbai Curry Prawns @ $13.95 while I had the Chicken Tikki Marsala @ $12.95--kind of Americanized with little taste. My chicken was prepared unlike any other Indian Restaurant we've visited. It was ok but not real Chicken Tikki Marsala--very different! Additionally we ordered: Seasoned rice @ $2.75, Garlic Naan @ $2.75-BURNT! + Mango Chutney @ $1.95, Diet Coke @ $1.95 & one 22 ounce Kingfisher beer served with a WARM glass @ $7 happy hour price--FROZEN GLASS PLEASE!. Cost for above was $49.25 + tax & tip. Reasonable cost for this meal. Our friends ordered something different but the end cost was similar. 

Opinion on the meal: We like our meals to be HOT-temperature wise. When you place hot food on a cold serving plate, the heat is transferred to that plate. Other Indian Restaurants we've dined in use preheated  copper kettles or cast iron skillets to serve the food which remains hot. I ordered the food at a spice level of 6. Each restaurant has a different meaning for the level of spice. I would recommend a higher level of spice here. DO NOT ORDER the Naan Bread unless you like it burnt/black on the bottom. Service was very good and the restrooms were clean.

Very strange as Tandoori Times has a Belly Dancer. Maybe this restaurant reflects a different region of India? We feel that they serve an Americanized style of Indian dishes. For my wife & I, Tandoori Times 2 appears to be "different" from other CLEAN Indian Restaurants we have dined in AZ--within 77 miles (as per Parani G.yelp review of 1/18/2012) + UT,  NC and NYC. My rating reflects the burnt/black naan bread, low spice level and the meal that cooled off rather fast.

Read a SIGN in the Men's Restroom---Free Wi-Fi--ask your server for the password.  Interesting sign placement! Don't know if the Ladies restroom had THAT sign.
