pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ i was very happy with this place. the food was delicious: onion bhaji, chili paneer and butter chicken. none of it was too sweet and in fact, the flavours were nice and the paneer had a nice heat. The garlic naan was nice as well and freshly baked. I would totally recommend this place. the service was also good.
