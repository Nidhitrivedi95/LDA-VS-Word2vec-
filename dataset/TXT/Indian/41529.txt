q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw Very friendly staff who will take special orders.  Wife and I had the tandoor chicken seekh kabob and chana masala.  Spicy with great flavor for both.  Their garlic naan were great.  Also had the kheer for dessert.  That is my new favorite thing in the whole world.

We will definitely be coming back.
