De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA If you are looking for your dose of South Indian non vegetarian food, this is a great choice (although my favourite in this category is Karaikuddi in Scarborough). They have a lot of options and are quick in their service. The challenge that they have is the restaurant is always crowded and sometimes miss (or delay) the order which wasn't in their original list. However, the Manager or Owner  is pretty proactive in responding to the requests. Also, the restaurant doesn't understand the concept of "mild" spicy. It was still spicy for me. LOL.The restaurant has a dedicated parking and makes it easy if you are traveling with family. I never fell lin love with the place but won't mind visiting it again.
