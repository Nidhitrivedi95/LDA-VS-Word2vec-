rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Very good food great service excellent family place......I would love to give it a 4 or higher but the meet in portions are getting less and less. My family eats here at least 5 times a month and this time I had to call to complain after ordering $61 in food and it was 80% sauce ...I called to tell them how disappointed I was and they corrected the situation by remaking 1/2 my order....

But when prices are rising faster than salaries and eating out is a choice not a necessity and when your dollars have options consistency matters.

I'll give it one more chance and I hope it will continue to be my restaurant of choice
