0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw First time here and first time for Indian cuisine. A friend told me that it was the best Indian food she has ever tried so I tried it. I ordered take out. They were so nice and friendly. They offered me tea while I waited. I had the chicken korma with rice. It was so flavorful and delish. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes. They had a huge selection of dishes to try.
