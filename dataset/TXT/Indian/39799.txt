P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg My sister, boyfriend, and I went here on Sunday being really hungry after a cardio workout. My sister ordered a small bowl of crab and corn soup. She appreciated it, given that it is her favorite soup. My boyfriend and I had the Yang chow fried rice and manchurian chicken.

We were disappointed as fck. It was mediocre. 

I am sure that anyone who is extremely hungry would have anything on his/ her mouth taste delicious but their dishes were blant. 

The interior of the restaurant was a 4/5. The food though was really disappointing. 

I wasn't happy. I am not coming back. Poor choice for us. 

Food pricings are cheap though.
