iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w Ancila's is a personal favourite of mine and the food is always cooked fresh to order. While theres usually wait times of 30-40 mins the food comes out fresh and has never dissapointed.

Today we had the beef karahi and the chicken briyani both spice level 5 which was more than enough for me and my girlfriend. I can usually handle 5 but next time ill have the spice at level 3. 

Btw shes on vacation july 9 2017 to aug 9 2017 on a journey to find new dishes for the restaurant.
