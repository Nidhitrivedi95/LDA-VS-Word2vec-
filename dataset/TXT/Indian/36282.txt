nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA Went to there Malabar Food Festival a few years ago and was blown away.
It was a huge buffet for $25 and I had never tasted Indian food like it before. I was super impressed.

Went again for lunch a year later and a few weeks ago, I used a groupon I had purchased a few months ago that was going to expire.

Food: Indian Food from the province of Karali. Someone knows what they are doing in the kitchen in regards to spice.
Atmosphere: not much
Service: Friendly and efficient.

I noticed they are no longer open for lunch. I asked why and he replied "not enough business". I truly hope these guys survive.
