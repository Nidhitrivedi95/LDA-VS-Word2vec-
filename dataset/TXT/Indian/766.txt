The restaurant really aims for "fine dining" and does a decent job at it via beautiful decor, presentation of dishes, etc . Service was formal and professional but slow between courses. 

Chicken main: Murgh Lababdar. This was tasty with the garlic naan I ordered. The sauce had carmelized onions, fresh tomatoes and cream. 
Beef Kabobs: Disappointing - really unappealing visually. Colour was red with how much masala was in it. 
Kulfi dessert: Better than I anticipated, very rich in flavour and good portion for $6 at this restaurant.
