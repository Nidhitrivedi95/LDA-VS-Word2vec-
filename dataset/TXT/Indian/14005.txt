In Delhi's on Nicolson street, which is a pretty busy street, as far as Edinburgh's concerned (though it's no Princes Street), so the bustle of people always seemed to keep it well hidden. The outside is white with scrawling letters, and it has two large windows that show a whole bunch of colourful drapes on the walls, and similarly colourful pillows on the seats. I can't really decide whether it's tacky and overwhelming, or quite comforting. The pillows are definitely comfortable, in any case.

They serve a variety of Indian cuisine, as well as lassis, juice (passion fruit, lychee and more!), delicious chai and coffees. I had a desi coffee when I was there, which was FULL of cinnamon (always a good sign). The food's normally less than a fiver, and you get a pretty good, filling amount. Around the cafe, and inside the bathroom there are loads of magazine photos of Indian stars and they show music videos on a small TV.  

I definitely recommend going in for a desi coffee (if you're a fan of cinnamon) and a vanilla flavoured chai if you're around the area and want to get away from the sirens and bustle of buses and cars on Nicolson street.
