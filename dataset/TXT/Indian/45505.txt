However, I came at the end (close to 2:00), so I had the impression that it may have been sitting there for awhile.  Nothing was really spicy.  The "sneeze guard" (Is that what they call it?) glass was opaque and kind of dusty.  

I did enjoy the naan and the curry.  The Chicken Tikka left a lot to be desired.  Not as flavorful as I had hoped.

I was the only one in there for the most part.  A few ladies did show up later.  The service was great- they were very attentive.  

The atmosphere is simple.  Dim lighting.  Maybe a dozen or so tables.  Clean (if you don't count the glass at the buffet).  Friendly.  

Was the $10 lunch buffet worth it?  I'm not sure. The best I can do is say that this place is "ok".
