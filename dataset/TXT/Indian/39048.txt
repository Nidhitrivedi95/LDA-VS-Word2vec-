Oq4frcNpND8e_SGdidzzbQ Voujon prides itself with modern(ish) Indian and Bengali food to the extent where it has positive reviews in its restaurant window from various local papers or diners who has testified.

Dont let these fool you though, Voujon isnt as great as it claims.

The 'modern' cooking is uninspiring, and totally lacking the flavours that traditional Indian food would deliver in an instant. This pretty much described the dissapointment we felt for the whole meal - lacking that certain something, the punch as it were. The food generally tasted like something you could buy from a supermarket, but was way more expensive.

However, Voujon has some redeeming features - the restaurant is beautifully modern and elegant - and the staff were helpful.

Overall, Voujon was a dissapointment - and I doubt Voujon will post this review in its window.
