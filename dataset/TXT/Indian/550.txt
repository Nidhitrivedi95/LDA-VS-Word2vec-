-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g Had eaten here several times under its previous ownership and thought we would give it a try.  Worked our way around the "waterfall" and someone came from behind the bar to seat us.  Found a number of interesting options on the menu and ordered an appetizer, two entrees and naan.  After fifteen minutes, the waitress came back to tell us that one of the entrees was not available that night.  We selected another.  It didn't take long for us to notice that a door bell chimed every time someone went in our out.  As there was a steady stream of takeout orders, the bell was chiming constantly.  The bell was necessary because one couldn't see the front door from the bar where at one time I counted five employees hanging out.  After waiting forty-five minutes, and being unable to flag down our waitress, I went up to the bar to ask where our food was.  Five minutes later, one of the entrees came out.  Another five minutes and a second one came out.  We were almost done with these when our appetizer came out.  At the one hour mark, our naan arrived.  I would have given this place two stars as the food, once it arrived, was fairly good.  The final straw was when the check came and either the owner or manager asked if we could leave the tip in cash as otherwise, it didn't come to them???  Never heard that one before.  Keep this up and there will be a third owner soon.
