LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw One of the best Indian food I ever had in Charlotte. I and my husband has tried almost every Indian restaurant but Jaipur Restaurant has the best food quality and even the quantity. Feels like home back in India. 

The owner is also very nice and kind. I will recommend this restaurant to everyone.
