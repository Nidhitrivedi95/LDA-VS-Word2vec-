q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw This review is for eating there. We have never tried their buffet, so don't know about that..
The service was horrible though one saturday night we ate here. very slow service. we were practically filling our own drinks at the fountain.. no condiments brought with food. no chutneys brought with pakora.. forgot to bring our drinks.. super expensive lassi.. paneer dish had practically no paneer in it, it was mostly all onions.
