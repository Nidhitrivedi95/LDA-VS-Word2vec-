_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg Not fancy nor do they have an extensive selection. In fact they are just a few chairs and tables in the back of an Indian market. But what they make they make well. I specially like their butter chicken and chicken tikka masala.  Their tandoori chicken is served on a bed of onions and is not as interesting. As well he just doesn't stay warm. They serve absolutely delicious gulabjamoon (a syrupy doughball dessert) and have a decent Indian chai.  Hot Naan is included
