ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA The best Indian food in Charlotte...period. Cannot go there without ordering the Eelam Calamari appetizer, Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan. The price for what you get is solid and so consistent in quality and taste every time.

The Buffet is great as well (but I do wish they offered the Tikka Masala on it more often.

Plus they deliver within a 6 mile area!
