3BJhHBe9xEKe8jaIDd8SWg I've been going to Tibet Cafe for years, bringing friends to try their gluten-free pad thai. It's different from traditional pad thai and that's what makes it so unique, not to mention their steamed momos are fantastic. I'll always recommend this place and bring friends here when they're visiting from out of town.
