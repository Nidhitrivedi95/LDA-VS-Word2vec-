Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q Excellent Indian food! Easily one of the best in the west end. I've tried the saag paneer, lamb korma, and butter chicken. All are excellent, and portions are quite large. The restaurant is quite new, so they still have a few kinks to iron out, but they seem to be improving and adding new things daily. There's now a lunch menu, for instance, which will probably keep me coming back quite regularly. The people are very nice too!

All in all, it's a massive improvement from Amaya express that was in the space before!
