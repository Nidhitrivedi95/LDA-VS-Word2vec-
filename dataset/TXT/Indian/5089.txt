2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw Just had a pretty expensive lunch for two and the bill was $65 Canadian Dollars.  They do have a lunch special in the $14-15 range but it is mostly loaded with vegetables and only one meat item and we decided to do the menu instead of the special.  My overall impression is that food is average and comparable with other Indian restaurants.  However, the price is almost double or at least 150% of the other comparable Indian restaurants.  My colleague said that was the first and last time we come to this restaurant and I tend to agree with him.
