The way it works is they have fresh food they prepare everyday but also have few dishes in the fridge that have not made the same day. Haleem is always from the fridge but it's always yummy. I did not like the tandoori chicken as It wasn't fresh other than that it's most popular for its chicken biryani which is freshly prepared everyday.
I still prefer this place over Eastern Foods. 
Unfortunately the neighbourhood is not the safest and or cleanest. There are lots of ppl begging for money and will bother u on ur way out.
You can also order their food through 'Uber Eats' delivery service if you are feeling lazy.
