-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g If I could give this place a zero star then I would! The staff are misleading, rude and the food is ok but way too $$$$ for food that looks like what I feed my dog. We wanted to try a new restaurant and what a bad mistake this restaurant is. The staff treats women with less respect, the employees walk around with poor hygiene and like they hate their job. They let a homeless man walk around while people are eating. I am fine with the man getting water but at least don't have him come in every five minutes and make the guests feel out of place. When we ordered our food the server asked what bread we would like. I asked if it was included and didn't tell us how much it was extra. So when I got my bill they not only forgot about taking off the groupons but also pointed out rudely to me (a woman) that the fine print said one per table. I used to be a server and you never are rude to a customer nor do you charge them something without them knowing about it first. So the groupons were never used or given back. So a $20 dinner turned into a $50. WOSRT RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!

WATCH OUT FOR THEM CHARGING YOU WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE!!!!!!
