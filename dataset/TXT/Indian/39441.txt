OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I have been coming to this restaurant for years whenever I feel like having something spicy with flavour. I usually call ahead and order take out for pick up and the guy on the phone always seems like he's in a hurry to hang up. I had dined in once with a couple of friends over 5 years ago to celebrate my birthday. The food portions were more than we could finish, with the bill around $40 for three people including taxes and tip. I just found the dining area busy and a little crammed, but it was an ok experience and the service was also surprisingly acceptable at the time. 

As mentioned by others you need to spend $20 and up for credit card use and I think that the $20 and up rule also applies to 10% cash discount on take out orders. The prices have increased over the years, but they still have reasonably priced dishes that you can share. They also used to offer free white rice with some orders before but now they charge for it, which I think is now $1 more. I usually stick to certain of my favourite and regular dishes like the Manchurian chicken and beef with chilli sauce, so I haven't noticed any change in taste and quality. I never had any bad experience with the food.

Today I had ordered crispy deep fried shrimp for take out and they were still preparing it when I arrived. As I was waiting for the order I looked around at the empty main entrance tables and chairs which must be the overflow area whenever the inside dining room is full. The décor does look outdated but the place always seems busy. They only thing that looked out of place was that they used pieces of cardboard under a couple of the table legs to keep them level. but other than that the place appeared clean and maintained. The shrimp I had ordered was also crispy, fresh and hot.
