_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg I've been looking for a decent Indian option in Central Phoenix, and this place seemed to be getting the best reviews.

The good?  The naan was at the table when we were ready to eat, which is nice.  The service really was pretty decent here.  They had veggie samosas, and a couple of different daal dishes.  The paneer tikka or whatever it was called was good, and something I don't typically see on Indian buffets.

Unfortunately, the curries seemed a little too soupy for my taste, and there were only two options (Curry Chicken and Butter Chicken, booooooring).

I guess I'm now spoiled after so many excellent trips to Kabab Palace in Tempe.  Oh well, I guess I still don't have a good Indian option for Central Phoenix.  At least the price was reasonable.
