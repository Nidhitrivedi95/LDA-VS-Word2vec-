3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Specifically asked for spoons and forks as I am staying at a hotel. Guy shows up and confirms that there are spoons and forks in the bag. I paid him for the food, $9 or $6 delivery charge and $5 tip only later to find out that there was just really bad quality food in the bag and nothing else. I LITERALLY THREW MY ENTIRE ORDER AWAY, PAID $50 FOR TRASH. If you guys want I can give you online lessons on how to cook good Indian food? Seriously, I won't charge you a thing. Don't scam people by offering something that you don't even know how to cook.
