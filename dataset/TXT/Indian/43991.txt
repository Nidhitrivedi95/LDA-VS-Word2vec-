RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Love this place!! Since I was brought to this resto, I find myself craving for it occasionally....

Lots of goodies on the menu.... Lamb chops and Biryanis are my fave!! Try their imported drinks to add to the experience!! Oh, talk about speed.... You place an order at the front, sit down and within 10 minutes, your food is served (HOT and SUPER TASTY!!)

I have never been to Pakistan, but this is authentic all right (so I've been told).

I'm going back, for shizzzzle!
