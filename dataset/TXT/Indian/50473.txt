UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg This place reminds me of Indian eateries in Sri Lanka and India everything about it. The interior is painted yellow and red and is playing instrumental Indian music. 

The waiters are friendly and has knowledge of the food in the menu. When ever you want to order any thing or call a waiter there's a button in the side of the table to call them.

I had butter chicken and saffron rice. The portions of the rice was not enough to finish the butter chicken but then again butter chicken is mental to eat with naan. When I asked for the butter chicken the waiter asked how spicy I wanted it and I took the spiciest they make it, to my surprise they actually made it spicy and still flavourful. The rice had the aroma and the hint if cream and spices was present in the rice such as nutmeg and other good things.

I half to get a naan because the rice only let me finish 75 persent of the butter chicken. They also ask you if you want the naan with butter or plain. To finish off i got a mango lassi which was ok not the best but i have the feeling it's pre made because as soon as i ordered it she came back in less than a minute with a tall glass of mango lassi with a straw. 

All in all i spent 26 dollars and it was well spent.
If are in the area and hungry i would definitely recommend you try this place and not the one right next door to it
