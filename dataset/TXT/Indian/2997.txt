0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw Great Indian food this side of the Valley.  Located in Avondale off Dysart with lots of available parking.  
The restaurant itself isn't fancy, and upon entering, is a large room with tables and chairs.  No small nooks or partitions for privacy.  Adequate lighting with small screen TV's on the wall playing Indian music.  The tables and chairs are adequately spaced with lots of room between adjoining tables and chairs. 
Staff are friendly and acknowledged us immediately on entering.  Menus were immediately brought to the tables along with water glasses being filled as well.
Menus were easy to comprehend and staff answered any questions we had.
My only issue is that I didn't like the pricing structure for the dishes, i.e. one had to order items of their dish separate.  For example, if you order the Curry Chicken dish, it doesn't come with rice or Naan bread, those items had to be ordered separately (-1).  My opinion is that as highly priced as some of the dishes are, perhaps it should include simple side dishes to accompany the main dish.
Overall, great restaurant, staff, and the food tasted great.  I heard they offer a lunch buffet which will certainly bring me back!
