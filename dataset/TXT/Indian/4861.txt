2RtOfUD8-jbdHiBr0CUckw My friend and I went here yesterday, Friday night after work. It was only 6pm and the place was already getting busy, so it's obviously a popular spot.

The food was INCREDIBLY good...amazing, in fact. I would give the food 5 stars but I'm bringing my rating down to 3 stars because I thought it was expensive when you factor in the portion sizes and the fact that the decor is kind of ghetto. 

I've been to some really nice Indian places downtown that have the exact same pricing but much nicer decor and slightly bigger portions. I'm a 115lbs female and if I thought the portion was too small, I imagine if you have a man-sized appetite you'd have to order 3 dishes for yourself.

I had the murgh lababdar which is an absolutely gorgeous chicken curry with some tomato, onions, cilantro and cream base. It was $14 and it came with about 3oz of chicken (4 large cubes) and 1/2 cup of sauce...just to give you an idea. It tasted absolutely amazing though! 

We also tried the channa masala (chick pea curry) which was equally tasty. I had a garlic naan bread (best naan i've ever had) and we ordered some pappadoms with mango chutney to start.

The service was fast but I wouldn't save the waiter was especially friendly, didn't say much, but he took our order and served the food quickly. Water glasses were filled up promptly. The building is kind of old and they should think about at least cleaning up the ceiling and slapping down a few coats of paint at minimum.
