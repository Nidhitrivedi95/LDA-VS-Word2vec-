RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg I found royal india after i was in town for a conference and was staying at the rio hotel in las vegas. Let me first off tell you how excited i was to find a nice sit down indian restaurant. I had never had indian food before and decided to give this place a try and let me tell you how happy i am that i did.

I walked into the restaurant to see such amazing decor (the two large wooden elephants are breathtaking) and a fully stocked bar. I was immediately escorted to my table ( which was extra comfy) and my server came with a basket of  Lentil flour cakes ( which were DELICIOUS!) and cup of water.  I met my waiter Daman who was very easy to talk to and really helpful and patient when he was explaining to me the different dishes they had. I was a bit  lost since i do not normally choose indian cuisine so i let him decide what dishes i should get. And i am so thankful that i did.

 He recommended i get the Samosa chat as an appetizer , which was this crunchy potato filled dish paired with a tamarind sauce and mint sauce and some yogurt.

 For the main course he recommended i get the Chilean sea bass tandoor ( which melted in my mouth literally ) and the lamb chop masala .The spice level was on point and glad i took his recommendation of ordering rice and naan with the order. 

I dont understand why this place has so many low ratings i mean every restaurant i have been to in vegas is as expensive if not more than the price i paid at royal india. The food, the service, the quality is well worth the price i paid.

Royal india, you have made a fan out of me! ill be back for sure! Thanks!
