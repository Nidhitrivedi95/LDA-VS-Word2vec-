vzjmi_Cxom5b1OVQC3B6MA Food is really good here an very inexpensive. There should be more people here but guess it's not a good neighborhood. 

If you are getting buffet you can try a little bit of everything. When I order I get the butter chicken (of course) and it's really good. 

A tip is to come early because since there are not too many people here if the food is good they don't make more.

The ambiance is simple and nice, good for sit down. The family staff is nice and friendly and attentive. Highly recommend.
