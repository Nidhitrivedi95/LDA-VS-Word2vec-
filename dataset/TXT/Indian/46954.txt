t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg The food here is fantastic, but my favorite part about the restaurant is definitely the servers. Travis and Jason are literally the best, they are super attentive and have my order memorized. My family and I come by every week at least, and never leave dissatisfied. Give Saffron a try, you won't regret it!!!

PS: Get the butter chicken
