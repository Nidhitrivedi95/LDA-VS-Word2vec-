Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg I've been here twice now and let me just say, the food is amazing. The 3 stars is based on service only. 

The first time we were there, there was a younger guy who appeared to be in charge. He was very friendly and while sometimes seemed negligent, we figured he was just trying to do too many things at once. 

The second time we went, there was an older man in charge and service was terrible. We had to wait 15 minutes just for someone to come to our table. Being a birthday dinner that we wanted to enjoy, we started by ordering an appetizer and drinks. The server (same older man), told us that they were super busy so if we don't order our food now, not to complain about having to wait a long time. I thought that was a rude way to put it, but we took his advice and ordered. 

Overall it was a good evening and the food was great, but unfortunately the pompous and unpleasant attitude of the man in charge made it impossible to enjoy 100%. We would have loved to have any of the other staff attend us, as they all seemed incredibly friendly and far more competent than the guy in charge.
