jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I know this place is kinda new but it does need some work.. 

Small but clean establishment 

Unfriendly staff, not necessarily rude but the woman waiting on us was giving off a very "I don't want to be here" vibe 

She couldn't separate our payments which was very 
inconvenient 


Lunch buffet-
The food was ok, not amazing, not a big selection, maybe 7 dishes. The side sauces weren't labeled so I had to wing it, luckily i love I Indian so I knew what everything was, they do not have chili sauce out which was slightly annoying but I asked and they brought it out.. the garlic naan was very dry and crispy, some bites better than others.
