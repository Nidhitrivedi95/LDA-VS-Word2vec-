FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA My fiance' and I are frequent visitors to Charlotte. We are both vegan, so anytime we travel we are on the search to find quality food. We didn't find out about Madras until recently while in town for a festival. I don't know how we overlooked Madras when we initially did our google search for vegan/vegetarian food years ago. All I can say is that we are ecstatic! We finally found GREAT, AUTHENTIC, Indian cuisine! We ordered the Schezwan rice along with their Gobi Manchurian (fried cauliflower). OMG, So delicious! Both dishes popped with flavor, the perfect heat (spicy), and they do not act skimpy with the portions. The gentleman that took our order was very helpful! I didn't know what I was ordering and my fiance' (who has been to India several times) couldn't recall what he would eat while he was there. The entire staff were very friendly- a place that is perfect for the family! We have been back twice since our initial visit. This is definitely our go to whenever in Charlotte!
