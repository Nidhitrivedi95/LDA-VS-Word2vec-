S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Okay, so I'll be honest, I have not eaten at a whole bunch of other Indian restaurants.  That being said, the lunch buffet is absolutely delicious.  I am relatively new to Indian food, and my friend told me I had to try this hidden gem.  

The restaurant itself is squeezed behind an Albertsons (next to a wig shop) but don't let that deter you!  Inside is very nice, and open.  Everything I had on the buffet was delicious (and I tried a little bit of almost everything!) and the servers kept our water glasses full and our table clear of abandoned plates.

I would definitely recommend this to others, and I will return (if only for the tikka masala...omg so delicious).  My friend told me that regionally, this restaurant favored the northern styles of cooking and most of the others nearby are more southern in orientation.  So keep that in mind if this is not entirely what you expected.  I found everything to be delicious.

I've been stuffed for hours. Give it a shot.  :)
