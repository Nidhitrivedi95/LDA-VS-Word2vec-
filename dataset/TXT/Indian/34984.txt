Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg We ordered the saag paneer, malai kofta and naan. The food was quite good and the naan just melt in your mouth.  The decor is pretty nice too. Service was attentive. The food was reasonably priced.

The only reason I did not give this place a 4 star is because they didn't have air conditioning on and it was a hot and humid Las Vegas evening.
