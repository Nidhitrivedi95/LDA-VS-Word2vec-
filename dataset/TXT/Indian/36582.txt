NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Believe the hype! Believe this hype because there is no exaggeration here but all of the food that this place serves is really that good! I came here with my coworkers and we all ordered something different and were craving more! Initially I purchased the Chaat Somosa because those are my two favorite items so when I seen that they had it put together I was very curious! At first I was hesitant since I myself am Indian and am use to the real Indian food, I find most places slack off on spices but this place is the REAL deal! That Chaat Somosa was the best I've ever had. It reminded me of the actual street food that I would have in India! Must go back here again!  Only thing I didn't like is that they charge $1 for Chutney which is realistically unreasonable when someone orders an item they should atleast be able to get chutney with it covered in the cost. Besides that, this place is awesome! Also, for you guys wondering the lamb meatballs are the only thing halal on the menu, I haven't tried them but those are next on my list!
