RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Went for the lunch buffet last week and we're thoroughly impressed by the food. They had a great variety of meat and vegetable based items, various spice levels, and all were piping hot. The owner was very welcoming and appreciative of our choice to dine there. The interior is a beautiful calming space and they would have gotten five stars if not for the ridiculously cold temperature inside. I'm hoping that was just a fluke, as we ate our entire meals huddled up with our coats on, which is never desirable. 

Here's hoping I've found my new favorite Indian restaurant in town!
