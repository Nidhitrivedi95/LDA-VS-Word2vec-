EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Wow! Thanks for a great meal .. Chicken Karahi was really good just like eating back home ! My 4 year old and 2 year gulped down the food without hesitation ! 

Recommend hiring more staff on the floor .. Food was very good but it got very busy and the owner may need help to manage all the walk in traffic .
