LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg It's being your own wine and/or beer with no corkage!!! The Indian food here is great, and I really enjoy the atmosphere! 

They say that every person should order 3-4 dishes but I think that's cray-cray. Two is enough for me.

There's a youthful atmosphere that I like about this place. It's clean, airy, with fun bright orange colours. So very different to what I normally experience at other Indian restaurants (all of them I'm not bothered to sit in!)

The food tastes fresh! I ordered the railway station lamb and it came in it's own mini-pot with an abundance of spinach in the sauce. I thought that was a nice change. Generally when you order a curry it mentions things like peppers, spinach, etc, but you never ACTUALLY see much of vegetables in it.. It's mostly just overly oily/creamy sauce! 

My group bought a few bottles of wine to bring, and once our table was cleared, we kept on drinking! What was nice is that we never felt rushed to leave after we finished eating. It felt like we stayed an extra hour afterwards and they didn't mind at all...

Anyways, I know when I want an Indian I will be here. Railway Lamb get.in.ma.bellay.
