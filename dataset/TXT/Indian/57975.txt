yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I went here on a Friday night with recommendations from a few Indian friends. I was very disappointed with the vegetarian selection. Of the "traditional" indian drink selection; they were completely out of all the drinks. I asked for my curry "hot, really hot and spicy." It was not. We had a group of 5 and half of our table had to wait for silverware after their food arrive. Then it took them about 35 minutes to bring us our check, nor did we get any water refills, all night. It was a bad time all round.
