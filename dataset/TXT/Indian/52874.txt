v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug We have gone to Coriander several times with our two young children and have always had a decent experience with the food/service. The buffet is pretty good, there is a good variety of options, but we've always enjoyed the quality of the menu items when we have the time to sit and wait (the service itself has never been memorable). On our visit today we were very disappointed to see that we were charged for 2 "kids' buffets." Our kids ate 3 bites of rice and nothing else, but we were informed by our server that this was a new charge for all kids under the age of 10. We've been to almost every indian buffet in Pittsburgh and have never been charged. For this reason I'm not sure how often we'll visit, but I do hope it does well since it's located in my neighborhood and is a good option to have.
