WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA We (group of 4) visited the Host on  a saturday evening. We showed up without any reservations, so we understood having to wait for 10 minutes.
For beer, i would recomment cheetah on tap. For entree we ordered the lamb biriyani, lamb shank in gravy (Nali ghosth), dum murgh (chicken in a rich sweet gravy) and Dal makhni (lentil preparation) and of course Nans for the table.
What I liked:
The food was really good. The lamb dishes were really tender and well seasoned, which is rare to find in most restaurants. What impressed me about the menu was the unique choices they had compared to most other indian restaurants. The biriyani was excellent, probably in the  top 5 for indian style biriyanis from among the restaurants i have been to. 
What I didnt like:
The service was just horrible after they brought the entress. No refills on water, until we flagged down a waitress. I wanted more beer but was done with dinner by the time they came around again. And to top it all the waitress started clearing the table before we were done, until stopped by us. I have eaten at their yorkville location, which has much better service.
