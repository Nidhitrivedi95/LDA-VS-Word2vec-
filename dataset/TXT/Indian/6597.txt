45OH7rpeWRzXelgpxs2BRw This is one of the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. We ordered dosa and I cant believe we got a soggy and cold dosa. We returned it and told them to give another one. The second one tasted really bad. Infact, I wont even call it dosa, i would call it wet hand-kerchief served in a plate. The dahi vada ( dumpling dipped in yogurt ) was also bad! The dumpling was not cooked properly and I can taste the raw dough. 

The funny thing is they switched off all the lights in the restaurant before 1 hr of closing time. They had only one light above our table and we were eating. Cheap restaurant and cheap food! Please stay away. Iam quite surprised why ppl gave 4+ rating for this restaurant and I went there with good hopes. But, we were disappointed.
