i6N0e1zVhkQvof_acn85Og We ordered delivery when we were too lazy to head to Little India for some good Indian food.  Prices were fine and the food was great.  It did take about an hour to show up so in the future I'd probably be sure to call well ahead of time.  Really good samosas, delicious lamb madras and the butter chicken was nice too.  Also went to their location to eat in but as there was a street fair we couldn't get a Thali plate but got some nice containers with chicken biryani, butter chicken, samosas again and good mango lassi.  Very inexpensive for a good meal.
