uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg Stop here for wonderfully fresh, fast and ethnic Indian cuisine. Sit in for a casual dinner or lunch in fast food style booths, or take out with you. Either way, you'll be treating your taste buds to delicious Indian food. Very glad to have this new addition to our side of town.
I recently stopped in with my son, and was unsure of what I wanted to order this time. A young man at the register recommended the biryani. It is their specialty, and is very good (I've had their chicken biryani before and it was wonderful). After telling him I was thinking about a curry, he then recommended the qorma, so I chose the vegetarian qorma. Anazing! The beautiful enticing aroma itself is enough to put me over the edge. I asked for medium heat in spiciness, and next time I'll ask for mild, cz whoooo doggie.... it kicked for sure. Even my husband who likes spicy things was taken aback. But, hey, a sweet mango Lassi helps cool things down. I love their food here. I could even feast on their basmati rice, and all it's amazing aroma and taste. Everything is very nicely done here. I highly recommend!
