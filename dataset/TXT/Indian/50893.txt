uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w Another excellent buffet dinner ($10 cash!). They have a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes, with sides and dessert. Tonight the saag mushroom was verrry creamy. The chicken tikki masala was sooo good! The dal was spicy but the curry was not. The soji was simple but good, not too sweet. Perfect naan. Eat up!
