-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ I absolutely loved their Chana batura!! So delicious. I ordered the mango milk shake, pain puri, dosa, and veggi thalli, and everything was SO GREAT!! The only thing is the restaurant isn't super clean and it's not fine dining! Defiantly would be going back when I am in Brampton next
