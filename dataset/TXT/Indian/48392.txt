TIDJDtkSt4gB-7sf8tmhug Lovely food  never had a bad meal yet, and it's great to have access to Thai food without having to go all the way into the City Centre. Never tried the Indian menu which is the primary cuisine, but I hear through friends that it's just as good. Also, the staff are really attentive and pride themselves on giving a really good service to customers. There's even a couple of really good looking waiters which is always a bonus! Finally, to top it all off, they also offer a takeaway and delivery service that stretches several miles  they even deliver as far as Broxburn! Well done Abida  you certainly have earned your 5 star rating!!!
