GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I've been here twice already. Dining area is very clean and bright. Food was solid, but wouldn't say it's spectacular. Out of all the dishes I've had here so far, I would say Malai Kofta is my favorite. Being that there aren't too many Indians on this side of town, I didn't really come in with really high expectations anyways. However, if you're comparing this to restaurants in areas densely populated with Indians (like where I'm originally from in NJ) this is about a notch below that. I would give this a 3.5 stars, but since the prices are fair (especially the lunch specials), portion sizes are quite large, and the chai is free, I'd bump this up half a star.
