gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My bff and I wanted good Indian food.  Yelp led us to a different Indian restaurant but because it was New Year's Eve and there was a ton of traffic crossing Las Vegas Blvd, we opted to go here instead.  We were happy with our choice!

My favorite Indian dishes are Tikka Masala and Palak Paneer with naan.  However, we saw that there was a dinner buffet line.  We asked, and to our surprise, it was only $10.99!  Sold.

Typically, dinner buffets at restaurants have a limited selection.  At Mt. Everest, pretty much all of their entrees are included in the buffet.  I can't remember everything, but I know they had about 8 different main dishes (including my two faves above, and about 3 different curries), samosas, dessert, and fresh fruit.  They bring unlimited fresh naan to your table.

Everything was so good.  We are definitely coming back next time we're in town.

Definitely worth the $11!

I came here on New Years Eve and at the end of the night, the server gave me a rose.  How sweet!
