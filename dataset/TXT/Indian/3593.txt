0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I've been to this place 3 times and every time the experience has been the same.  We have never waited for a table since most people I see just come in for pick up orders.  The service is so great here, always attentive and any time you want to take left overs home (which is always due to the large portions), they even pack it for you.

Prices are reasonable and taste is great, not overly oily like some Hakka places. Highly recommend it.
