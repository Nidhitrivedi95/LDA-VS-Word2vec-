jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg We had a delightful lunch at Jewel of the Crown on a Saturday afternoon. The November weather was perfect and we were able to sit outside, listening to the next restaurant's live entertainment. 

We ordered off the dinner menu rather than get lunch specials. The tandoori chicken was very good and had a nice kick to it. Likewise for the chicken tikka masala, a generous portion with lots of wonderful creamy sauce. It was also spicier than I have had in the past but was excellent. The only disappointment was the naan bread, which was nothing special. 

If I were in town again I would absolutely go again to try some of my other Indian favorites. 

The hours are unusual so make sure they are open before you go.
