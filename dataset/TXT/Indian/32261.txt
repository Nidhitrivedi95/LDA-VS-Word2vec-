LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg This place is amazing and has finally reopened as Nirvana Indian Cuisine. You can reach them at 480-483-9284. They are located at 14891 N. Northsight Blvd. #119. We were shocked when they closed and tried finding a new place but none were as good as this place. Simply the best!! They are taking phone orders now and plan to open officially at the end of September.
