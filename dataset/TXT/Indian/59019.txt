yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Ok, I already tried the one they have on Riveira Casino. Frist impression of that place wasn't  that great. So i had spoiled potatoes in my Favorite dish (Dosa). After that i never went there. Then i heard this place, gave the frist try with our family. in the evening time wan't that busy and we had great welcome from the front desk and the waiter guy was kind enough to bring three high chairs for our baby to make the broken one replaced. he was no smile and pleasent. Bar tender dude was ecceptional and he knows what he doing. he made great magarita and his generous service was make any one happy. i tried the Chicken tika Dosa twise... really... it was that good.. Only the down fall was the shrimp biriani the shrims were bad taste like they were uncooked. 
     The waiter dude " Santiago Fernandez" is a collest indian waiter i ever seen. I think this dude knows what he talking about when he is explaining the food. Even he gave me wierdest messurment of the legnth of the Dosa that chef made in the kitchen. It was unacceptable but belivable fact. lols to my self..... we all happy about the service and the prices but they finally took the shrim beriani put of our bill by Manager Raj... Keep his mustache perfectly fine. $220 something dollarasss.. went down to $160 kindof....Bless me Groupon!!! 
   We will go back thats for sure and we will send more people.. more Sri Lankans of course!!!!
