m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew The price for dinner is $14.95 (or something close to $15).

Pros:
-dinner buffet (most indian places only have buffet for lunch)

Cons:
-the selection was abysmal. Most of the stuff I wouldn't eat.
-butter chicken had bones in it
-no lamb curry, chicken curry, etc
-not worth the $15!

I recommend going somewhere else... anywhere else. It's yonge st, lots of options. Like Salad King, Chipotle, etc.
