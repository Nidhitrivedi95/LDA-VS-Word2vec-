f6T2YaTfGoSyQV-l4jzrjw Stopped in for lunch and puck some sweets. If you keep your eyes and nose close outside and make your way inside then you can find great sweets and decent Punjabi vegetarian food. There is a pan shop next door and outside is coated with people spitting that on side walks. Disgusting:( ordered a thali and you can pick which sides. Do not order puri since the one I got was cold and made who knows when. Completely deflated and was more like batura instead of puri (supposed to be fluffy but was chewy). Chana was bit hard and so was ghobi... they had some rice and attempted salad but both were not edible. Ended taking a spoon each and throwing rest away. Naan looked fresh. All in all people who miss home cooked Punjabi meal should visit. There are Ana poorna in Santa Clara with better taste yet home cooked. Sweets looked good and yet have to try them. Will visit again if the outside area gets bit cleaner.
