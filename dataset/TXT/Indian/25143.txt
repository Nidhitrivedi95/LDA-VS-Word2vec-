HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw Their food is really awesome. I have yet to find a Hakka restaurant that can beat them. I would question the bad reviews on here. 

I have never been disappointed with the food. Plenty of friends and family have gotten hooked on Faleys after trying their dishes. Huge portions and great value.

The interior of the restaurant is truly nothing special - this is totally true. I always opt for take-out - and take out is always steaming hot.. which is really nice. Don't let the location or decor scare you. The food speaks for itself. 

The staff is always friendly. 

Def. a fave.
