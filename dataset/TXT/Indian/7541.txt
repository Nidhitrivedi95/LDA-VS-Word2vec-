5vxp6inj3sY4Eb2MFyOOPg What a brilliant restaurant. The food is not only incredibly fresh but it's made all in house. Including the noodles. The dinner special for 4 was $79.99 and it came with a drink, starter, main course, and dessert. Everything was beautifully plated and each dish was so different from the next. The whole experience was exquisite. We didn't stop talking about the food for days. Well worth the visit. And tell your friends and family. Cause I want to tell the world.
