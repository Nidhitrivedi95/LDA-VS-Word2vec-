6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w Went there with my boyfriend for Valentines Day dinner & the dinner fab!  Best Pecora! Butter chicken & beef vindaloo to die for & as always service is great.  This is our second time there & we will be back.  Great idea to go on valentines day as they had a prix fix menu which we took advantage of as was able to try different things we have not ordered before.  Also their samosa's were to die for!
