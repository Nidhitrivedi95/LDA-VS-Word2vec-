8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ This is such a cozy restaurant that has side street parking which makes it a great location to for date night. We usually opt for little India or Lahore tikka which is around the neighbourhood. We were pleasantly surprised with a nice warm atmosphere the restaurant was! 

We started off with the vegetable samosas that were very nicely plated and cut in half for easy eating. It was very good, fresh, hot and crispy. Then our mains arrived which was the a lamb biryani and a sizzling hot platter of assorted meats. They were very accommodating when we wanted to change the regular naan to garlic naan. The garlic naan really brings an extra layer of flavour to the dish! 

It's a shame that we didn't have room for dessert because by far this was the first restaurants that showed a variety of Indian cuisine desserts that looked very appetizing! 

I think this is a great place to eat and we would consider it for another date night!! Definitely will try the dessert next time!
