grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg The naan here is delicious. 

It's a take-out joint where they try to mix in some "Chinese dishes" occasionally. Their Chinese dishes tend to be salty...and not very good. The rest of food, with its dishes changing frequently tend to be pretty decent. Full disclosure: some of their offerings (re: a lot) may be a bit oily, but that shouldn't scare you from devouring their food. Remember, fat is what makes food taste good. 

It's cheap and it's good. I usually get 3-4 dishes and rice for around $20. 

Right across the [plaza] street is the Silver Spoon, but that place always appears to be empty. 

Parking is plentiful.
