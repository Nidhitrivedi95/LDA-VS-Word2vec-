ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ egads - what to do?  I recently came here with a friend and we seemed to enjoy one of the nicer Indian buffet places in Toronto.  Food and variety was pretty good.  Labels were well displayed.  Service was particularly good b/c the customer:server ratio was particularly in our favour.  This ended up meaning fresh naan served right to our table, and regular refreshing of our glasses of cold water.

However, and this is the biggest However in all of my Yelp experience thus far... my friend had a WILDLY BAD BOUT of FOOD POISONING.  

I did not have any of the Tandoori chicken, but decided to wing one piece home for my dog.  He thoroughly enjoyed it... but, not unlike my friend, he was "off" the next day and resisted his two regular daily meals.  Also, the first thing that he did when he went outside to pee, was eat grass (something that animals instinctively do when their stomach is upset and s/he might feel like vomitting). 

Argh!  This is one of my fave Indian buffet spots (the other being Dharma on King st.)... but the fact that my friend became SO VIOLENTLY ILL has now put a different spin on this place.

Gad, I don't want this place to shut down or anything - but geez, I don't want to become sick after having a meal here.  My friend had to take sick leave off work, and is still not 100% 48 hours later.  

Online I looked up ways to deal with Food Poisoning, and one site suggested a visit to the doctor's to document/prove the association with the restaurant AND to make a phone call to Health Canada(?) to make them aware of the situation.
