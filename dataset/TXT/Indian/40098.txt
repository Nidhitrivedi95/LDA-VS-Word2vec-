pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Fantastic Indian food.  The naan was made just right, and the food comes in these little platters where a candle keeps the food warm.  Nice touch!

All the usual staples, and all are done well.  Friendly service.  I came here before going on a short shopping spree at Ross Park mall - very well placed for that sort of thing!

BTW - I didn't do the buffet.  My sense is that buffets are never as good as fresh food, so I don't go for that and can't vouch for the buffet food.
