KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Our group of 7 tried this place for HH. There are only drink specials which were pretty decent prices. 

Everyone love the food so much. We ordered the garlic/butter naan, kati rolls, gobi manchurian, tikka, eggplant curry, okra, so many other tasty dishes. Everyone was sharing the dishes and I loved how the Tikka Masala actually tasted like tomatoes.

The reason why I am giving this place 1 star is that the service was pretty slow, our water glasses were empty...but my guy and I felt really sick after we ate the food. Our tummies were not happy a few hours later and for the rest of the night. What worried me what the most recent reviewer about him and wife getting food poisoning...

I don't think we will be heading back to PTI any time soon for fear of getting sick again.
