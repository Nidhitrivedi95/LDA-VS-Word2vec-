llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Stopped in for the lunch buffet at about 1:30 on a Wednesday.  It was pretty quiet. It is one of very few business left in this less than stellar strip mall.  But don't let it fool ya or discourage you.  Inside is clean and colorful, with plenty of room for larger groups.    I would have to say there was a lot to choose from and all was hot fresh and full of flavor.  The naan was nice hot and fresh off the griddle.  I was very pleased and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch and can see myself going back in the near future. Yum!
