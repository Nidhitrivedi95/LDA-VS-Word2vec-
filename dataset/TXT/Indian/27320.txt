ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w 10000000/10000000 is my review!!!!!
The owner is extremely caring and friendly!
The atmosphere was perfect!
Extremely clean! 

The food was the best Hakka my boyfriend (who is Indian) and I have ever had!!

We ordered:
Vegetable spring rolls - mouth watering!!
Black pepper chicken (kinda looked like pakoras)- BLEW OUR MINS!! We could have had another order!
Tandoori chicken- was so juicy and soft and melted in our mouths omg yes!
Chilli chicken dry - BLOW AWAY FROM THE FLAVOUR!!
Thai fried rice - I could have ate the entire plate to my self - and it was huge !!
For dessert we got the fried banana with icecream AND THE STRAWBERRY SAUCE, chocolate shavings and the little cookie was all home made!

Clearly no words can describe how good it is until you have gone yourself!
It's new to the area so let's show it some love!
