IaJ8ZCKxKFzgNoIFNCc0YQ I highly enjoy this place and my husband and I have been back many times since our first visit. I very much enjoy the food and the owners are so friendly and really go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience.

I understand everyone is entitled to their opinion, so for those that did not enjoy this place your opinion is valid, but I don't understand how you had such a horrible experience. I also don't understand why the reviews had to be so nit pickey. 

For the reviewer that nit picked about the tables and chairs, big deal! Shouldn't you focus on the food and not the decor? I know I go to a restaurant for food not decor. 

I think the same reviewer remarked that the veggies are frozen, quiet the opposite. The owners pride themselves on the freshness of their food. 

Having spoken to the owners I think they know how to run a business and if more people give them a chance I think they will suceed and they are listening to these Yelp reviews and taking what we say about them into consideration, which is more than I can say for most restaurant owners in this town who don't seem to care a whole lot what their patrons say.

I know not everyone will have the same experience, but I can say that I like this place and it's just too bad the other reviewers didn't enjoy what Curry Leaf has to offer.
