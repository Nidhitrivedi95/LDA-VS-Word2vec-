RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg I had never had Indian food before trying Bombay Indian Grill.
I decided to expand my pallete and try out Bombay.

Let's just say I would eat her 2-3 times a week if I could afford it.

I love their tandoori and their chana masala. That's pretty much what I order each time I come. I'm vegan, and it's nice having a lot of options to choose from on their menu.

I've brought friends and family here and everyone else has loved their meals.

Try Bombay and you won't be disappointed.

I will say I prefer their campus location (even though it's much smaller) because the staff is friendlier. One of the servers here can be pretty rude. He once took my dish before I was done with it and I almost said something but it didn't seem worth it.

The one Indian man that I have seen here (he wears a turban, kind of young looking) is pretty nice and has spoken to me every time I have come in to eat.

Come here for the food but not for the service.
