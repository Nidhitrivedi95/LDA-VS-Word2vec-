2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Avani has amazing high end Indian food. We go here often, usually to celebrate special occasions, and have had a great time everytime!

Note that there were rumours floating around that their head chef left, but those were put to rest during our last visit there (a couple weeks ago for your highness' bday), as the food quality and taste were as expected. The service tho has gotten a lot shittier. 

We usually get the Malai corn rolls (mmmm SCRUMPTIOUS), the samosa rolls, dry chilli paneer, dry veg manchurian, paneer tikka and chicken seekh kebab. For mains, we usually get the malai kofta, dal makhani, a paneer dish and methi matar malai. The breads are what sets this place apart. They have the good old rotis and naans of several varieties, but their parathas are just amazing! So is their roomali roti (if you've never had one before, try it!!!).

The place allows you to bring your own cakes, etc when celebrating events and doesn't charge a fee for it. It is a pricey joint however and expect to spend between $40 - $50 per person minimum (and that is without drinks). Well worth it!
