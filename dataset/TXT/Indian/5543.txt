3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Went there with a Groupon with my husband on Sunday for a dinner buffet.  As many reviewers have already indicated the buffet options are minimal; that said, they have the most popular Indian food e.g.

Food:  overall okay...meh! 
 Meats:  curry lamb, tandoori chicken, curry basa fish and butter chicken. 
Vegetarian: curry lentil, mixed veg, basmati rice and some other curry.  
Salad Bar: green salad, mixed salad, kale salad, condiments and some deep fried food (spring rolls, samosa, pakora.
Naan: ask server for either garlic or plain  
  
**I found the temperature of the food was a bit on the cool side and not hot enough.

Service : good service if there aren't a lot of customers- they don't have enough staff

Overall: With this Groupon,  it comes with any drinks including beer, house wine and even mango Lassi.   Overall for the price we paid, good value.  But probably won't be coming back...definitely have had better Indian food.
