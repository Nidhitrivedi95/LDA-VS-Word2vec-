kkNWzhSpAjxm0zIxol3IzQ I've tried many Indian restaurants and this one didn't particularly blow me away. We got the chicken tikka masala and murgh masala. They brought one of the orders out about 5 minutes before the other, which was a bit odd considering we were the only customers there. The chicken was also burnt on the outside layer. The staff seemed friendly and the restaurant was clean, but my overall experience can be summed up as average.
