ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ This Indian restaurant is outstanding. Authentic cuisine with real Indian spice (heat) when requested. Staff are friendly and making excellent recommendations to please your night out. The decor is traditional with pleasant India music playing softly. The food is to die for. I enjoyed the Lamb Boonah (sorry for my spelling) and Tandoori Chicken. What a feast, can feed two easily.
