pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Whoa, there.  "Best Indian food in Pittsburgh," is excessive, as one reviewer commented.  I'm a sucker for Indian food -- and will eat Trader Joe's Chicken Tikki Masala when desperate -- but I also know good quality.  I saw Slumdog Millionaire, like, a hundred times.

Taj Mahal is okay.  3 stars.  The lunch buffet is a good spread with vegetarian options, chicken curry, goat curry, chicken tikki masala, tandoori chicken, saag, appetizers, and deserts.  But the food is only average -- I'm pretty disappointed with the tikki masala, because the chicken is dry and the sauce isn't that flavorful.  I know, I know, I said I eat Trader Joe's frozen dinners - but honestly, I think that has more flavor.

Mix up the goat curry with the saag - that was actually very tasty.

But for around $8-9, all you can eat, I'm pretty satisfied.  It is NOT great Indian food, but it is GOOD value, and should satisfy your craving.
