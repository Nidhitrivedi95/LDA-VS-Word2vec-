gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Service was fantastic with friendly and warm loving people. The owner made sure to perdonally come and communicate with every table. You can tell the food is made with Love and caring in great flavors.

We were a party of 6 and had several dishes to get a full Indian cuisine experience. All went smooth with Taj Mahalo premium lager. ;)  The Lamb Vindaloo and chicken makhani were exceptional. We went mild on the spice because of a few guests with us that were reluctant to get to intense with spice. Everything was just great.  Casual setting, casual seating and superb people with great food.  Thanks Prakash and your team!
