TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ It was one of nights where the bf & I couldn't decide where to eat dinner tonight...#firstworldproblem lol so we definitely went on yelp for some help. We saw a couple of Hakka chinese restaurants around our area & the first one that got our attention was LOTUS GARDEN!

We ordered manchuran fried rice, garlic chicken & crispy beef. We wanted chinese brocolli w/ garlic (Gai Lan) which was not on the menu but they quickly accommodated to our request right away ^_^ 

As the food came out, there was a bit of a mix up w/ another table. The new server had given us the Thai fried rice & another chicken dish. We were quite confused but indulged in it anyway. The owner then was quick to respond to the error & made changes. We ended up keeping the dishes as well as it was so delicious. She sincerely apologized & made sure we got the 2  mistaken dishes for free & on the house.

As the food came out, it looked as good as it tasted. Crispy beef was nicely seasoned & definitely had a nice crunch effect to it which I loved ! The Thai fried rice...OMG never had I ever ! Tasted any fried rice like the one here @ Lotus Garden. It was sweet & savory & had a nice touch of little pieces of crispy 
chicken & pineapple *2 thumbs up*. In addition, the Chinese brocolli was also delicious.

Funny thing about my experience here, was as the bf was packing up our left overs....I tried to race him in getting as much food on my plate before he packed everything up. IT WAS THAT GOOD!

I can honestly say that this is the best Hakka chinese food I've ever tried & believe me...I was never a fan of Hakka Chinese food until now. *round of applause* to LOTUS GARDEN for exceeding my expectation
