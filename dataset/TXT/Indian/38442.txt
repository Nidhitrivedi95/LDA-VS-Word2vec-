OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I've had better. Food is average & so is the service.
Butter chicken tasted like spicey tomato soup with chicken in it. My husband wasn't told that he could order less spicey. My lentils were good but I've had them better elsewhere. I've never had indigestion from Indian before but am suffering horribly after eating here.  We gave them a try, there's better Indian in town so we won't be returning.
