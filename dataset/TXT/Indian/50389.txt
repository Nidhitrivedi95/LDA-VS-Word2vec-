UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w Best authentic Indian food ever. I absolutely love this place! I've never had anything bad ever and it's all reasonably priced. I go here every week (sometimes twice a week) since I moved here 4 months ago and it has always been incredible. If I lived closer I might just eat here everyday... It's my favorite restaurant in AZ. My favorite is the Chole, aloo chaat and the samosas.
