x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Ordered things for kids menu... After waiting 40 min server told us that we did not order any such thing and kitchen is closed... After spending huge amount for table still have to look for McDonald to get kid his meal... Server needs to pay attention and repeat the order because she writes anything she likes... Also mixed up chicken corn soup to vegetable soup...
