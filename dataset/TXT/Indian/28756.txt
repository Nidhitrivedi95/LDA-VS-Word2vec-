jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Been here a couple times for lunch.  The wait staff was quite welcoming and friendly.  Food was top notch -- as good as I've had anywhere (I've been to around 8 Indian places).  Chairs, table, and dishwares are high quality.  You have a nice view to the mountains or strip from a window table.  Prices are in line with other Indian restaurants, considering that rice is included with the entries.  One downside is that because it is located in a industrial park area, their bathroom is shared between different businesses and it wasn't in good sanitary condition; so deduct one star for that.
