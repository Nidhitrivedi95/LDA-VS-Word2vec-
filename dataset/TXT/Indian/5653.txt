3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg I went to resturant to get take out. When i ordered dal makhani and chicken tikka, they said 25-30 mins wait as they make everything fresh. I thought that lets wait maybe its worth the wait. But was completely wrong. Chicken tikka was like sweet and did not taste good. Before going to pick up the food i called in after 20 mins if food is ready and the person said bluntly that you ordered 5 mins back. Wrong, i ordered long time back. So in all not good experience.
2 stars because the dal makhani tasted good.
