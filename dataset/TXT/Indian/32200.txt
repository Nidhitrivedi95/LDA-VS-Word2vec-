LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg I had to update my review because my family and I had dinner last night and the food WAS NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING.  Goat Curry, Paratha bread, Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken biriyani, and spinach.  EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.  Tasty and spiced to the level we requested.  
The service was great.  They fill the water and checked on us to make sure everything was right.  
This is a place you will get your indian food fix and totally enjoy it.  
Go NOW!

Another amazing, delicious meal with the most friendly and on-point service that anyone can imagine.  Nice portions, wonderfully seasoned food, attractive environment, white tablecloths and napkins, accommodating service. What a great place!   I can't say enough and everyone should come out to Indian Paradise to confirm what I am saying.  

(BTW, not related to the company in any way. I just want to make sure this place gets to stay in business so that I can continue to enjoy this gem of a restaurant.)
