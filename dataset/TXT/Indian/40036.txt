pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I did do a takeout at this place and frankly it was not my first choice. I ended up ordering from this restaurant only because Mintt was closed, it being a Monday. I ordered a Chicken Biryani (Spicy), Aloo(Potato) Kulcha, Chicken Hyderabad(Spicy). 
I must say the food was beyond expectation as the previous buffet fiasco had set the bar too low. The Kulcha was soft and had ample filling of lightly spiced potato. The hyderabad chicken was spicy and flavorful. The gravy was rich and thick with the onions having been sauteed very well. The Biryani was also the right amount of spicy with good flavor. It was however Kacchi Biryani(Not the dum variety). I got some Jeera Rice with the chicken dish which was nothing out of the ordinary. The rice was a little crunchy though. The raita with the biryani was simple and effective. It took the richness away form the biryani, exactly what it is supposed to do. 
All in all a very good experience. I had to wait a while though for the food to be ready, but if the food is this good I wouldn't mind waiting the 5 odd minutes. 
One beef that I still have with this restaurant is the option of white/dark meat for the chicken dishes is not available. I do not like the breast pieces/ white meat of the chicken as it is less flavorful and absorbs less spices from the curry. Moreover it is also very chewy and not soft like the dark meat(thigh/legs).
