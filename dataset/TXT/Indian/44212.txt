RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This has been a favourite place of mine for years. But lately the service has been.. quite maddeningly ridiculous. The restaurant now has a (perfectly sensible) policy of not seating a party until everyone has arrived. But today is learnt the hard way that they will follow this policy to the letter even when the place is nowhere close to busy. I was with a party of 5 on a lazy Monday evening, came ahead of time before my family, and they refused to seat me even though I see at least 9 empty tables that can seat 6 each. Upon protesting politely, I was told that I cannot be seated in case a larger party party appeared. At this point, the evening crowd got even less populous. It was.. a poor execution of a good policy. I wish they trained their host staff to be flexible depending on how busy the evening is.
