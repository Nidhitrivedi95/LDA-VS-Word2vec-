pX7ftE5CySOa-5cpuJl_ZA Whoa!!! Totally got the real deal here. I also feel pretty special because I ordered something that's not on the menu. I ordered a chicken 65 and it is an explosion of flavor. Normally it is considered a pepper chicken.  I was advised to order it this way. It is rumored to have 65 spices! Wow! No wonder its totally intense. I really enjoyed the authenticity of the flavor.
