tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Came here with my Indian friend who said she would not be embarrassed to take me here for the food. So i thought that was a sign of good things to come. They have a buffet which was affordable (less than $10) with great selection (vegetarian, meats, mango yogurt, desert, etc) If you want other dishes, they got a full menu as well. I thought the food was great. Every dish I tried were flavorful and fresh. They even brought out fresh warm naan came out when we sat down at the table. YUM. 
Oh and they gave us a hot plate of chicken as well (maybe this is also complimentary?) Anyhoo, I would totally come back here for an insatiable Indian food craving.
