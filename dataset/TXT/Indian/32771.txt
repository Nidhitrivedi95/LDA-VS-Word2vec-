LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Sometime last year, a south indian friend of mine introduced me to the magic that is dosa. If you are unaware, a dosa is like a crispy crepe made from lentils and rice, and filled with a mild potato masala. I have heard from a few indian friends that this is the best dosa you'll find outside of india.

Once you've chosen from a wide array of dosa options, your meal will come with three unique and amazing chutneys ranging from mild to spicy, and a small bowl of warm sambhar, which is a vegetable and lentil stew which you can have mild or spicy. 

You will eat with your hands. To do so, you rip off a small section of the dosa and use it to pick up the potato stuffing inside. Protip for first timers, the dosa gets more flexible the closer to the middle you get. Dip the crispy outer portion in your sambar and chutneys. Try eat with only one hand, as is customary.

Do not be intimidated by this place. the food is outstanding, flavourful, fresh and inexpensive.

Carnivores be aware this place is strictly vegetarian.
