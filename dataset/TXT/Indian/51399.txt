UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA The Indian food we had was pretty good with the exception of the kulfi.  For those who don't know what kulfi is, it is Indian ice cream.  The pistachio kulfi we had here had a lot of ice crystals in it.  A sign that it was either melted and re-frozen (that has to violate some health codes) or that they did not cook the milk down long enough (lazy cooking).  Also, the Nepali dishes I had were not very good and I know this because I've lived in Nepal.  The momos tasted like they were made with ready made wonton wrappers from the grocery store.  The momo dough isn't quite the same as a wonton wrapper.  The kwati soup did not appear to be made from NINE types of beans/lentils.  It also did not look like the beans/lentils had been sprouted.  I give this place 2 stars because I the Indian food here seems decent but I definitely recommend avoiding the Nepali dishes.
