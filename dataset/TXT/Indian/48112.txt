TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This restaurant was a wonderful experience. It's located in a seedy part of the road, but it is a find. You know when there's a limo in the parking lot, that's a clue.

They have an extensive menu, so we tried the Aloo Tikki appetizer, and it was four tasty fried cakes and very good. Then, we ordered the basic items we use to tell one restaurant from another.

The Lamb Korma is great, with more lamb than most others, and the lamb is very tasty and tender. There is enough sauce, so you can have just sauce and rice, too. Yummy. The Chicken Tikki Marsala is very tender, again with more chicken than usual. Very good sauce. The garlic naan is perfect. Very lightly crispy on the surface, and chewy inside, with a dusting of herbs for good looks. 

You know, every dish here is pretty, too.

They make a firm vodka martini, and the recommended Taj Mahal beer was just right.

Good service, very attentive, and "Auntie Tarala" will tell you with a lift of her eyebrow if you get it right. The charming manager stopped by to answer questions, and be sure we were happy. We were.

So you can have a lovely Indian meal,  at a reasonable price, without the noise and crowds of the strip, just 15 minutes away.in an easy drive. The parking is a free lot.
