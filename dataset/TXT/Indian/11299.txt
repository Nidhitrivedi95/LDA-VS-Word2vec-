aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q I had heard so many good things about this place over the years but by the time I finally got around to trying them they had shut down. Fortunately it was just for a short renovation and they are back open again. I went today with a fellow foodie that is a huge fan of this place. I tried the lamb satay jumbo burrito as this was reccomended by the lady at the cash.

The burrito: Well it's a little different from most burritos as they don't use beans and rice and I would compare it more to a jumbo fajita. At $6.45 it was great value and very filling. The taste of the lamb was really good though I think they could add some more spice to it and overdue it a bit with what tastes like thousand islands dressing. My burrito w/ 2 drinks (mango nectar and bottle of water) came to $10.44 which is quite good for the area. Most places it is hard to find lunch for under $15 nearby.

Conclusion: I would definitely return as the food was very good for the price I paid. I would give them a 7.5/10 for this experience.
