GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw So far, this is my favorite Indian restaurant in town. The food is delicious! My go-to order is the Paneer Tikka Masala with the Chili Paneer Naan - something I have never had anywhere else. The wait times can become excessive, however. My last order was placed through Eat24, Yelp's online ordering partner, and I waited in the restaurant over an hour past my expected pick-up time (which was already extended past an hour due to a busy night). If this was improved it would easily be a five-star review.
