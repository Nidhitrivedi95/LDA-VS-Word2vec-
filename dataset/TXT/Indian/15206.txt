CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA Omg! This place is me and my husbands new favorite place!!! We were looking for a good spot for Indian food near by and came across this place. We figured we give it a try and we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the chicken tikka masala/Butter chicken/Tandoori chicken with garlic naan....AMAZING! We have dined here twice already and we are so impressed we will be regulars :) 5 's for sure!!! And we will be bringing our friends/family. I'm not one for reviews but felt I needed to share this place with the world!
