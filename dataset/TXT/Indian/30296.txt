K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g The food is good, clean restaurant. I was there for dinner however the waiter only came once to my table to take my order after being seated for about 5 mins. He never came back. There is a woman there that is doing all the work for the waiters. She came to bring water twice, served the food and checked on us to see how we were. I regret that I did not get her name but she seemed to be working her tail off while the waiters all hung out at the register. We did not even get a check brought to us, we had to get up and go to the register to pay.
