XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Absolutely loved this place!  Went to try it out for my boyfriend's birthday.  Ordered lots of great things including the special tibetan fried rice (tasted like an amazing home cooked meal), the pan fried chicken momos, the deep fried beef momos, the fluffy steamed buns and the vegetarian manchurian.  All the dishes were so flavourful.  The steamed buns so moist and fluffy, the momos ridiculously good.  The thing I appreciated most is nothing tasted greasy!  And to boot, the owner treated us so amazingly!  Would 100% come back or order for pick up as they get busy really quickly for dinner.
