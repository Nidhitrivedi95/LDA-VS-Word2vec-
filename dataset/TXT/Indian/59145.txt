yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Just had their buffet that had wonderful tikki masala, a wide range of indian dishes and various types of rice. $10 was certainly worth it! It was a wonderful experience!  We ordered a goat dish with an onion and ginger gravy. The pistachio kulfi was amazing, homemade and creamy! Demetri was a fabulous server, very attentive and caring! He even took the time to go through the buffet line and explain every dish and made helpful suggestions, the goat dish was one of them. The naan bread is fresh and hot, very delicious. We are foodies and definitely will be back, and will bring friends! Thank you for the hospitality!
