GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I have very little knowledge of Indian cuisine and absolutely no knowledge of Pakistani cuisine but this place was fantastic.  I ordered Nehani Noor Jehan, which was intensely flavorful...almost a floral fragrance in your nose while your mouth tastes rich, thick sauce with beef shanks.  I ate it with rice and some prices of their yummy, freshly-made naan.  

My dining companion had the Chicken Jalfrezi and it was delicious.  I'll have that next time.  Lots of tender chunks of chicken. This would be a great place to go with a bunch of friends so you can order and share several of their specialties.  I already want to return!!!
