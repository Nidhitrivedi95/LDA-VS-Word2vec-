ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Let me begin by saying I love Indian food. 

Let me clarify this by saying that despite my ongoing curried devotion, I really have a difficult time ordering from the menu at Indian restaurants because I have a hard time deciding on just one or two dishes.  

Enter my savior - The India Garden buffet. 

I have been to Indian buffets before (anyone else miss Indigo downtown?) but India Garden's lunch buffet has been consistently amazing for the last two years that I have been going.  For less than $10, you are treated to 3-4 meat dishes (usually chicken and goat) as well as an additional selection of 3-4 vegetarian items.  Add to this a plentiful supply of freshly baked naan and you can't go wrong.  

On top of the excellent food, the service is superlatively good, and the staff is incredibly friendly.  Whether alone or with the whole family in tow, they have always been remarkably welcoming and accommodating. 

India Garden is another of the many treasures Lakewood has to offer.
