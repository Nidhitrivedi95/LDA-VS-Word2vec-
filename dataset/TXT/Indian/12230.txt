auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I have never tried Indian Food before, so I was excited. When my friend and I walked in at first we thought it was dead but when we came inside there was actually a lot of people. 

The service was GREAT!! They are very attentive and very helpful. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend ordered the Lamb Mango Curry. Both dishes was delicious.  Have to order the Peas Pillau and the Garlic Naan. And their Mango Lasse was very refreshing. 

My friend and I loves to eat and try new places, since this was my first time trying Indian food. I would definitely let my friends know about this place and I would come back to try more of their dishes.
