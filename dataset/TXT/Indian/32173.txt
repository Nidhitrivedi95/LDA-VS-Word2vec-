LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg We went for lunch buffet today from work and we are not satisfied with the taste and also they have very limited veg options . However three stars are for thier mango lassi. I dont recommend this place if you are looking for huge variety in the buffet. Biryani I felt overcooked and overall I have a ok experience.
