qDv5GyT2tzlJrbtxqzasQA My boyfriend and I went to roti palace for takeout lunch and ordered Aloo Papri Chat, Chili Goby, Saag Paneer roti and Channa curry with rice..

I really enjoyed to Saag Paneer, as I have never tried it in roti form. I would recommend that. I also really enjoyed the chili goby (breaded, fried cauliflower in spicy chili sauce).

However, I didn't love the Channa, as I usually do. The Chana and rice were pre mixed together.. and because of this, the rice absorbed all the sauce it came with. You should have the rice seperate of the Chana!

I don't understand what the papri chat was, I don't think the dish made sense and it didn't taste good to me. I would not order this again.  Overall, I would come back. But I would not order the papri chat or the Chana with rice (unless I got them seperated).
