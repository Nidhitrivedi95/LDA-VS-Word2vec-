0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw This is a wonderful place. This is the best indian restaurant i have eaten at. Period.

My family and i stopped here for dinner on our way to Sedona. We loved the food so much we changed our return route from Grand Canyon, just to eat here. 

Its wonderful food and the people are truly generous and lovely.

You will love this place.
