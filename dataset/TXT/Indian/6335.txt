3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA WOOOO I love this place!

This was my first time going to an indian restaurant and it was great! I was most excited to try their garlic naan, cause 1. i love garlic 2. i LOVE naan! So it was good

$3 for their garlic naan but it's quite big

average curries were about $12/13 but it was really filling. The dish they serve it in makes it look small, but apparently its a bottomless dish.

The service is nice, the place is clean. Overall I will def come back here for my indian food fix
