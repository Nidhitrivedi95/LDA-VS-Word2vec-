ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Been here a handful of times and it's never a disappointment. The food is extremely flavorful and it's some of the best Indian food in Vegas, not bland like other places. True flavor. Some of the appetizers are not that great flavor wise. Every experience here is delightful and the service is always great.
