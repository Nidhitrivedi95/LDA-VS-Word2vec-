V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg I should have avoided this place given all the poor reviews, but I was given a free $20 Wagjag voucher for this place, so I decided why not give it a chance?  Big mistake.

So the voucher said this on it (I still have the electronic copy so this is verbatim):
- Limit 1 voucher per visit
- Valid only at the location selected (Yorkdale Mall: 3401 Dufferin Street)
- Not valid with other promotions
- Must print voucher and present at time of visit. Electronic vouchers are not accepted
- Does not include tax or gratuity. No cash value. No cash back

I always read the fine print and nowhere did it say that you must order from the dinner menu and that you cannot order from the lunch menu.

So I was there at lunch time with my parents.  So I ordered from the lunch menu.  We ordered an order of Butter Chicken, an order of Masala Lime Lamb, and an order of Amaya Prawns.  When I went to pay (we were doing takeout so it was shortly after ordering), the cashier charged me the dinner prices which were $4 more for each plate than the lunch prices.  I asked her why and she said it was because I was using the Wagjag voucher.  There was a huge lineup behind me (I have no idea why this place was so busy) and we were so hungry, I didn't care to argue with her, so I just paid it and took our orders out to the food court.  WTF?  I'm charged the dinner prices at lunchtime because I'm using a voucher?  And I'm pretty sure I wasn't given dinner-sized portions because the portions were pretty dinky.  So I had to pay over $20 on top of the $20 voucher (the total food bill was over $40 - for 3 dinky portions and no beverages).     

So maybe the food is actually good...wrong!  It's not good at all.  The shrimp (prawns) tasted disgusting to me.  They were mushy.  How in the world do you make shrimps mushy?  I have no idea.  They definitely did not taste fresh.  My parents were not crazy about the butter chicken or masala lamb either.  What a waste of money and calories.    

If someone were to give me a free voucher for this place again, I would actually decline it.
