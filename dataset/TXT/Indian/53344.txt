VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg To start: Incredible food. They have a pretty extensive menu with many items to choose from, and after several visits, I have yet to try something less than stellar! Appetizers, entrees, desserts, you name it. Nobody makes a paneer quite like Tandoori times. I was also surprised to see all of the negative reviews about service, because in my experience, it has always been decent. 
 
Really, I have only one complaint: While the belly dancer is clearly talented and very likable (she's great and bringing in the crowd), the music/ cymbals during the performance are so loud to the point where you cannot hear the people at your own table. I think it's really cool that they have belly dancing performances, I just wish that not paying full attention to them were a possibility.
