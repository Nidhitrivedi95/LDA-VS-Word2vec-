02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Seriously guys, adding a bunch of spices to cooked rice with lamb is NOT how you make biryani.  Oh, and who places green bell peppers to biryani?  I'm not sure what I was eating but with each
bite, I asked myself loads of questions:

"Is this what I paid $13 for?"
"Why did I pay $13 for this?"
"Why am I sitting in my car, on my way to the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, eating this spice flavored rice with
not lamb?"
"What is this big black thing that looks like a beetle.  Oh, its just a cardamom?"
"When I asked the guy who gave this to me for some raita (Indian yogurt condiment), why was he 
saying that was going to be extra when it is always customary (and FREE) to hand that out with the biryani?"
"Should I finish this or no?  I need to finish this, I paid 13 freakin dollars for this - that's why!"

Then, the cycle of questions would start all over again and if that is not torture, I'm not sure what is.
