EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg My wife &:I were on a vacation to Las Vega We love Pakistani and Indian cuisine and always prefer where available when traveling. We Googled and found Kabob & More. Tried their Nahari and Kaboob and Chicken Karahi and nans. Loved it. We visited this restaurant every night while in Las Vegas. The service was great and prices competitive. We highly recommend this restaurant for Indian / Pakistani food.
