7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Love this place so much!! I had the chicken tikka masala which is the perfect blend of tomatoes and cream with big chunks of high quality chicken. Also had the navratna korma which was just as good, filled with different vegetables and cheese which I've never had in that dish before and was very flavorful. Enjoyed it all with warm naan. Portions are a little small when you eat in the restaurant, but the food is fabulous!
