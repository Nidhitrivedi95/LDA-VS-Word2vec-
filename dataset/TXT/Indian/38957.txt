OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I was immediately curious about the place when I read the name "Urban Turban". I was expecting a funky place with a neat experience & I definitely got that & some... 

Upon entering I had a huge smile on my face when I saw the auto rickshaw right there by the entrance. It's something I used a lot for transportation growing up in Mumbai! A neat touch & quite unique! 

The receptionist, waiter & couple other people who checked on us were very attentive & respectful. The food was absolutely delicious, I loved the saag (spinach), eggplant Bharta & the Chana masala. They had Gulab Jamun for buffet dessert & I found them to melt in my mouth soft. The chai was nice & strong. We got to talk to the owner who is very amicable. He asked if we had tried the "Paan shots" & we hadn't, of course we had to. Absolutely loved it! I've never had anything like it before in my 12 years of eating Indian food all over the US.

I highly recommend Urban Turban whether you live in Vegas or are visiting. You won't be disappointed & you'll get your money's worth. Two thumbs up.
