Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ The food was good, but the service rather deplorable. Went there with two friends, all of us Indian. 

Firstly, the server who initially greeted us lead us to a nicely located booth, but then the manager came in and asked us to sit in a table in the middle of the restaurant, claiming that the booth was "reserved". It seemed that no such reservation was in place, as after a while when a group of white people came in who also had no reservation, they were lead to the said booth. 

Secondly, we had ordered a vegetable jhalfrezi, but our server returned with a lamb jhalfrezi - he was quite casual about it and said "eat this, this is better". While he was aware of his mistake, he didn't offer us a vegetable jhalfrezi, and in the end we were charged for the lamb jhalfrezi which was slightly more expensive than the vegetarian jhalfrezi. 

This was a disappointing experience and I wouldn't like to visit this place again.
