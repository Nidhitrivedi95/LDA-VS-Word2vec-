o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Some of the best Indian food I've ever tasted on the West Coast! Their all-you-can-eat lunch buffet is definitely well-priced for the amazing food they leave out. I personally recommend the butter chicken, chana masala and aloo mater. Worth a try if you're new to Indian cuisine and definitely worth becoming a regular!
