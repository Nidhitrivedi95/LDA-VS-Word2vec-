GC9Re0tKAnecMww3DB638g Stopped by here today (we don't eat cupcakes very often) and didn't realise it wasn't "that other bakery" any longer.  Since I was already there I decided to give them a shot.  The cupcakes all look very pretty.  If this was based off of service, they would get a 5.  The young woman working that day was very friendly.  I came for cupcakes, but she was happy to let me try some of the interesting Indian inspired ice cream flavors too.  Interesting.  Not bad.  Interesting.

I ordered four different cupcakes.  All nice looking.  All incredibly dry.  I am a terrible baker and I could have made better cupcakes from a box.  The peanut butter frosting and the Oreo frostings were fine.  Nothing amazing, but I want the cake part to be the hero of the cupcake.  Not even close.  I sadly won't be back.  You get two stars for your awesome staff member.  Keep her around!  (I wish I caught her name).  Next time, I'll probably cross the street to Kneaders.  I'd also be better off at Safeway.
