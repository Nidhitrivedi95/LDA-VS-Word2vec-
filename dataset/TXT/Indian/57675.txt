yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw As an Indian, five stars was out of reach anyway. The food was decent..not bad for Arizona Indian food. We enjoyed the paneer makhni, lamb vindaloo and chicken curry. The naan was also very nice. I tried some chaat (street food in India that is typically flavorful and delicious) and it was border-line inedible..we requested extra spicy and it was bland and likely had been sitting for a while. I never understand why chaat is so difficult to find in Phoenix and this was pretty disappointing. I would also say that it was expensive; a decent Indian buffet is often a better value and larger food coma!
