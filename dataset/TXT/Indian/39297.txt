oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q I think I have figured out the kind of hakka i don't like, the kind served by this place!
Went there last night and I am still struggling where to begin.

Service:
i) Asked if their chow-men had vegetables and told that it doesn't; Guess what? chow-men had veggies and had to be sent back.

ii) We found Hair in the rice ball, server made a face how i would imagine "FML". Took the bowl of rice and brought back another after a while, because apologizing is too mainstream.

iii) The only good thing about the service was that it was fast, food came pretty quickly and stuff.

Food:
Okay to absolutely tasteless

i) Chicken Pakora - okay, this was very acceptable and tasty.
ii) Shezuan Chicken - Chicken with salt and gravy and some veggies.
iii) Chilli beef - Beef with salt and gravy, absolutely tasteless.
iv) General Tsao - okay this had some sweet and sour taste, the only thing we ate happily.
v) Chow-men - Tasteless noodle with chicken
vi) Chicken Fried Rice - Rice was wet, the only thing they have to take care of when cooking.

They had Pad Thai, we were gonna order but got to know that it's made with Tomato Sauce, what kind of Pad Thai is made with Tomato sauce?

Server came to fill water, asked if we wanted the chilli beef to take out since it was barely touched, we said no and he went "OH", that's it.

You know, you'd think that a hair was discovered in the rice bowl, the least a restaurant would do is take it out of the bill right? NOPE! no apology and the dish was still there on the bill.

We were so done with the place that we didn't even argue, paid and left. What a waste of appetite.
