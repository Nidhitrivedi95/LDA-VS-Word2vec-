GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g The food is absolutely amazing.
However, keep in mind it's SOUTH indian food, which means it's on the spicy side.
I had the lemon rice and also the Dosa with spinach filling.  Of course I doused it with with tons of chutneys too. (Sorry Scott B, I plagerized from your review) I loved it.  Nice and spicy!  I also got the cauliflower with chili sauce.  YUM!!!
Don't expect ambiance, it's all about the cooking.
My Indian friend loves it, she raves about this and drives from N Phoenix to the Woodlands about once a week.  
Definitely go and give it a try!
