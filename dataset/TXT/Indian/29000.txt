jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q We went to Pure Indian Cuisine for the lunch buffet. The food was extremely disappointing. Most of the food items tasted very stale. The only good dish was the Kheer. I am not sure if the ala carte orders are better but would not recommend the lunch buffet. The place was however clean and yes the view of the airport is great.
