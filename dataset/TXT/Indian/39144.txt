OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w Just Pukht it and come here for your meal.  Located in Markham you know you have found a good spot when you hop out of your car and can smell the delicious curry from the parking lot. My mouth was watering even before I stepped in the restaurant.

It's a pretty big restaurant and decor is tasteful (not cheesy at all like how some Indian restaurants can be).  You can also see the chefs cooking in the kitchen b/c it's a glass wall separating the kitchen and the dining room.  You can watch them make skewers and see how the tandoor works.  Also, everything is made to order - fresh.  They don't make the food before hand and just heat up - this is evident by watching the chef's make your meal before your eyes.  Of course this means that the time from when you order to when you get your food takes awhile...but I don't mind if things are made fresh.  

We ordered a bunch of different items for our group - mango salad; aloo gobi; garlic naan; lamb skewers; the dum phukt chicken special and rice pulao.   Yum, yum and YUM!   The mango salad offered a sweet cool flavour to some of the hotter dishes.  The aloo gobi was a nice side and the chicken special was spicy but not burn out your mouth spicy.  Tender pieces of chicken in curry....eatne with the rice or naan, it was just delicious.  It comes looking like chicken pot pie (the best way I can explain it) - the chicken was inside a naan bowl almost.  
Everything was delicious.  I didn't find anything too spicy..but I'm used to spice so I've got a slight tolerance to it.

I also tried the butter chicken from our nice Yelp friends at the table next to us - smooth, creamy and yum.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back....
