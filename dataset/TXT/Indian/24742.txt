h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA Just stopped by here for dinner the other day and figured I'd write a review.  I've been here twice and have had a good experience both times.  Their food is very tasty.  When I went for lunch I thought their selection wasn't as big as other places, but everything was well prepared.  Out of both, I prefered dinner even though we were the only people in the place.  The food came out pretty quick and was super fresh.  The meat samosa, garlic naan, chicken biriyani, chicken curry, and tikki masala were all great.  I think even though everyone seems to love the tikki masala I liked the curry better.  ALSO to note, it was very spicy, more than when prepared for the buffet I think, which I thought was great.
