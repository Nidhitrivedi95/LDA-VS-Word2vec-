ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I must say their real menu is different from menu on Yelp. It's more of a South Indian Restaurant. They have limited options for Main Course specially if you are vegetarian. They had about 6-7 options for vegetarians including daal.

We were a gang of 4, so we had to think what to order looking at the menu. But, the food quality was pretty good. We all liked the food. I liked the Garlic naan.

Their staff is very responsive as well.
