gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We got a cab from the MGM Grand in an effort to see a little more of "real" Las Vegas when we were in town for a conference.  Boy was it worth it!  The owner (also the primary waiter) was the kindest, most hospitable man.  He gave wonderful beer and food recommendations, checked on us numerous times, and brought us a small bite of dessert on the house before calling us a cab back to the strip.  What a wonderful evening!  A must-dine restaurant for anyone adventurous enough to get away from all the typical tourist traps.  Thank you to Mount Everest; we'll be sure to come back on our next visit to Las Vegas!
