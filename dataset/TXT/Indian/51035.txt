UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ We went to this place because we wanted good indian food and it was rated four out of five stars. Do not come here. We were served water with a hair in it and when we brought it to their attention they didnt instead of them apologizing, thet simply laughed it off. The other waiters there were on their phones and having side conversations that could be heard  in the entire restaurant. The food took 20 mins to come out despite us ordering a small appetizer in an empty restaurant. Add insult to injury, the food itself tasted bland and uninspired. What was supposed to be Chicken 65 arrived as small pieces of chicked soaking in a small pool of ketchup. The food is bad, bland, and WAY overpriced, and the service was poor. Avoid at all costs.
