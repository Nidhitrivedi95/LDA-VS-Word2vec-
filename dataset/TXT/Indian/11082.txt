A9UQhHtG9Xh3nkhe3UvXzQ Went here for lunch. Cheap? Absolutely? Good? Well...not so much. Pretty bland. The flavors ran together and everything was overcooked. Maitre d' and waiter hovered over us the entire time in an effort to shuttle us out. Also, the naan is heavily sweetened. Some folks like that. Me? Not so much. Maybe I'll try it again, but I doubt it.  

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here.
