yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg Super friendly service! The friends we were dining with go here a lot so we were definitely treated very well by the staff. Shrimp tikka masala was delicious! Garlic naan was also great! The veggie samosas were yummy. The cracker and spread that was brought to our table when we arrived was super tasty, but I don't know what it's called.
At some point during the meal I swallowed something very sharp. To the point that I went to the bathroom bc I was worried I would have to try and get it out of me. Ha. Needless to say, I did not need to do that. It has now been two whole days an I'm still alive despite sealing a sharp morsel. I'm guessing it was an accidental piece of shrimp tail and not the jagged check chicken bone I thought it was. Ya ya, never mind I was eating a shrimp dish. 

I did also try the mutter paneer (sp) and another chicken dish that were both also delicious.  

Despite the swallowed sharp piece, I will be back!
