9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw It was their 9th week opening at the new location. I like the open floor plan and modern decor. My husband and I were craving Indian so we came to try this place out. The manager who took our order was great and recommended some great dishes! My only complaint is it took about 20 minutes for our appetizer and additional 30 minutes for our dinner to come out. The owner came over and apologized and said they are still working on a lot of things. Apology accepted the food tasted great! But please dont make me HANGRY again.  
The lunch buffet set up looked pretty enticing I will definitely come in to check that out soon
