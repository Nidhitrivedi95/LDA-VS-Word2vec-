All of the places with "good" reviews did not measure up to the food i was used to-- and I would eat Indian at least once a week. Finally after asking around for a few months, I had a couple different folks tell me about Saffron and figured I couldn't be let down any more than I already was and decided to give it a shot and I am so glad I did! This is the authentic Indian I remember! The masala sauce is perfectly creamy with the right spices, not Tabasco sauce like so many places I've tried around the area. Their rice is not greasy and perfectly aromatic and the naan was fluffy with the right amount of garlic. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend and try all their other dishes! 5 out of 5 from this Indian food lover.
