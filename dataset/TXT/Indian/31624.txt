KVwV03I-APnUlAWmnz__gw If you are hungry then you need to stopby. It is a great place to get a very tasty well-cooked food .This is not only a restaurant with delicious food but also having various kinds of grocery stuff.I used to visit frequently to pick Vegetables,Guava's,Samosa,Pani puri and other stuff too for a valuable price. Inside and outside view of a restaurant is nice with good customer service and seating alignment. Very good experience with dining !I recommend everyone to try it.
