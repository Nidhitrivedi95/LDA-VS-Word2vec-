skKvWc8KwSAhj5Zf_pe7Dg Great vegetarian food. Very fresh and tasty appetizers - tried the paneer wraps which were simply out of this world. The samosas were great - nice filling, just enough, blended and cooked. The  mint and tamarind sauces on the side were very good.  The  owner Arti is  also the awesome chef who totally accommodated  my request for a good mix for introducing  her great dishes to my non Indian clients in terms of spice and that fear of  the unknown.  Our party of 10 loved  the atmosphere and the food. Loads of parking in the front. Back at least twice a week for my desi khaana fix. Love it.
