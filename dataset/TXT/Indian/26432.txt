ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg If your looking for an Indian restaraunt....don't go to the Copper. If your looking for an Indian Fusion restaraunt...don't go here. HOWEVER, if your looking for an interesting American restaruant, then you can try this place. You may be dissapointed though....You'll notice that there are no "indian" people eating at this place...there's definately a reason why!
