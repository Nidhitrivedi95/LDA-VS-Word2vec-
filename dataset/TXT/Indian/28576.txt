J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ If you are looking for Indian food that will knock your socks off please go to little india. 

Little India is an incredible restaurant in toronto. Frankly, it has zero competition and will remain one of the best restaurants in toronto. 

I love their veggie pakoras, onion bhajia, and samosas!

IMO the best thing I've had here is the lamb rogan josh. Incredible.

I've had the butter chicken, chicken korma,  chicken tikka masala,  and the tandoori meats. They are all delicious too. But my heart remains with the rogan josh.

Naan and rice is great. I look forward to having all the vegetarian dishes in one sitting in the near future. I love you Little India
