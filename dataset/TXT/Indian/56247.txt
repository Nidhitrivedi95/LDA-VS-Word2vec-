xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Really liked this place. $5 for the lunch special jerk chicken roti Tue-Fri. Great value. There's quite of bit of chicken in the roti and its spicy & delicious. Its quite substantial too. 

There were some other specials (not as good as the $5 one, but still good), as well as a regular menu. A lot of the potential things to order. 

My yelp app was showing a check in deal for a free Double. Apparently this offer has ended, but the owner honored it. 

Ample parking. Accepts debit (not credit). Friendly staff. Will be back next time I'm in the area
