7IF5cjvH1d97pzvYPnf9Mg Severa is a quaint little restaurant with a friendly authentic feel to it and friendly staff.
The food is pretty good, may not be the best Indian cuisine I ever had but decent.
The palak paneer was great, the butter chicken just average.
It felt like the restaurant cooks were playing it safe. Not spicy, just the usual Indian flavours.
So bottom line, food is ok maybe 3 stars but the atmosphere is 4.
However, I will go again.
