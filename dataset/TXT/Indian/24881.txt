h2cPIifmtPD029q4sthRSQ I am no expert in Indian food, so I am reviewing from the perspective whether the food appeals to me, instead of whether the food is authentic.  We ordered some sorts of a meat platters that had butter chicken, curry goats, chickpeas, some types of vegetarian food, tantoori chicken drumstick, rice and naan.  All the food tasted rich and bold.  I found the vegetarian items more spicy than the meat items.  The butter chicken was good but The Host's was better.  The curry goat was delicious.  The tantoori chicken tasted good and not too dry.  The only thing I was sure that needed improvement was the naan.  It had a layer of crisp outside alright, but the inside was not that soft and moist.

The services was a bit slow.  We were in a rush, and the server said this entree only took 5 minutes to make.  It took approximately 20 minutes to arrive instead.

Overall, this restaurant was okay.
