OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA 5 stars, ALL THE WAY!! 
Best chilli chicken by far!! So much flavour and SO much food!! 
It's like $8 for chilli chicken on rice and you get a massive portion!
I have had knock offs of this and nothing has come even remotely close!!

Yes, its not like the 5 star setting, but my rating is strictly on the food. Taste is AMAZING. It's a blend of Indian and Chinese so there is TONS of flavour.

Oh, and its super fast service. If you call in they can have your food ready in about 15-20 min.

YUMMY FAST AND CHEAP. MUST TRY!!!
