B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg First, great atmosphere and service. A great place for a business lunch or date night.  Samosas were large and well executed with potato and peas in the filling and three sauces. The lunch serving had two samosas. I had the chicken curry for my first time here. The basmati rice was delicious. My only complaint is that the curry was faaaaar too salty.  I picked the chicken out and left most of the sauce.   I ordered a level two spiciness and shouldve gone with a three without blinking. Two was to mild for me. $12 for lunch and I had leftovers. I'll give them another shot,  but will skip the basic curry.
