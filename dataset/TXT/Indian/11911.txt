auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ We recently went to this restaurant... we have been going there for a long time... and it was different.   The Tikka Masala was not as good.... it was bland... and that is the main reason we go there... I asked the waiter what had changed since we had been there about 2 months ago.. and the bald chef apparently is no long there.   I was dissapointed with the flavor of the samosas also.... I wish I knew where the old chef went.. Not sure we will be coming back if the food is going to be like this????  Update... the bald chef is now at the Taste of India on Maryland Pkwy.  We will be going there now to see if the food is great like it was at the Taj Palace before he left.   They said they sometimes have Tikka Masala for lunch, but said to call in advance to check... they may be able to put it out for us...
