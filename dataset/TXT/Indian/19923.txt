FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I've been here twice. It seems both times, they had the same items in the buffet. Service was poor - none of the wait staff say anything to you until you pay the bill. We were seated by the window and a neon sign that was making a loud noise and smelled like it was burning or going to catch fire. The food was ok - the samosas were subpar, Maharaja on the West side seems to have the best tasting food and the most options for vegans/vegetarians.
