My favorites are: butter chicken and lamb masala. Food quality is very good for its relatively cheap price and large portion. 

The service though is a bit slow. They have 2-3 waiters/ waitresses only so on a busy day, your dinner might have to wait an extra 1-2hrs. I went on a Saturday night one time, and it was so busy to the point I felt like I could just leave without paying and no one would notice. We waited for 30 mins for the food to come out. After we finished, we had to take the to-go box ourselves, packed the left over and still had to wait approx 20 mins for the check. The waiters were rushing back and forth between tables so if you are expecting a relax ambience, you are at the wrong place.
