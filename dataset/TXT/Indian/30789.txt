KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Went here for mother's day since my mom had been wanting to try it for awhile. We definitely will have to come back again. The house cabernet was very good and dry. Everyone at our table ordered something different and we just tried a bit of everything.  Every dish was excellent and the waiter was attentive and able to explain what the different dishes were since we don't eat Indian food much. The garlic naan bread was also great.  I highly recommend this place.
