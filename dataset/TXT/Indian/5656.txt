3HAPJH0Qoi8Ix6M9rUMfjg I found the service terrible and the prices too high.  They don't even have real basmati rice for the curries only some stale gross frozen version of rice.  It was disappointing.   The food was brought out before bans so.everything was cold by the time the bans got there.  For the same money I could have gone to a nice restaurant that was efficiently run.  Also too much garlic in papri chat. It was overall one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.
