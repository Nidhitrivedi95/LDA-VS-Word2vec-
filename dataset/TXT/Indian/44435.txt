rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg Amazing South Indian style food. So many kinds of dosa. We got samosa chaat for an appetizer (my personal favourite) and for main course: palak paneer and mushroom/spiced potato dosa. Both were amazing! We had a fantastic waiter, fantastic food and pretty quick service. Best to make a reservation but we got lucky and we're seated quickly.
