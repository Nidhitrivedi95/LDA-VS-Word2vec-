LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Anytime I have a craving for dosas, Guru Lukshmi is my go-to spot. It is preferred if you make a reservation ahead of time, as this place is very popular and there always seems to be a line up. I happened to arrive 15 minutes prior to opening hours on Saturday and was still third in line to get a table. The food is made with love and the flavours are mouth-watering. If you like spicy, flavorful food, this is the right place to eat. I tried Chettinad Dosa with cheese. I wasn't sure if adding cheese would take away from the authenticity of the dosa, but I felt it just added to the texture and flavour of the dish. I've tried the Mysore Bhaji dosa, which was featured in the Toronto Star newspaper, and it continues to be one of my favourite dosas at Guru Lukshmi. Definitely recommend this place for the food. The long waits might be off-putting to some, but if you have the time, it's definitely worth the wait!
