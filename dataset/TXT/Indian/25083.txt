I find that sometimes there their dishes surprise me with some sweetness which isn't bad, just well... surprising. Also, if you are a big Naan eater be sure to order extra as it never seems quite enough to sop up all that delicious butter chicken sauce! I also found out that they deliver (check out their website for the phone number) no need to use Just Eat or any of those other websites.
