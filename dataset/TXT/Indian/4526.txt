1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg I went to the Biryani House on Hayden because I wanted cheaper curry than the Indian Hut on Church was offering. I ordered mattar paneer, chicken korma, onion bhaji, and rice and it came to about $22. Yes, this place will do just fine for my curry cravings. 

It's not that I can't handle spicy food, but I ordered what I thought are 2 mild dishes. Both had a good kick to them, which I found surprising but acceptable. I wonder if anyone else is not so accepting of a traditionally mild dish served spicy. 

I've done take-out twice now, and both times the waiter/host failed to impress me with customer service skills. Monosyllabic responses to every question might be efficient, but it isn't pleasant. While I waited, he grunted at the other tables in what (I think) was offering refills on the drinks. The second time I ordered over the phone in advance, and the phone manner was equally poor. Meh. I don't care that much. If I can feed me and my boyfriend, with some leftovers for lunch the next day, all for 20 bucks, I'm satisified.

Oh and there is another Biryana House just on Wellesley (I think) that is much bigger, and must be where these photos are from.
