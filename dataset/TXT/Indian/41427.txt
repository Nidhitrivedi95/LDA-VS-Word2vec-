Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Don't let the empty parking lot and smallish looking restaurant fool you - this is some of the best Indian fare (and dining experience) you'll find in Madison.

I'll admit...seeing the place from the outside didn't have me convinced, but since when did I start going to restaurants for their outdoor decor?

The night 3 of us went for dinner, the place was empty, not another soul there.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating right off the bat, getting us situated with a table and bread before we had a chance to take our coats off. I love free stuff.

At one point during the evening, we had 3 separate folks waiting our table...talk about service. All very friendly, trying to be helpful and clear things quickly.

I didn't order a drink like my other two compadres, but the staff brought out chai for me, without asking, on the house.  It was phenomenal. And free. They had me at "on the house."

Down to the food - everything was incredibly flavorful.  Our table had 2 chicken dishes (1 curry), 1 veg dish, and 2 sides of nan.  The chicken was done perfectly and melted in your mouth.  Portions are plenty big. We ate more than we should. 

In short, these guys know what they're doing.  Go.
