gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Mt Everest is my go to place for Indian. I've only been here during lunch for the buffet. It's $11.99. I absolutely love the chili chicken! Curry chicken and Tikka Masala are very good also. The buffet has about 8-10 dishes along with fruit and salad. They bring buttered Naan to your table. The decor isn't much to look at but that really doesn't matter to me. I LOVE this place and if they ever closed down I would be heartbroken!
