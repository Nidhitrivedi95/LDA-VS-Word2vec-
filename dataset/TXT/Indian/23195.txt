gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Tonight I brought my family of five to Mount Everest on empty stomachs and we left all beyond pleased with the service, food and taste. 

We began with chicken momos, that were fresh and had plenty of flavor with and without the sauce. 
We then got the chicken tiki masala, chicken curry, lamb korma and vegetable biryani. 
Each dish was unique and the flavors built off one another. Our water glasses were never empty as the spices climbed, a true testament to the service. 

Both the garlic naan and the plain are perfect accompaniments to the dishes and really round out the meal. 

From the moment stepping inside and breathing in the fresh scent to leaving Mount Everest makes you feel welcome whether it's your first time or old regulars. I told my coworkers this is some of the best Indian food in town and I can't wait for my next meal here.
