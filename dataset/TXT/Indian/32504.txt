li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ I'm waffling between 2 and 3 stars ... Will I eat at Hurry 4 Curry again? Yes. Why? It was fast. It was not a sandwich. It is close to work. OK, I'm going with 3 stars because I will most likely go there over the other "in a hurry" options at the Arizona Center. 

My co-worker picked up our food (she said the touch screen ordering was great), and we both got the Butter Chicken. It was OK - nothing out of this world amazing, but it was very saucy (which I like). Next time, I'll probably get something with some spice. I didn't realize it was not going to be spicy at all.
