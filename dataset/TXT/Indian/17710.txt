e2jGy1NTv4mOms4wquE_lg Good food. We (used to) order for delivery weekly. The first time we ordered the $15 Butter Chicken dish we received a large bowl of sauce with 6 or 7 small cubes of chicken. Disappointing! We gave Sandhu the benefit of the doubt and a few months later, with guests for dinner, ordered the Butter Chicken again and got the same bowl of sauce with hardly any chicken. Hey Sandhu, I can buy an entire BBQ chicken for less than $10. 

Before turning to Yelp to whine about my first world problems, I wrote a polite email to Sandhu about this issue but have received no reply. 

Recap: Really good food, very stingy quantities of Butter Chicken. I'm tempted to give only 2 stars for their lack of response to my email but I'm correcting for my overall grumpiness this morning.
