xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Absolutely delicious. We had samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Chilly Chicken (not sure if it was a typo on the menu) with garlic naan. Unlike most other Indian restaurants I've been to, they don't ask you how spicy you want things. The Chilly Chicken was very spicy, and the Tikka Masala was mildly spicy. 

We'll definitely go back again.
