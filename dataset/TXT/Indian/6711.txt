49taxSIx7Gwdjnr10QrnUw What an incredible place!  I've been a regular patron of Zaiaka for about two years now, and I cannot stop going back, and bringing all of my friends with me.  The previous two reviewers were correct in their assessment of the owner.  Meena Kumar is a very sweet woman who will do everything in her power to ensure you enjoy your experience at her location.  The food is, of course, incredible.  The seekh kebab (lamb) is, as DK said, a great appetizer to open your meal with, although it's best if shared with one or two other people, as it can be very filling.  The vegetarian dishes are also very good and worth trying out; my favorites are the malai kofta, mattar paneer, and dal makhani.  If you're trying Indian food for the first time, I'd recommend trying either Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Makhan Wala.  Either is very good, but be sure to get some kind of naan to go with it.

The atmosphere is very relaxed; you do not have to dress up in order to go, as the place is very casual.  Alcohol is BYOB, but on some occasions (most notably Valentine's day), wine is complementary.  Zaiaka also caters, so if you have a party or wedding, it may be worth your interest to see what they can do.

Once again, this place is a gem!  Every time I bring my friends, they also end up loving Zaiaka, and some even visit on a regular basis with people they also know.  Be sure to visit Zaiaka sometime; you won't be disappointed!
