4ritTGFnNxmKnKm-UX3kPQ If you are looking for a no-nonsense taste of Punjab, this is it! I ordered their non-veg thali, and instead of 2 meat + 1 veg + rice + naan, I opted for 1 meat (goat curry), aloo gobi and kidney beans. I am always unsure I want to order thali dishes for dinner because some of the curry can be sitting there since lunch, but because the traffic is high, it was cooked fresh. Best aloo gobi (cauliflower + potato), must try!
