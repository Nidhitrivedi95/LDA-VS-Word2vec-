OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I reserved on yelp, they didn't even know I had a reservation....
Luckily my friends were there early so they've put some tables together for us. 

Beside that, the food was great. It was really tasty. But, in my opinion, it was really too expensive for what it was. You can find real good, authentic indian restaurants all over Montreal for a very few bucks. 

Beside that, the staff was weird, not that nice and judgy a bit. They were looking at us from there stool where the "bar" is all night long... 

For a one time experience that was fun, especially because I had a show after that at the Club Soda, it was not far from it. But I would never go back just to go and enjoy that restaurant. And I would also not recommend it to friends just because I would recommend others indian restaurants before that one.
