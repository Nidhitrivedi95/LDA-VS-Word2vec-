I love this place, I come here often.   The kathi rolls are fantastic.    To be honest I prefer these over the rice bowls.    Favourite dishes are chicken tikka kathi roll and paneer kathi roll.

Music and atmosphere is also great, and makes you feel that you are not in the middle of a corporate park in the middle of Mississauga.

My only reservation is that it can sometimes take quite a while for the food to be served especially on busy days.  If you are in a rush, I wouldn't recommend going there if the lineup is more than 6 people.     It could take you 20+ minutes to get your food.
