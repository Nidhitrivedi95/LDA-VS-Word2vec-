K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw I only had the weekend buffet at this place and oh boy is it great!
fresh backed naan is my favorite, different dishes on different days provides variety. Food tastes 'home made'. Service is very good, courteous and friendly. I've been to this spot at least a dozen times and never once left unhappy. I would highly recommend the weekend buffet.
$9.50 for this quality is too little to pay but I'm not complaining. ; )
awesome spot for lunch with friends or family.
come early and receive the best service and food then you would later on during the day when the place fills up. (service stays good, but since the place is a bit more packed, you should understand that you will have to be a little more patient)
