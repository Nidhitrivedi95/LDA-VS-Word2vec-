Mw4OBWvBQ-L_a0EOFKFDjQ Tried this for light lunch with chicken samosa and chicken pilaf.
Pilaf was traditional n flavourful .
Only negative where they loose point is that place unhygienic, tables dirty .
Hygiene a big thing for me place n cannot compromise .
May not come for dine in n may do take out !
