9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A 630pm on Valentines Day. We had made reservations at a resaurant downtown, but wanted to eat with our fellow gays in the Village. Cut to us hopping on the metro to Gay Town! After spending a good 30min walking around trying to pick out a restaurant that A) had openings and B) didnt offer a V-Day menu we were famished and still at a loss. Seriously though, who searches for a restaurant ON V-Day? 

Anyway, from across the street we see the blue walls of Tabla. Walking in, I saw the typical pictures of all the Hindu gods/blue people, mixed in with the odd decor that is usually hung up at all indian restaurants. I am beginging to think that every Indian restaurant across the WORLD orders interior design elements from the same place. As we sat down, I was scared we were going to get mediocre indian fare to match the odd interior. Boy, was I wrong! I have had some pretty amazing indian food throughout my time, but this...THIS had to have been some of the best.

We started with dahl and samosas and a killer bottle of wine. We then had tandoori chicken(which came with a pile of spiced rice) saag aloo which was not the overly cooked spinach mass with a few potatoes typically seen, and some chicken dish in a spicy tomato sauce. As I was licking my plate clean, I realized Tabla was the perfect impromptu V-Day dinner. Much better than spending 85 dollars per person on a set menu of just "ok" food.
