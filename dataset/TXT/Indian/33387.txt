Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q Great place!  We stopped in for Social Hour.  The teas were excellent.  We actually didn't hit any actual entree but did appetizers instead.  The tacos were delicious- we got the combo which gives you chicken, steak, and shrimp.  The Spinach and Cheese dip we would probably not get again, we had just been hummused and guaced out, but we'd definitely go for one of those next time.  And the pad thai was very good as well.  Oh yeah, and we had creme brulee for dessert which was great as well!  Also, our server was a super sweet girl (but I forget her name :( but she looks like JLaw).
