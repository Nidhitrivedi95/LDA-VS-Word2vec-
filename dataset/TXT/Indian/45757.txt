Ordered mango lassi, veg samosas and veg pakoras.  Mains butter chicken and spinach and potatoes.  

Samosas looked like they came out of a cardboard box and tasted like it too.  Pakoras were heavy little round balls of potato but missing other veggies.

Butter chicken was merely ok.  Spinach dish was spicy but overcooked.  Naan was fine but rice was a bit dry and peas in it were also a bit dry and hard.

They seem to have a buffet set up for lunch perhaps?  Maybe try again to see if it's better...
