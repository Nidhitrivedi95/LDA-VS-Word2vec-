_W_qYeOmM52rg-g5XbCaLg I usually come here for breakfast if I can't cook in the morning for whatever reason. The price is cheap! The food is average, but for the price you can't complain! I've only had breakfast at this restaurant so I can comment on their other specialties ie Lunch specials. I recommend this joint if you are in the area and need a quick bite!

PS: Service is wonderful! Love the people working there.
