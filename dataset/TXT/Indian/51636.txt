UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA It was one of those slower nights for them.  As usual, the ambient were perfect.  We were seated right away.  Given time and suggestions on chef's special and people's choice of appetizers and main course.  Food came in perfect quantity and steaming hot, not microwaved but freshly made because you can feel that in the taste and aroma of the dish.  Perfect balance of seasoning, hurbs and spices were used.  Gravey was not too light and not too rich but with perfect thickness.  Proposition of gravey to other vegeis was perfect. Naan (bread) was warm with butter on them and freshly made.  Super soft from inside and had nice golden color crust on top with melting butter.  An excellent experience of food, services and environment.  Will recommend to friends, families and others looking for amazing Indian food...
