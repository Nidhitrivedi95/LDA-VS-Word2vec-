5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA This place was very disappointing. The food I had (what was available ) was very flavorful but for a buffet  there were not to many options. It seemed  very authentic  but there was a lack of variety. The atmosphere  was worth zero stars. Dark quite and depressing  we were literally  the only ones there. It has a lot of potential  but the area isn't the best so it's probably  hard to justify going all out for minimal business.

 There was no dessert offered for the buffet but they made something  up real quick which was nice. However  to me a dessert should be a given on an idian buffet. We ordered  waters and all they had were small bottled  waters kept at room temp.

 Not to mention  the price was high, most idian  lunch buffets in the area are 8.99 and this was 11.99. I have no issue  paying 11.99 but for room temp water maybe 5 options and no dessert?

  I did speak with the owner who was very nice and truly cares about was he serves. It is clear he is disappointed with the lack of business  but with all things considered  I can see why other buffets are crowded  and this one is suffering. He spoke off all these great dishes but there was nothing to sample. 

Like I said there is a lot of potential  but unless there are drastic changes I will not be back anytime soon. After  reading all of the great reviews maybe we went on an off day but for a place like this first impression  are everything ....
