t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Since YELP's review algorithm is bias to paying restaurants, i'm giving this a false rating of 5 stars, it's actually a "1" STAR review and here is why:

Came here for a lunch buffet with my family last week and we were so disappointed and I'll tell you why. We arrived at around 2 pm and we were seated right away. Here is the problem, the buffet trays were close to empty, I'm talking rice, chicken tikka, etc..only items left were salad and some we had no idea what. We asked the waitress and she said they don't have anymore food, I say WHAT??we paid in full and yet there are no foods on the trays? There was another family in another table and they felt the same way. I asked the waitress and she said it's best to come early since they don't put anymore food on the tray later during the buffet times. She did came back with chicken tandoori, and guess what, she brought it over from a tupperware bin, it seemed as if she heated it up in the microwave and dumped it on the buffet tray, DISGUSTING! Additionally, they were on Dirty Dining before, I should have known better.

To the business owner: this is unfair and unethical, how can you charge a full amount for a buffet and yet not have the food on hand, looking into consulting the BBB for unethical business practices. We well never come back. And to those reviewers who think this place is great, just ask yourself if it's fair to pay in full and not get what you paid for.
