PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Everything was too spicy!! And I'm Indian so I'm used to spicy food. But this was too much. The pizza bar... Nothing there. 
Then finally when there was one chicken pizza (the only option) it was so overloaded with hot peppers on it that you couldn't even see the chicken. 
Everything on the tava should have been called mirch(spicy pepper) with a side of appetizers. Out mouthes were on fire as soon as I started. 
I tried to eat some fruit some onion rings and even something sweet. But nothing helped. Maybe that's the trick to get people to buy fruity drinks. 
Even the veg subzi and daal was tooo spicy, at that point I gave up and didn't have the mouth to try anything else. (Not that there was much to try) lips were on fire and tongue was throbbing in pain. 
 We came with a group of 10 and there were a few multicultural friends too everyone was in the same pain! I had some gulabjamun jamun for dessert and the restaurant was too cold for ice cream. So we gave up and left. My boyfriend and I were in so much discomfort. Thank goodness for the TimHortons next door some warm sweet tea helped us feel better on the way home. 
What a horrible experience!!
