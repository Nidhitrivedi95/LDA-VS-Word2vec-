wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw For September's international supper club UYE Taj Mahal was the place picked to meet at.

It's a newer place in old town Scottsdale, so they are still working on some kinks, at times it did seem as if service was slow, but so extremely friendly. We were a big group of 20, so it's somewhat expected.

I knew what I wanted before I even got there, I had been craving chicken tikka masala, just had to have it! So I ordered the chicken tikka masala and some onion naan bread.

The naan bread was packed with sautéed diced onions, it was crispy and soft at the same time and had great flavor! 

The chicken tikka masala, oohh my sweet heaven, this was some of the best chicken tikka masala I have had in years! I ordered it at medium heat level and it was good, next time I will go a tad bit hotter.  The chicken was so tender and juicy, and the sauce, oh sweet Jesus the sauce was just heavenly! I really wanted to lick my bowl clean, however I did not haha. The portions look small, but honestly it's the perfect amount, I was full and content with having eaten one of the best meals I have had in a long time.

Looking forward to coming back and trying some other dishes!
