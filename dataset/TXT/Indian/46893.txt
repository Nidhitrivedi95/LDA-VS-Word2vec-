t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I have been here twice. The first time was for buffet and the second time we had their Sunday lunch specials.

 The place had a nice atmosphere, clean and spacious.

They have a small lunch buffet for $12.99 and the drinks cost $1. There was three veggie dishes, 4 chicken dishes, plus appetizers, and salad. I would've liked to see a few more selections... Nothing was tasteless but nothing blew my mind, either, it was not spicy and they didn't have my fave dish i.e goat curry.

When it comes to ordering from the menu, the spice level is 1 to 10. I would recommend under 5.

On Sunday they have no buffet but lunch specials.

I wasn't crazy about their food, it was just ok. I felt the price was high compared to the portion. I do like the fact they had Indo-chinese dishes on the menu.
