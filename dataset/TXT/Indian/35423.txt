muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw I ordered the chicken bhari and I was a little disappointed with how plain my dish was. My plate was 3/5 covered in naan, the rest was the pieces of chicken and a dry salad with no dressing. I received 7 boneless pieces of meat off of a kabob. The texture was very good, temperature was hot, but the spices and flavor missed the mark. I wanted the buffet, because I like the variety, but its only on the weekends I believe.  Not sure if I would come back here. My plate was about $10 which I thought was a bit high for chicken and flat bread.
