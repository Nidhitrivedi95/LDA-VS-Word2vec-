UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I love this place for lunch! Never a big crowd, and they get you in and out quickly. But, if you're not in a hurry and want to sit and check emails or play or your phone, they're cool with that too. Service is quick and the food is amazing. I've only ever had the lunch buffet, but it's on the top Indian good I've had. Must try's are the lentil soup and the garlic naan. Both are the best I've ever had.
