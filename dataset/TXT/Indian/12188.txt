auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ $17 for a little container of curry?! That's just way too much. 1 star because it tasted good but it hardly had any chicken in it and it was too small of a serving for the price we paid! 

Might try this place for their buffet since I guess that is what it's known for. Until then, 1 star!
