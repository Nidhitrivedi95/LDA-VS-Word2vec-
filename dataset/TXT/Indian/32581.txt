LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I would give this place 5 stars.  

It has all the criteria I want in a dosa - crispy and good fillings (but not too much).  It can get very spicy though so, for those who doesn't like it too spicy, I would go for the milder flavors.  If you like it slightly sweeter, I would recommend the coconut masala dosa.  But, I'm sure they are all tasty and the fillings really come down to personal preference.  It's more like, what would you like as your filling - tofu, chickpeas, potatoes.  Then, you decided, how would I like it spiced?  With Coriander, coconut flakes, chili, etc...I know the menu can be overwhelming.

The sambar was extremely tasty and delicious.  

We also ordered the Idly (the steamed rice cakes) and I really enjoyed that.  It was extremely soft and fluffy.  I would definitely order it again.

Would I wait 45min to an hour to have this?  Absolutely not!  Would definitely recommend sending them an email to RSVP.  I think if I waited 45min, I would have been too cranky to enjoy it and probably would not give it a 5.
