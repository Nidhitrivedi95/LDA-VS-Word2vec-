fVbZptKCH2lIRS56M1zc6g My mom has been to this place multiple times, and suggested that I tried it with her a few days ago. We got the "Kings Platter" Which came with tandoori chicken, chicken kabob, tandoori chicken chunks & non-tandoori, and some type of curry seasoned fish.... It was bursting with flavour, melting in the mouth. Their naan was amazing, and the rice cooked to perfection. There was so much food for 25$ we couldn't finish it all, and had to take out a lot of chicken. We ended it all wish rasmali, which was to die for! Will be visiting again soon
