FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw My family and I have eaten here a number of times. Always busy, but there is a lot of room. Wait staff is very friendly. The lunch buffet is the best value. The food is fantastic. Great variety of Indian food. Good Nan bread and great Biryani. Prices are very reasonable for a family. We will keep coming back.
