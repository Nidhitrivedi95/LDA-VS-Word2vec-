TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Great place for a quick, easy lunch for great and tasty Indian food.  From one end of the buffet to the other, the lunch menu offered great tasting food.  Great food always starts with fresh ingredients, and the freshness in Nasmaste's food really shines through.  The owner was super pleasant and really a pleasure to speak with.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for delicious food, Indian or otherwise (I'm actually not a fan, but I loved the food).  

The restaurant has a nice clean look that is soft and comfortable.  The service was great too.
