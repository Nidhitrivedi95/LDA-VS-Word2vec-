PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ This was my third time visiting Tandoori Flame and boy has it gone downhill. The first time around the time when it first opened, the food was pretty good, standard north indian cuisine. Jumping to this last time, it was really bad. First of all, the service was terrible. We needed our server twice during our lunch, and both times we had to walk up to her and ambush her for what we wanted.
Second of all, the main course food was alright. A few steps up from frozen President's Choice Indian dinners. I wouldn't have complained if it wasn't for the dessert. I had the rice pudding, which was like eating crispy (but not so crispy) cereal. The rice was rock hard!! It was either uncooked, or just refrigerated for ages. The Rasgula and Jalebi was, I am certain, at least 2 weeks old - tasted like old oil. 
It felt like they'd started to cut corners and just kept going because they still got business.
