Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Not remotely Tibetan or Nepalese despite its name.  In fact, they serve both South and North Indian food.  In any case they are very friendly and the service was excellent.

The food is served in very generous and the flavours are excellent.    My lamb was excellent and butter tender.  Mulligatawny soup was great too, though I could have done without the pieces of broccoli (nothing negative for other people, I just happen to detest the stuff).  The samosas were homemade and freshly made!  Delicious.

The storefront is pleasant if nothing too fancy.  We went on a Monday and were the only customers so the food and service were extra good.
