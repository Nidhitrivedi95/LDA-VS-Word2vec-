LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg I only stopped in for takeout. Everyone I spoke to was very nice, they were speedy, and the food was delicious when I finally got home. I ordered soup and lamb dish and both were fantastic. Together it came out to about $21. I've heard they have a great lunch buffet-- I'll be sure to try that next.
