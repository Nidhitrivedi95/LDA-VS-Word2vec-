1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg The food here is great. Always enjoyed getting indian food here whether it be in their lunch special or for dinner. A big fan of the Shrimp Vindaloo, which has the right amount of spice and is very flavorful. As for taste, it is definitely one of the better indian restaurants i've been to in and outside of Toronto. I've been there probably a dozen times to eat over the years.

The owner who is usually at the shop is not friendly, but usually isn't rude either. The restaurant is located right off the Hayden exit on the Bloor/Yonge subway station. The interior of the restaurant is very small, probably couldn't fit much more than 20 comfortably. I remember having to scoot my chair a few times to make sure I wasn't in the way when people walked by. 

I would recommend it for doing takeout.
