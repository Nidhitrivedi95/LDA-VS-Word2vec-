Tv8uaK1ymZES4vjSpr1unQ This was a unique experience. I've never gotten lunch from inside of a Hare Krishna Temple before, safe to say. 

Dim lighting, nicely made-up tables, soft Indian music. Kind of a funky atmosphere. I liked it.

Got the dish to go, $10 all in, pretty generous amount, lots of variety, nice taste, pretty fresh. Really enjoyed the date balls for dessert. I'm not a vegan or vegetarian by any means, but I still respect the food and the ethos behind it.

All in all, I enjoyed it. Will be back for sure, maybe I'll try eating in next time and soak up more of the atmosphere. 

I don't know how they make any money though, it wasn't very busy and it's pretty cheap and there is no alcohol obviously to help pad the bottom line.

Hope they make it, I'd like to come regularly!
