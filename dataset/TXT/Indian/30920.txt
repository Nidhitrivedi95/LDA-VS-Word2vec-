KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Ok my rating purely based on the lunch buffet that I am eating right now. I did arrive by 1 pm that's 90 before close. 
Most of the items were sitting there and had no freshness or the the taste you will expect. Britain was just ride and small chicken piece while the rice had drive Ed and become hard. Gram lentil (Chana daal) had twice the amount of salt. Goat curry was probably prepared from frozen so it just microwaved hot and in thick gravy no freshness there either. I tried eggplant (baigan bharta) no freshness there either. Naan was not crisp but again probably sitting in over (pre made). Kheer (rice putting) was simple rice and milk. No dry fruits or condensed milk flavor or even elaichi. Gulab jamun were hard dried and no syrup has gone in them. 

There was just one girl visible doing food runs and could not get the water to the table so had to remind again. 

Having said that, I have had better experience. At dinner time. Both food, drinks and service. But buffet sucks big time. Lesson learnt.
