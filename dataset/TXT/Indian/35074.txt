mOsKIonnlHllP9gfbXdgnQ ***I was first to review this place.  I gave it 5 stars and below review remains.  I do feel it has fallen off big time.    

I have given you so many chances, your staff is very nice.

My last straw was the cockroach on the fridge.   I called the guy out from the back to show the  cockroach.  It was about mid adult size, with them wirey attennas.   It was crawling around, and i pictured it being baked into my shami kabab I just ordered.  

The food is on warmers.  It is either doused in oil to not get dry... Or it is Dry.

I have a sense of humour, and i literally have to never go back there ever again after posting this.  Otherwise I will get curry cockroach to go!

Fail!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
