sdO4fyWkFsZYHSj6yVwQIg Shahi Palace is entirely devoid of atmosphere. Most patrons seem to prefer to eat in their cars, or at home. We chose the dine-in option, and are no worse for the wear (though I am still puzzling over the locker room aesthetic of the bathroom).

I was most impressed with the naan and the salt lassi. The salt lassi is full of cumin seeds, by the way. It was not as salty as one I had in New Jersey, but that's OK. The naan was nicely charred without being burnt to a crisp. If only I could achieve the same result in my home toaster. The raita was pretty good, too; nice and sour.

I liked our entrees. The chicken jalfrazi was certainly spicy (not hot), but a little too much oil. There was also a paneer that worked well.

Really, at $28 for this stuff, it's hard to go too wrong. Apparently, though, I might have tried a chicken roll. Those were selling fast.
