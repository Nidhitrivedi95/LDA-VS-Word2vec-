ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw One of the best Indian food I have ever had.
Spice levels are highly customizable, made to order menu items and didn't take much time to prepare. Waiters are really nice and accommodating. We drive 30 miles to eat here. An American colleague suggested this place and not surprising to see a lot of Americans dine at this Indian restaurant !
