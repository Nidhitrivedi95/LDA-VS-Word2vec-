JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg It's really hard to find a good Indian restaurant in North America, but this ladies and gentleman is a gem! What caught my eye is that they have a dish named 'Goat Amritsari' and if an Indian restaurant has a goat dish you know it's legit. So when i placed the first order with them I pigged out and ordered sooo much that my bill was a $100 and mind you this was only for my wife and I! The food was excellent and Earth Indian has become one of my go-to restaurants! A must try is the Prawn Balchao!
