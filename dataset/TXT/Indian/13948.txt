BuC5gidaUkXs0YPZmvQexA Took a detour on my way home just to try this after hearing great reviews from my friends-- I wasn't disappointed! 

I came in right when the pies just came out and ordered quite a few different varieties. The service was extremely welcoming and polite and the first pie I tried (Chicken Pot Pie, a classic of course) was delicious. I can't wait to try their other pies!!!
