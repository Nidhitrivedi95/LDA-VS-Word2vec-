grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg First time here...I was craving butter chicken and hubby checked yelp..its tucked away in a small strip plaza but easy enough to.find with free parking. Lots of variety and so cheap! We tried a meat lamprai which includes 1 meat Curry, a rice, and 5 veggie curries with an egg and some other sides wrapped in a banana leaf...for like 9.bucks this thing can feed 2...it weighed a ton! Try the eggplant dish! I wasn't sure what to pick so told the guy to pick his favourite and he told me the eggplant is the best recipe...he did not lie! 
I will return:)
