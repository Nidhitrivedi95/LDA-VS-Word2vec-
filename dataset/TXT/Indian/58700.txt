Yoc9_4sv6AT1AIohPPiGbA Decent food. Not authentic by any means as I think the chef is not from the south, and the flavors quite don't live up to ones I grew up in Chennai. Everything is a bit unnecessarily spicy, even sambar. I think they confuse food from Chennai to one in hyderabad where everything is spiced up and hot, have no idea. So kinda all of it taste similar and the price isn't cheap by any means. The service is not professional yet, but people there are very helpful. I am a student so being accessible near ASU is the major plus. There is much better Indian( south Indian) food in the valley if you can travel and bear to stay hungry for a while.
