-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw Amazing value for money!  Highly recommended.  

All prices include tax.  For $8 (veg.) or $9 (non-veg.) you will be completely filled by their 3-choice thali plates, which include salad, rice, NAAN, and papadum.
The $5 wraps are also a fantastic value/quality. 
The owner(?) and the gentleman with the turban are really nice.  

I wish they would offer a bhuna or rogan josh (fish as a protein would be nice too!), and the washroom and decor should be improved, but but at least they usually play decent Indian music, and not crappy Top 40 radio!
