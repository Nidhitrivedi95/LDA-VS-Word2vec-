muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw I visited this place on a Sunday, a very busy day because of an all-day buffet.  Almost everything was delicious on the buffet table! The sweets, not so many selections only a couple.  Service was also good.  It does get very hot inside though. 

Would eat here again for sure! Not bad, and a lot better than most South Asian restaurants.
