YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A We came here for lunch one day on our trip to Toronto. We ordered the lamb vindaloo and aaloo gobhi, as well as naan. The food was very good, however, it does not come with rice, which we had to order after the food came. Service was pretty good. Just the pricing, which perhaps is due to it's location also, is over-priced. I know the typical portion size for these dishes, and this is what I expect, however I wouldn't expect to pay 19 for a small bowl of vindaloo.
