daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ It's hard for me to find a chaat place that I really like, so I was excited to try this one out since it recently opened up in the area. The decor was decent, and overall the place looked clean. We ordered chicken puffs, samosa chaat,  papdi chaat, and tiramisu. The portions were super tiny, yet still the food was pretty expensive! We came in for dinner and one chaat per person was not enough. 

The samosa chaat seemed good in flavor, but there was only one samosa and it wasn't even a decent size. There was also a huge lack of chickpeas, which is essential to any chaat. After searching in our dishes, we found that the average amount was 2 chickpeas per dish! There also weren't a lot of onions or solid food, so at times it was kind of like eating chutney with a spoon. Plus there was so little that I finished it in less than 5 minutes, still hungry for more.

The papdi chaat looked yummy, although, again, it was a small portion. The first bite was fine, but after a few more I found it to be inedible. The ratio of papdi to chutney was not good at all, and my mouth started hurting from chomping down the crunchy and dry dish. After a while, I gave up and stopped eating.

The tiramisu was okay... it seemed soggy but was still better than the rest of the meal. The chicken puffs were okay as well. They were small in size and were not anything to write home about. They garnished the dish with potato chips, which were quite obviously store bought. The service was slow as well.

By the end of the meal, I was nauseous and bloated without even eating much at all. The next day, my stomach was upset and so was I. For some reason, the place was doing pretty well and it wasn't that empty. Not sure what people see in this place. Never coming back!
