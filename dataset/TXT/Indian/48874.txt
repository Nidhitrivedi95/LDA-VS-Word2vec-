tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA Personally my favourite take-out Indian in Mississauga. I call the place "Cheap and Cheerless", but in NO WAY is that derogatory. The chili chicken, rice and Chana are great! But start with some Pakoras and sauce and a vegetarian samosa. I always have leftovers for next day's lunch! Excellent value. Too bad they don't deliver.
