RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w - Probably the most popular Indian restaurant in town. Excessive hype IMO
- As authentic as you will get in Toronto. The ambience, decor,  the people, the area itself all contribute to the experience.
- Everything served in styrofoam plates and cups. Not my favorite part about the place.
- Staff are friendly. Usually extremely busy. Late night isn't a bad option. 
- Recommended items : Chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, tadka daal and definitely try the mango lassi.
