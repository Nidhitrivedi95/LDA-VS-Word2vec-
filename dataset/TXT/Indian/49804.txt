U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw Not much into writing reviews but this place definitely deserves one :-). Tried their chicken tikka, goat curry and naan...Excellent food both in taste and quality. Will definitely be going there often as this is the best Indian food I have come across in AZ in last 8 years. Hope they keep serving the same level of good food!!
