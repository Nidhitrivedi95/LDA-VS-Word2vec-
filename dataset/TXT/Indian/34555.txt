Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg We walked  in on Christmas eve expecting a menu dinner but and they had a "special" buffet and would not take menu orders. So we decided to try it but what a let down. A pricey $18 per person for a vegetarian buffet !!
Most of the vegetables were creamy and oily - Ykes.
None of the buffet items were labeled so I am guessing here.
1. Paneer dish- was just full of cream
2. The basic item like plane rice was over cooked and broken like some cheap quality rice - did not taste nor have the aroma of "basmati rice"
3. THe "naan" was cold, soggy and stacked up. We expected naan to be served hot at the table like any good indian resturant.
4."daahi vada" was hard as rocks
5.  aloo bellpepper was full of oil 
6. palak paneer - There wad not paneer in the "Palak paneer"
7. The desert-1 - gulab jamun" was too hard and too sweet.
8.dessert-2 - fruit salad - not fresh fruital all from a can and tasteless.
To top it off when the workers tried to pour a new batch of " fruit salad" they trued pouring it in from a large container and inevitable it went all over his hand (no gloves) Wonder how kosher is the kitchen. 
THis is when I had enough for this place. 
Think twice before eating here.
