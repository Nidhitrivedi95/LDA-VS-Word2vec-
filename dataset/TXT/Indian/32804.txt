LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA The quality of food and service have both seriously dropped at the new location. The new location has still has a crowded atmosphere inside in a bigger place. 

Well based upon what myself, my family and friends feel, that people have no other choice at this point, so they just happen to tolerate the bad service and the food; but mark our words, that If and when a new restaurant comes around the corner, guru Lakshmi is just going to drain out in no time. Bad bad bad customer service!!!!
