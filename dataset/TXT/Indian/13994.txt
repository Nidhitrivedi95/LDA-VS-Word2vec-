BXeXS9EaNN03AptFwElvjA Indian nom nom nom!!

So as a friend and I completed our awesome fancy dress outfits we decided that we needed some food to reward our efforts!!

We had been admiring the mosque kitchen and thinking of giving it a go! my amigo pointed out a very true thing....it doesnt look very authentic! It looks like any cafe/restaurant that could be serving anything so on we went!

We saw Dehli and inspected the menu, cheap we thought and with him being a student on we went inside. As you go inside your eyes and other senses are assaulted. The vibrant decor, the smell of the food, the music and the bollywood madness on the screen transport you to another world away from the bustling world outside.

One thing we did notice immedietrly was the high number of Indian customers! There is a lot to be said we agreed for a restaurant if its a palce where the people of said country cuisine go to dine there!You kind of think ....yeah....this is going to be good!

After reviewing the menu we opted for the £14.95 sharing platter!!

After a reasonable wait we were not disappointed! What appeared before us was a rorating platter with different dishes!

- lovely fragrant rice
- chipati and naans
- chickpea curry,
- spinach and potato dish (alak gook perhaps im not good with names)
- chicken masala
- badjis with cous cous and salad with yogurt sauce!!

Also included for this price were a juice, I had gauva juice! So damn goood!

Also included was a desert to share which was a mango cheesecake!! The base wasa very buttery shortcake, with a cream rich cake with pieces of mango through it topped and decorated with passionfruit, raspberry and mango purees! AMaaaaazing!

Jd - hugely happy man will be back here for sure!!
