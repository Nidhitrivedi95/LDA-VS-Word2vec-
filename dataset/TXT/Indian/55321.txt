Wait a while to be seated because this place is super busy, and enjoy the best Indian food in town! Go with a larger group and order more variety, try many of the dishes in their extensive menu and you are in for some delightful surprises. Place is not fancy, but clean, well kept, not tacky, comfortable and the staff is super friendly and efficient enough. Went there many many times, never disappoints. Last time April 2016, with a family group of 8, and the waiter at reception was extremely helpful securing a table for us in reasonable time, despite the busy line behind us and the packed room.
