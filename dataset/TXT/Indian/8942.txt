8-4EI1VyBQsMEvScE4LEJw We eat here pretty regularly.  Tuesday is our favourite day because diners receive 10%off. We usually get the butter chicken, vegetable korma, naan.  I enjoy the food and find the flavours very nice.bread is amazing!  This week the butter chicken was also very god though I would say that the chicken could be a bit more tender.  Of course we will come again to this place.  The service is great as well.  Decor is slightly outdated, in my opinion. Tweaks could have me give them a 5 star rating.
