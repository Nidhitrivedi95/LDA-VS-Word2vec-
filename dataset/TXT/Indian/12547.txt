AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw With a bold name like that..you know they've gotta deliver! Add sultan to anything and you've instantly upgraded to first class! I can't deny it, I was lured here by the name. LOL

This is a tiny takeout joint serving some expensive samosas! For those who are used to 5-7 somosas for a dollar; you been spoiled! It's not too late to turn back! But if you truly want some freshly mader  and delicious samosas then head on it.

This is not the typical cheapy, doughy, oily stuff you get at your local supermarket or variety stores. The wrapping is thin! Kinda like Chinese spring rolls. I find that with this wrapper, it's crispier and significantly less oily than the traditional stuff. I also learn from an Indian friend that these are from a different part of the country but they are absolutely the real deal!

They have a bazillion different flavours but of course I went with the lowly veggie and chicken ones; they were delicious! Some of the best if not the best I have every had. Piping hot, super crispy, fresh, aromatic and the ratio of fillings to wrapper felt almost perfect. I actually prefer the veggie more because it had significantly more flavour to it for some reason; not that the chicken wasn't flavourful either.

This place is busy and they do run out! If you are making a destination stop, you might want to call ahead or drive real fast!

I do have to agree with most that while these are incredibly delicious, at a buck a pop they are crazy expensive compared to what you can get out there. But then again... I think it's well worth the price; sorta. :S
