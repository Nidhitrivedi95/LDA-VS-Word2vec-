RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Worst place ever , cold food , bad service , overpriced . Do not go to Lahore Tikka House please . They warm their food when you order it , meaning it's pre cooked . Don't ever go there , you will be dissapointed . My name for this place is : GARBAGE . My girl and I walked out . It's very bad . More geared to people who don't know what Indian / Pakistani food tastes like . More for people that just want to eat bland and Cold  Indian / Pakistani  food and want to pay through the roof . Do not go there . Waste of money on garbage . We ordered Butter Chicken , Ribs and Palak Paneer with Naan , all 4 dishes came out cold . In fact , the paneer was nearly frozen in the middle . The Naan I think they Microwave . I think the Naans from a store rather than it being cooked in a tandoor oven . WTF ? Even the food , because its already cooked , they frigin Microwave it . Lol . We sent it all back and walked out . People , there are thousands of Indian / Pakistani restaurants out there with way better service , food , cost etc . Go there . GUARANTEED ,  Lahore Tikka will dissapoint you . What a GARBAGE PLACE . I hope this post is helpful to the people who haven't been there yet .
