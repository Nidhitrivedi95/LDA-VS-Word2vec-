jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Amazing place to be at any point of time.To Begin with,I ordered samosas made by chef Nely,they were real beautiful and the best.The next ones were the chilly chicken and they were really spicy just the way I wanted it to be with some simply lip smacking garlic naan.The food there is really awesome and it really has some magic in it that keeps me going back again and again! :)
