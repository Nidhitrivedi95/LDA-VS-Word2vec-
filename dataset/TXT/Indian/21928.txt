gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw They say this is the only halal restaurant in Las Vegas. That is not true. There are plenty. Also this is definitely not Pakistani cuisine. More like fusion of Pakistani and middle eastern. That being said, no complaint here on that because the food is epic! 

Almost everything on the menu is good. Their burger is different than a regular American style burger and it is really good! 

1 star less due to parking issues. Downtown is not parking friendly and you have to park far away on the streets and walk here.
