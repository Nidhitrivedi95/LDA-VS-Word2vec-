RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg We ate here twice in two days, once for dinner and again at the lunch buffet, because everything we had was delicious. It was quiet too, without the stinky casino smoke, plus nice decor and fast service. This place is an undiscovered gem. If you like Indian food and you're at the Rio, definitely eat here.
