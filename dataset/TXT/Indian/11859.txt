AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ I was attending a weekend conference and Maezo was the caterer for all three meals. I usually am not a fan of Indian food but they did an excellent job feeding us with the abundant food. They served us buffet style which included a variety of dishes like mushrooms, pasta, rice, chicken, fruits, potatoes and dessert.

Despite the marathon going on that weekend, they pulled a trolley instead of dropping off the meals by car. Everyone at the conference were happy with the meals throughout the weekend. It will be worth trying when I do pass by their restaurant with some friends.
