bU6mVZSuO5EpvfUay87e8g After hearing a rave review from an ex work colleague (who can be quite a snob), and walking past the restaurant's 'flash' exterior (well it looks fancy when you remember the bed shop that used to be there) I decided to give Kebabish a bash.


 First of all, I have to agree with the below reviewer. Our table was slightly dirty. The restaurant itself was cold and although the waiter was very helpful to the point of nervousness, I can't say I was too impressed with the food. I mean, it was okay but nothing too spectacular. Maybe it's because it was a weekday evening but there wasn't much atmosphere either.


 I highly doubt I'll be back but I reckon it makes sense as an addition to Dalry road and will probably do well in the area as there's not much else to choose from in the way of mid price range sit in restaurants. I'm guessing they'll do well with the student population on the way home from town, if they open late enough to exploit this market.
