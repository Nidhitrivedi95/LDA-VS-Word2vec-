NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ Mmmmm Indian food!

Set up almost like a cafeteria/chipotle style, hot n mild is a good place to stop in for some good Indian food.

I definitely did not think it matches the spice level of its rival down the street (it was definitely much more milder), but still good. We got the combo meals of dal, chicken vindaloo, butter chicken and chicken tikka marsala. All were very good- we even got a side of garlic naan and the veg samosas. Very fast and good.

Seating is limited, but there are a couple of seats there. 

The food is definitely milder here, but it's also very good as well. I recommend here- it definitely satisfied my hungry stomach.
