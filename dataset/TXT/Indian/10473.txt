9sS0LaJVnv_HR_klZq4Dlg I use to go to mainstream Samosa places to get my samosas. Then I found this hidden gem in Scarborough and I feel blessed! After trying out their samosas, I have made orders after orders. And when you order food for catering to others, it really represents you and your personality. So thanks to their delicious samosas, I have earned such positive feedback. Every one that have tried their samosas through my orders have provided great feedback about their food. This is a great feeling and I am going to order food from them going forward!
