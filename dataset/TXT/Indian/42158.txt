qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ It was the "Bomb"! - 4.5/5

For several month now, my boyfriend has been craving Indian food and I finally gave in. We came here for one of our monthly celebrations and it did not disappoint. This little gem is found all the way in Markham at Hwy 7 and Galsworthy Dr. I made a reservation for 2 around 7pm and when we showed up, it was just us two (it was sooo romantic =3) but then 10 mins later, a family showed up for dinner, haha! 

Presentation: The place had a light scent although when we left, that scent was still lingering with us, very clean, there was some Indian music playing in the background at a low volume and it was a very homely setting/ the utensils and plates were clean and all the food brought to us were served in stainless steel dishes.

Pros: big portions (you will have leftovers) and everything is FRESH!

Cons: Their website is faulty if you want to make a reservation, calling them is more efficient.

Fave Eats: Palak Paneer; the cheese pieces were humungo, Butter Chicken; so rich and creamy with a touch of sweetness and lastly dessert, Kulfi; traditional Indian ice-cream, it was heavenly!

Price: Decent, you get a lot of food for three dishes!

Seconds: YES PLEASE! =D
