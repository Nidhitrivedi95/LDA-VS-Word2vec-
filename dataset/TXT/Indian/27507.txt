Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg My sister and I really enjoyed our dinner here. It is located in the front of the Matthews Festival shopping center, but don't expect to find fluorescent lights and old booths. The decor is very modern and pretty. The owner walked us through the menu and gave us recommendations for dishes to try. We decided on the Gobi matar paneer keema and the  Subzi daal makhni. Both dishes were delicious. The garlic naan was also delightful. They have lots of vegetarian options and vegan options as well. The portion sizes are large and the prices are very reasonable. We left very full and happy. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try.
