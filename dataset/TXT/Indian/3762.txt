0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in food. We ordered the dry chili chicken and Manchurian noodles. Order came out quick. I just can't believe how a dish so colourful and fragrant be so bland. The chili chicken was flavourful but not as I expected. It was well seasoned but I cannot say the seasonings complimented each other. Customer service was good, price is good, food did not live up to its hype. Will not be back and would not recommend. The only thing we wanted more of was the fortune cookie.
