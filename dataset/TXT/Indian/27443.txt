IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA The food was tasty and good. We had the lamb rogan josh (highly recommended) and the chicken Madras with ginger naan (the only place I've found making this variety of naan) with onion bhaji, papadom and pilau rice. Service was fast, portions were big (the meal was meant for two but we were so full after a while that we kept the rest for breakfast the next day). If you're craving good Indian food where portions are generous and prices are okay, this is the place to go.
