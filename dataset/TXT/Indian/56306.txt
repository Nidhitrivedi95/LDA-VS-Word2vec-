Xr6GqliUPIkRE8Q-Uh1mJA Watch out for the hot sauce! I always get the boneless chicken roti. The owners are from Trinidad so the food is very good and authentic.

The place is a clean hole (if you get that) but that's where all the good foods are located. Roti is very good and wish it was a bit bigger because I want some more after I'm done. But it is a good size portion.

It is a ways off from downtown but I would think of Ram's when I'm eating a roti somewhere else.
