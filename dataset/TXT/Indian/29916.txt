jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I went to this restaurant because I am vegan. While they do have a decent selection of vegan dishes, the ones I tried were horrible. I ordered the vegetable curry and some whole wheat nan. The food was tasteless. The peas, carrots, and corn were frozen. When the hostess brought the food she only brought the curry, and I had to ask for rice, also she brought the food in a metal container and not on a plate. It tasted like there was no spices or curry added. The restaurant was empty and the cashier kept going in the back, so it seemed like a ghost town. I had to ask and get my own water. The whole layout is horrible. I don't know who designed the place but it actually makes your eyes hurt. I really don't think they will be around very long.
