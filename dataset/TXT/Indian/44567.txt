ry_c9N_E4zmB3VlyLDE26Q My boyfriend and I had been attempting to cut down on the number of takeaways we were eating, and had been doing so well... until last night when laziness and a desire for curry overcame us and we ordered from The Raj.  We'd not ordered before, but being Leith residents had walked by a few times and had heard of 'Curry In A Hurry' so thought we'd give it a go, and set to choosing what we wanted from the leaflet pushed through our letterbox a couple of weeks ago.

The deal advertised on the front is for two curries (chicken, lamb or veg), two rice, a naan, poppadoms and two 'free' beers for £18.95 - pretty decent. It doesn't specifiy any further than that, but it would appear that despite ordering two chicken curries (Sag and Pasanda), two rice (albeit one of them Pilau), a naan (Peshwari) and poppadoms we obviously didn't qualify for the discount! Perhaps our tastes in rice and naan meant we were disqualified - it would be a better idea for the leaflet (and the website, I checked) to specify what rice and naan were included... Our total was £23 (which was about 60p more than I'd calculated off the menu....).

The rice was fine, although the container wasn't completely full like most are, and the curries were decent. The sag was nicely spicey, and my boyfriend said he'd be happy to order the pasanda again. And most importantly to a poppadom fiend  like myself, the poppadoms were absolutely fine (is it possible to get a truly excellent poppadom? I don't know, but you can certainly get bad ones).

I can't say anything was particularly outstanding, and it's annoying to find out when the delivery arrives that you have to pay £4 more than the advertised deal... but the food was okay and delivery was prompt (though not quite as swift as the half an hour I was told on the phone). We may well order again, but with so many Indians to choose from we'll probably keep trying to find 'The One'.
