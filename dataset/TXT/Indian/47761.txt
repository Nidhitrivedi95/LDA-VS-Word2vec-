       - Flavor - Probably one of my favorite India restaurants in town. The lamb is tender and not overcooked like other places.
       - Price/Portions - The prices are on par with other Indian restaurants but the portions are definitely a lot smaller.
       - Locale - The restaurant is located in a pretty bad neighborhood and the parking lot is dimly lit.
       - Decor - Though it might not look it from the outside, the inside is quite nice.
       - Lunch Buffet - They have a lunch buffet for $11.95 which I think is a way better deal. Moreover, I wouldn't want to be in that neighborhood at night anyway.
**Ordered**
       - $14.95 Chicken Tikka Masala - Creamy and delicious, this curry is a must try.
       - $15.95 Lamb Rogan Josh - The lamb was tender. The curry was a tomato base and wasn't as thick as other curries.
       - $2.95 Garlic Naan - Your standard garlic naan, fluffy and soft.
       - $3.95 Cheese Naan - They added cheese to regular naan. It kinda tasted like a cheese pizza, but better.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd definitely recommend this place. However, if you don't mind which meal, I'd say go to the lunch buffet for a wider selection and a way better deal.
