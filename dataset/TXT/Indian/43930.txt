RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Really good Pakistani food. I'm told its very authentic and some of the best you will find. I loved the mango shake! Made from the best mangos available. 

I split the buttered chicken and another beef dish with two others. The Nan was fantastic, as it usually is at these type of restaurants, and the buttered chicken was also very good. Portion sizes were great and there was definitely enough food to go around for all three of us to be full. If I were in the mood for this type of food and in this area again, I would head straight there.
