9K7MGRE9op4Ewi3HE49eKw A quick trip to Edinburgh, did not want to spend too much $$ for a late dinner. Walking on Leith Walk, came upon this place, took a chance.  Large Seekh Kebab with Naan was good, spicy, filling, for a good price. Staff were friendly,  asked if all was Good with a smile.

If you are looking for a basic restaurant with good prices, consider Curry House.  If in Edinburgh, will try again.
