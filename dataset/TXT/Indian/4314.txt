1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw I was really excited about this place because I love Indian street food and haven't found a great place yet in Cleveland. But I was overall disappointed by this restaurant. The food was just average, and the ambiance was strange. I went on a Saturday night and they were out of many of their key menu items. I ordered the masala dosa, my go-to, but it was served cold and the potato filling was not made well. I would consider coming back for the buffet! But otherwise, I would go elsewhere for Indian food in Cleveland.
