Lunch experience: VERY BUSY! Your sometimes lucky to get a table if you arrive a bit after noon. We found one table that was right in front of the Buffett, so it was quite noisy. The food was great and appeared fresh and tasted great. I think it was considered pretty expensive for a lunch buffet however.  I remember us spending about 3ish dollars for the two of us and then two week later, it the price was reduced to 11 dollars. It was really pricy for what it was for the first experience. 

We have come back several more times and we have had a wonderful dinner there. I am a big fan of their chicken masala and butter chicken and the chicken chettinad.

The waiter had checked on us thought our meal and was always full of the water jugs that they use for drinks. It appeared that they had a fully stocked bar with a collection of beer also.

I highly recommend this place for a great dinner.
