tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Do you like food comas? 
Do you believe that there's a buffet on this planet where EACH AND EVERY ITEM is perfect, delicious, and has the same quality and amazement as an entree you'd order off of a menu? If you believe, then you're in for a treat - India Oven is truly that place; the very first buffet I've ever been to in which none of the food served tasted like... it was from a buffet. Everything is awesome. The service is impeccable, and they constantly throw the best garlic naan on earth at you. This is why I'm fat, and I'm so proud to be!
