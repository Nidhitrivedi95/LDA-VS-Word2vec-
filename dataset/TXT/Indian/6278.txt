3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA We are Indian and we loved the food.  We had Paneer Tikka Masala, Bhuna Gosht, fish tandoori tikkas, lacha paratha, and Tasmania for desert.  Every dish seemed to be perfect.  The fish was perfectly cooked, tasty and not over cooked.
Two minor things I didn't like:  color added to the planner giving it a bright red color.  Unnecessary in my opinion.  Second the Bhuna Gosht was a bit salty (my wife thought it was perfect), but this is something you can tell them when you place the order.
Also I had 2 glasses of the 2008 Perez Cruz Cabernet which I enjoyed.  Just give it time to breathe.
