- I think I have become a health freak... I just cannot eat anything that is too oil.. soaked in oil... deep fried and then soak in oil
- so the fellowing review is bias, opinionated... and may not be relevant to you!

I love Indian food! I love Chinese food! But just I still have not feel the love when they decide to become Hakka Indian food...

Hot Wok is quite nice and clean and dare I say Modern compare to some of the Hakka place I have been... The large Plasma TV on the wall is showing hot music video the whole time we were eating here...

Chicken Pakora ($8.50)
- after my Federick incident... "The Worst Pakora in Toronto?" I still have not find a place that serve anything that is worse than that...
- Here the chicken has been marinated with tandoori based spice... and then dipped in batter than deep fried.. has a lot of flavours
- The dipping sauce is AMAZING! Spicy.. refreshing and a little sour.. which balanced out the oilness of the pakora

Chilli Chicken ($8.50)
- Chicken deep fried then stired fried in this thick and heavy dark sauce!
- No sight of Chili?? I was looking for it really hard? Maybe my dinner mate ate them all when I was watching and singing along with the music video?

Manchurian Noodle ($7.75)
- Huge Huge Huge Plate of Noodle piled sky high!!
- This is one of the time that you wish that the portion is not that huge... 
- Noodle itself as is is not bad.. have quite a good bite...but with all these oil dripping ... make it not my kind of noodle

Manchurian Vegetable Egg Fried Rice ($6.95)
- Huge portion again.. every piece of rice is soaked in oil
- I am not a rice person..so I never feel the love and joy when a huge plate of rice in front of me and I have to eat that!
- My dinner mate that insist in ordering some rice hardly touch it because she was complaining about a vinegar taste... which none of us detect that

Service here is indifferent, but efficient... typical Chinese restaurant.. Waitress has more interest talking to the 2 young male patrons than serving us.

We have tons of leftover and I hope my yelp friend ate that at home as midnight snack will have better experience after heating them up in the microwave...
