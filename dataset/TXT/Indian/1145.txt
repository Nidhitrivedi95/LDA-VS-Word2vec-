-qdbWrCU8Ktg80dk458BAw Good customer service and food. We visited this place after seeing some yelp reviews and the place was within 3 miles from our hotel. Ordered vada paav , thali meals and kulfi. Vada paav was so yummy that we took two of them to go as well. The lady in the counter( must be the owner) was so friendly. She figured out that we are not from Canada and she gave us a small sweet box as a compliment and mentioned that it was a gesture to welcome us here in Canada. It was so nice of her.
