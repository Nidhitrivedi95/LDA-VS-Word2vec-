hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw I went for dinner with 4 other friends a few nights ago... The food was great. The service... well it wasn't intentionally bad I think but it was definitely lackluster. Immediately upon sitting we ask for 5 glasses of water. He brings 2 glasses, with no ice, 10 minutes later. We ask for ice, 3 mango lassis and a coke. 10 minutes later out come 1 mango lassi and 1 coke... still no ice and still missing 1 mago lassi and 3 waters. This is 30 minutes into sitting down. It definitely was not because they were swamped... there was only 1 other table seated in the restaurant. he eventually brought us the remaining beverages and took our order.
We all ordered Chicken Tikka MArsala with varying levels of spice but what we got was Chicken Tikka Marsala all at medium level. It was plain to see that they just made one batch and tried to pass it off. At $15 a plate just for the Marsala... this is unacceptable. Actually, as I'm writing this review I'm deducting another star. 1 star for you Mantra Marsala. What poor service!
