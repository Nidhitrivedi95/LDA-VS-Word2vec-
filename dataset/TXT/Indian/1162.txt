-qfZdXO2c-GpvOhr0KmNCg Very disappointing for the price. We ordered via foodora and the naan bread was undercooked, felt like we were eating raw dough. The vindaloo chicken wasn't even spicy, not even a little bit. The butter chicken and rice were the only decent thing.  For the price, would never go again. Definitely better options for cheaper or the same price.
