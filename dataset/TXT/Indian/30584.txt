kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw Placed order online and was told would be ready for pickup at 1:48. Arrived at 1:55 and not ready. So asked to add 1 piece of Roti to order. At 2:10 still no order. Asked about it and was told they were busy. There was 1 other party in the whole place. At 2:15 he told me they were "making the roti now". Seriously? 1) I ordered it 20 min who 2) It's a tortilla for goodness sake. Forget it! Got my $1.29 back and left with the order that I guess had been sitting waiting for that single roti. Ridiculous!!! Left at 2:20, 25 minutes after arriving to pick up my food. Gave it 2 stars because the food was pretty good but no more stars because I won't go back.
