lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw I've been to this place before and it had good food but bad service. Today my experience was pathetic with terrible food and service from the owner/manager asking me to just eat and leave the place because I complained against his undercooked bland chicken which according to him is the best dish of the restaurant (Chicken Shashlik). He offered to replace my dish but was persistent that it would taste the same. My second dish was Beef with cheese and mushrooms but apparently not because they ended up making Beef Satellite and wouldn't replace it again arguing that I asked for the latter. Definitely need a management change or just shut down.
