NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg First off, I have to say that the owners poured a ton of cash into this place. It's modern, sleek, and focused on local and pure ingredients. People have said it's like an Indian version of chipotle, but I think that description is way off. First off, the ingredients are better and most of it is made from scratch in the restaurant. There are some customizations of various BBQ plates, but you place an order versus standing in a cramped line. The choices for sides are fairly simple, which is a good thing. 

As for the technology - they have a coke freestyle machine, and this was my first encounter with this amazing contraption. It could be a whole star by itself. Lemon coke zero? Yes, please! The automatic hand washer is pretty cool and super practical. 

I have to admit that I had high expectations for this place, but keeping in mind it's a fast-casual restaurant, the standards are different for sure. From my experience, the samosa chaat was the best - soft and crispy with a good blend of spices. I was very disappointed with the vegetable biryani. They bake a naan crust over it, but this just turned out hard and basically in-edible (although this was take out). The actual biryani was not good. They serve basmati rice, which is a plus - but both times I've had it, it was too dry. The lamb meatballs were tender and tasty with the mint yogurt - much better than what you'd expect from a fast casual place. The chana masala is a yummy side choice and the chai was better than average. 

Overall it runs about $11-12 for a meal and a drink. It's steep for Cleveland lunch, but the overall quality is high and the portions are large - so it's definitely worth it. Another big plus, the menu offerings are much healthier and nutrition information is readily available on hand held cards. Great for people who like to know what they're eating. I will definitely be back to try their other menu offerings.
