-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA If I were strictly going to rate this place on quality and flavor of food, I would give the place 3 stars. But given the sheer number of available dishes on the buffet requires me to give it 4. I am a bit of an Indian buffet aficionado, and this place offers literally double the next highest number of dishes Ive seen at an Indian buffet.

And the food is good, too! It really is very good quality...BUT, I have had a lot better too. I like that they place naan on the buffet. I like that everything was well stocked. I liked the variety of entrees and desserts. I also liked the chai offered on the line. Really, this place is a great place to bring someone who has never had indian before or someone who wants to try a wide variety of dishes.

The service lacked. About 3/4 of the way through the meal, my father and I noticed that literally every other table had been given dosai as part of their meal. We did not receive these, and were somewhat bummed. Also, water service was lacking. The have a pitcher on each of the tables which contains just enough water to fill exactly 4 glasses. We were out of water for quite a long time and it was difficult to flag down a server.

Finally, the price was just ok. I had come to this location many times when it was Pasand, and they have remodeled and revamped everything from the decor to the menu, but Im not quite convinced that the price is worth the quality. My father seemed to really enjoy this place though, and given its proximity to our home, Im sure he will be back many times. I will probably not be back unless invited by someone else, or Im specifically in need of an Indian restaurant within a 3 mile radius of this location.
