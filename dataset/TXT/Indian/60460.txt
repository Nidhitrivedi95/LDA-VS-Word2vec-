ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw Last night my bride suggested that we try Needle and Pin, obviously I married a smart woman! Addy was our server and she was outstanding. The food reminded us of when we lived in the Washington DC area. We started with the scotch eggs and chicken curry pot pie. It was the best scotch eggs that I've ever had, they were amazing. We continued with beef wellington bites and the roasted vegetable and jackfruit curry. Everything was perfectly prepared. We are thrilled to have a restaurant of this quality in our neighborhood.
