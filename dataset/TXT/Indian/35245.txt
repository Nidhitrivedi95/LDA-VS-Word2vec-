MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg This place has come a long way from being a place one would line up for cheap samosas. it's all that and more vegetarian cuisine. 

Let's get this out of the way, this is a take out place. period. they the word factory in the name and they are definitely that when you see the volume of food they put out each and every day. 

if you need Samosas, they have them at 5 for $1. for a long time, at least 10 years I've been coming here for that very reason. they're excellent value. they also, like many stores of this type, are able to serve multiple other food items. 

They specialise in your traditional Indian appetizers, deep fried, baked, cooked in large batches, etc. my favourite is the small (they call medium) samosas because there is no way you can beat the price. 

every order I've made the last 3 times I've been here has been piping hot and fresh out of the fryer. you get that crispy crunch with that soft but nicely flavourful potato, pea and other flavours inside. 

parking is somewhat challenging with the massive volume of orders they take for catering, take out and of course samosas and sweets. but the value is there. if you ever want to look like a hero a lot a pot luck or some sort of event, go here.

4.0 out of 5.0 for value for money, quality, and freshness.
