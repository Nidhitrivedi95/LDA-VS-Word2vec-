C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw I got a pick up for Ritual so there wasn't much customer service so I can't comment on that. 

I got the Butter Chicken and Brussel Sprouts and Carrots.  The food wasn't for me.  It was bland and I think I've had much better Indian food in Scarborough.  In addition,  the bottom of the takeout container was filled with curry and it stained my white table.  

So basically I'm not coming back. Sorry :(
