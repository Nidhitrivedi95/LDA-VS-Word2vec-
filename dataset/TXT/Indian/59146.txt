yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I drive by this place all the time and finally stopped in.  Must thank yelp for the deal.

My roommate and I were hungry and the fridge was empty.  Search for a deal and boom, right next to home.  We came in around dinner time and it was fairly packed.  After, I am glad we came in when we did.  The dinner rush came in 20 mins after we did.  Service? Outstanding!!  Waiters very tentative to us, but I felt that too many different servers approached us and made it difficult to keep track.  Our waiter that took our order gave me some good recommendations since I have not had India food before.  Our first app was the chicken 65.  65 different spices, I thought dang.  I'm gonna need lots of water.  Turns out, very flavorful.  Similar to carne asada since it was served with diced onions and cilantro.  Our main was the Masala Dosa dn the Tandorri dinner.  I am first glad I didn't go with the 3 foot long dosa.  Would have been way too much.  I loved the dosa, very spicy the one I got, but also fresh.  Tandoori was very nice, plenty of different meats.  I do feel that the chicken was dry as well as the sausage (over cooked).  This probably happen since the kitchen was backed up.  My roommate loved the naan.  So great, that he ordered another basket.  We got our free mango for checking via yelp.  Very tasty drink.  From the name, I first thought it was a jelly.

Everything was great, but kitchen was overwhelmed by the rush.  Waiters did apologized many times, and we listened into the other tables complaints and all.  I felt that they handled the neighboring table well since they were upset by a mistaken order.  Others were upset by the wait. 

Overall, I'll come back.  Do want to try the lunch buffet.
