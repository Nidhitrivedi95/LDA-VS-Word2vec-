i0vXeFOD6e-DZ8cBwxaQRQ I didn't even get a chance to order....

First I wasn't greeted but that's ok, I understand that. The problem started when I saw a cell phone near the ingredients in the area where they prepare the ice cream rolls. For my daughter, I stayed. I did notice the young lady had on gloves. But it gets worse. While waiting for her to finish rolling the ice cream "the phone rings". SHE PICKED THE PHONE UP WITH THE GLOVES ON AND PUT THE PHONE ON HER EAR WHILE ROLLING ICE CREAM. Absolutely disgusting. Oh and she had a conversation smh. I couldn't stomach that so we left. Hygiene and sanitation is so important when handling food. I'm pretty sure everyone in the world knows that cell phones are the dirtiest things in the world. This was at the Arrowhead Mall location. Maybe the one at Paradise Mall is more aware of germs. I don't recommend this place. Cleanliness is next to godliness right.
