JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Don't worry about what all of it is, just know it's all good!  I too had to warm up to Indian food a few years back, but once you develop a taste for it then places like Aroma stand out to you!
A beautiful interior greets you as you walk in, as well as prompt courteous service!  Lunch is the time to go to sample many different dishes on their buffet.  I'll admit that even after several years of loving this cuisine, I still don't know what everything is and don't care!  It's full of spices and flavors that just wow you, but not set your mouth on fire!  There's no need to try to describe the different chicken and goat dishes, as I'm not sure if I really know!  You don't 4 1/2 stars after 100+ reviews if it's not good though!!
