IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw We came here looking at the 4 star rating of the restaurant but we were quite disappointed. The quality of the food was not that great, the quantity for the price is not right and the service levels mediocre. If you want to see what the Indian restaurants in Canada looked like in 1980s or 1990s, then check this place out. Else, there are so Indian restaurants that offer better quality and service (and around the same price point).
