PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Came here with three for the Sunday brunch. All the appetizers were stale and cold. Asked them so many times to give the fresh ones but went on deaf ears. The main course was sub par with rubbery chicken. Barf!
They had omelette and prantha stations which were all empty and no one was making anything on those tawa plates. 
Now the dessert, don't even go there. Cakes taste horrible and I doubt if they were fresh. Fruits looked like death.
Waste of a visit
