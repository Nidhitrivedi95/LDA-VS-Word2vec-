0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw This is just the kind of restaurant I love. Outstanding food at a very reasonable price, fast and friendly service with no pretentious atmosphere or attitude. It's just a small family working their butts off to serve up a great variety of Indian favorites in a high quality way. And lots of Indian families come here to eat, which attests to the authenticity and quality.
