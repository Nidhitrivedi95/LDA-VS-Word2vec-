yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw WOW! I took my husband here for his birthday dinner after seeing this restaurant featured on PBS' "Check Please, Arizona". The Dhaba does not disappoint. I come from an Indian family of very picky eaters and cook Indian food myself at home on a regular basis. We started with a couple of chaat plates - pani puri and the samosa plate. Both were excellent. The samosas were the best I had in a very long time. For dinner my husband ordered the Dhaba chicken curry and I ordered a palak kofta curry that was out of this world. I'm not normally a fan of spinach curries, but this one showed me that I had never had a good spinach curry before. The kofta in this curry was dreamy, made out of nuts, carrots, cauliflower and other goodies.

If you've read my other reviews, I don't hand out five star reviews on a regular basis. In fact, I have a very high standard when it comes to quality and flavor. The Dhaba has it all in addition to very warm and attentive servers. The space is intimate, the tables large and comfortable, and the decor comforting, homey and unpretentious. I believe The Dhaba to be absolutely THE  BEST Indian food in the valley. I am so so happy I tried this restaurant and I will keep coming back for more. There are so many different dishes on the menu that I will be coming here for a very long time!

Do yourselves a favor and go to The Dhaba. Word to those who are averse to hot spicy - dishes are ordered on a scale of 1-10 in terms of heat. I ordered a 7 because I love hot spicy food, my husband ordered a 5. Both had a good level of heat to them, and I was sweating after a few minutes! Love it! If you enjoy hot and spicy food, go for it. If you don't, I would definitely stay under 5. When they say spicy they mean it! You won't find watered down flavors here.
