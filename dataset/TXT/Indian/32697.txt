LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This is our new favourite dosa restaurant! We went to Guru Lakshmi yesterday and really enjoyed our service, food, and of course the atmosphere. We arrived at 7:50 for our 8 o'clock reservation and were seated as soon as the table was ready. Although the restaurant was extremely busy, our server made it a point to attend to us right away. Our food also Came very fast, approximately within 15 minutes. Both my husband and I ordered the masala dosa and we finished off our dinner with Masala chai and kulfi. Overall this is truly the best dosa we have had within the GTA Region, I would definitely recommend giving this restaurant a shot!
