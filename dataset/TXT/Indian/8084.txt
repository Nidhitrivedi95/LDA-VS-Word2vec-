7d2LqDc0Cb5dcizil_h34A The food was fantastic and tasty spicy and every dish tasted different. The only complaint I have is that some of the dishes with meat have very miserly portions which were mainly bones. The sauces were flavourful and the food was great.  The mutton sukuti why is my favorite dish but be warned it is spicy
