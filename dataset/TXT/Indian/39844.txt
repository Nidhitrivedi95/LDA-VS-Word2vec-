PGo6eHLGAKNL_XNajkwc-w This is a fantastic Indian restaurant. The service is excellent and the food is superb.


 We had an amazing starter - a Mushroom Puri which had a real kick to it! Then we had a Lamb Biryani, Sag Gosht, Tarka Dal and Garlic Nan bread. You wont find better Indian food than this anywhere else!


 Why have to travel into Edinburgh when you can have an amazing meal right on your doorstep?


 I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant if you are ever in Penicuik, Midlothian.
