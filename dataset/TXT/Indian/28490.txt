J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Scammy business model!!

I ordered from the tasteaway website in which there is a mandatory delivery charge.  When the driver arrives, he stood their awarkly expecting a tip.  After informing me that he only gets a "PORTION" of the delivery charge, I ended up tipping the guy.  I normally don't tip when there is a delivery fee, but I felt guilty when the restaurant rips him off.

So what's going on exactly?  Little india is pocketing a portion of the delivery charge even though they do nothing on their end to deliver the food.  Why should I have to pay a delivery fee AND make up the difference with tips for the driver.  

This sort of practice should be banned.  This restaurant is obviously making the driver and the customer its victims.
