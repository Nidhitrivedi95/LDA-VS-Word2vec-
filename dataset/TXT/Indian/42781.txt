RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg We had mixed feelings here, so I'll break it down: 

Atmosphere: 5
Very cool place. Lighting very moody. Walls painted funky, drapes hanging everywhere, very cozy. They've done well with a small space. 

Service: 3.5
Our server was very nice and attentive. The hostess seemed entirely uninterested in helping us however so we waited a while before she even spoke to us, kinda strange since we were standing right in front of her. 

Appetizers: 3
Your standard indian appetizers, nothing special. 

Main course: 3
We ordered 2 dishes. They were unmemorable and made us regret spending as much as we did for the meal overall. Just very uninspired cooking and not as flavorful as most other places we've been. 

Probably will give it one more shot simply because it's a great vibe, but the food needs to hit the mark next time or we're done with them.
