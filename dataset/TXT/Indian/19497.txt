ffWkln-XUcOyh_K9SK5oBQ Have been here several times now and my support for this place has grown with each visit. The staff are unfailingly polite and kind: ordered take out one day and reached there a bit after 9 pm ( after the restaurant closes). However, since it was raining heavily they happily accommodated my friends and I and we ate our food inside the restaurant! They went about their closing procedures without rushing us at all!

Definitely regulars now. Have seen people study there, will do so as well.
