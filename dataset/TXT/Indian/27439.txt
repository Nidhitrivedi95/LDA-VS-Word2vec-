IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw I've been here several times, with friends for the lunch buffet, and perhaps once for dinner, also for the buffet. This time we came on a Tuesday night, and decided to skip the buffet and order a la carte. The rationale was that the food wood be fresher.

There were a handful of other patrons. It wasn't super busy, but it wasn't empty, either.

We ordered the lamb rogan josh, shahi paneer, peas pulao rice and naan. We were asked how spicy we wanted the food; and we replied hotter rather than mild.

The shahi paneer was delicious; very creamy and flavourful. The rice was colourful, but there could have been more, considering we had two main dishes. The portions of the main dishes were generous. The naan was better than all right, but not terrific. The big disappointment was the lamb. The meat was over-cooked and tough. The spice, however, was bang on.

The service was attentive, but not overly so. Our water glasses were kept full. However, they never asked us how everything was; so I had to broach the subject of the meat myself. The waiter mumbled something but I didn't catch it. Twice.

I probably wouldn't have bothered posting a review if it had ended there. But when I reviewed the bill I noticed the rice dish was charged at $4.99, and I was pretty sure It was less than that in the menu. Going to the cash I checked the menu, and sure enough, it was $3.49. I wanted to mention something, but after taking my money and giving me my change, he moved to the back and ignored me. He'd seen me checking the menu against the bill.

I decided not to wait further. I took the extra $1.50 out of his tip.
