NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg If you're craving Indian food and in a rush...Choolaah will do the trick.

Choolaah reminds me of a fast-casual Chipotle, but with Indian food. You order at one counter and pick it up at another counter when they call your name. There's plenty of places to sit throughout-- as I think it was actually a former car dealership. Huge space!

I'm not sure if it was the best Indian food I've ever had, but it was still pretty tasty. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I find the atmosphere a tad stressful. When it's busy, it's BUSY, and people tend to build up everywhere and it creates a somewhat chaotic environment.

Regardless, I'm just an addict to their Chicken Tikka Masala, so I'll certainly be back. It's also super budget friendly, so happy dance for your wallet! You can get a healthy, pretty generous lunch for $10ish. They also have an online ordering platform coming soon, which should help those of us who prefer to grab and go!
