SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A Stopped in to India Oven for some take out and ordered the non-vegeterian Thalí, essentially, a sampler plate. I'm not really sure what it consisted of, but I can tell you it was delicious!  There was a chicken dish, a shrimp one, and beef...or maybe lamb? All three were great - the shrimp was excellent! 

We also ordered some meat samosas...those were not my favorite.  I'm a samosa fan, but these just didn't do it for me.  It was really just a deep fried pocket of finely ground meat...the samosas I've had in the past were pastry thin dough, wrapped several times around the fillings, so that the dough was a bit flaky.  These had a single wrapping of a thicker dough.  I dunno...not my thing.  Aside from that, great dinner. I'll be back for sure.

Oh - redeeming the samosas was this delicious minty green dipping sauce.  Yum.
