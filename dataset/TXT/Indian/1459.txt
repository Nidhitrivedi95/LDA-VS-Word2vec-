-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA By far my favorite place to eat in the Valley. Always great tasting food and fast service. The owner is amazing and will explain dishes to you and the buffet is one of a kind! If you never have had the opportunity to experience Indian Cuisine, I would highly recommend coming for the lunch buffet to experience all sorts of dishes!
