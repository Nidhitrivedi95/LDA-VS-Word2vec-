lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw My family and I are absolute fans of sizzlers and we are so happy to have found a joint that serves authentic sizzlers, just like we used to have in Mumbai!  Absolutely delicious and the service was just as great!  We ordered three sizzlers for four people and it was a sizzler fest!  We had a paneer cheese sizzler, prawns and fish shashlik, and prawns sizzler.  The sauces were perfectly flavoured, good portion size and it comes sizzling to the table.  The wait time is quite little and we are definitely going to attend here again.
