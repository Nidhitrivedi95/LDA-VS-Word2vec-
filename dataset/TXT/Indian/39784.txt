P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg My girlfriend introduced me to China Cottage 3 years ago, and it's now my favourite Hakka restaurant in Toronto. Great, spicy dishes with great taste while being well priced. Peppered Chicken and Chili Chicken are my favourites, but if you don't like spice their mixed Cantonese Chow Mein (Shrimp / Chicken) is great. Overall, great for take out or eat in.
