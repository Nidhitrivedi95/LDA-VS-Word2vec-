PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q My partner and I just left and were disgusted by our experience. It's not often I harshly critique a restaurant, but this restaurant deserves to have its reputation tarnished. We walked in shortly after 5 PM on a Saturday evening and were initially greeted and shown to our booth. I have never before sampled Indian fare (and never will after this experience) so I was extremely excited to try it. I was prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash to have an all-out authentic Indian cuisine experience to try to cap off an early Valentine's Day date, yet we ended up paying $24 for two half-plates of terrible food. After sitting at our booth for ten minutes (the restaurant was NOT crowded) we just assumed it was buffet-styled only and went to each grab a plate. I had no idea what anything was and just tried to sample a small bit of everything. The food was barely warm, wasn't seasoned (isn't Indian food supposed to be spicy?), and there wasn't any naan, which my partner told me was tasty bread. 

After being grossed out by our food my partner asked if there was a way we could receive menus and order food from them instead. The server proceeded to ignore his inquiry. He discussed just leaving without paying in total disgust for the lack of service and awful food, but we promptly paid and left. For what it's worth we watched as another larger group walked in behind us and were approached at their table and asked if they wanted the buffet or to see a menu. I have half a mind to suspect we were treated so rudely due to our sexual orientation. 

In seeing the reviews below if THIS is what you Pittsburghers consider to be great food then you obviously lack any sense of culinary expertise. I would love to thank India Garden for ruining my first foray into Indian cuisine along with our Valentine's Day.
