H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw If you're looking for a solid Indian restaurant with a modern interior and vibe, marigold is the place to go! I went with my friend last night and both of our dishes were amazing. The staff was attentive and friendly and came to check on me several times while I was waiting for my friend to arrive. 

I ordered the vegetable biryani and it was great! I wish it had a bit more kick, but it was filled with veggies and tofu which I appreciated. The waiter told us that that particular dish took a longer time to make and gave us a snack on the house while we waited. When the meal finally came i was so surprised!! Not only was the presentation very interesting, they give you quite a large portion! 

My friend ordered the lamb from the appetizer menu and she was able have that as her entree and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not small per say, but if you have a large appetite I wouldn't rely on it as your main. 

I also got the butter/garlic naan which was incredible. I'll definitely be back again next time I'm in the area!
