rYziPPEILDXJ_F5uKR--YQ This is small Vegetarian takeout Indian food place.Though the menu is limited,  food is made freshly. I tired Bombay sandwich, samosa, samosa chat, Chole, Gulab Jamun, mango lassi and Chai. I have been to this place around 6-7 times and  I have seen people coming for Tea and Samosa (5pm snack in India). Very limited curry menu
