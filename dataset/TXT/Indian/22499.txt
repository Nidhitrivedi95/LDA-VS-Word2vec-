gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I'm a big fan of Indian food, so I was glad to see a new Indian restaurant open up so close to where I work.  I went in for lunch today, the food was delicious!  I'm not a vegetarian, but with flavors this good I did not miss the meat at all.  I had the vegetable vindaloo which was really good, the spice level was pefect and they give you plenty of food.  I also had a garlic Naan bread which was excellent.  I'm not normally a buffet guy, but I had a look at what they had on offer and it looked really fresh with plenty to choose from.  I will be trying the buffet next time I go.  This is easily the best Indian food I've had in Arizona. Woodlands is good and I love India Oven and Guru Palace but I think this place beats them all.
