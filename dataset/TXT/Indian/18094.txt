EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg My wife and I were here for a convention and we stayed in Vegas for five days.  We enjoyed delicious meals every day.  The authentic taste and flavors emerged our senses and provoked us to come back for more delicious foods.  We would definitely come back in a heartbeat.  Absolutely wonderful authentic delights.  We give it five stars.  A thumbs up for excellence in service and food.
