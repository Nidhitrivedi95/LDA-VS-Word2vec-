f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Excellent Authentic Pakistani Food, the restaurant it self is small and more of a fast food type but it has real deal Lahori food, their kabob and chicken karahi are as good if not better than Ravi Kabob in Arlington VA, just be aware their spicy dishes are really hot. All in all if you want real deal this is it.
