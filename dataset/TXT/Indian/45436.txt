SB0HnIkRA7IaTX9btxZW-Q I don't know what it is with me lately but all I want is Indian food. This restaurant was in my to try list and I was so happy that it's not too far from my appointment. I had to stop by for takeout before going home. I chose two thalies. One butter chicken and on lamb curry. Both came with curried chickpeas, side salad, basmati rice and a chicken drum or thigh tandoori. It was good and flavourful but lacked the spiciness that I usually crave in Indian food. I'm glad that I asked for extra hot sauce! I'm kinda disappointed that the hot sauce is nothing more then green chilli peppers that had blended into a paste. Thankfully I have about 15 different kinds of hot and very spicy sauce at home lol!!! The service was super nice and welcoming and the food was done within 10 minutes. I would definitely come back here if I had no other options.
