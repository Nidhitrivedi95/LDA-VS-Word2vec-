TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Easily the best Indian food in Vegas! Second to Brick Ln in London only, this is about as good as it gets in the States. Low lighting, romantic, soft contemporary Indian music playing, incredible food! Friendly staff. If u live in Vegas or just visiting don't miss this little gem.
