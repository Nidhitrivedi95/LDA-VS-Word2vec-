auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I found this place on Yelp, so I ordered takeout once. I arrived at the end of the time window they give you when you order. They didn't even know what I ordered when I arrived. After much scrambling around and another 15 minutes of waiting, I got my food. The portions for the takeout were a little on the small side for the price. 

It tasted good though, so I decided to order takeout again. The second time, I had a certificate from restaurants.com. I specifically looked at the certificate before I bought it and it did not say anything about dine-in only. I called and ordered (about $100 worth of food) and told them I had the certificate. They said ok and then I hung up. I get a call back a few minutes later saying that the certificate is for dine-in only. I told them it doesn't say that, and what did it matter. I then offered to pay them a tip for the whole meal so they wouldn't lose out on that. They said no. So I told them I wanted to cancel my order. After talking to their owner, they were still ok with giving up my business and cancelled my order. 

Maybe other people will have better luck, but they aren't getting my business anymore.
