Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Man this place is great.  It is hidden in the back of the Hawaiian marketplace, so you need to seach for it, but wow!

The first good sign was when we walked in there and saw four Indian gentlemen with the Indian-style turbans (sorry for not being cultured enough to know what they are called) leaving...always a good sign for an ethnic restaurant.  But the food is excellent, and the value for being right on the strip is amazing.  Their chicken masala is to die for, but everything else we had was also excellent, including the saag.  The lunch buffet is a must try.  My wife and I both like Indian food, and this was some of the best, if not the best, we ever had.  Two days in Vegas- two trips to Tamba.
