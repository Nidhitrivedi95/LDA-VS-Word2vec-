eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Disappointing! I was visiting my sister in Toronto last week who has always been a big fan of Brar's and always telling us how they go there every other week there to eat. So obviously we had to go there once and what a disappointment it was. We ordered food worth more than $90 (around 9 items) and it was mostly snacks. 

Couple of items came within 5-10 minutes and we started to eat but then nothing came for another 25-30 minutes. We checked with the cashier and she rudely asked what else is remaining... I said everything is remaining except the two items we got in the start. After couple of minutes the dessert (2 plates) arrived which was supposed to come in the end, my sister returned it saying we are still waiting for the snacks items and we had asked for desserts to come at the end at the time of order itself.

After a few minutes the manager came, apologized and said they moved to the new ordering system that day and that's why they messed up the order. My sister expressed her disappointment and he said he will look into it.

After 5 minutes or so the remaining items started coming but they were not up to the mark and seemed to be made in a hurry e.g. in dahi bhalla there was no visible bhalla and whatever there was it was all so meshed up that it tasted weird. When the dessert came (malpua rabri), it was so horrible and cold that we could not eat any of it (we expected the malpua to be warmer). It seems as they just kept and gave us the same plates when they served us first. 

Towards the end, one of the servers came and gave us 10$ bill saying it's the compensation for the mess they made today. 10$??? I was shocked! We just wasted 90$, our time, spoiled our mood for the horrible food and service we received. We just put those 10$ back at the table and left the restaurant. Thank god on the way back home we got pizza from pizza pizza.

No way going back there again!
