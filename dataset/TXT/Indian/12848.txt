B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog An Indian restaurant in Old Montreal - you better be special and different. And this one lives up to the expectations. It's a notch above the other Indian restaurant (Taj) out there. I loved the white walls out there that adds to the ambience. The food is pretty good and the service is nice. The washrooms are clean and the service is good. Hands down, the best Indian restaurant in Montreal - it's quite pricey though!
