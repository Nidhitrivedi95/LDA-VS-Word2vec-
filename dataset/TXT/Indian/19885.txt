FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Swerve yourself on over to Swagat for some samosas, naan, and tikka masala.  !

I love Swagat for dinner! It's so close to 5 *'s, just lacking in a bit of music ambience and a warmer temperature. I have always been cold here. Not really sure why.

Anyway...the naan, garlicky naan. Yum, yum, yummy!! The vegetarian or chicken tikka masala is heavenly, incredible, and such a treat!! Oh my goodness...the food gets all 5 *'s from me. No question. .

The service is great; the staff is very attentive. I love the stainless steel bowls most sauce dishes are served inside too! At the conclusion of your meal, you are provided a hot hand towel as well.
