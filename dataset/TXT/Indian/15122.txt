CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I ordered the food online from Dhaba's website. The mattar paneer and butter chicken were fairly decent. I wouldn't say there's anything particularly special about them. I did expect a higher heat level in terms of spices. This is Indian food, after all, and I expect that  "fairly spicy" (as described to me) means that my mouth will burn deeply and my nose will water slightly. No such luck. 

But the curries were creamy, very rich,  and not too oily. I could have done with less salt but it was only slightly noticeable. The naan was soft and delivered in foil bags designed to keep them fresh. The service on the phone was impeccable and the restaurant took our order even past 10 pm on a weeknight.
