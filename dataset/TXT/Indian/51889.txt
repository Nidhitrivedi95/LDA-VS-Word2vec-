UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We were visiting Las Vegas and were craving Indian food. Mint had a lot of good reviews and we decided to check this place out. The crowd was extremely young and the place was lively. The decor was okay with muted sounds of Indian cinema music in the background. The menu was very innovative -- almost every appetizer and entree had a twist. We are vegetarian and so this review won't help if you are looking to hear about the chicken tikka masala (which I am told is good...). 

So, we ordered the Organic Samosa and vegetable pakoras. We also ordered the mahakali mango masala (yes that is the real name), Dal Maharani Balti, and the Hariyali Kabab. After a long day of gallivanting, we were hungry and would have eaten anything cooked :-)

For the food then... While the names were innovative, the food not so much. The Hariyali Kabab was green (as expected), but was bland. The chutneys were basted on a bit too much and there was literally no spice. The Mahakali Mango Masala was similarly taste free and bland. We had ordered this with paneer and it was undercooked. The Dal wasn't bad and probably the only item that was tasty enough. The breads, on the other hand, were fresh and nice.

Also there were a lot of innovative lassi types. These were very nice as well. 

Perhaps the items with meat were better and the crowd was generally having a lot of fun! So, we might have been the unlucky group. This place is definitely worth a visit just to see the creativity in the menu.
