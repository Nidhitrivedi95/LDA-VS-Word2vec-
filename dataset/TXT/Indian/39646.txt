P4h8kgy_48oE9vCHJc4BCQ This place is consistent on being inconsistent in their food taste. The only thing that I can order and be sure its going to be good are the seekh kababs and reshmi kababs...which we often get. The service is really inefficient so just bite your tongue and hold in the frustration while you are ordering. Tip: always request extra green chutney!!!
