NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I was shopping across the street and saw this Choolah! My first impression- modern amenities with tandoor ovens and even a fancy soda machine. The food was piping hot, fresh and delicious. I'm glad I decided to give it a go! There are other fast food type Indian places popping up in the area-but this one stands apart with its bold authentic flavors and small details like fresh herbs. (Cilantro fans- go wild) They need to open one of these by the University circle area!
