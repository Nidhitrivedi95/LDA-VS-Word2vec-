9K2FHkajUaTU4P2cfFJmGQ Second visit to Peacock and this time for their Lunch buffet. Clearly, a better experience than the first time and hence my rating has gone up from a single star to 3. The quality of meat used (esp goat) is worth appreciation. Not many restaurants offer such quality. Biryani and fish fry have to be my favorite! Tandoori chicken was tasty too but cold. The food overall was either at room temperature or mildly hot, which marred the taste to a great extent and hence, I cannot rate the food very highly. South Indian dishes (sambhar & chatni) were very disappointing. Desserts did not please me much either (shahi tukra and ladoo). The service needs attention for sure. Only reason I'd go back (if I do) is for Biryani- the rice was so full of flavor.
