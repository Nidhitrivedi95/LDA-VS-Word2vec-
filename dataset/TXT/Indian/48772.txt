TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA Stopped in for lunch.  Interesting in that its located in an old house, but it works. I had to ask the server for change for the parking meter, he was very helpful. After feeding the meter, I came back and was seated right away.  I had the Indian Buffet. Nice selection for 7.99.

The butter chicken had a great flavorful sauce - the chicken (Boneless white meat) was a little dry, but the sauce more than made up for it.  The spinach Dal was excellent.  Lemon flavored rice was very good. I tried everything - the eggplant dish was good, tandoori chicken good, veggie curry was okay.  Chick pea dish was very good.  The dessert dish was a beet-based mash with nuts and ?? but was really good and different. The staff was attentive and friendly.

All in all - I will be back!  I cant wait to try it for dinner.
