t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Excellent food and service! Tikka Masala, Saag and Aloo were all delicious! We tried three different desserts and each were also delicious! Lots to bring home too! Servers were helpful, kind and courteous. Ordered all meals at a level 3 spice out of 10 which was perfect! We will definitely go back!
