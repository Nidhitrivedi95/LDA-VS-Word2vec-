QMB3hmb_Yv6Vk-HLiM2cdA After some furniture browsing (without buying anything) along Eglinton Ave last Saturday, my friend and I walked down to Veggie Thali for dinner. The place was not at all what I expected (although this doesn't take away from the very good food), only a very small eating area with four tables and a few chairs at a side counter, no real décor or wait service, and plastic cutlery. There is a hot-table counter at the back to place your order, with the menu on two displays above, and a cooler at the side for the pop and juice. The service was friendly enough, with a brief explanation of what each item was, and the food was ready quite fast.

As for the food, it was very good, although not as spicy as I thought some dishes would be. We each had a hot-table thali, which comes with rice, salad, roti and dessert. I had channa masala, mung beans, and spiced cauliflower and potatoes; I believe my friend had lentils and squash, seasoned vegetables, and spiced cauliflower and potatoes also. Everything was served on a thali, which is the metal dish divided into several little sections. The channa masala was the best of my choices, although I would have preferred if it was spicier; the mung beans were good mixed with the rice. The roti were very thin and made with whole wheat I think. The dessert was interesting; my friend said it tasted like cream of wheat, which is fairly close as it was apparently sweetened semolina with bits of fruit. Other than the thali, they also serve a vegetable biryani and samosas, along with some side dishes.

Overall, it was a very good meal. With pop and an extra serving of rice, the bill came to $28 for two, perhaps a little more than some similar places but worth it.
