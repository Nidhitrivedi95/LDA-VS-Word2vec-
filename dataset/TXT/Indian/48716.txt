TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA The food is incredible. I ordered garlic naan, a mango lassi, and lamb vindaloo--the best I have ever had. Staff were concerned when I asked for the vindaloo to be prepared extra spicy, but after a little well-intentioned debate she acquiesced to my request. I was incredibly satisfied. The flavors and spiciness were in perfect balance. Few of the Indian restaurants I have frequented are bold enough to meet my capsaicin requests. However, I am confident that anyone even after a little finagling could find the perfect balance of spice to suite their palate.

The staff do seem to be a tad confused however. The garlic naan I ordered, which I had asked to be served as an appetizer appeared after my vindaloo, and only after I had asked about it. The food served to my friends had already arrived. Nonetheless, if the communication among the staff were improved, this would be a 5-star establishment!
