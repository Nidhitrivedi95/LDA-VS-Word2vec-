Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg Great food, but I wouldn't say it matches the restaurants in Mississauga. Indian cuisine in Toronto surprisingly lacks imagination and kick. This place was pretty packed for a Tuesday night, so I realized it must be a local favourite. 

There were quite a few lone diners present when I went, Kingfishers in hand :) I had the vegetable jalfrezi, and asked the waiter to make it spicy (a request which was sadly, unfulfilled). The portions were sizeable, and the food was rich, and very good- just not spicy enough for my liking. The naan and roti are yum. There was a little bit of a delay in making the roti, and the waiter apologized multiple times for that. Three stars for the food, and +1 for the great service. A good go-to place for flavourful, wholesome Indian food.
