8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw This is strictly "ok" place. There's no naan. It's the wheat off-the-shelf pita.  The tamarind chicken was good/better than average (which is why the 3 stars).  The chickpea ("chhole") were a bad average.  Rice was standard (non-basmati). The price was less than $6.  The seating was skeletal (not fancy at all).  

I would actually want to give it 2.5 stars.  Definitely not worth the 4-star rating that it has.  It is family-owned so you should support this place.
