UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA A long overdue update about Mint - short and sweet, but well deserved.

Mint have clearly listened to the feedback from Yelp over the last couple of years. What we have now is a well-rounded, extremely consistent buffet and a comprehensive menu ready to cater to every food preference.

At 10.99 for buffet it's no wonder that this place can have a queue out the door around lunchtimes. 

Plenty of delicious fare to choose from and some vegetarian options for my wife. Oh, and garlic naan that's among the finest in the valley.

Don't miss out!
