ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ Everything tasted extremely salty here. Butter chicken was sour and salty and trust me I've had butter chicken many times!! 

They took it back but still you can't really "fix" a salty dish unless you start from scratch. The waiter then said its mainly the tomato and yogurt that gives that taste but honestly I could not eat it. The curry could almost be a marinara sauce because of so much tomato tanginess.

Even if it looked like I barely touched it they still charged us full price. Was hoping they would take it off the bill (considering its overpriced...same price for lunch AND dinner) no one else was in the restaurant. Completely empty. Hmm...

Strange because I totally trusted the review here but unfortunately I will not be coming back.
