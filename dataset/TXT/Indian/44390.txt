Rwbj2ed2IHEAQlCFl2pR-g We want to Passage to India last night - seated and promptly forgotten about- finally brought menus and had to ask two waiters for water - we ordered and didn't see the apps for over a half an hour (approx 35 mins) -son had gone to ask about them - no explanation (another single older man was completely ignored nearby as well) two tables who had come on after we had ordered were served their dinners first - maddening - after an hour and 40 minutes my husband went to ask where the food was, the waiter said he was going to get it - came back a few minutes later empty handed said it would be ANOTHER TEN MINUTES- approximately two hours for Indian food ???? Butter chicken and chicken tikka?? So we left and got a decent fish and chips next door- 
Also noticed since we had plenty of time for observation, waiters brusque and not overly friendly to other tables - plenty of good Indian in Edi to put up with this place :(
