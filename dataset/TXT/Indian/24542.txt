H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ I am a huge fan of another Hakka joint and am a regular there, however I was driving by and saw this new restaurant, so I ventured in with my fiancé. One word - WOW!!! The food is not oily or salty and the portions are decent. I had to give this a 5 star because this is the best Hakka food I have ever had.
