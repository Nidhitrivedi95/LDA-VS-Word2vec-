You can't go wrong with 3 course 25$ GARNISHED, TASTY meals. They used to also have really delicious GOURMET sandwiches for under 10 dollars at lunch. Get past the weird decor, the lame name, the unprofessional service (they do try their best though, points for effort, I think it's a cultural thing), and you will have one of the best bang for your buck meals in the Dundas/University area.

Constructive advice to management: redesign/redecorate the restaurant for more refined intimate atmosphere, tone down on portion size and showy presentation, learn dining service professionalism, plating could be better.
