CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Pretty good freakin food. Had a salad there that was unique to Indian spices, all the ingredients paired so well with those spices. Also got the shrimp appetizer that was so tasty.... And everything else that we had. Unique dishes, and opens late! Can't wait to go back. Just wish they gave larger portions :)
