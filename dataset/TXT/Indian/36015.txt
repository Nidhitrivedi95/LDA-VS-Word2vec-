NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ A very modest, unpretentious restaurant with OK food. Went there for lunch while visiting Hillcrest Hospital and ate from the pre-prepared "pick two" lunch choices. I'd describe the choices perhaps as mild or milder, there was nothing approaching spicy. The chicken tikka masala and vindaloo were both fairly tasty. They earned a third star with the naan, which was fresh, hot and well done. I'll forgive almost anything if the naan is good in an Indian restaurant!

It appears primarily to be a take-out place, the ambiance was pretty much nonexistent. The cook/cashier/server was friendly and prompt. I'd be interested in trying ordering off the menu with a request for spice to see what they can do.
