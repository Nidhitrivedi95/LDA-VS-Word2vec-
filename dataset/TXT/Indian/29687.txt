jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg We ordered take out for lunch and we clearly stated lunch special multiple times. The person on the phone repeated the order and everything was ok. But when we got there, they had billed us for a regular order and overcharged us by 30 dollars. I tried reasoning with the owner who rudely started yelling at me. 
There are plenty of Indian places around. I would skip this one. Not worth the hassle with unscrupulous owners.
