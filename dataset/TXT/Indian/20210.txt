fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Indian buffet hidden inside an industrial area. From the outside if you drive by the area it is not what you expect, a restaurant in a highly industrial/commercial area of town. The outside looks small and probably a place you won't go in but inside was quite surprisingly large. 

There were quite a few selections for the buffet and I in particularly like their goat curry and fish pakora. There were a decent selection of fruits and appetizers. The desserts wasn't as big of a selection by why need it when you have so much other food to taste. 

Service wise was a little above average. It was nice that the server brought out the naans to your table but getting water refills seems to be a little lacking sometimes. But they were quite to remove your old plate. 

Price wise, 11.99 on weekday lunch was not bad and free parking outside. Definitely will give this place a try again if I am in the area for Indian.
