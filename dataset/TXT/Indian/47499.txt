TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw The Lamb Korma is one of the best things I've ever eaten and service is impeccable, even when using discount. Definitely reasonable pricing and portions, don't let the neighborhood scare you this is a superior Indian place to many in fancier locations!  I've come here for ladies lunch and family dinner same happy tummy:)
