9y2MS2VyXZzFRi2zGV0AFg This classy Indian restaurant has a great reputation throughout Edinburgh for better than average cuisine of a spicy nature, so after a strenuous (!) afternoon of shopping at the nearby Ocean Terminal shopping centre, my mother and I decided this was definitely the moment for a curry with matching, tasty nan bread.

As my mother and I are both pretty indecisive people when it comes to choosing anything from a menu that has more than one thing on it, the helpful waiter chap recommended quite a few dishes for us. We went for the Murgh Masallam and actually, I think the other dish was a good old Tikka Masala, which I know is a pretty unadventurous dish to go for, but it tasted so good. Add some garlic nan bread and pilau rice, and you have yourself one awesome meal.

Aptly, being near the water and the Royal Yacht Britania, the restaurant's interior is very nautical, with a lot of blue and sail decoration on the go, so you do feel like you could be eating in someone's large yacht. I should also add that not only does Britannia Spice offer Indian food, it also has a range of Bangladeshi, Nepali and Thai cuisine on the menu.
