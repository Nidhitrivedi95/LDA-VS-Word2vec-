S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Went back today for another excellent lunch! The staff could not be any friendlier, and its such   a bargain for great food that I wish they would move to Maricopa! 

Outstanding dishes today were: Keema Matter (Ground Beef w/ Green Peas), Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Veg. Biryani, and Garlic Naan
