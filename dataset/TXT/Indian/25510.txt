hq10TdILrwtTcAESKY251Q We went to Nirvana with friends today (we were a group of 6). 

Ambience:(4.5/5) It looks so ordinary from the outside, but once you enter, its like a totally different place.Very Indian, very desi! The interior is awesome. Great ambience.

Food: (4/5) The food was pretty good. We had Hot & Sour soup, which was ok. Then for starters we had chat papri and dahi bhalla. Both of them were really good. Next we had veg manchurian, achari paneer, nirvana dal with roti. The achari paneer was super yummy. Then we also had veg biryani. Overall their food is good, nice Indian flavours.

Service: (3.5/5) Our waitress was friendly and nice. Service was good.

Overall, it is a good place to go with friends or family for some tasty Indian food!! Will definitely go there again.
