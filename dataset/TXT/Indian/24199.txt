gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg Place is serious, no doubt I will visit again. Chicken curry and Naan was perfection. Ritesh picked a winner, my friend, we will eat again. Ritesh we will create technology architectures together. Ravi Shankar rest in peace, I love music. 

I enjoy the food and the food refreshes me. Clears my sinus. Chicken chilli next time and also Tandoori. A special feeling. I will hold back on five stars because restaurant is new and I don't want for them to begin to feel 2 big for their bridges.
