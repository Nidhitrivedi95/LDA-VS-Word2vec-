DjlOWc6p2jkit9zMSFa_ew Wonderful flavours, unique dishes and helpful service will  keep us coming back.  Our favourite dish is the mushroom curry.  The appetizers (dosas, pakoras) are also fresh and flavourful.  We have been at least 5 times since they opened, and have never been disappointed.  Aravind's south Indian fare is a welcome addition to the Danforth strip. It  has also replaced traditional curry-house style Indian in our rotation for good!  I  have a gluten intolerance which can make dining out a challenge. Aravind's staff was extremely helpful in guiding me through the menu, most of which is compatible with a gluten-free diet.   I look forward to trying their new lamb & chicken entrees soon.
