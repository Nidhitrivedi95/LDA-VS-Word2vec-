ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw Biryani House opened at this location several months ago. The location has changed over several times so I was hesitant to try it. That being said, after passing by on several occasions I figured I should give it a chance. 

I had already eaten dinner and was just looking for a little snack so I grabbed a few of their veggie samosas. While they were quite tasty, I did find them to be a bit on the cool side (maybe as a result of having sat out for a while) and they were quite small. They did satisfy my hunger though!

Because of it's location I will likely return for the samosas, but I'm not about the other dishes.
