vwVoksbTKehDP8ZGUQaVfQ So overpriced for the amount and quality of food that is served. I purchased a portion of lamb vindaloo, which was a pretty average to small sized portion and cost approx $15. It was excessively salty and had very little meat floating in oily curry sauce. No naan or rice was given with the curry. Very disappointing experience.
