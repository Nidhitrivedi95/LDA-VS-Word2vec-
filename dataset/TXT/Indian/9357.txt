The smell of Indian spices greets you from just outside the restaurant, making your mouth water right away. Ive come here twice, the first time I ordered chicken vindaloo and the second butter chicken (spice level 2). Each time the waiter has questioned my spice tolerance and argued with me that I should get lower spice, which does get annoying, but at least they have your best interest in mind! Each dish comes with choice of rice or naan although the first time I came there they offered me both for free! There is no way you can come here without trying the garlic naan. If happiness came in bread form, it would be naan. My friend ordered the mango laasi which I tried and really recommend if you're looking for something to drink with your meal. Staff was very nice and fast!
