MKCbZC6KR4oxA4LOQAVdhw I think I have developed a mild obsession with their Greek omelette. It is quite possibly one of the best meals I have ever eaten. This is a small operation, so you may have to wait a little for service, as much of the staff is working both the front and back of the house. I've also had the mango lassi and okra fries. Both were delicious. I've also enjoyed the baklava waffle with their in house cinnamon syrup. The food is very fresh and delicious, and this place has quickly become a regular in my rotation of dining options. I highly recommend checking Greedy Girl out.
