Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg The service at Trimurti is outstanding.  I like that there is no particular waiter-to-tables assignment.  When I was there, there was a team of four wait staff  who collectively  serviced all the tables.  My seat was facing the back end of the restaurant and I observed that they all stood in attention, watching watching out for tables that might need their attention.  There was no personal chit-chat among the wait staff, and I never had to ask for a water re-fill as there was always someone walking around to replenish them.  They were courteous and respectful and focused on getting *you* serviced (as opposed to your usual perky waiters bopping around and pretending to be your best friend).  

And the food, of course, was excellent.  My partner and I ordered Chili Paneer, Chicken Briyani, Two orders of naan, raita, and Mango Lassi.  Now, I'm the type of gal who makes a lot of moaning noises when I eat good food, and believe me, I was moaning a lot when I ate.  The paneer was fresh and airy.  Watch out for those chilis!  The chicken in the briyani was tender and moist.  The dishes comes to your table in ornate siver serving bowls.  There are a lot of vergetarian options in this place, and I imagine here is a paneer version for every carnivourous dish.

I highly recommend Trimurti and Iwill definitely go back!
