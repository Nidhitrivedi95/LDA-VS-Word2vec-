CvOxwAhmwwy3sQRKYVAjGg This place seriously surprised me. It's in rough shape and in need of some refreshing so I automatically thought the worst. However, the old adage is true, never judge a book by it's cover. The food is surprisingly decent. The butter chicken and freshly made parathas were so good. The parathas are not placed on the buffet line, you need to ask the server because they make it to order. I'm fine with that because you can never go wrong with freshly made, buttery parathas YUM!  It's 12.99 for a lunch buffet with some good non-veg and veg options.
