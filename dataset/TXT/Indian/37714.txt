OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg By far one of the best Indian restaurants that I have ever been to. Yes, it's pricier than your average Indian fare, but the amazing customer service and unparalelled quality of the food make it worth it. In my undergrad, my roommates and I would save up specifically just to go here on our birthdays and for special occassions! There's a specific waiter in general (I never got his name, but he's tall and young-looking *UPDATE: his name is Sumit, so if you're planning on going to the host and have him as your server, you'll leave a happy diner!) who is the absolute sweetest, always going above and beyond to make sure our dining experience was a good one, and even remembering us and our orders the next time we came.  I'd go so far as to say he is one of the best servers I've ever had, at any establishment. The atmosphere is also great for a girls' night out, date, or family dinner. LOVE, love, love the Host.

Must-trys:
-Their chicken tikka masala (I never used to be a fan of Indian food. This dish from the Host totally changed my opinion and converted me to a fan!)
-Their garlic naan (better bring some gum for after this, folks: The Host is very generous for their garlic, and it pays off! So scrumptious.)
