H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ This is one of my favorite Indian restaurants! Yummy! The malai kofta with the cashew sauce is divine. The chicken tikka is really delicious. Garlic naan was a good choice and to finish it off the gajar halwa was oh so tasty. The waitstaff is really running but still ultra friendly and helpful.  My husband (who is Indian) and I always enjoy ourselves.
