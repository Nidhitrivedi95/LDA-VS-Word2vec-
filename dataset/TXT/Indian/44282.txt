rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I was pleasantly surprised by the team at Pukka. 

I had heard a lot about it - and had suggested it to a friend who wanted to book a nice Indian place for her birthday. We looked at Ji (Pukka's sister bar) and Pukka - and I thought that the menu at Pukka would more conducive to a lovely dinner party.

Well, I was correct. 

As soon as we walked in, the aromas of the masalas were amazing. 
It's hard to screw up Indian food - but it's been done, especially in the hip/trendy areas of the city; but I knew that these guys had it nailed as soon as we walked in. 

The service was excellent - our server was on point all evening - and it was packed in there. 

I'm not going to go through all of the dishes, because I think everything is good on the menu. 

The only thing that don't agree with, and I see this in trendy Indian joints, is changing for chutneys. It's ridiculous. It's like being charged for salsa at a Mexican place. 

Go to Pukka ... you won't be disappointed.
