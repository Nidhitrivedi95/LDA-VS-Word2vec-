RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w One of the best Indian/Pakistani food I have had in North America. The most authentic sheikh khababs, fresh crisp butter naan, baigan bharta, biryani, nahari!!!

This place was crowed on a Monday night and it sure ought to be. I would recommend this for anyone looking for authentic Indian food. Service was wonderful. I loved the way, they brought out chillies on skewers. 

Everything we had was worth trying. The free raita and red sauce was very interesting. They just laid on every table in squeeze  bottles. 

Loved it. Must visit!!!!
