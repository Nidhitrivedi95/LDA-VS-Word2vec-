UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ Come here every week. Love their lamb and beef biryani. Medium spice is really hot. I like hot, so I get medium spice. If you can't handle extra spices, I suggest you get mild. Food is fresh and good service.

Only complain I have is the upwelling. I don't drink my calories. So I don't drink soda or anything. I like plain old tap water.
