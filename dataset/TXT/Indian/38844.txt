OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This place has no authentic Indian food. Tried their paneer tikka which was way too costly 8$ for 4 peices which I thought is just unfair. Also tried their veg noodles and veg fried rice. Both of these items had too much oil and no spices. The hotel did not have hot sauce which to me is not worth my money. The items were made with frozen bag of vegetables. Will never go back again.
