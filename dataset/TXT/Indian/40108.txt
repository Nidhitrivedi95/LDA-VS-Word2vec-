PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw It was our second visit at Namaste Kathmandu, and second time we were not disappointed. Moreover, I must admit that the meal was even more AMAZING! 

Absolutely delicious and full of flavour food, waiters who are very caring but not importunate, good prices, nice decor... It's a real gem! It was a wonderful experience, the Team is doing a really great job. We will definitely be back - it's one of the best restaurants in Edinburgh!
