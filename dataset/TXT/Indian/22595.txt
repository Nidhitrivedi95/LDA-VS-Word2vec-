gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg This is one of my favorite places to get dinner at in the valley. The food is amazing and different, the chili gobi is my personal favorite is like the vegan version of chicken wings. The owner is great and always makes you feel welcomed. Fast service always fresh and great price for the amount of food
