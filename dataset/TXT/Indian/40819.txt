PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g I decided to give this place a try, and I can't say I was completely wowed. The ambience is romantic with dimmed lights, red paint and cushioned seats, and a quiet atmosphere. 

The complimentary warm garlic naan was appreciated. We ordered the chana masala, which was not very tasty or spicy. The chicken vindaloo's consistency was a little too thick for my liking, but still nice and spicy. The bastmati rice was delicious and not too oily. 

I didn't try the Malabar fish angoori, but was told that it was delicious and very flavourful. It is also one of the restaurant's signature dishes.
 
For dessert, we shared the gulab jamun, which tasted just right and not too sweet. The servers were a little reserved, but were still quite warm and the food was served quite quickly. I don't think the high prices are justifiable for the food served; therefore I would not return.
