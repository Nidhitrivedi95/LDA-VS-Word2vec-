7d2LqDc0Cb5dcizil_h34A We had a party for 7 people and all of us enjoyed the food. Started with hot and sour soup which was spicy and delicious and then came potato chilli which is spicy style french fries. Loved it! The highlight was the momo which is as I understand is a traditional Tibetan dumpling dish. We ordered both chicken and veggie style momos and I particulary liked the chicken ones. Chilli chicken was sizzling and medium spicy...the way I like it. Forgot the name of their traditional bread but I found it tasty and unique at the same time.
I'll visit again soon.
