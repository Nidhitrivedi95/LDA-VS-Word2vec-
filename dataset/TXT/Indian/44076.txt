RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w We visited on Sunday May 24th, 2015 afternoon. Place was packed up. Lines were long. Food was ok but our waitress Soha was exceptional. She was dealing with 6 tables (30 people simultaneously). She won our recognition because of her speed of service, helpful attitude and her big smile. Keep up Soha.
