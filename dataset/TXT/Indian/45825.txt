SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ Went here for the buffet lunch with a co-worker. The people that worked there were very pleasant and the service was fast. We were seated right away and told we could go right up to get our food. The food was good but nothing special. They had some spicy options but not all that spicy (I guess you can't expect much from a buffet in that area). They had a good selection of both vegetarian and meat options so there was something for everyone. Would I go back, if I worked Downtown all the time, probably yes but I would not make it a point to go there otherwise.
