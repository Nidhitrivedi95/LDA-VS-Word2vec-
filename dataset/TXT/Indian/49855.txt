U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw I am a hard guy to impress but the food here was so tasty that I was impressed instantly. I like non vegetarian food so had ordered fish curry and chilly chicken. Both dishes turned out to be fantastic! I can say that the quantity was a bit inadequate but the quality of the food certainly made up for that. 

I would recommend this restaurant any day.
