KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Its a nice cozy restaurant which has some decent hakkah Chinese fusion food! There lunch specials are good and have tummy filling portions. 

The food itself tastes good and is warm and comes in a timely fashion. 
The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and fast. Plus they do individual bills as well. 
The parking is not a problem as its part of a big plaza.
