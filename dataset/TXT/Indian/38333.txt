oMt3FrXtmYiP2ayn46PHtQ Finally some authentic north Indian/Pakistani food..Tried beef nihari, mutton korma, butter chicken , mutton biriyani and Peshawari naan and all of them turned out to be delicious..if the Garam masala is a touch lesser in the biriyani I believe it will taste even better..
Haven't yet tried the buffet but I guess the variety will justify the price which I guess is a little on the higher end on the first sight..
