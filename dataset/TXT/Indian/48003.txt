TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Sunday night: January 10, 2010. Indian Food Heaven. My bf yelped this place while we were thinking of a place to grub my last night in Vegas before heading back home Monday morning. When we first walked in, I thought, "Wow...tons of Indian customers and wow...very classy spot." We started off with some flat breads and a couple different dipping sauces. Very delicious! For our entrees we ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Curry and of course being total mcfatties we ordered 2 different types of Naan bread. Ohhhh how I love Naan and ohhhh how they made them just right! And to finish off with dessert we ordered some Indian ice cream, I had the pistachio and he ordered the mango. Very different, but very good as well. The service was also quite excellent. I definitely didn't think we'd find an awesome Indian restaurant as this one that night. Definitely gotta try this place out if you're ever in Vegas and looking to dine off the strip.
