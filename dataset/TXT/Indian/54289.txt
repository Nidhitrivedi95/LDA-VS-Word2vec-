Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A Love this place! It definitely hits the spot whenever my husband and I are craving some good Indian food. I usually get one of the curries with paneer, while hubby really enjoys the butter chicken curry. 
Add one of their samosas (or an entire order = 3 or 4 can't remember) to your meal. Very fresh and let me tell you, you'd be surprised by how filling they are! 
There is also an Indian grocery a few doors down from this place, so if you are looking to make some of these tasty dishes at home, go and check it out.
