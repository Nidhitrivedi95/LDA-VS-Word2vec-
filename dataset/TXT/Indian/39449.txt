OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I will never eat here again.  Read on if you must.

The good:
- cheap (but shitty) beer
- green beans were good - but not as good as Chung King Garden or even Moxie's (yes, Moxie's bar and grill, frequently found in the parking lot of a mall, that Moxie's) has a better szechuan green bean dish
- House shrimp was proclaimed delightful by all parties - I did not indulge

The inoffensive but not good:
- The spring roll was actually an egg roll and it was not too gross to eat half of
- Hot and sour soup was acceptable - but not even in the top 50 hot and sour soups I have ever had... there was a lot of tofu but it could have been hotter in spice and temperature... one of my favorite parts of the meal and I really didn't like it very much, so you can imagine what I thought of the rest of this failure dinner (I actually tasted failure... and it tasted like gravy)

The bad (where to even start...):
- Everything was breaded and deep fried but nothing was crispy
- Every sauce has the underlying flavour of cheap packet gravy... it was WEIRD
- The following dishes were so gross I didn't eat more than one piece: ginger chicken (the most gravy flavoured of them all), chili chicken (not a single chili in it, and doused in fluorescent orange sauce that only tasted like gravy in the after taste), crispy beef (not crispy, sauce has no distinct flavour and pieces looked like turds - note - I am used to this being a dry dish, to have it covered in a sauce of a molasses viscosity that hinted at the flavour of gravy was... disgusting)

All in all, I would give this 2 stars, mostly because the beer was so cheap, but as we were getting ready to leave (Christine was finishing her drink and Shari was using the restroom) the owner asked us to vacate our seats because other people were waiting. Sure, I'll just take my half a beer out into the parking lot.  WTF?  -1.  Seriously, we would have been gone within the next 2 minutes, shut your face and go deep fry some more failure.

Interesting to note: nothing else in this plaza is open.  It is completely vacant, save this terrible restaurant.
