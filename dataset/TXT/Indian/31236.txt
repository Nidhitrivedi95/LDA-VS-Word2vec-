KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw this place was a great find!... the food was delicious and had many unique menu items.  the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Rick.  this restaurant is easy to get to and lots of free parking.  the portions were very generous and priced very reasonably.  

I would recommend this to anyone for some good home cooking and great spins on traditional dishes.
