UAXz2KC1aXpxzV-MLdXbmQ Authentic Indian food for "The Beaches Set".  PM if you don't get what I mean!  ;)

Chefs are Indian, waiter looked Indian-ish, restaurant was contemporary and clean, but prices are somewhat high just because they don't include rice/naan.  A bowl of rice on its own was $3.99, but it was a good 2-3 servings.

I went for a bday dinner and arrived late with my bf.  Since we were leaving early, I asked if we could be put on a separate bill.  And the waiter said that groups of 6+ people are put onto 1 bill.  Water was refilled throughout the dinner.

My only criticism was the paying of the bill at the end of dinner.  Since everything was put onto 1 bill, people were leaving at various times, each individual had to go up, and pay their own portion.  So it did get a bit messy.

At one point, the waiter who was separating the bills short-changed my bf and said to the bday girl, "Don't give me attitude".  I'm pretty sure the bday girl didn't say anything do prompt this response.

I understand that separate bills gets messy, but wouldn't it have been easier than doing math at the end of the meal?  And wouldn't the waiter end up getting MORE tips??

Not a pleasant way to wrap up a celebration.  I think I'd rather risk a stomach ache and dine in Little India or elsewhere with equally good food.  I'm sure they'd have the sense to offer separate billing.

There was also a "hostess" who was there, but she did absolutely nothing, so I'm not sure why she was even working that night.  She sorta faded into the background as soon as each person went up to pay their portion.
