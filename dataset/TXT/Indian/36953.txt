o_sq_rvTBo59hm6TkDi6tg The good:

1) tons of selection at the buffet
2) there is naan at the actual buffet so you don't have to wait for your waiter to bring some to your table
3) the place is decorated quite nicely; nothing too fancy but nothing too ugly either
4) central location; very close to square one and the central core of Mississauga
5) the food was really yummy (esp. the butter chicken!)

The bad:

1) it's a little bit more pricier than others because it is such a central location
