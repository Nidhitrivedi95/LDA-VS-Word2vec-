ffWkln-XUcOyh_K9SK5oBQ You have to be a very specific type of person to feel comfortable in this completely unique, baby blue restaurant.

Vivek pointed out that it's like eating in a cloud.  True, but man, that's not Zen.  It's just weird.  Clouds are not appropriate venues for eating.  Eating is fundamentally tied up with the experience, energy, and emotions that go along with being nourished.  And I'm not talking about nourishment for the soul.  I'm talking about nourishment for the body.  That's the point of eating.  Y'know...what you do at a restaurant.  It's a very earth-based energy.  The environment, atmosphere, music, sound, space and service at this place give you the opposite vibe.  It's a very unsettling disconnect.

The food is fine, if amateurish.  Why not just buy a can of chick peas and some sauce from President's Choice?  The service is attentive, but creepy.  It would be more appropriate for a temple or a yoga class.  It's just not right for a restaurant.

The other problem with this place is that it feels like it's a recruitment centre for a pseudo-spiritual charlatan.  The less said about that, the better.
