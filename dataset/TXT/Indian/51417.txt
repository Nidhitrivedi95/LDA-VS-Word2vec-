UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA good food and a surprisingly sophisticated beer and wine menu.  have yet to have something there that wasn't delicious.  hit the lunch buffet for a nice selection of what they have to offer or order off the descriptive (and slightly humorously written) menu.  if you like it hot (and i mean HOT..this is one of the few places i have been to in a while that will make it hot enough for me) don't be afraid to say so...they will accommodate you.  however, if they suggest a heat level for a dish, my experiences there are to listen to them and enjoy the subtle nuances that too much spicy might cover...you can always ask for something spicy on the side if you want to heat it up.  be sure to check what the specials are...often unique and tasty.  good variety and a place that can accommodate your vegan and vegetarian friends, as well.

head there for happy hour (can't remember the exact time) and enjoy the two for one beer prices.  they have a diverse selection from around the world, including some great belgian-style ales as well as a couple of organic brews.  or try the ginger energy tea....just the thing to pick you up.

**edit 4/10/09....the place in under new management...wasn't happy w/ the food or service the last time i was there (hard to get them to make it hot nemore).  i know they have a different chef than when i gave my first review....will give it another shot, but it isn't the same place as it was

***edit 6/1/09...went again last friday.  food was lackluster....not bad, but not at all what it was.  sad that the place that used to have awesome flavor and spice served me two bland entrees.  would drop it to two stars if it didn't have a decent price....and one of my friends did like one of the two things she got.

****edit 12/15/10...THEY'RE BACK!!! very happy to say that the food has been really good the past couple of times i have been there. and the lunch buffet is still good and reasonably priced! thumbs up
