PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ We've come to this place many times and the experience is always consistent. Food selection is not as great as other all you can eat places like Mandarin but it is clean inside and the servers are attentive to your needs.

There are a few dishes that are good but overall most offerings are nothing special enough that you must go here to have it. One good thing is that they are usually accommodating when other places are full or at capacity for certain holidays.

I would recommended trying it at least once.
