Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Indian food is my favorite cuisine and I have been to many different Indian restaurants around the globe.  I went for dinner service and though the the decor is dated, my boyfriend and I were beyond pleased with the entire experience.  Maharani is at the top of my list of exceptional restaurants.  The food was divine and the service was impeccable.  We had the samosa chat, garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo curry, all of which were delicious.  The menu also consists of southern Indian cuisine which I will definitely have to try next time, as it isn't offered at most other Indian restaurants!
