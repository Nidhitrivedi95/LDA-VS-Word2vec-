TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA Lost one point for bad sambhar , sambhar the accompaniment with most South Indian dishes was not authentic , lacked flavours n taste .
We ordered mini idli"s soaked in sambhar served with coconut chutney , Ghee roast masala Dosa and poori with aloo bhaji n kurma. All delicacies were outstanding except sambhar .
Service was superb too !

Way to go SB.
