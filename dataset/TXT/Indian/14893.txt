cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Too bad Yelp! doesn't let you give a 0-star.

Decor:
Or lack of.  Trying to match the King St W hipster notion and failed big time.

Cleanliness:
Oh where do I start?  How about the floor.  There were mouse trap and sticky pad visible on the floor and around the benches...I wonder why???  Here is an idea, pay an exterminator.  Our water glasses had stuck-on food ON THE INSIDE, when I asked for a new one, the waiter/owner didn't seem to care or apologetic.  My steak and rice came with a long curly hair which I was not about to digest after seeing the rest of the restaurant.  How they pass the health inspection is beyond me.

Taste:
Fine dining my a$$, tastes more like straight out of the microwave.  There is no creativity that sets aside the food from other places.  And the fusion part, I was looking around to find that.  I ordered the steak, medium rare.  First of all, it looked more like 2 beef patties out of your local Loblaws slapped together.  Second of all, 2 pieces were rare and 1 piece was well done.  Maybe that was their attempt at FUSION??

Service:
It literately took 10 min to just get the menu and another 15 to get water or even attention at the table.  We bought a Groupon and the server didn't even seem to know what menu we are suppose to pick from.  The Groupon clearly said ANY wine upto $9/glass but the server INSISTED that it was only the $6 house-wine.  I was in no mood to argue over stupid stuff and only to get a glass of cheap Jackson & Triggs.  WOW!!!

Atmosphere:
Dark, smells like Indian food and BO mixed for too long and dirty.

Respect to those that like the crap they serve here, I don't know how you people stand it but it seems the standards in the area is fairly LOW.  Save your money and go to any over-priced franchise and it'll taste better than this slop.
