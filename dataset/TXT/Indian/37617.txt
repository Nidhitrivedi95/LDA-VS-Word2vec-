OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Great indian food. I had the tahi.. good value but my friend had the tandoori chicken... came on a hot plate.. sizzling and delicious.  Anyways good place for indian food but it loses a star because the owner refused to give us a student discount claiming we can only get it if we pay on one bill???!!! when is a student going to pay for 6 other students??! kind of ridiculous
