LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg I really like this place and it has become our go to carry out Indian restaurant. I've heard their lunch buffet is very good but have yet to make it in.  My wife and I always split the chicken Tikka masala and butter naan, it is plenty of food for two and the meal comes with rice.  I normally can eat large quantities but splitting it is the perfect amount.  The service is always very good.  Over all, I'm thankful we found Indian paradise.
