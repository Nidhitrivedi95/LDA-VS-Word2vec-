0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I love Indian food and even more so when it's fresh and tasty and interesting. Go beyond the boring curries and you've caught me. And so when I stepped into Chaupaati and inhaled the sent, I knew that I'd found a good spot.

Bummer that it was only me and that I could order a bunch of stuff to share. So I just ordered a Aloo Tikka Chaat, spicy. And spicy it was. Loaded with heat, onions, chick peas, chopped tomato and somewhere under there, potato. I cleared the plate. And if there weren't other people in the restaurant at the time, I'd have picked it up and licked the plate too.

Very tasty, not expensive. Yummy Indian food.
