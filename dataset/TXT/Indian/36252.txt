NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ We started with chicken momo. They were good, a bit like a curried ravioli. The sauce tasted a bit like a spicy tomato pasta sauce, making it seem even more like a twisted Italian dish. They were good, none the less.
I got my bhuteko khasi (lamb) as hot, and it was a bit spicy but not nearly what I expected. The taste was great for this dish.  We also had the rasilo chicken which, at medium spice, was not hot at all. I preferred my lamb.
