CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ I finally was able to make it here for lunch, and I'm so glad I did! The decor is not very impressive, but the food is! You are able to choose how spicy you want something, the flavors are spot on, and it is hot and fresh. Indian food is never my first choice, but after eating here that may change!
