0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg We got the chicken curry #54 and the lamb chetinad #52 with medium and hot spice levels respectively. We also got some garlic naan. The food was excellent. They made excellent suggestions and were very patient!

On to the food, the chicken curry was superb. It was extremely spicy (which we love). It was awesome!! The lamb chetinad was also good. It wasnt as spicy as the curry but the meat was very tender. The food was portioned well. I will definitely absolutely be back to try more items off the menu. 

Great authentic lowkey indian cuisine in a nice area. Loved it!!
