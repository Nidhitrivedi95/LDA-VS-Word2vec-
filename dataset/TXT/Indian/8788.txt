7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg I've had Indian food in almost all restaurants in the Cleveland area. This has been one of the best experiences. Gastronomic delight. The chef's specials are a must-try. So is the gulab jamun, which is a perfect end to a good meal. Will visit again soon.
The alcohol selection is not as limited as most other Indian restaurants. The pricing is moderate.
