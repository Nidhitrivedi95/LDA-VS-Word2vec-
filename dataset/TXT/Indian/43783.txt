RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg This is the new, off-campus (yay!) and more fine dining Bombay, and I have to say, it is fantastic.  It's in the old Basmati building, and they are doing a wonderful job of bringing their delicious food to the non-student crowd.

They've only been open a couple weeks and seem to have everything down already.  The service was perfectly attentive and the food was amazing.  They bring out an Indian version of chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal that was really good.  Their Naan is some of the best I've had, and the Tandoori lamb was so wonderfully tender that a butter knife was more than sufficient to cut it.  Everything was perfectly flavored, just the right temperature, and the portion sizes were right on the mark.  Our bill for two was about $40 and included appetizers, extra Naan and drinks, so the prices are very fair.  I was really stuffed by the time we left and still had plenty to take home.

The owner stopped by at the end of our meal to see how we liked everything and to tell us a little about his restaurants and business philosophy (ie, made to order food using his father's original recipes), which I though was a nice touch.  I sincerely hope that this new location takes off, as it certainly deserves to!
