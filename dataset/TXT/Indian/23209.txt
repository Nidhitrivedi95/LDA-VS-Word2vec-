gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This place is horrible, DO NOT come here!!!
The food is of substandard / poor quality and the service is horrendous.

What restaurant brings their naan as soon as you sit down? Ps - the naan tastes more like bread than naan

And they server never refilled out naan - he was busy watching cricket on his tv behind the counter

The samosas were very oily - refried

The gulab jamun were uncooked in the center - defrost?

There weren't many Indians when we there, which is a tell-tell sign that it is not catered to Indians!
