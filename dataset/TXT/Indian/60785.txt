zQwAPLeF1hSXLIHjyALmjg Absolutely delicious! We came here for dinner and will definitely be coming back.

Very authentic afghan and Indian food, with plenty of vegetarian options. We had the classic butter chicken, it tasted more subdued than normal Indian butter chicken. I really liked the flavour.
The paneer in spinach was great and filling.

Staff was friendly and conversational. 

Highly recommend this place and they have great takeout options!
