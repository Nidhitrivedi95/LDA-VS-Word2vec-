TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA So, so, so delicious.  Tasty, spicy, hot, sustaining, succulent, savory, all the descriptive words please.   

Can I say I was so sad it was closed last night?  It's not open on Mondays.  It's just a little clean Indian food restaurant on the edge of North Oakland.  Wood floors in an old Victorian home.  It's like you are eating at someone's house, which is really cool, cause honestly, I prefer eating at home or at someone's house as opposed to a restaurant.  I've eaten at People's in Garfield and the old India House, and they don't even begin to compare.

Their portions are big, and you always have some leftover at the end of the meal.  And I eat a lot, so that's saying something.  I basically gluttonous as an eater.  Anyhow, I digress.

Go there, it's not too pricey, the service is ALWAYS good, and they always make sure you have enough water.  I wish I could remember what I get, but I can't.  It's always something Paneer (chicken or cheese).  Their nan is always perfect, like they just baked it in a old hearth.

YUM!
