Gtw-SpnhyNa0TwNETlysyw We came here for dinner.

Bhindi Masala - Very good.  Great flavor and the okra was fresh.  It was dry as it should be (but often is not at other Indian restaurants).

The lamb special - Excellent.  Lamb was tender and the sauce was the perfect blend of heat and flavor.

Chicken Tikka Masala - Different, less tomato-ey than other places I've been to.  It was good, but not what we were expecting.

Chicken Tandoori - The key here is that it wasn't dry.  It was nice and juicy.

The garlic and butter naans were both perfect.

The service was friendly and attentive.  One of my favorite Indian restaurants in the Valley.
