sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Tried this place based on the glowing Yelp reviews.  Didn't like it.  Not at all.  From best to worst (relatively) we had the following: chicken korma roti, lamb roti, butter chicken roti, shrimp roti.  Could be I'm used to a better quality of indian food.  Could be I'm used to a better quality of roti.  Could be I just expected good food.  Period.  The shrimp & butter chicken roti taste the same.  Bland and too sweet.  The chicken korma was much better with the lamb a close second.  Gotta say, the lamb roti had lots of lamb in the filling and it was spiced much better than the chicken.  Didn't dig the dry roti either.  Located at Bathurst & Queen St. West.  Not a lot of room to sit - just 3 or 4 small tables.  More of a take-out dive, than anything.  Since it's a holiday, didn't have to wait at all for our food.   What a waste of money.  Won't ever go back.  Not worth the money (avg $11.95+ per roti) nor the time to drive to this place.  Cash only.  Grungy spot.
