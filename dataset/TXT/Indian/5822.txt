3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Truly some of the best Indian my wife and I have ever had and there were some great Indian places in Phoenix where we lived previously. 

As others have stated, the Naan is pretty much the best I've tasted in Las Vegas. The lunch buffet is very good with a wide, fresh selection. I also order take out a couple times a month to bring home to the wife and kid for dinner. 

Every staff member there is beyond nice and super attentive to boot! Highly recommended.
