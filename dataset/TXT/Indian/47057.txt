Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg The best Indian restaurant in Cleveland. Me and my husband went here for dinner on Sunday night, we had the hyderabadi chicken biriyani, chicken tikka masala and goat Karahi, all tasted fresh and good! They make special biriyani on Fri-Sat. Since moving to Ohio, we're been searching for some good Indian/Pakistani restaurants like they have in Va and NY. This is our new favorite spot!
