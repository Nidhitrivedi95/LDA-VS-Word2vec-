GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Stopped in for a quick lunch during the week, and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and diversity of food offered.  Naan bread was amazing, staff friendly, and food delicious.  Only complaint was the bathrooms - smelled like there was a gas leak.  Will definitely be back next time we're in town to lose some money!
