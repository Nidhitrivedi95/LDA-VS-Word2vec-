yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug I had to fill out my first police statement ever. Why? Because we chose to have lunch at this place. One of my family member's purse was stolen. More than theft the way the guy who claimed to be the owner (here on Yelp he is listed as manager not the owner) talked is the problem. 
Another person on table next to ours wallet was taken as well. After the manager (claiming to be the owner) showed us the horrible quality video footage, went onto say that the those ladies were standing next to our tables for 5-10 minutes and we should have been responsible enough. Instead of being understanding, he tried to divert the blame on us and the other group.
I won't ask you not to eat here, that choice is yours to make but do take precautions and hold onto your stuff tightly.
