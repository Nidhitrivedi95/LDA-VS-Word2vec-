sUGlSS0AF2xPYFEjvKJbSA This is now were Maharaja used to be. The new owners must have new chefs as well. The food was terrible. 

Very bland tikka masala and chicken curry; every thing needed more salt or something. The tikka masala had way to much cream in it I could barely eat it. Even the nann was cold and tastless. 

My favorite thing to eat at most Indian restaurants is the mint chutney, dipping for nann, pakora and samosas. Most places the taste is very similar, sometimes different color or texture but still tasty. Tandoori House's was beyond awful. It was again bland, super spicy from tons of raw jalapeños that it almost tasted chemical-like. 

The samosas were also empty from the time we got there until we left. Maybe it will get better with time but I'm not willing to take that chance. We will not be coming back here, Swagat off of Old Sauk will be our go to Indian buffet from now on. Also weird how the other 2 reviewers have only started yelping this month and have only reviewed this restaurant? Just sayin.....
