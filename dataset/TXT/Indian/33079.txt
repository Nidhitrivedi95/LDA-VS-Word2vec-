llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g We recently moved up to Sunnyslope, so the search was on for a new Indian Restaurant and India Palace was it.  We enjoyed it so much that when they moved over to the new location on Bell Road we followed.  

They have all the typical Indian fare, although we only eat the veggie stuff so I can't comment on the meat dishes.  Their Mali Kofta is wonderful with amazing sauce including cashews and raisins and they are more than willing to add Paneer to your Aloo Matter (if you're into that kind of thing).  Great samosas and pakoras, and if you go for dinner they will start you off with some Poppadums and salsa with chutney.  

I think India Palace has one of the best Indian Buffets, but that is mainly based off the fact that their buffet always includes a large selection of veggie dishes, almost more than the meat selection! They also always have some interesting selections that you may not see on the menu like Chili Tofu and Curried Pasta.  It's all you can eat including the naan and hot Indian Tea.  Its always busy at lunch time and there is a reason why.

It is located in the corner of a strip mall, but once you enter you wouldn't know thats where you were, as the restaurant itself is very nice on the inside.  The staff is very friendly and if you go as often as we do you will get to know them all because they are always there!!

They also have restaurants in Sedona and Flagstaff, although I recently heard they were going to be selling those and just keep the one in Phoenix. 

Enjoy!
