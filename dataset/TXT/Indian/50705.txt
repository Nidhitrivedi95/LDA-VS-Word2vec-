UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I really like their food. I know Indian cuisine and how it should taste quite well because I lived in India. We had chicken tikka, rogan josh, malai kofta with naan and rice. Naan was not the best I've tried. Chicken tikka was a bit dry to my taste but not bad. Malai kofta was very nice as well as rogan josh. The place was completely full with people waiting in line to get a table. The service was good.
