We started with the Chilli chicken dry since that was the most popular dish there. In my opinion it wasn't that bad, pretty decent with flavour in it. Next up was chicken pakora, which was not good at all the only reason would be the taste, I couldn't figure out the spices. 

Main dish we had Kung Pao chicken, Szechwan chicken gravy, Chicken chowmein noodles and Manchurian fried rice. I wouldn't recommend to order kung pao chicken because it was too sweet and bland. I loved the combination of Manchurian fried rice with the Szechwan gravy on top.

Lastly, to end this the servers were friendly. Even though the food didn't impress me, the servers made sure I enjoyed the atmosphere.
