FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg We were in the area, starving & craving Indian food so we decided to go here & give it try.

The restaurant is decorated tastefully & is clean. We arrived 15 minutes prior to closing & the waitress was pushy. She was quite unhelpful when asking questions about meal options due to a serious food allergy, even though she was advised of the restriction she really didn't seem to care.

She seemed reluctant to honour the yelp check in deal. The food was good & the portions were well sized. The mango lassi was not as flavourful as I like it but I've had worse. The samosas were not very good according to my firend. The chicken tikka masala was very good,perfeclty balanced. I believe our second dish was the mattar paneer, it was ok, I was happy I tried it but wouldn't order it again. We had to order the rice & naan on the side & both were well prepared.

We ended our meal with a different staff member that was kind & attentive,he pointed out that the young lady was new to the establishment although part of the family. He made up for the subpart service we had received during most of our meal. We had leftovers to take home & were too full to try any dessert plus the kitchen was closed so we couldn't have had any if we wanted to. I think this establishment is overpriced for the quality of food.

Overall,I wouldn't go out of my way to go back.
