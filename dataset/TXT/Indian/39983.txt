pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I had some type of over cooked grilled chicken; the kids of the owners seem to be the wait staff and they clearly don't communicate with each other, the kids don't want to be there, they will forget half your meal, I even still left a tip, i called the manager a few times and I was yelled at for calling too much, they thought i was trying to sell something to them??  awfully weird, I hate to see locally owned places near my neighborhood go down hill like this, and pleas stop leaving your dairy products in the sun your going to make people ill, yikes! come on now!
