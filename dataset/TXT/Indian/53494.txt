VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg We have flip-flopped between cafe tandoor and Indian Flame as to which is our preferred easily accessed local Indian food.  After our most recent underwhelming experience with Cafe Tandoor, Indian Flame has won out.  Cafe Tandoor, while often quite good, just simply is not consistent enough for my liking.  They sometimes don't provide any rice and it is a bit pricey.  Ultimately, there is good food to be had from here, but other local options are better.
