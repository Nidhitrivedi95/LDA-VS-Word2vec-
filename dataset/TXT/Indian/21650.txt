GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g I was pleasantly surprised with their chutney bar, wow, so many amazing chutneys to try. I can't really comment on the hot factor since I don't really consider a ghost pepper to be particularly hot, so you're on your own there. 

The giant dosa we received was filled with a potato filling, and was very delicious. The paneer butter masala was creamy and flavorful, but not overpowering. The customer service was very friendly and they seem to have very cheap lunch specials that allow you to sample some of their best dishes!
