c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg Pls do your self a favor and don't choose to go here. Instead you should go to the one right in front of this  restaurant called "Kirali Restaurant'.  

I placed an order for Mutton Kothu Rotti over the phone. When I went there and saw the bill I almost fainted.  The cost of a mutton kothu rotti is almost $15 dollars.  The funny thing is it wasn't even enough for one person. I asked the waitress why it is so much for just one mutton kothu rotti , she didn't have an answer for me. I told her this is the last time I am coming here.  She said 'oh thats fine we get enough business from other customers'. 

At Kirali Restaurant it is almost $12 and its enough for 2 people.

I would never go back to Karaikudi.
