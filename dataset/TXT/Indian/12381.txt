axGUBM5mgmFZQn85bMTVPA We've been fairly disappointed with the Indian food in the Charlotte area, so we stopped in to Nirvana with low expectations. We left with a new go-to place for Indian. 

Atmosphere
The atmosphere is slightly upscale, though it's comfortable enough for jeans and a nice shirt. Nice Indian music was playing and we had a comfortable booth by the window. The place is smallish, in a typical plaza storefront box, but done very nicely. 

Service
We received service on par with other Indian restaurants I've been to. That is to say, it was everything you need and nothing more. I'm a fan of this, as I am there to eat and not chit chat with an overzealous waiter. 

Food
Perfect. Everything was delicious. Rich sauces without being too rich. Buttery Naan bread without being too buttery. Filling without being too heavy. Complex layers of flavor that make you think that Indian chefs are magicians more than chefs. We had the Naan bread where you get to pick 3. My favorite was the fruit and nut Naan, it was like a mildly sweet dessert. Everything was perfectly cooked and stunningly delicious. My wife and I ordered 1 appetizer, 1 meal and the Naan, and left full and had enough for leftovers.

Cost
We found it to be a bit more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the area, but well worth it for the increased quality and taste. 

If you are in the Ballentine area (slightly north?) it's a great place for a fantastic dinner.

Celebrity most likely to enjoy eating here: 
Tina Fey. She would butcher the names of the food but she'd eat it like there's no tomorrow.  

Half hour to live and I have to get my last meal here: 
I'll just tilt my head back and you can cram as much malai kofta in there as possible.
