hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Both I and my wife were  very, very disappointed by lie bestowed upon us by server of Mantra Masala, when we visited Mantra Masala yesterday, the 9th of October 2014
We had ordered kulfi and kheer. What was served was vanilla ice cream and  something which resembled and tasted like reheated porridge.
When we spoke to server he insisted that what he had served was kulfi. When I told him that I had taken kulfi dessert throughout my life and that I would recognize kulfi when presented to me he backed down and accepted that what he served was not kulfi but vanilla ice cream and that he was not being truthful.
 After this lie, I did not want to speak with him about reheated porridge like item served as kheer.
Not only did he not apologize but also billed both deserts.
The lie was conduct unbecoming.  If we were naive, unsuspecting clients, he would have taken us for a ride.
This experience was disappointing to say the least.
