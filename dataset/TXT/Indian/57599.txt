yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Everything I have ordered here or tasted from a friend's entry has been delicious.   I love Indian food anyway with its "sneaky spice" and delicious warm flavors. 

The naan here is delicious, and one order could feed four to five people. 

I have ordered the Dal Makhani, Punjabi Chole, Dil Bahar Korma, and Sialkoti Rajmeh, and all of these had delicious flavors and spice.  You can determine the level of spice, like most Indian restaurants. 

The entries come with white or brown rice. 

The only complaint I have is that it can take a while even after seated.  Both times I have gone for dine-in, it was fairly crowded, but it was at least 20 minutes before someone even came by to ask for our orders.  However, due to the extensive menu, this wasn't a problem, since there are many delicious items in which to choose, we needed that time!  Water refills are constant and the food comes out quite quick after ordered. 

I'm also excited to know they are open till 10pm.
