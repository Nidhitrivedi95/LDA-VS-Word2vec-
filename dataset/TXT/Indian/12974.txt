b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Ate there on Sunday November 23rd 2014. Space is bright, warm colors and welcoming staff. Extremely clean and crisp. The staff was very helpful with the menu which is large. There is no lunch time buffet so be prepared for that. Tried the dosa (huge and tasty, good for two or three people to share), the garlic soup (never had a more savory garlic soup), an eggplant dish and a chicken dish. My wife and I have eaten a lot of egglplant and chicken at Indian restaurants but nothing like this. The eggplants were whole and slightly charred. The chicken was thoroughly sauced. The service was excellent, water always filled and helpful explaining the menu. If you like heat this place will more than satisfy.
