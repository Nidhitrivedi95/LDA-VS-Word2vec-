Leave it at this...nothing was outstanding, either way.  No fantastic dishes...no total duds.  The food was tasty and well prepared.  No dal, though, and it's one of my favourites.  The experience was MUCH better than my last meal at Mahar.

It is a clean and comfortable place, with good service.  My dining partner insisted that I mention that our waiter almost wore a trough in the floor by circling the restaurant constantly...whether anyone needed anything or not.  It was like he was doing laps, waiting for a customer to flag him down.

Worth a return visit.
