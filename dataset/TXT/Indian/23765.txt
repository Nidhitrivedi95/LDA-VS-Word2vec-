gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I love, love, love this place... best indian buffet in town. I have been enjoying there food for years. Recently they have had a staff of 3 or 4 waiters that are always walking around, never picking up your plates, slowley refilling your water and darn near not even making eye contact with you....PLEASE FIX THIS!!! YOU GUYS ARE BETTER THAN THIS !!! I will up the stars when you up the service. I am not usually a complainer but when service goes down, business goes down and I dont want to lose you MT. EVEREST.
