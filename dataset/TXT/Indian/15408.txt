CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ My husband and I just tried this place out last night and we thought it was pretty good! It was our first time and my husband and I aren't the most familiar with Indian food so the menu was a little hard to understand. We don't know the names of dishes and what they are like so it was hard for us to know what to try. It would have been nice to have a description of the dish with the name for the Indian newbies like us. Luckily the customer behind us in line told us about what the dishes were like and had some good recommendations. The food was overall very good but like a previous poster, they were out of a lot of main dishes so it took awhile while they were cooked. The staff was all very pleasant and outgoing. We'll definitely be back for another try.
