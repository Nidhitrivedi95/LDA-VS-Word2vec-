The 
This is the new location of the mandarin-esque AYCE Indian Restaurant in the heartland mall area of 'Sauga.

Pros:

1. It looks alot better than the other location, more modern and really cool exposed brick decor. 

2. The food is more openly laid out, with a lot less of that salad decor garbage

3. The Service was fast and efficient, and food kept getting refilled quickly

4. All dat fresh naan yo, jst never ending. My brother (little) was just standing there staring at the gy making it (I use little loosely, hes 21)

5. The chaat station, mmm pani puris

6. The grill station , mmm tandoori all day


Cons:

1. They didnt have my favorite - the hariyali chicken (Green chicken)


Thats it basically!

Check it out, its yummy and worth it. Cheaper than most buffets too
