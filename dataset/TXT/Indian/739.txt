-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg My family came here for my dads birthday. Since we are Indian, and my parents are phenomenal cooks, we are VERY picky when it comes to Indian food (since we are soooo well fed at home) 

The meat here is amazing. Kabobs, tandoori stuff...delicious (as I was told from my father). Since I am vegetarian, I didn't get to try any of these meats. 

The main curries were ok. Everything is mild,so tell them if you want it to be spicy! The naan was so soft and fresh, and the paneer curry was quite good. 

Best thing was the service. Our waiter was very patient and kind (go Kenneth!) I don't think I would come back since I'm vegetarian, but it's a great place if you want to try some good meat.
