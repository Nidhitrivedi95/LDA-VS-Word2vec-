2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Ok, so the food is actually quite good. However, there are some issues that need to be addressed!! (I would have given this place 2 1/2 Stars if I could. So I rounded up) First, the service was extremely slow and inattentive. This made it difficult to get started (seated and ordered), get refills on my water, and my chai I ordered ended up coming out barely warm (as well as taking a long time to arrive). The other issue I have is with their "Buffet". It's not a buffet where you go to a table and pick what you want to try and how much of it you want. I'm actually Very OK with that, it keeps the food fresh and feels more upscale. However, their "Buffet" is a preset meal. Honestly, it's really more of a Prix Fixe meal! Now I was told that you can order more of any of the preset dishes, thus being all you can eat (like a buffet), but they give you quite a bit of food and I doubt you'll need to order extra of anything (except the rice, I did need more rice). The problem with this is, you'll probably leave quite a bit of food on the table to go to waste and they Do NOT Let You Take Any With You (remember, it's a "Buffet". Only it's really really Not)! This place could easily be a 4 1/2 - 5 Star place! They need to fix their service (biggest issue is really attentiveness) and change their "Buffet" to a Prix Fixe menu. As a Prix Fixe menu nothing would really need to change. Don't offer all you can eat (, stay the same price, but Let The Leftovers Go Home With The Customer! There's WAY TOO MUCH food waste in our society!
