h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA This was the 1st time trying the Royal Taj. We choose this place because of the overall reviews from Yelp.com. The overall experience started out good. The lady was very helpful in explaining some of the dishes and making suggestions. Throughout our meal, she did come by to check on us. We waited for the bill to come which took a while, and while we were waiting we noticed that this place must be good when actual Indian people go there to eat indian food. Ok, so fast forward to the lady finally coming back, we asked her to split the bill, she replied that she would "be right back". 20 minutes later, we spotted her just chit chatting with what I assumed was her husband. We sent up my brother to check on the bills to which she replied "ok", as if we never had asked and if she had no intention on doing anything about it. 10 minutes later, both the lady and the guy comes out and says ok, come up and let us know what you ordered. So our party had to come up in chunks to tell them what we ordered so they could split the bill. Very unprofessional. My suggestion for this place is to keep the owners out of the dining room and hire some professional waiters and waitresses. So overall it started off good but once we asked to split the bill, it environment turned really sour. Ending our night on a bad note. It's probably good if you just call in your order and take out.
