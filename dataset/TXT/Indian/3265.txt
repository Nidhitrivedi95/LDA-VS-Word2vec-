My friend had never eaten Indian and he loved it! 
We had seen their sign while we were shopping for groceries, and walking around the corner from the Bilo there they were, Chaupaati friendly and inviting
My husband and I were very accustomed to what to order due to me being in culinary school, and my friend began struggled to decide. Quickly the friendly wait staff was there to help with any questions that he had. 
I got the Chicken Korma, an order of Naan bread and the assorted pakoras which was out of this world, BTW. My husband ordered Shahi Paneer and our fried ordered the Tikka Masala. Everything was so good that we all decided to share everything. 
Chaupaati is a total hidden gem and I hope they stick around. 
Thanks again for the service & you all will definitely be seeing us again!
