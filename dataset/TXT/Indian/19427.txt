feFckrNF9-QzGrY4T9dAvQ I'm going to break this down to explain my two stars. Here we go.

THE GOOD: 
* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. 
* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere
* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.

THE BAD:
* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.
* A surly "aunty type" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids
* Said "aunty type" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.
* Said "aunty type" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.
* Said "aunty type" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?
* Said "aunty type" doesn't say "thank you", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.

THE UGLY:
* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? 

So, in the end, here's the equation:

1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.

Bah.
