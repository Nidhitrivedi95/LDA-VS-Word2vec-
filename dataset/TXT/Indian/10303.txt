9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w Came her for an early dinner with family and some family friends. 
Décor is really, really nice...customer service is questionable. 
We ordered 2 dishes each of dal makhani, paneer makhani and malai kofta along with naan and tandoori roti. 
In terms of curries, dal makhani is pretty reasonable, malai kofta was probably my favourite - the koftas are well made. paneer makhani is disappointing - forget about tasting like ketchup, the colour of the curry shouts ketchup...I had very little of it. paneer is chewy - commented on by other members too. 
Tandoori roti was dry, very light in weight; Didn't have the naan but other members said it was alright.
For the kind of prices that you have to pay, you should expect better quality.
