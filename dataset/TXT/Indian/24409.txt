h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ We went here last night for the first time and had a fantastic dinner. My husband ordered a spicy vegetable soup and we got two orders of chicken tikka masala. He didn't like his soup and said it tasted like spicy water with some spices, so we will try something different next time. The chicken tikka masala was AWESOME, but the rice it came with was pretty bland. Although I felt it was fine when paired with the masala. The garlic butter naan we ordered was seriously amazing! And dipping it in the tikka masala sauce was the best part of the meal. Our server was very sweet and very efficient, however they were definitely understaffed for the amount of people dining. I think she may have been serving most of the tables in the place. So it took a little longer to get everything than it probably should have but it was never so long that it was ridiculous. The restaurant itself is beautiful, very clean and well designed. You would never be able to know such a nice place is hidden in the shopping mall. There was plenty of open parking and it seemed like the place didn't get busy until 8:30ish; definitely a later crowd. Our price for the soup, two dinners, naan and 20% tip was $45; which was very reasonable. We will absolutely be back soon!
