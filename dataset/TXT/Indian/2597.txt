02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Went in at 6 pm on a Sunday. Restaurant had perhaps 3 tables sat. We were sat in a part of the restaurant near all the other tables. Received water and menus. Waited over 15 minutes for someone to take our order. 

When we flagged someone down we were told they were short staffed but still no one came over to apologize or take our order. Waited another 5 minutes and left. While we were waiting one couple waited the entire time at the register to pay their check and another man dining alone was in the same situation and walked out.
