LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg Sitting on a prominent corner opposite the Kings Theatre, Tuk Tuk Indian Street Food is an odd mix of modern minimalist marketing and traditional simple street food.  It works on a tapas-style approach - they recommend two people order between 5 and 6 dishes and work from there. It's not licensed so BYOB is the order of the day (no corkage charge),

So, last night, when I was the lead guitarist out of the Shadows, we decided to pop in here after picking up a rather nice bottle of red on the way. When it comes to tapas, I come over all Carol Vorderman and select random dishes from different sections without much attention to what's actually in them.  Sometimes it works and sometimes my food allergies get the better of me. On this occasion I think it's safe to say it worked out reasonably well. 

We had......

Fish cakes.  Not that great. Yes they were shaped like cakes and had an 'aroma de la mer' but somehow the subtle flavours were lost amidst the rest.  They would have benefited from some kind of dipping sauce. They weren't that hot either.  Lamb kebabs that could have done with a yoghurt dressing but otherwise were pretty decent. Chilli garlic chicken. Fantastic. A lamb curry. Almost as good as the chilli garlic chicken.  Hakka Chilli Paneer. Just confusing. Think Singapore Noodles meets Rogan Josh. It tasted ok but somehow my senses were working overtime to comprehend what I was seeing and what I was tasting.  On the side we had rice and garlic nan, both good.

We finished off with a couple of chai teas. 

So in summary, I think Tuk Tuk is probably a decent 'try me' kind of place, but I don't think there's enough here to keep me coming back for more. Yes the bill is quite reasonable, but you've already paid for your booze and it's easy to leave that calculation off the total.  As with most tapas ventures there will inevitably be a couple of dishes that don't totally work so you have to focus on the overall appeal of the meal.
