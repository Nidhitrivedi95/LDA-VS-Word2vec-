1. Food is pretty good.
2. Prices are reasonable for Indian food.
3. Good service. 

Bad:
1. If you get there at a certain time they will make you wait until that time's menu is available. 

I'm not a fan of Indian food. My tongue cannot handle the spiciness this food typically contains. However, I was in Vegas and this town is about leaving your ol' self at home and trying new experiences. 
So, I walked in to the restaurant and they were celebrating an event. They server told me that I had to wait 'til 10 pm to place my order. I waited patiently, and one of the owners came over and apologized. 
He went ahead and took my order. I tend not to eat fish anywhere, so he recommended the Old Delhi style corn fed chicken tikka makhani prepared with ground spices and fenugreek flavoured tomato makhani sauce, served with pulao rice. 
I took it to go. When I got back to my hotel room. I seriously prayed it would not be too spicy. 
I grabbed a spoon and went for taste:
Ummm, not bad. Hot ,but not... wait, crap, spiciness coming in... where's the rice? Found it! oh! yeah... that's better. Not bad. Ok, let's continue. 
So, it was basically like this for the rest of the meal; 1 or 2 spoonfuls of Old Delhi chicken and rice. 
Overall, I would def. come here again. It is the only place I've found myself liking the food. I've gone all over the world trying Indian food, except India.
