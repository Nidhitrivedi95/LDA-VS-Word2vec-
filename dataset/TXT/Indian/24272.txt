gXLiBVCHIqoPEw2CaP3QmQ Just ordered take-out from here. The owners are incredibly friendly and answered all of our questions on the menu. My wife and I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, garlic naan, and a Paner Dosa. Both dishes were extremely well made and flavorful and came out in exactly 15 minutes as promised. Every restaurant's level of spiciness is different. We asked for a mild Chicken Tikka Masala and to our palette, it was more of a mild/medium (which was fine). But, just mentioning as a tip when ordering your level of spiciness. 

This is a quintessential family restaurant and we highly recommend it for eat in or take out.
