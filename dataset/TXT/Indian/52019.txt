UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Me and my friends went to the lunch buffet for the first time , so this review is for the lunch buffet only...
The selection is very limited with a total of about 10-11 items (that's including the 2 desserts and 3 soups but not including the chutney bar, which has about 5 chutneys, which I don't care much about..)  , the food is OK for the price, but not the service, me and my friends just felt like we weren't welcome there, the servers never greeted us when he saw us walking in, also very slow when it comes to taking away the plates (we only had 2-3 plates each), not like it was busy in any way, the restaurant was half empty despite it's small space. During the (granted brief) time we were there he never came to our table to check if we need more naan or not..... After we got our second plate, the server gave us the check without asking, and without saying a word to us... We gave him the money and were supposed to get 8 bucks something as change but he just assumed that's the tip for him, which to his credit he was right, but I still expected him to bring the change back first, but he never did... Of course when we left there's no acknowledgement or goodbye in any form....
Their bad manner and service "might" have something to do with my friends being Chinese ? A form of prejudice ? They didn't think we'll tip? we weren't wearing suits but t-shirts and jeans? I don't know for sure....
We won't be back, that's for sure.....
