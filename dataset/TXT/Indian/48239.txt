ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA When I need a tikka marsala fix, this is the place I go. Their saffron chicken tikka marsala is possibly the best tikka marsala I've ever had. There is a really nice anise flavor to sauce, and they're willing to make it spicy for me (although CTM isn't traditionally a spicy dish). It's definitely a good place to hit if you're heading to Ayrsley Cinema for a movie.
