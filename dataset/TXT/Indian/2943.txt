0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw Service was amazing.  My bill was incorrect.  Mentioned this to the waiter and he gave me a discount.  Huge menu.  I ordered the non-vegetarian dinner.  So much food.  Food was amazing.  The waiter gave me a side of tandoori chicken for free.  Very tasty.  Best Indian food in the west valley.  The place was super clean.  You can choose between buffet or a la carte, lunch and dinner time.  I will be back.
