6P4ZzCdd_YQqncnQv1jplQ Food is excellent. The decor is awful. The server didn't seem too swift & wasn't that accommodating at first. He may not be used to Scottsdale clientele. I'm not really sure if they are trying to appeal to Indians or the mainstream but they should get rid of that awful Indian TV/Indian music videos. I did not care for them & if they are trying to appeal to everyone then they are not doing a good job. The place is way too big. I hope they make it but unfortunately every restaurant that has been there fails. They should have chosen another location. I wouldn't waste my $$ on a remodel, just move. But the food is amazing!!!
