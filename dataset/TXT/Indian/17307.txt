DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ The best Indian food we've had in a long time along with excellent customer service. Specializing in Northern Indian cuisine the dishes were presented in a fresh and flavorful variety. We started with samosas and mango lassi and continued on to the chicken tikka masala and the chicken kabob. Our server added the saag paneer which was the housemate speciality and incredibly tasty. The naan was tender and light while the rice have enough bulk to hold sauces. Bonus they also serve Haywards 5000. Hubby ordered mango pudding for dessert and was pleased while I opted for a tasty sweet milky chai tea. I can't wait to come back.
