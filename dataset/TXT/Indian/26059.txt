Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw This place used to be really good, but it has kept sliding downhilll for years. Had a crave and got their mixed platter to go (which I've had many times). I asked for plain rice instead of that yellow rice that normally comes with.... But they UPCHARGED me $1 without telling me. Then I get the carton home and nothing's been kept separate. the rice is coating everything, the flavours are muddled.  And, the chicken was dry and I only got a mere 2 pakoras! usually i get 4 or 5.

I do wish more Indian places did combination platters for one of two. I wouldn't recommend this place. If you do, dine IN the restaurant` *(otherwise your food will look like post-mortem dog food), and ask about the price if you want to make a substitution.

Staff are... half friendly, half not.  Maybe the other location cares more... and doesn't leave chicken sitting around getting dried.
