7KKugTC6WXZpypifkf9i7Q This is a restaurant that my family visits occasionally.  They have some tasty dishes that we enjoy, like crispy ginger chicken (or beef), general tao chicken and their awesome chilli chicken wings. 

Now lets talk for a moment about those chilli chicken wings (sips tea). You might think it's chicken wings coated in chilli chicken sauce but nay. It's well coated fried chicken  wings tossed in ginger, pepper flakes, garlic and a sriracha kinda sauce (yah I basically just gave you the recipe). It's my favourite thing to order from there. Never had chicken wings like that at any other place.

Lastly, the chicken balls are awesome here. A lot of places you go to are pure batter with a tiny hidden chunk of chicken....here has big golden chicken balls with huge chunks of chicken. Further their sweet n sour sauce is soooo good - I wanna drink it. But alas! I resist.

Nice setting, clean restaurant and friendly, prompt staff.
