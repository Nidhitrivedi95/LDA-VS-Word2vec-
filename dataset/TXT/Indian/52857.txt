v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug Stopped in for a quick carry out lunch; figuring buffet would be a good route. I received a single styrofoam container - nothing for soup or salad if I wanted either. Then again, I didn't ask. $8.55. 

Lunch buffet was relatively limited considering the pages or offerings they have for order. Chicken Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Palak Paneer, spicy cabbage (sorry, don't know the formal name on that one), Tandoori Chicken, a beef dish, and naan. Oh, rice. Obviously. There were two soups and a small spice/salad bar also with your standards - cucumber salad, mint sauce, pepper sauce etc. 

Frankly, it just wasn't the best Indian I've had. It was good; but chicken was a little tough in the tikka masala; the naan was pretty average, and the spicy cabbage was REALLY spicy. 

I promise to return and try a la carte, because the menu is simply so gargantuan I couldn't imagine limiting my judgement to just the lunch buffet. 

Side note - they do have a pretty cool, long bar with full service and a couple tv's. I could see getting crazy here with a dinner buffet and a few drafts ...
