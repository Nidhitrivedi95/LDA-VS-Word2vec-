gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A If your in Vegas and your at all a fan of Indian food, stop here!

The neighborhood is a little sketchy and the place is an old fast food joint, but be brave. Inside it's comfortable and clean, and on the hot day that we visited it was cool. 

We had the sample plate that had a smattering of various Indian dishes, and all were very good. 

The owner and waiter were very nice and answered all questions we had about the food. 

We will go again next time we are in town.
