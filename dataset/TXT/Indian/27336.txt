Imeco-4YvX4lDHk-TSJXXA Decor was nice. Greeted well at the door. Sami came by several times to check on us. The owner also came by several times to ask about our food. Service was exceptional. Food was exceptional. Ambiance was excellent. We had the pakoras for appetizers. Excellent. Chicken jalfrezi and chicken korma were top notch. Shrimp in s red sauce was very very good. The naans were hot and fresh. Service was very very impressive. Definitely highly recommend. Sami's attention and friendliness is the reason I'll be back. And dessert of Gulab jamun with coconut was not sweet. Just right. And the chai hit the right spot. 

Keep up the excellent work.
