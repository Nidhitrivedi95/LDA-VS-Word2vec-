tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This place had by far the most food selection for weekday lunch buffett i have ever seen in the U.S.
I am an indian so i know indian food,trust me they do a bang up job.I liked the fact that they had 2 Lamb Entrees and 2 chicken entrees.
Free lassi and Tea for buffett is amazing.
I will be going there again and again for sure.
