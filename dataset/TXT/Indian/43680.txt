RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Had a great experience here.  Service was super friendly and prompt.  The chicken tikka masala is excellent as well as the paneer naan.  I also tried the chicken curry, which used dark meat.  I thought it was just OK because of the poor quality of the chicken.  However, the curry was excellent.  I can't wait to go back!
