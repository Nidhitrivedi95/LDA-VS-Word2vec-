Aol8whdcT7BfnhUCnfa1lw I have to admit, I haven't ever set foot in this restaurant, but it is our go to place for takeout Indian food on a regular basis.  Consistently good and always arrives steaming hot, within 30-40 minutes of ordering.  Butter chicken and lamb curry are favorites.  Their naan bread is really good too.
