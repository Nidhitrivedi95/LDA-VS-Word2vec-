DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg My favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley!  Great food, lots to choose from and the staff is very nice and helpful if you don't know what to get.  They have sampler type orders that allow you to try many things.  They also have a fantastic lunch buffet with a wide variety.  Everything is very reasonably priced and did I mention it's BYOB!?  We stop and grab a 6 pack of our favorite brew and come here for some gooooood grub.  It is vegetarian but honestly, even if you're not one, you won' miss the meat here.  So much food and it is all soooo good!  You don't need the meat!
