RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg My husband and I used a Living Social deal for this restaurant.  We preferred it over Copper.  The serving size was much larger and the food was delicious.  We had the Chatpate Tikki Chole for appetizer - Spiced potato patties served over a bed of a zesty garbanzo beans stew and topped with duo of mint and tamarind chutneys - highly recommend it! So much flavor!  I had chicken tikka masala and garlic naan and my husband had Tandoori Lamb.  Both of them were excellent.  There was enough for us to take home and have for dinner the following night.  I just made some rice to go along with it.  We'll visit here again...with a restaurant.com certificate.  It's a little pricey.  Chairs weren't exactly comfy but the food makes up for it.
