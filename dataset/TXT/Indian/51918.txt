UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Mint was a great place for us to have family dinner! The place was clean, had great service and an extensive menu. My husband tried one of their flavored milks (to help with some spice maybe?) and it was delicious. 

I refused to leave without trying the naan and it delivered. I wish I would have taken photos, but you know it's a good meal when you are enjoying it so much that you forget to! There was a mixture of different curry dishes at our table and I enjoyed each one. I honestly couldn't tell you which one I ordered because we ordered a handful. There was not one that I DIDN'T like!

They also have a great wine and beer menu and appetizers. Dimly lit for a perfect date spot or a fun place with the family like we were there for. (Can't believe we got a table with minimal waiting on a Saturday!)

The only downside to this location is the parking lot - it's small and a little sketchy in the evening!
