iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA This was the blandest Indian food I have ever had.  It tasted watered down.  And yet, still managed to give me indigestion!  Not sure how they pulled that off.  We started with Vegetable Pakora - which everywhere else is nice bite size pieces of chile, onion, califlower, etc., but at Marigold Maison was like the small pieces remaining in a bag of potato chips.  They were such small pieces that you couldn't even dip them in the chutney - you had to scoop some "pakora" and toss it into your mouth, then scoop some chutney and shove it in.  We also had the Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Both sauces were so bland, it was like Italian food.  And the  Naan was over cooked so that half of it was basically a cracker - not a good springy bread that could soak up a sauce, like naan should be.  The prices were outrageous for the quality and quantity provided.  We had 1 appetizer, 2 orders of naan, 2 entrees and 4 beers - bill came to $85 before tip.  Also, server tried to take away our entree bowls before we were done.  I guess he thought that since we ate the 8 or so pieces of meat, that we were done.  I eat Indian food for the  SAUCE.  But I guess since the sauce really sucked that many of the customers at Marigold Maison just leave it.  I won't be back.
