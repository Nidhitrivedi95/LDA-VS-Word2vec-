hVNISzeoHut2RlmPb0n4CA This deserves zero stars. It's THE worst Indian food and sweet place in Mississauga! We bought some rasmalai- it was made with burnt milk. The moti choor ladoo smelled like they were made with stale oil. The thali was very oily, bland and did not have any taste. Too bad we bought all these things as takeout and don't stay in Missi so could not return them! Never ever buy anything from here-the staff is rude and food is stale and bad quality. They are cheating people by selling bad quality Indian stuff. Please stay away from this place-there are far better restaurants to spend your money at in Mississauga
