ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ This place hadn't lost it's touch! I had the Lamb Vindaloo, Butter chicken, Lamb Briyani, Special Fish Coriander, Garlic Naan and Mango Lassie. Everything is Delicious! I was here 10 months ago and they still have the organic options available.. I don't think the butter chicken was organic, I buy organic meat sometimes and know what organic meat taste like.. maybe it's because I didn't state organic? Either way, the food is Delicious. I love Indian food, I use to eat it often but I got so sick of it, so now I only eat it, once every 2-3 months.. You need to try this place out, the chef knows how to cook!
