NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg The atmosphere of this place is pretty cool and new age. Think of it like the chipotle of indian food and you'll know what to expect. They have one of those new auto beverage dispensers and a cool hand shower/wash station. The employees in general are professional, nothing more, nothing less. The food is very consistent and pretty good tasting. It's in between fast food and restaurant food, just like chipotle. Its a cool new place to try as there are not many quick indian food places I can think of nearby.
