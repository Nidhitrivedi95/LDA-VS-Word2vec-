_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Coworkers took me here. One of them is Indian and said this is the most authentic cuisine he can find in the city.

I'm not indian, but the food sure tasted like it would be the standard of authentic cuisine. It was amazingly delicious. On the pricy side, but to me,  all the worth it because the quality and taste is just top-notch. Ordered the Seafood Thali for $18, which comes with tandoori chicken, shrimp in coconut curry, chick peas, salad, naan, and a dessert, and we also got rice and yogurt to share. I think i got extremely good value for the price. I am definitely coming back with my bf for lunch.
