Both dishes had great flavor and reminded me how much I love the complex Indian flavors and spices. Fish can out perfectly on a hot griddle that continued to cook the fish and veggies through. The two of us only finished half due to the large portions. One downside was the food was a little too salty. Still tasted great, but reigning in the salt would have made it better. Prices were fair too. $33 for the entire dinner and we still had half leftover.
