B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Worst food. Ate last night here..ordered appetizer sampler chicken biryani and goat curry. Goat was not cooked properly and the appetizers looked as if they were taken out from freezer and heated in microwave. Biryani was like rice mixed in current paste. Not at all worth it. Do not waste your money or hurt your tummies. This is not authentic indian food.
