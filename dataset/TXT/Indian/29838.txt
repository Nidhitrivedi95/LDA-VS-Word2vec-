jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Food is good but it is VERY pricey. If you order a burger its 5.99 and fries would be 3 bucks on top of that. I just bought my burger and went across the street to mcdonalds and picked up the dollar fries. Besides the price, the food is just ok. In no way shape or form is it worth 11 and 13, which is their general price range. If you go for kabobs you are talking very small quantities for nothing less than 12 and anything decent costing an easy 16. Also every little chutney, sauce or dip is going to cost you between 2- 3 dollars. Pros: Nice and Clean
Cons: EXPENSIVE, Small quantities.
 
Final comment: I only come here when I dont want to go too far for halal. But Vegas is pretty small so I just drive most of the times :)
