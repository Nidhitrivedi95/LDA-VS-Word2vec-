zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q worst service! i ordered okra curry and the lady said they are out. she handed me the menu and never came back for 25 minute. I had to go to them to order. now the 2nd lady i went to was pretty rude and loud. whatever i asked , they were out. she seems pretty mad ! 

i ended up eating nothing. my husband had chicken karahi though. once you sit they dont give a crap. they are busy with all takeout orders.
