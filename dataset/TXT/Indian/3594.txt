0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Decided to come here after the 10:30 Sunday Mass.. It supposedly opened at 12, and we got there at 11:30 so we decided to do a little grocery shopping while we waited.

Got in quarter after 12 and there were about 3 tables in already! We snatched a table and ordered up.  I got the Chili Calamari, my sister got General Tso Chicken, and my Mother the Pad Thai.  

I found all 3 dishes to be quite delicious! The Calamari was rather salty, and had a good amount of heat, the Pad Thai was delightfully sweet and spicy, and the General Tso chicken wasn't JUST deep fried batter like many other places.  You could actually feel yourself biting into a nice hearty chunk of chicken.  

Unfortunately, I'm not the greatest with spicy food so I was often in need of water, which the waiter was more than happy to refill...4 times.  

My sister unexpectedly took in a piece of chili disguised as chicken (the thick red sauce made it indistinguishable from the chicken), and it practically K.O'd her.

All in all, I really enjoyed the place! The food was a little pricey, and I think I like the chili squid from Dixie Park a little better. 

I'll be back next time to try the Pakoras!
