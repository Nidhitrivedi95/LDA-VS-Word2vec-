MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g This being my second visit here I can pretty much conclude my experience here with 2 stars. 
Let me start off with the positives. 
The place has a really huge dining area with great Indian music and really courteous staff. 
On my first visit here we ordered paneer puff(3/5) mushroom puff (3/5), pani puri-(what the heck?!?) and chole batura (decent). We weren't sure if we'd come back as the food did not knock our socks off(really good Indian food usually does) plus it's an all vegetarian restaurant. 
My second visit here today was because I happened to be here in the area during the lunch hour. I decided to take the special lunch box which comprises of 2 curries, naan bread, rice, raita (yogurt) and a dessert. 
Today they had palak dal and paneer masala, naan bread, raita, rice and gulab jamun. 

I KID YOU NOT WHEN I SAY THE QUANTITY OF EACH WAS MUCH LESS THAN IF YOU WERE TO RECEIVE A SAMPLE OF EACH ITEM! 

 Did not even have enough gravy to finish my meal and I was still so hungry by the end of it I ended up ordering Hakka noodles and chilli gobi. 
The Hakka noodles was mediocre at best, the chilli gobi tasted good though not really of the authentic chilli gobi. But it tasted pretty good. 

The place has average vegetarian Indian food and may have more items on the menu which could be good, but I don't think I can stress enough about the quantity of food you receive for the prices. Especially the accompaniments. And when there are better Indian restaurants serving better food around. The lunch box is a total rip off, more like a snack box. This maybe my last visit here as neither the quantity can be justified nor the food is punch-you-in-the-face-fantastic.
