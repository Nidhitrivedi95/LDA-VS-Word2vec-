TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA Went in for dinner with family. The place isn't a formal dine in place but the NIhari is amazing! I had the butter chicken and the kabobs, which were also good. This place is known for there amazing NIhari but the butter chicken is amazing too. They don't serve you, you have to line up to order and then they call
Out your name once it's ready, but it's all worth it !
