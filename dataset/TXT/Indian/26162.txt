IaJ8ZCKxKFzgNoIFNCc0YQ My experience is not based on my dining, I am writing just at the attitude I was given when I called to inquire about the place. While browsing on the net, I came across this restaurant that advertised on the uniqueness of the menu/ concept.  Being a 40 mile drive from my place, I called to inquire more about the whole concept they were selling.....And LO!!!! What an Attitude!!! The lady on the other side is not bothered about the business I could give her, or the "Word of Mouth". All she had was, why dont you come here? When I told her where I lived, she was like, "For one, we dont divulge our concept/menu on the phone.....Anyways it is very far for you". Some attitude for a person who has just started a business.
Worst customer service I have ever come across.
