jRxLnJ9my31Re_O2MvQGhw I came here from a recommendation from a co worker. Let's start from the beginning. I walked in and am immediately greeted. I walk to the counter and inform them I've never been here before. They asked me my comfort level with spicy food. Told them and before I could say anything else, I had a sauce sample and a rice sample. And these samples aren't small. Think syrafoam ice cream bowl size full. Yep! He said we can make anything on the menu or we can whip something up. I let him do his thing and whip me up something. Excellent decision, he made me a mango habanero bowl. WOW WOW WOW!!!! So good. There are three different sizes I opted for the regular which was plenty enough for me. Roger is extremely friendly and wants to make sure everything is perfect to your liking. He is open to suggestions and criticism, which is awesome because it makes you feel as if your opinion matters. The price was perfect. Honestly $11 for my meal and a drink is great. Especially since I couldn't finish it and will finish it for dinner. So two meals for me for $11. I'm okay with that! Let's get into the flavor. Everything is so fresh and flavorful, it will linger on your tongue after. So so so delicious. I will return and I absolutely recommend everyone come out and try this. They close at 4.
