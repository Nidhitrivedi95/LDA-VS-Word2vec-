CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ I can't believe that people have rated really low for this restaurant.  I am originally from South India and this restaurant serves the best South Indian Food. This is the real taste of South India and somehow they did the magic of reducing the spice level without compromising the taste. For $7, we get rice with 2 sides, 1 curry, 1 chappati, 1 dessert. Chicken 65 is the best. I really loved it. There is also one Chicken curry which is too yummy.  The curry which we get with white rice is kinda okay but not the best. Medu Vada is too good. I loved the dessert (both Payasam and also Sakara pongal). Food can't taste more tastier than this. This might not be fancy place but they serve real good food. 

Chicken 65 - 10/10
Payasam - 10/10
Sakara pongal - 9/10
Medu Vadai - 10/10
Curry provided with while rice - 7/10
For dine-in - 5/10
for takeout - 10/10
Value for money - 10/10
Chicken Biriyani - not yet tasted
Coffee - 6/10 (probably, if they have added extra shot, it would have been great)

I have stayed in NJ for a long time where there are many Indian restaurant but this small restaurant serves a better food than any restaurant in whole NC/NJ
