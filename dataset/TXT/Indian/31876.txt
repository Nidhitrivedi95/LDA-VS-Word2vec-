kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Bombay has done an absolutely fabulous job in menu revisions lately. Being a Vegetarian, it is a fabulous place! There is a tofu or potato option available for all entree choices. There food is also extremely low calorie and healthy. It's so darn good, though that this seems to be untrue! (but it's not). I never feel overly full or stuffed. They have awesome wine specials (20 bucks a bottle for a large variety of
tastes-some high end) and some couple's nights deals comparable to most restaurants (20 buckish). Happy hour specials look awesome, though end before I'm off work and head out. 
I minus one small star for service. Seems mildly slackish at times and not customer centered. It's a small establishment, so I unfortunately cannot blame a busy server/bartender. At times the service does seem aloof. However, if you love modern music, fabulous Indian food, and a wide variety of wine, come hither.
It's a great place I feel is trying to improve and I applaud the option of Vegetarian dishes and all low calorie, body happy foods. Kudos Bombay!
