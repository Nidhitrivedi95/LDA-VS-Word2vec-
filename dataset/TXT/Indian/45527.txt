ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw This was my first time at Indian Garden and my first time eating Indian food in general. 

I was nervous walking in as I cannot eat nuts of any kind and was told that many Indian sauces contain nuts. The person who greeted us assured me that I could order anything on the menu and he would make sure that it was absolutely nut free. That being said I felt super comfortable and we got a table.

The inside of the restaurant is completely different from the look of the outside. Very nice atmosphere inside. 

I ordered garlic naan bread and the potato cauliflower dish which was served with rice. I ordered it a number 5 for spicy and it was perfect. Everything was delish. 

I am giving a four star because it took a very long time (close to 10min) for someone to take our drink order. Perhaps they were very busy for a moment, because that did not reflect the service the rest of our time there. The food and drinks came out super fast and several people stopped to ask how everything was tasting. And the woman refilling the water always made sure our glasses were full to the top. 

We will definitely return!!
