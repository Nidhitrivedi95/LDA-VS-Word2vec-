MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg We came here to pick up some samosas and sweets. We also grabbed some mango "shakes" which were super cheap, but I would not call it a shake at all. 

Starting with the samosas, there is a separate line so you don't have to take a number and wait in the long lines if that is all you want. They have different sizes and we got the ones that were 5 for $1. They are pretty good considering the price and size. There is plenty of filling and  the ratio to the wrapper is perfect. The ones at Samosa King in Scarborough are also very good, but the filling is different and there is a lot of the dough compared to these ones. The tamarind sauce that came with it didn't look appetizing at all. Just looked like a sugar-water sauce with red food colouring. Nowhere near a real tamarind sauce. I just threw it out so I can't comment on the taste. I'm sure it would have been similar to a sweet and sour or duck sauce with some tamarind flavour hiding in the background. 

The sweets we got were yellow peda and a mixed barfi box. Both were ready-made on the side to-go. We didn't have time to wait in the long line. These were actually very fresh as well. I've seen the same packages at grocery stores, but those are not as fresh as these. I would recommend them if you don't have time for the line. 

The mango "shakes"  we got were awful. It was nowhere close to a shake and there was no ice cream in it (which is what comes to my mind when I hear "shake"). It simply tasted like they blended milk with a very tiny amount of mango pulp. It's only $1.50 so I guess it's not a huge loss. I wouldn't get them again though. 

Overall, this is not a bad place. They have a bunch of other snacks and even curries and other items for catering. I'll try some of their other food items the next time I am in the area.
