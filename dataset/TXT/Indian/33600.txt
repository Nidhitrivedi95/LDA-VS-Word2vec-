LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg Had to wait FOREVER to get fed here, which didn't do much for my grumbly and unreliable tummy. The other problem for me is that most of the food is spicy, which is a bit of an issue when you've got a sensitive gut like me (too much info?). Despite asking the waitress for the least spicy options, what turned up still had me sweating. 

I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and the idea of street food. We were in a group of nine people so quite a few folk ordered the set menu, which was never ending and seemed pretty good value for money. Again, quite long waits between servings so not an ideal option if the place is really busy. 

I opted for two veggie dishes and a naan bread - I think one of the dishes was a daal and the other was a potato and aubergine dish. They were both nice, but the spice was too much for me despite the waitress saying they weren't too hot. What can I say, I'm a wimp. The portion sizes weren't spectacular as you'd expect from a joint that does Indian tapas, and that combo just about filled me up. 

It was all just, well, okay. I see quite a lot of folk like this place, but the combo of spice, long wait and tapas didn't really do it for me. Maybe another visit needs to happen when less packed... Or maybe it's just not for me. TOO MUCH SPICY SPICY!! :(
