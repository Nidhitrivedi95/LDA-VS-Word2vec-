jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg My first Indian food experience was Jewel of the Crown catering at a Thunderbird Global Management graduation party. Not knowing what it was, I scooped up some Paneer Tikka Masala on a garlic naan, and I've been hooked ever since. 

I have now been a customer of Jewel of The Crown for eight years and everything I've ever had on the menu has been fantastic. Being a pescatarian, there is a plethora of choices for me on the menu. If you are vegetarian or vegan, they are extremely accommodating. 

The mango lassi is fantastic for the children, while they have a great array of alcoholic beverages for the adults. Heck, I order the mango lassi for myself it's so good! 

I *highly* recommend getting garlic naan with your entre and then an extra one to take home if you have leftovers. When heating your leftovers up, separate the rice from the entrée, heat on the stove, and broil the naan on high (watch closely!). It will be just as good as it was in the restaurant.
