llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Lunch Buffet Review:

When we noticed five cars in the parking lot waiting for the doors to open for lunch, we knew we were in for a treat.  Simply amazing and a solid 5 star Indian Buffet.  One of the widest selections of foods we've ever seen.  Each one of their dishes were unique and well spiced.  Typically we can pick one or two things from buffets as our favorites, but we loved everything here.  From appetizers, to main courses, to dips, to desserts; you will enjoy them all.

On top of amazing food, the restaurant is immaculately cleaned, staffed with friendly/professional waiters, and the prices are extremely fair (Only $10.50 with tax per buffet).  They even bring fresh, hot Naan to each table.
