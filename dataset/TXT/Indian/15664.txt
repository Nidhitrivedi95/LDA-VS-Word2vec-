cVdBHFoDjJZX9JOh-1GWHw I never would of known of this place if it wasn't for the YELP family. Being of indian decent, I have tried probably all of the indian restaurants in the Pickering/Ajax area. But this place, by far,  is the best! 

My first impression of this place was that it wasn't very big, the decor wasn't up to snuff. Nevertheless, it was a very comfortable atmosphere.

We were promptly greeted by Baldeep, who is part owner of this place. He was very courteous, and quite helpful when it came to the menu.

All the food we ordered was very good, but what really stood out for me was the Fish Tikka! If you like fish, you have to order this item. Its sea bass, marinated in indian spices, then grilled over charcoal...sooo GOOD! The party I was with, was vegetarian, and they said the veggie food was very tasty as well.

We had a plesant conversation with the owner and found out the chef is from a 5 star hotel back in India, based on how tasty the food was I wasn't surprised.

We intend on going back in the summer, when the patio is open. A must try for indian food lovers.
