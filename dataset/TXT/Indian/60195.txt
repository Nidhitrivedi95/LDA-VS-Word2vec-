ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Best Indian food in the Charlotte university area! They're chicken tikka masala is life changing. Since graduating UNCC I've moved to Winston-Salem, but I still make that hour and a half drive sometimes just to eat at this restaurant. 
Food is priced fairly and service is great. 

I recommend the garlic naan bread and  chicken tikka masala.
