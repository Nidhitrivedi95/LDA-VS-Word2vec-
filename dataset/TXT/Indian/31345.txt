Burger is handmade, tandoori bacon is extra, but worth it.  They also have a BLT with said tandoori bacon.  Apparently the owner won Recipes to Riches for his butter chicken Mac and cheese, haven't tried it but it's on my to-try list.  Each day they have daily samosa features, and many vegetarian options.  I've been there four times and haven't been disappointed yet.

Interior is like a lunch counter, tables and seats are available and I've never had an issue with getting a seat.  Order at the counter and pick up food and self-service drink fridges.  There is an area with couches and comfy chairs as well, but I have never seen anyone sit there.
