MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ We went to Bombay Palace yesterday, and we loved it. We didn't try the buffet, we went for the a la carte menu. 

I really enjoy indian food, so I may be biased a bit, but the samosas, the rice, the garlic naan and the tandoori chicken were really awesome. It is a bit more expensive then some other indian restaurants in the city, but I didn't mind because I really enjoyed their food.

Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the staff is also friendly.
