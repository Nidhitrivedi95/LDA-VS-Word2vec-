zKSKmkBxfrltJau_4s1ZHA Simple and absolutely authentic Indian food. Biryani and Dosa definitely on top of the list. Just go for food which will be plenty for two - for 1 order of Briyani. Lost a start as the girls seems overwhelmed to manage counter, take orders and serve all The same time. Hope they improve as I will be back soon.
