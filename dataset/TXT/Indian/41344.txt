Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ The restaurant itself was small (seats ~30) and a bit cramped, but everything was and bright and clean.

I got the butter chicken lunch special for $9.95, which included:
- a small salad (disliked the dressing)
- 8 pieces of warm, chewy naan
- butter chicken with 7 pieces of chicken
- rice

Not the best butter chicken I've ever had, but still very good, especially once the value is taken into account.
