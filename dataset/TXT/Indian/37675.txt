OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg I did not enjoy my time here at The Host at all. Service was slow. The waitress took over 15 mins to come over to our table to greet us. After the order was taken, the food took forever to reach our table. We had to constantly remind the waitress for our food. The food was not great at all either. It was such poor quality food, and small portions as well. Attending this restaurant during Winterlicious, I had very high expectations for it being in the Winterlicious list. This restaurant did not meet my expectations and provided such disappointment.
