GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Note: I have only been here once as my fiance isn't a big fan of Indian food.. but I have been day dreaming about it ever since.

My friend I grabbed lunch here on a Friday afternoon. Considering we went during what would normally be considered the "lunch rush", I was surprised that it wasn't more crowded. But, she had raved about their lunch specials so I was excited to try TT out. We were quickly greeted with ice water and offered fresh brewed chai. Our waiter was great. While he was new (he had just started a week before) but was friendly, knowledgeable and seemed super enthusiastic about the food.

We decided to split an order of Samosas to start. Wow, best Samosas that I have had EVER. The outside was cooked perfectly, soft but crispy and warm. The filling of potatoes and peas was creamy and spiced perfectly. They were served with a garbanzo masala chutney that was out of this world. Seriously I could have eaten the chutney with a spoon.

My friend had the lamb vindaloo which is the special on Friday, so she was served her main course, a salad, rice and naan. This is the dish she had raved to me about, and she seemed to be equally pleased with it the day we went. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and it didn't disappoint. The chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderfully creamy with just enough heat. I also ordered a side of chili naan... it was huge WAY too much for one person, but was so delicious I wanted to eat the whole order. 

I will be back... And, while I would like to say that I will try other dishes, it will be hard to pull myself away from the Samosas... and the Chicken Tikka Masala. Seriously. Check this place out.
