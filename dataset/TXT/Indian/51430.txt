UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Worst place ever!! Full of liars.. the folks that work here are very dishonest.. We have been to many classy Indian restaurants as we are from Silicon Valley, home to numerous Indian.. 
First, an employee invites us in by saying for kids it's half the price and for adults it will be the full price.. 
My kids ages, 8 and 10 are super poor eaters to begin with.. The reason I am sharing this info with you is so you know after we ate(we are very health conscious folks and don't eat much anyways to begin with)... the manager Biru brought the bill to us with full cost for all 4 of us. We requested to please explain the bill as they had mentioned something different for kids. Conveniently, he first asked how old my kids were and we told them. 
After this, he stated that 3 and younger are free and 3-7ate half off!
When I brought to his attention, he stated he couldn't do anything and the person who seated us didn't know anything.. anyways, long story short. Folks here are very unprofessional and liars.. Food is mediocre.. 
I don't recommend it and won't suggest it to anyone!!
