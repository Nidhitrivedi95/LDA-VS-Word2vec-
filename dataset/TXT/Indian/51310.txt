UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ Been here 3 times and the food is always so good! The Price Is a little expensive we pay $37 for two, but it is a large portion, I guess we could share but me and my husband hate sharing food. The atmosphere is really underwhelming, every time I been there there, no music playing and  the set up is kinda cheaply done with stuff just not completed. It's kinda like siting at a doctors office waiting for the doctor to come in and give you results! Needless to say just get your food to go!
