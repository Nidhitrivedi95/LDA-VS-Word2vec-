tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA I've been frequenting this little restaurant for a number of years and its always been good.  Affordable pricing, fresh and tasty food.  Dine-in or Take-out.  Although dine in is a little 'cafeteria-ish'..  but its good for just a quick bite.

they have a pretty decent menu selection of typical north indian dishes.  and plenty of sweets too.  Its like a fast-food counter so service doesn't need to be much, but they manage to be friendly.

I'd recommend It for Indian food in the area, ideally for take out and then relax and eat at home.  They have good Channa Bhatura, and Chicken Biryani.  I haven't tried all their stuff but I'm sure it is all reasonable to delicious!
