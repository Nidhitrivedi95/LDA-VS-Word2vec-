lz-imOl4szJQBXKo1aHpqQ I visited MannaMahal Lastweek and was quite surprised by the variety of South Indian dishes. We ordered some south Indian dishes and they were excellent. Friendly Staff and 20% discount added further joy to our visit.


 Would defintely go again to try some authentic South Indian dishes like Masala Dosa, FishCurry etc.
