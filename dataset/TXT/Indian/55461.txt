x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA Went for their buffet last week, and sadly didn't have any sort of memorable experience. The most impressive dishes were the potato cauliflower dish, and the drink. Naan was boring, spiciness of the meat dishes lacked flavor to make them complex. Perhaps it is just that I have been spoiled by the amazing Indian food I have had elsewhere, but this just did not stack up. 

To be fair, I have never ordered off this restaurant's menu, so perhaps their cooked to order fare is more impressive, but the lunch buffet was just not doing it for me. 

Price was reasonable, so at least there was no sticker shock to add insult to injury.
