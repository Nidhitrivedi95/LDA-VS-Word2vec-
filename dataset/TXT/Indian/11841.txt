AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ I'm torn about this place since it is pretty average but you can tell they are really trying.  Pretty basic and more like a 3.5. Fusion food tasted pretty good but the food was lukewarm and came within a few minutes which makes me believe it was sitting under a heat lamp.

Macaroni masala and curry poutine were delicious. The chicken satay and Cobb salad are skippable - dry, limp and lackluster. High points come at the end with their Creme Brulee and gulap Jaman cheese cake- must try. Service was decent but the ambiance is awkward with their soft and weird music choices.

The place is really trying to get people in with their multiple deals but they don't advertise that you can't use OpenTable and a Groupon.
