1rVolOOpyyqcy5w366lMqw Call me superficial, call this trivial, but there's just something a little bit special about having a takeaway delivered by a man in a three piece suit. This has nothing to do with the quality of the food (which is excellent), but it definitely brightens up my day.

I've been getting take-aways from the Clay Oven for years. We (as a flat) used to get the banquet for two between four of us. You get (wait for it): Chicken Tikka Massallam; Lamb Bhuna; Mixed Vegetable Bhaji; Alo Gobi Massallam; Pilau Rice (2 portions); Sultana Nan; Kulfi. Yeah, that's for two people. So unless you've a huge appetite, this works out at just shy of £6 per person for four (£22.95), which makes it really good value. Otherwise it is one of the more expensive take-aways.

Top tip: Ask them to swap the kulfi (a sort of weird Indian frozen dessert) for another naan. We've never had a problem doing that. Unless you really like kulfi, you weirdo.
