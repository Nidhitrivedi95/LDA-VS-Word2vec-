02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ WOW! Haha...yeah this place is cool. Just looking at it makes me feel cool. Not gonna lie, I was a little skeptical coming here because honestly, it's not in the best part of town, but it's great. Come here. I judge a place by its Chicken Korma my favorite Indian dish. And this place did a fantastic job. The Biryani was a little lack luster but it still had great flavor. The cashier guy was super nice, he engaged in painful small talk with me haha. That's a plus! And man! BOLLYWOOD MUSIC! I got my food to go so I didn't get a chance to get the whole experience as a sit down customer but I'm sure it's just as good. Enjoy! Thank you!
