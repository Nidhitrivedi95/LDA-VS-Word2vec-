oMt3FrXtmYiP2ayn46PHtQ Best Indian food I've had in Charlotte!! I never usually write reviews, but this place deserves it! Fresh off the grill kebabs, Lamb Karahi was full of flavor and the naan's are soft and hot! If you are looking for authentic Indian/Pakistani food, this is definitely the place to go!
