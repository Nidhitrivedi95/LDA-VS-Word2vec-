OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We came here for lunch buffet. The curry's were too thin and it was hard to have them without bowls available. 

Rice and some dey vegetables and chicken dishes had too much salt and some had almost none. 

There was no desert and yogurt which is surprising to see at a Indian buffet. They did ask them for desert which is when they brought it for us. 

The gulab jamun they brought were definitely canned and cold. 

The serves took forever to bring out naan too. We came in to try la-carte which other yelper's had recommended but they were not serving that this afternoon. 
 
However one other customer was able to place the la-carte order which was again weird. 

And the worst part - my friend found a piece of plastic in here palak paneer. They did refund her the money for the buffet but seeing that I am not coming back again ! 

One star - for the ambiance !!!
