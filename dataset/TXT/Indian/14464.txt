C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA A (young) friend & I had lunch here on a weekday.  This is a great place to meet up for a delicious fun food lunch in a quiet atmosphere.  We could actually have a pleasant conversation.

We both enjoyed our choices even though  we challenged our waiter with our food allergies and our uncompromising palate as we are both foodies. 

With the chef's help in modifying our dishes to accommodating food allergies, we shared a salad then C. had a Scroll  (wrap) and I a burger.

Great dining & meeting outing for lunch & brunch but may be too casual for dinner for my boomer generation
