Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Bleh. Not much flavor and pretty bland food. Buffet selection is pretty small from what I am used to at Indian restaurants but it's fine. All the food even the sweets tasted pretty much cooked out of a box and not fresh.
The service is ok and the place looks nice. It's a one time visit for us because the quality does not match good Indian food and a bit over-priced
