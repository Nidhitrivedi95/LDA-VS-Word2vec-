J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Mmmm....Little India is good. We ended up here after debating which of the three restaurants to go to. I'd been to Trimurti before, but was interested in the middle one. That one was empty, and being in empty restaurants weirds me out for some reason, so we went to look in Trimurti's window. Then one of the wait staff came out and was trying to get us to go inside. Kinda sad. Sooo Little India won our choice by being the least desperate.

But the lack of desperation here wasn't the only good part. Service was so so speedy! The staff were really nice and efficient, which I can determine since my water glass never went empty. Our food came out pretty fast, it was delicious, and cheap. I got a vegetable Thali platter, which had chana masala, saag paneer, something with eggplants, and another dish with mixed vegetables, along with rice and a different type of naan for $12. My boyfriend got the masala chicken, which was SO spicy I almost died. But also delicious so I kept having more and then crying about how hot it was.

After my experience at Little India, I'm coming to the realization that all of the Indian restaurants in this strip are good. But if you're still unsure, you'll be guaranteed a good experience and great food at Little India.
