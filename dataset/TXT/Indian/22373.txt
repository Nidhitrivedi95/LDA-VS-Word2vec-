gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA Before I tell you guys why India Masala in FashionShow Mall is a must go to, let me ask you this. Who doesn't like Indian Food?! Their entire cuisine is a gift for the brilliant flavors they put together to produce excellent dishes for us to consume.

Being said that, I've been dining here for as long as I can remember. And nothing has changed. Excellent food, awesome customer service and most of all, very convenient in terms of access. It's located at the 3rd floor food court and trust me, it'll stand out from it's competitors!

They offer tons of food selections as well as drinks! Best sellers are usually marked on the menu as well! The food is filling, very worth it for its price. You get quality and most of all, a happy stomach!

I highly recommend this place to anyone who's willing to learn about the culture and discover awesome food!

Shouting out Monica DiDi and their entire team for always recommending me with spectacular food!
