HF-fLG3QaNepY151QKDNLA Food is average here and reasonable. Been here 3 times and each time they charged me $10 extra on my bill. Please check your bill before paying. washrooms are dirty and stinky. My first visit was good but the last 2 visits were disappointing.  Food quality is not consistent and not piping hot at times. Please spend your money wisely here. Make sure the waiter has your full attention while taking your order properly. since they tend to look away while taking your order.
