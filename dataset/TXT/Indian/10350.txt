9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w Come on B.B, how is it you started off with linens an now brown paper lines your tables as if we are at jack astors. Why does the tandoori chicken come with ketchup packets. Where is the class.

Came here after a long time this week for my bro's bday.
We ordered a spectrum of things, from lamb korma, to seafood curry. 

The puri's were good, and the food was AVG.  So they don't have dessert other than ice cream and ladoos...lame.

I would come here for a quick bite but why bother when Saravaana Bhavan is in the plaza beside this...

Nicely designed decor though, cool waterfall wall with statues. But again...why construction paper instead of table clothes. I cant take this place seriously anymore.
