Second time taking out from here, and was definitely pleased again.

Samosas and Bhajia appetizers, accompanied by coriander and tamarind sauces. The sauces were a little thin compared to what I am accustomed to, but they still were good. 

Had four dishes shared for mains, Lamb Biryani, Butter Chicken, Chicken Korma and Mushroom Mutter Paneer. 

All were plentiful, not lacking meat nor paneer. Surprising actually. Not to this place in particular, but an overall dining experience that  four adults and one child all could sample each dish, more than one morsel of meat each.

The chicken was moist and tender in the butter chicken, a good sign, not dried out leftover buffet scraps repurposed for the dish. Nice and fresh. 

Only downsides I found were the Biryani lacked sultanas and the korma was a tad salty. Not the end of the world, but worth mentioning. 

And finished with Mango Lassi, which were just right.

Yum, need to do the sit down buffet there one time.
