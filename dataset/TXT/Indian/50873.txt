uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w Excellent Indian food located near campus. The buffets are amazing -- the lunch buffet is $11 and the dinner buffet is $12. Definitely a big draw for a college student on a budget. There are a la carte dishes for around $10, but if you think you can eat more than just one plate of food in a sitting, the buffet is worth it. Make sure you arrive a bit early for lunch and dinner so that the buffets are still warm.
