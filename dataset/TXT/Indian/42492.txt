Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA I come here sometimes with my girlfriend. The serving quantities are very generous for the price, so much so that I normally save enough to have lunch the next day. The food tastes alright. The seating is pretty limited but there's normally a free space. The staff are helpful and the food comes out very quickly.
