xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w I have eaten at this restaurant several times in the past and the food has always been good. Today was no exception although this was my first Sunday buffet experience. The food was excellent , the spread comprehensive. The place was crowded without being overwhelming. A big thumbs up!!
