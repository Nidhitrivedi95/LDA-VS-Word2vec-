vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Spending a lot of my life in New Delhi, iam no stranger to punjabi cuisine which is one of my favorite north Indian cuisines. One of my favorite thing about this cuisine is its prevalance.. you would find little mom and pop stores selling freshly  made breads and piping hot sabzi for dirt cheap prices, scattered like crazy.

Also, having spent considerable time in various parts of USA including New Jersey and New York I have come to expect specifics from any given Indian restaurant in USA or Canada. But I was pleasantly surprised in this case.

I walked in to Pushap just because it was close to where i stayed in Montreal. The appearances are unassuming and the staff were really really busy.

The food was striking in its simplicity and authenticity. It brought back memories of all the good times I had enjoying authentic punjabi food from road side dhabas of India. The flavors were just right with no excessive masalas thrown in and the breads were freshly baked/ fried.


I ended up paying 15 bucks for a truck load of food 2 of us ate.
