uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA I came here at 11:50 am and stayed here till 12:50 pm. This place is dead for buffet.  I came with teammates . I stayed here for  hr but all I show 7 ppls including 3 of us. Staff stay inside most time. I have to wait 20-30 m to get naans. I asked about naan. Then lady bring that with in minute. I doubt about food freshness. 
 Not recommended for buffet. Not sure about dinner :(

Please careful about bill as well. They said buy one and get other half. We were 3 people and my bill was 29.21 Inc tax. Their  buffet charge is 8.99 per person . 

I asked lady about charge , She said, I should mentioned her about it if I want to get bill like that or not. 

Advertising something and charging something !!! 

Crazy ethics!!!!
