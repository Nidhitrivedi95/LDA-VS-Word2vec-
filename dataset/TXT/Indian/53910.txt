VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ I have been going to Guru Palace since they opened about 6 years or so ago.  I have been to all the Indian restaurants in the valley and I have to say every time I try out a new one I think why didn't I just go to Guru in the first place! They are consistently good, the food is fresh and the service is great.
