0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw My husband and I had excellent service and food on a Friday night. We were greeted and seated in a timely manner and the owner spoke with us - was very attentive and explained some dishes and customs with us. We received excellent garlic Naan and the cilantro jalepeno sauce was wonderful. We recommend the shrimp masala and lamb korba. Samosa appetizer is a must. We were offered a dessert and promised if we didn't like it, another dessert of our liking would be brought out. We were also brought Chai tea after the meal that was delicious. Big thumbs up for food and service. The restaurant offered the quiet informal ambience we were looking for away from our toddlers - but still a lovely enough place that did not feel likeI a fast food or strip mall establishment...far from! The pricing was also very fair. We will be back.
