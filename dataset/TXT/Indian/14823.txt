cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA I have always been a fan of the place, even before it was on Bay Street. Recently paid a visit was in the hope to try its lunch buffet, but found out it was cancelled at the moment due to some technical issues. 

We went for the 3-course lunch menu for $9.95/person. Super super decent portion for the price we paid, and the rice is always amazingly good. Staff is friendly and we got naan for free even. Definitely one of my top choices for fusion-Indian food :)
