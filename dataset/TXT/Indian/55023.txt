Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Long story short, check your receipt and get an itemized copy if you can.

Something strange has happened in the last few months, the prices have all increased 2-3$ each and it's not reflected on the menu. My aunt picked up our order and the man at the register told her it was going to be $92. For 5 entrees, 3 rice and 3 orders of plain naan. When she asked for a receipt he said something along the lines of "Ok, ok, 85 then.", but refused to give her an itemized receipt. I called when she got home and asked for an itemized receipt and he was very abrupt, bordering on rude. When I showed up he had an itemized ticket written out very neatly, not the original scribbly ticket that was waved at my aunt. I'm really disappointed. I'll wait a few months and go back and maybe things will be better/more consistent by then.

(Also we were given and charged for 4 orders of rice when I ordered only 3. Wouldn't be a big deal except the rice is 3.5$ each. And I only wanted 3.)
