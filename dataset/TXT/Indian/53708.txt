ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA This place has just opened recently so we thought we would try it out and we were not disappointed! The food was on point, I was very happy with my lamb saag. We had great service and the owners were very nice and approachable. Will be back as soon as they get their alcohol license!
