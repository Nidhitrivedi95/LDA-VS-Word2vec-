O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Best Indian Chicken Vindaloo that I've had in a long time! Got it medium spicy and it was so good - better than my homemade curry! One of these days I'd like to come for the lunch buffet which is available 6 days a week. The service was excellent & the owner is kind & gracious. Been coming here for 8 years & food has been consistently good. Highly recommended!
