o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw A friend and I just happen to be referred to this undiscovered gem in North Phoenix.  I will have to say pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and spicy the food was.  Was expecting the normal when it comes to Indian food for Phoenix.  I will say, this has to be by far the best Indian food I have eaten in all of the Phoenix metro area.
