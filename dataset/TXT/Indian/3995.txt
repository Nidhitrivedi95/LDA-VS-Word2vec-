112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA My friend talked up Chutney Rolls for days since we had a trip planned out that way later in the week, needless to say I was so excited when the day came to go there for lunch.  As we walked up we noticed the windows looked dark, and there was a closed sign in the window.  We were sooooo bummed!!  The sign said they were closed for staff training and because they were making some changes.  We pressed our noses the window, suddenly Drew appeared and as we told him about our journey there and our disappointment he invited us in and told us he would whip something up for us.  He was soooo accommodating, set us up our own little table, made us some DELICIOUS wraps, made us more bread since we became obsessed with how delicious it was, and put on some jams.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, the experience, and the food.  So glad Drew was nice enough to go out of his way to make our day!
