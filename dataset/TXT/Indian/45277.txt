S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA I've come here with my Scottish friends a few times. They say that the Indian food is better in Scotland than it in the U.S. and they really like this place so that's saying something. Also you know the Indian food is good when you see a lot of Indian people eating there and there were a lot today. The food is amazing and the service is great. I just tried their lunch buffet and I am about to go in a food coma now..... :)
