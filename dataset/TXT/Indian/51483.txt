I came to Mint Indian Bistro today for the first time since I am staying in Las Vegas. We were seated quickly and got our food. The nan came after some time though. The reason this is 4 stars and not 4 is because there wasn't much variety for someone like me being a vegetarian and not likening very spicy food. But overall excellent food and I would recommend the paneer tikka masala. That was not extremely spicy but still very good.
