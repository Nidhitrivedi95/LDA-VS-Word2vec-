x1GM1mzeDx4ARUGKV8n98Q Great hidden gem in Cave Creek.  Great fry bread, great mexican food. From the outside, you would never think there is a eating establishment here.  It is in the back of a gift shop.  You order your food at the counter and the tables are located behind the kitchen area.   It is a quirky place but it definitely fits right in with the town of Cave Creek.
