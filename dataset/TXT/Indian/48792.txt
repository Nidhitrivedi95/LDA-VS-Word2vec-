TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA This is a review for the takeout experience. I have always had generally positive dining experiences here, with the food being very good. They are super slow, however, so if you are trying to get out in a reasonable amount of time, do go elsewhere.

I was told that my takeout order would be ready in 30 minutes, but when I arrived at 30 they told me another 15 minutes. I found this to be unacceptable, and it appeared to me that there were several others who were also in the same situation. They need to get their act together with regards to seating and timely take-out orders.
