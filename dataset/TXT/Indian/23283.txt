gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Just one word- disaster. Interior totally hideous.. They don't know what an appetizer is. So basically we unfortunately ordered the vegetarian momos which like tasted really bad. As soon I finished taking the first bite I get the main course. The server didn't let us eat and was pushing plates on our table to make room for main course. Now for the main course we ordered malai kofta (which was with minimal gravy and some koftas that were totally stale and tasted really bad) and paneer tikka ( which was equally pathetic). Save your money for something better. Stay away
