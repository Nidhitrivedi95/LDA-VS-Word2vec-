ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg I came here for pani puri (5.99) earlier tonight at 9PM and this is what I got. Definitely not the best. You're better off with street pani puri for sure! Previously I've had bhel puri from here before which was quite good so I'm hoping today was just a bad night (it was the very end of Eid, which is probably one of the busiest nights of the year)
