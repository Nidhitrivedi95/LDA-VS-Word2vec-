PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q It's not that India Garden is actively bad, but there is not much to recommend it either. The food is your typical Americanized grub, the Indian equivalent of "Chinese Takeout."

The service is pretty unfriendly. The waiter mumbled unintelligibly over the blaring music; then, he looked impatient and put out when I asked him to repeat what he said. No one from the waitstaff looked like he wanted to be there.

The only highlight was that the vegetarian and some of the chicken dishes are "half off" after 10pm. My order of chicken saag at $5.50 probably does qualify as a bargain, but the watery saag and the stingy bits of chicken make the regular price kind of a rip off. So after normalizing for the overpriced menu, I consider the discount to be more like 20%. 

Conclusion: there are better options unless you are trapped in Oakland past 10pm and starving.
