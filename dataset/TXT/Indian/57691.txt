yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I am by no means an expert on India cuisine. My experience is limited to dozens of buffets and a single non-buffet experience a friend took me to in Manhattan. While that was good, this was awe-inspiring.

The Dhaba is NOT a buffet restaurant. They serve fresh Punjabi food and have an extensive menu. But not at lunch during the week. Their innovative approach is to rotate through the best items on their menu each week. We ate their on a Thursday. We skipped the two vegetarian entrees and went straight for the chicken and lamb. Both were melt-in-your-mouth outstanding. Both were spiced for flavor, not simply heat. I'm a huge fan of hot food, but it wasn't until driving out of the parking lot that I realized how not-hot the food had been. Amazing.

We had the Mur Lasuni Tikka (chicken) and the Kali Marichi Ka Gosht (lamb). Served family style, with fantastic madras lentils (they probably call it something different), yogurt sauce (taziki?) , naan that perfectly complimented the meal instead of overpowering it, and a lovely salad with a mango-and-lots-of-other-good-stuff dressing.

The lovely lady there took the time to explain everything to us and made the experience that much better. And since they rotate the lunch menu every day during the week -- full menu on the weekends and for dinner -- I have good reason to return at least four more times this month!
