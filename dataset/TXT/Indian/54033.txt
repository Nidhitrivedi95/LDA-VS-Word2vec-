vrAZ6qenlYwHfgzSSlmkiQ I found this place on yelp. Decided to try it and was not disappointed. Everything was so delicious and fresh. When we first went in it was pretty quiet but it got busier as we finished up. I was very surprised with our bill! $35 for two people, all you can eat and we each got a pop as well. Such a great deal and I will definitely revisit.
