VqJXm1NjJFYTNKtNp-h_DA I have been here twice and that's only because I live in the east end. They have the best doubles in town by far. I came during lunch on my last visit and there were a few people ahead of me but I still got my doubles very quickly. They are very nice and they also sell tickets for different fêtes and parties. If you have a large order definitely call ahead. This place is hectic on a weekend and the parking lot is madness so plan accordingly. Definitely worth a trip. I'm already salivating thinking about doubles
