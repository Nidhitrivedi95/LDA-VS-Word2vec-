NHDdAZJqS3cf_K6HYxoQ9w Excellent Indian cuisine served up in a nondescript converted house off the main strips on Ile Perrot.  Like many restaurants of this type or category, you aren't going here for seductive ambiance, but rather the food (confirmed by the fact it does a brisk takeout business, at a 10% discount, to boot).  The menu is expansive but the offerings are all fairly unique in terms of seasoning, type to type - curries will be distinct from vindaloos which will be distinct from kormas, which is how it should be - and they will adjust the heat/spice level on any given dish to your preference.

Be sure to give their mulligatawny soup, channa somosa, and chicken tikka a try, as all are standouts and very good values for what you get.  I haven't really had a dud dish yet, so couple that with the overall affordable prices and quality of ingredients used, and that merits full marks in my book.
