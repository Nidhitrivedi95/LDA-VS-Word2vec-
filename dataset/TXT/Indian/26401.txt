I have also been for lunch and love their menu.  It isn't a buffet that is often found at Indian restaurants, which I do like.  However, here you are able to choose your protein and choose your sauce to create your own dish.  It comes out in a big bowl so for around $10, it's quite a deal.

This is the place I go to when I want a quiet bar to sit at and just enjoy a delicious meal by myself or one other friend.
