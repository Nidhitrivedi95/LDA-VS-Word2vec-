Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw After realizing that Banjara didn't have a buffet anymore (and outrageously priced a la carte), we went to Chef of India as we were both craving Indian Food.

I believe the price is $11.99.  They had a very good selection between curry meats, salads and desserts.  I especially liked their tandoori chicken.  It was great.  

Verdict: My new go-to Indian buffet in the Yonge/Eg area.
