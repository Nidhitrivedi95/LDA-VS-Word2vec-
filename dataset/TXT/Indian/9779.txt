9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw We went here for lunch and their buffet spread was delicious! They have a good selection of vegetarian dishes and a few meat dishes. I was hoping they would have some seafood, like fish stew or shrimp curry, but they did not. I tried almost all of the food they had at the buffet that day and they're very good. I've eaten authentic Indian food before from friends, and in restaurants when we travelled to other countries. I have certain expectations when eating Indian cuisine, but this place is really good, so I would come back. The restaurant is quite spacious and because it was lunch, not very crowded--which I prefer. The only thing I did not like was the iced tea that I ordered--it did not taste good at all. Otherwise, the buffet spread was really enjoyable.
