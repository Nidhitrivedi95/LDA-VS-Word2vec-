jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Best Mediterranean restraunt I have ever been to! I got the chicken shawarma, fries, gyro, and the lox and all was amazing especially their dipping sauce. The only bad thing I'd have to say about this restaurant is they are really busy but still manage to get the job done. Today they have earned themselves a life long customer.
