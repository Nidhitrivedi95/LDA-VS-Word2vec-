gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA This was my first time trying Indian food, and wow I'm impressed how this fast food Indian restaurant is surprisingly good! I have so many great things to say about this place. First off, the service is excellent! The cashier was kind enough to let my boyfriend & I try the sauces out since it was our first time ordering Indian food. I had no clue what to order, so she recommended the Chicken Tikka Masala w/ the Garlic Naan. I also tried the Vegetable Samosa.. So tasty & flavorful. This place is amazing and will not disappoint! I most definitely will be returning very soon! :)
