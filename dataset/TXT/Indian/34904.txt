Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I had lunch buffet with my family. The food here is real good and everyone of us liked it. It has a great ambience and is really good for large groups too. Also since it's located on the strip, it's a nice place to have lunch after walking down the strip for few miles. I also took the advantage of Yelp checkin, which got me 10% off on my bill.
