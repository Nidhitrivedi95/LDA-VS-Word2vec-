yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I love Indian food and I have tried a lot of Indian restaurants in Arizona, but this place is by far the best.  I've been here for dinner and they also have great lunch specials.  I had the Kashmiri chicken tikka masala with a spicy level of 7.  It was amazing.  Everything is fresh and has a great authentic taste.  I also got salad, garlic naan, basmati rice, lentil soup, and rice pudding.  The host and server were great and the atmosphere was pleasant.  I will definitely be back.
