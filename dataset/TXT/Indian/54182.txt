vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw Good food, Good ambience, Horrible service, rather expensive.
Waited literally 45 minutes for drinks to come, when we reminded waiter he apologised that he had forgotten, finally got drinks near end of meal. 
Rude staff.
Dirty cutlery, had to ask for a new fork because of baked on food.

Butter chicken was very sweet, but still quite delicious.
The fennel mango lassi has no taste of fennel.
