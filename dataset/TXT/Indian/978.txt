-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw The food is great but the staff lacks cleaning standers and the place over all needs some cleaning. The bathroom was really dirty and you can see dry urine on the toilet seat. I saw one of the ladies cleaning it before i left but she went straight to the kitchen and started preparing food without washing her hands. But like i said, the food is really delicious and the only problem is how dirty it is.
