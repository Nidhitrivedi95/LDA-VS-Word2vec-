9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w I love this place! Their shrimp curry is delicious. The sauce is flavourful and full of vegetables, and the shrimp itself is perfectly cooked. The naan is great too, and you get a few big pieces with every meal. Can't wait to go again and try some of their vegetarian options.
