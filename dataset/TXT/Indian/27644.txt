Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg The best indian food that I've had in the United States, truly. Large portion sizes, and very authentic. Service was phenomenal. I had the lamb curry and it was so tender - not oily at all. Highly recommend the chili garlic naan. The chef is so talented and attentive and made it a point to come greet each guest dining on a Friday night. We will be back!
