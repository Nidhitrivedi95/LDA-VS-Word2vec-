DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg When I fly into or out of Sky Harbor, I never miss the opportunity to eat at Udupi's. Just ten minutes down the road from the airport, I always look forward to the scrumptious Indian food on tap here. 

I have no idea what anything is called, but they have these HUGE pancake-type things that are wrapped around this crazy-good potato stuff, and may daughters go crazy for them. I have to sneak a bite when they're getting something from the buffet. And speaking of the buffet, everything is vegetarian, with vegan offerings clearly marked (even the sauces/dressings). 

Be warned, some of the dishes are weld-level spicy, while others are very mild, and most things somewhere in between. My advice is: take a very small sampling of everything and go back for more of your favorites. Oh, and come hungry - there's no way you will have room for dessert.
