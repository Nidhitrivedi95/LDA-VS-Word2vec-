c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg My husband grew up in Kerala, so we're always lookin' to score some tasty South Indian bites. We found Karaikudi online and made the voyage based upon the promise of nandu masala (crab curry), one of our favorites. When we arrived, we found the restaurant to be actually quite far on the outskirts of Toronto. It is in kind of a weird, largely unoccupied shopping complex. When you go inside, you find that it feels a lot like a traditional South Indian restaurant. The buffet had lots of South Indian morsels, so we decided against the nandu masala that we'd planned on. Instead, we had chai, veda with sambar, Chicken 65, avial, shrimp fry, really nice dosa, payasam and several other curries. The service was inconsistent. The food was okay. I'll agree with Ray that it was solid. We just keep looking for South Indian food that is better than the foods we make at home, or that my mother-in-law prepares. The quest continues. At $9.99 per buffet, this was a lot of food for lunch. With a buffet waiting for diners, it is a shame that you must make multiple requests for dosa (served fresh, not on the buffet), water, and chai. Not sure what keeps the waiters so busy with the buffet going on. The dosa were really good and actually better than those served at Udupi Palace on Gerrard.
