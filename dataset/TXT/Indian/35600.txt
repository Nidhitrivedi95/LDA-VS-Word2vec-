N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg My boss was really wary of my choice of a place to eat after my last two choices, when I was travelling with him in Dallas, were a total bust. And I chose those based on yelp reviews. So when I chose this again based on yelp, he decided we eat at the falafel joint in the food court. The food there was not nice. I however wanted to give curry pot a go so I came back later in the evening. I was pleasantly surprised to find really good pav bhaaji. It was authentic. The chat masala in the salad , butter melting in the bhaji and salted butter for the buns. This guy knew what he was doing. I can just say this, when in Dallas don't trust yelp since Dallas yelpers don't know what they are saying but other than that yelp has not failed me. This is a 4.5 star for taste. Esp for pav bhaaji since that's the dish I had. Portion size was good.
