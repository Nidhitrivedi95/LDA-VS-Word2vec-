UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ What wonderful Indian food. I ordered the butter chicken at a medium heat and garlic naan and it comes with a side of mixed rice. The sauce was a deep red color and you could taste the spice the heat could have cranked it up a bit more and the chicken was tender. The garlic naan was lightly buttered and the garlic was tasty without destroying your mouth or those around you. This will be a regular lunch spot. It is a little pricy but it is really enough for two meals.
