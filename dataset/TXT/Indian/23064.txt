gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Went to Mt Everest again last week and noticed that some items were changed, so I'm not sure if they have different items each day or not. No goat curry, bummer!!! Anyway, the food were not as good as the last time I tried it. I mean, it's not bad, it's just not as good to be rated 5 stars. Anyway, last week experience deserved only 3 star, so I kinda averaged it out to be 4 star.
