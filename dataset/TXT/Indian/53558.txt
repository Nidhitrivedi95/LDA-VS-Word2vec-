vFnzV9uy9nEXFQgkSuv_AQ I agree with the other reviewers here on yelp.   Food is good quality but not very spicy so it's OK for a lunch buffet.   Very clean dining room and bathrooms.  Service is fine as far as a lunch buffet goes.  The iced tea was better here than other ethnic restaurants, it had a hint cardamom or cinnamon that was interesting.
