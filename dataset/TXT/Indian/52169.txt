UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA In looking at the reviews on Mint; I had my expectations set very high when walking into this small resturant. They were quite busy when we arrived after 8pm on a Saturday night, but the wait wasn't too long, though there wasn't a place to sit down inside (it was a cold night in Vegas). You'll see that I frequent Indian restaurants fairly regularly wherever I travel, so I know what I like and how it compares to other establishments. 

My family and I decided to go with the Chef's Northern India tasting menu and were given a plethora of different dishes, though with smaller than normal portions. We all enjoyed the pakora (they called them pakodas) and again thought we were in for the best Indian meal in a long time. That being said, the lamb vindaloo was rather skimpy on the lamb (and it was tougher than it should have been), the chicken tikka masala had great flavor; but was more masala than chicken, and the daal was good, but just a tad undercooked. I was also disappointed when I asked for a "6-7 spicy" I received something more like a 2 or 3. They do have something they call Inferno chili sauce, but I thought my dishes came from a very universal pot that's geared to less spice (and flavor). As other reviewers have noted, their naan bread is excellent. Service was satisfactory, but I never felt like I was being "served" meaning it was more obligatory than driven. 

All in all, a good Indian meal, though I have had better for less money.
