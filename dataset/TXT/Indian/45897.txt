sJ0MYSAIVK28cMzh-s-NPA Went here for a quick lunch. The presentation of the food was amazing and the food itself was great. Service could be stepped up a notch, though it is an express/fast food restaurant the people behind the counter could use a little more training. The prices were not bad, $10 for a combo type meal including a main, rice and salad. A meal for two came to $27 with taxes in and two drinks. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quick Indian fix. Flavours were on point and the food tasted fresh enough.
