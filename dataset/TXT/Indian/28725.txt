The dishes they serve are NOT the rich and oily ones that is very common in Indian restaurants in US. The dishes are also very reasonably priced. They have a menu book which includes pictures of the dishes that could help those who are not familiar with these dishes.
We liked their chaats, samosa, chole batura, poori, pulav (in mini thali) etc.
One thing they could improve upon is the the way they packed Sev Dahi Chaat, it had the yogurt already mixed in, which made it a little soggy by the time it was home. They could instead pack the liquids separately.
Seems like a family run place, with experienced women in the kitchen cooking the way they cook at home. Most of the poor reviews of this place seems to be from the initial days (they launched around 3 months back), I guess they have now got their act together. I had not been there during the early days.
