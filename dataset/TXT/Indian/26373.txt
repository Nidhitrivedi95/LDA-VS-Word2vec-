ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Who knew I would like Indian food so much.  I am usually adventurous in trying new cuisines but have stayed away from Indian for some reason.  Tonight's experiment with Copper during Restaurant Week made me fall in love with the flavors.

First off we started off with Naan and 3 sauces.  Who needs sauce when the naan was delicious on its own?  But the chutney, yogurt and fruit sauces all were flavorful.

For the first course everyone at my table ordered the Tamarind-Curry Leaf Prawns.  It came with 4 tasty prawns spiced just right and a cucumber roll.  Yummmm.

For the 2nd course, I ordered the Thecha Rubbed Tawa Chicken Thigh which started out a little spicy but my mouth got used to it.  The chicken was very tender and the sauce was addicting!  The vegetable medley that came with was quite tasty as well.  The other two people dining with me ordered the Seafood "MelJol" which they said was excellent.

The dessert selection was different than what was described on the Restaurant week website.  It was light and with a puddling-like texture with a fruit drizzle but I forget the name.  Our waiter described it as "like Cream of Wheat".  To me, that's comfort food.  It was light and amazing.

Service was excellent.  Someone was always around taking plates, refilling drinks or replacing silverware.

This is definitely some place I need to come back to try their regular menu.
