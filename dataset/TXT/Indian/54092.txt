VrftSduLIducNfEzITOL5A Just ordered off of just eat and it was terrible. The butter chicken tastes like they threw a can of cream of tomato soup on processed chicken pieces. You were lucky if you could find a piece in the dish full of liquid. The only thing that was ok was the tandoori chicken and the plain basmati rice. The naan was really dry. I have a ton left over, normally it is the first to go in my house. The vegetable dishes were flavourless mush. I will never order from them again. Pretty disappointed after spending $80
