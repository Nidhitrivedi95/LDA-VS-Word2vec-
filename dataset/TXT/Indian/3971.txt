0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Had been to Kohinoor with my friends today. Savored a sumptuous vegetarian buffet. The samosas and pakodas had authentic Indian essence. Enjoyed the crispy butter naan and paneer butter masala made in pure ghee. The owner got to know it was my birthday treat and he gave me a box full of sweets as complimentary :) Awesome buffet at economical price.
