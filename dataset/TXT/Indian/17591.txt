DxbdfvNYPCyiLJDDPJK3Tg I was hesitant given some reviews but I still gave it a try since it's close to home.

If you are picky and care about decor, then follow everyone else's review - plastic table clothes and plants. But if you're like me and can lool past that, then what a gem for food. 

Yes, there are some items that are not the best but overall, thus place gives generous portions and the food is great.

4 stars from me
