Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg My girlfriend and I went to Trimurti after walking up and down queen street looking for something good to eat for lunch (we couldn't decide so we settled on the closest Indian restaurant). 
They were offering a 13 dollar lunch buffet. I am often skeptical about buffets however, the food was well made, fresh and authentic. They offered many different types of curry, butter chicken, nan, and other typical Indian dishes. 
Overall the deliciousness of the food exceeded the 13 dollars for lunch. Very delicious and I would likely return.
