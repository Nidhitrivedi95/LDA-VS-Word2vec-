-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw I enjoyed Thali for exactly what it is - good, fast and affordable Indian cuisine. It's not an impressive restaurant but the selection is quite good and you simply can't beat the amount of food you get for the price. The meat Thali (2 meat dishes, 1 veg dish, rice, salad & naan) is really good - enough food for two meals for me. And at t $9, it's a perfect way to get a big selection of food at a small price.

I would, however, prefer that they use boneless meats in their dishes but I wasn't surprised that they didn't - that is usually  big factor in the pricing of Indian dishes. 

They also have a great selection of appetizers at $1 - $3 a pop.. I will definitely stop by for a good snack in the near future.

All in all, a great find in Montreal.
