MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ I have been twice. The first time was during their pre-grand opening and the food was good. I went back again last week. The food was fantastic. I eat home cooked indian vegetarian food couple times a week so I'm picky. The vegi dishes were twice as good as any other indian place in AZ. The price is higher, but reasonable for the location. The roti and naan is also very good.
