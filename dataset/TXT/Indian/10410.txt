I noticed many of the menu items listed were actually things that were prepared by contestants on the Indian version of the show 'Master Chef', such as the pani puri, etc. Tried the lamb chops which was good.  I guess they are relying a bit too much on the name to carry this place, but maybe it will improve over time to merit being top class.
