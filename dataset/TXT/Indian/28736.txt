Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ I have to appreciate that lunch goes until 4 p.m. . The food was okay and the quantity is plentiful. The quality, on the other hand, was just ok. Fish is fishy tasting... Shrimp is over breaded... Service it too laid back. The tables are never completely clean. Soy sauce always has an imprint.  What I totally love is the fish pakora! The sauce that comes with it is my favourite from any other Hakka restaurant! All lunch specials come with bottled water and a spring roll. They have a huge selection also.
