ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ Under new management. Absolutely delicious. Reminds me of my favorite, Udipi Cafe in Columbus, Ohio. Fried foods are not greasy, good spice, great selection. Helpful service. I can't wait to try the lunch buffet.  11-230.

UPDATE: Have been back many times- food is delightful!  And just found out from owners that they will be offering a DINNER BUFFET starting 10/16!!! Try Curry Bowl!!!
