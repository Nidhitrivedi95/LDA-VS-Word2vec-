AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ Service: (4 stars)
- Friendly
- refilled water multiple times
- a bit on the slow side 

Atmosphere (4 stars):
- Looks very fancy
- We were there on a Thursday night and the place was pretty empty.
- They were placing EDM music 

Food: (3 stars)
- We got stuffed mushrooms appetizer (4 stars) - taste 5 stars, but for 11$ I expected more than 5 very small mushrooms
- Mansoon Basket (5 stars) - really good and tasty.  Decent size for the price.
- Lamb chops (2 stars): for $28 getting only 2 was a bit overpriced
- Butter Chicken (4 stars) - a bit on the smaller size. It comes with pappadums (but it tasted stale)
- Drinks (2 stars) ($9 a drink, for a small wine, or tap beer)

The total for 4 people, 4 entries, 2 appetizers and 4 drinks each was $186 (including tax and tip).  


In my opinion, the cost is not worth it.  If you get living social deal it becomes decent, but I definitely would not go there and pay full price.
