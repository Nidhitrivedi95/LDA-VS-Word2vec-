aTRnnM41SxIV-u4rUwceOg My goal this year was to find the best kothu roti joint in Scarborough/Markham. I had heard great things about Gasa so I decided to try it out. I had to wait over 25 minutes for my food and I was not provided an explanation. In addition to the poor customer service, I had a horrible experience with the food here. The roti tasted very stale and the curry was abysmal. The next day, I was sick to the point that I had to go to my family doctor who said I had food poisoning. Two thumbs DOWN, Gasa.
