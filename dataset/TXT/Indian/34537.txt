Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Over all good food right price however pathetic service & attitude of the staff including manager there it took 45 min for a order to come on weekday and tht too it wasn't complete until we completed the entire dinner they didn't bring the raita / chutney we ordered and they tried to sneak in the 2 items in the bill. Won't recommend due to service and attitude issue.
