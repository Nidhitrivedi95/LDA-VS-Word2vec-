rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ We tried this place tonight on a whim and unfortunately ended up walking out after 10-15 minutes.  

Staff barely spoke and instead handed us a menu. No one bothered to communicate that we had to find our own seat.

After we decided what to order, we were then informed it that would take 45 minutes to prepare and serve the food.  Why should it take so long when there were barely any customers in the dining area at 7:30pm on a Friday evening?

Staff did not seem to be knowledgeable concerning food allergies, which could be potentially life threatening to my child who has a nut and shellfish allergy.

My wife and I finally decided to take our business elsewhere!
