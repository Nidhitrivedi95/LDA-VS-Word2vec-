f6sfdqS4WAwaD9zzTADEuw Terrible experience. We have ordered shrimp roti and was served some shrimps that was anything but fresh. We sent it back and they gave us some fresh ones. The food was excessively salty. The service was horrible as well...took forever to get the food, in spite of the restaurant being empty. Lastly, we were going to pay with a credit card and found out that they only take cash or debit card. We will never return.
