zvtkeghW0Px5HY9QkJ4INw Hit and miss here. Chicken biryani is $4.99 (tax included) and is a big square box filled with fluffy biryani and two pieces of chicken. Butter chicken is $7.99 or something, and it also comes in a big square box. Half of it is a minimalistic green salad (kinda sad looking, actually), and not even very full at that, and the other half the box is filled with rice covered in butter chicken. About 10-12 chicken chunks, but not very big ones. Think skewer pieces of chicken. Yeah. The butter chicken was oddly sweet and didn't taste like most of the butter chickens I've had. I would liken their butter chicken to the sweet and sour chicken balls that people say are authentic Chinese food. Not. I'd definitely go back for the biryani. I wouldn't go back for the butter chicken.
