ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I love love love this place , my husband is not really In to Indian food but he always eats everything up from this place. We originally found it on groupon , the first time we went it seemed  very slow (for dinner) but this last time it seemed steady. They have a great wine selection we ended up ordering two bottles. Also the food is amazing. Best Indian I've had in Vegas. I love the large selection of naan bread! The servers are great and professional, I can not wait to go back!
