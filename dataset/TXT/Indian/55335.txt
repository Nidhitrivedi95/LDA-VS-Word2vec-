x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA Went to Punjab Palace this evening. The waiter brings me an empty plate upon which I find a piece of hair. I return it to him and as I'm handing it over, I see a frickin cockroach hanging out in between the plates he was holding. I yell out "omg is that a cockroach" and he looks at it and says "yes" like it was nothing. I die. and then I left.
