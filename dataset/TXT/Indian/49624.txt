tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I have now been to India Oven at least 6 times, all for the dinner buffet.  Each and every time the food has been fresh, hot and extremely good. It is hard to beat a dinner buffet that also includes fresh naan and tandoori chicken. In fact my PICKY 5 year old can eat the chicken tikka every day and be extremely happy.

The only problem with putting up a good review here is that we like it being a hidden gem....we don't want to have to fight off the crowds!
