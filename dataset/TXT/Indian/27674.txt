IpuLXGV2iSsQhejPIM3NQA I went to Bombay Bakers to try their chaat papri and I have to say I was very impressed with the food. The price is very reasonable and the food was really good as well. The location is a cute little location with plenty of sitting space. They also offer eggless cupcakes and pastries for a great price!
