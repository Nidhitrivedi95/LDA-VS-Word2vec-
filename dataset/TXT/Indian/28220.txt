iZtv9s9lBA6DviQ2Mbm-SA (3.5) Wow, after reading the other reviews -- I feel like I went to completely different place last night. 

The staff was really friendly and service was quick: every time we got up to get more food, someone would come to clear away our dirty plates and refill our water cups.

I thought $11.95 for a weekend dinner buffet was rather affordable. I was coming here with low expectations (based on the other reviews), but I had a coupon, so I wanted to try it out.

The food was actually pretty good. I have been to several other Indian buffets and this one was one of the better. Buffets are not really great to begin with -- I always prefer a la carte -- but I really enjoyed my meal here at Mumbai Sapphire.

There was a good selection of food, healthy portions of chicken in the meat dishes, and lots of vegetarian options. The place was empty, only 1 other couple was eating in there, but that's ok -- I am sure this place is more busy during the work week. 

I will definitely come here again: good price, decent food and friendly staff.
