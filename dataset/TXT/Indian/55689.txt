x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Did not even get to a table, despite having called an hour before and asked for a table for 7 at 7! The female on the phone told me that they were not taking any more reservations but for us to come on in and they would seat us.
Upon arrival there was no greeting from any of the staff. I walked up to the person who seemed in charge and had to get his attention as he was more involved with another (yawning) employee.
I won't go into any further details but I see the common thread about poor service in all the reviews! I concur.
