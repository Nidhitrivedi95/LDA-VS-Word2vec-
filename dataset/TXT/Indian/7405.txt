Lo and behold, about two weeks ago they finally opened.  When I saw that it had opened, I was super excited.

I've had the exact same thing both times I've been here.  The non-veg Thali which comes with your choice of 2 meats, chickpeas, rice and naan bread.  Each time I've had butter chicken and lamb meatballs as my 2 meats.  

The butter chicken is delicious and there is a nice spice to the lamb.  Chickpeas, rice and naan are all of your standard quality and fresh.   Overall, I think this is a solid lunch place for the working folk around the area though it is slightly pricey at $9.99 for the non-veg Thali.  Ah well, I'll still be back.
