TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Well, what can I say...we went to our favorite Indian restaurant again today. First time enjoying Indian food in this new year. I had my chicken biryani and my girl had chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. Food was delicious like always. Even better customer service by our favorite waiter Gary. Wish I could give this place 10 stars. Amazing food and Awesome Vibes. Can't wait to go back with our friends. Keep up the great work Gary. Hands down the Best customer service.
