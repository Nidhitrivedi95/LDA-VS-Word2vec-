7U5-h997PyWX4B8uMk4Tcw We ordered few things for lunch today but were not impressed. The goat curry in the Thali special with 2 meat for $7.99 had gone bad, butter chicken was ok, the portion of the rice was very small, not sure what was the mint sauce for, the salad was not fresh, the naan was burned, portion was small for what you paid for. The rice of the Chicken biryani was ok, but for some reason they buried two small pieces of chicken at the bottom of the container, so you needed to eat most of the rice before you can get to the chicken and the chicken was not overly fresh as well. I was there around 12:15 for lunch, waited 15 mins for them to preheat the food , I was the only customer there, Half of the display was empty and the hot table was empty with only couple sauces in there, not sure if that was a good sign.
