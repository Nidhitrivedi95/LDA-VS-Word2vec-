K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g We landed in Phoenix and were surprised to learn that there was a restaurant that had Madras in its name. Furthermore it had really good reviews that only added to our hunger. So we decided to give this place a shot for our dinner!

We ordered sambar Vadai, masala dosa and chettinad Gobi masala dosa. None of the dishes lived up to the name Madras!!! The Vadai was really very hard and it seemed like it was made in the morning (at least we hope it wasn't any earlier than that). The dosas were a little sour and that is a clear no-no for anyone from madras. The service was slow because they were understaffed that day.
