7IF5cjvH1d97pzvYPnf9Mg Let me start by saying, the food here is excellent. I've eaten here a few times and the food has always been delicious. However, for the first time tonight I ordered takeout and the order for butter chicken w/ rice and naan bread was $22.50. I've eaten at other Indian cuisine restaurants around the city and I expect to pay around 15 or 16 dollars for good Indian food. But $22.50 is a little ridiculous I think.
