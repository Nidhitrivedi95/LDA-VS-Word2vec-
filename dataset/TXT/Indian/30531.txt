KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ We've been to this restaurant 7 or 8 times now and on all occasions the food was excellent. We've never gotten the buffet and always order off the menu. The tomato soup is the best I've ever had. You can tell everything is freshly prepared. I think they've worked out the initial kinks they had in the kitchen and with the service. The current wait staff is good. We've been to many Indian restaurants and the food at this one wins head and shoulders above the rest locally.
