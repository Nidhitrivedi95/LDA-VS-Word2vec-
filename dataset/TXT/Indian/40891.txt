PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA I was on strip with my fella and decided to grab a quick bite at the Riviera. I remembered they had a food court and recalled some positive reviews for India Masala. 

My expectations were low, but I persevered. I ordered the chicken tikka masala which came with rice and a side of naan.

The curry was decent. Not very spicy and more on the bland side than I would prefer, but still ok. The rice was dry and overcooked. It was clearly sitting around a while so I avoided it. The naan was my favorite part of the meal. It was overly oily, but delicious. We were tempted to order an extra one for dipping, but decided against it.

Decent for a food court and probably ten times better than the other food court options at the Riviera, but that isn't saying much.
