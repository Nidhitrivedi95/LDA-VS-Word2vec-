yLmZPpg57FRukoqlLZH_dQ I would've given a review of the food I ate at this place but sadly I never got around to it. 
Went to Jalsa on a Thursday night with my family and was VERY disappointed with the customer service of the place. We were the second party in line to be seated in a restaurant which was about 80% full but no one from the working staff came to ask us the number of people, tell us the wait time or if we were dinning in or taking food to-go. After about 20 minutes of waiting, not moving up in the waiting line and watching the two servers walking around with completely disregard of the costumers waiting, I decided to go and ask for a to-go menu so we could just get the food and leave. Upon asking for the menu and amount of time it would take to prepare 3 appetizers to-go, we were told that the wait will be about an hour. It was at this point where I had had enough and lost my patience to wait around and decided to go elsewhere. 
All in all a very very poor experience. 
I would recommend to go here during the time they don't have a lot of people in the restaurant or more staff working and please let me know how the food was. 
cheers
