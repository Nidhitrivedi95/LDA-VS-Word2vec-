KUf4XRy81XMJdY4Pjb27PQ I am very impressed with this place. I have been to India and the food here authentic and delicious. The Nepalese food is excellent. Try the fried dumplings. What an interesting mix of Chinese and Indian. Their masala chai is some of the best I've ever had. I had the Chicken Thupka and loved it. We ordered everything "Hot" spice level and it was just right. Try this place! Reasonably priced too!
