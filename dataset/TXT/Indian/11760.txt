aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q I was in Cleveland for business for almost 10 months. My work location was few blocks from the Colonial Market Place. As I travelled for only four days, I need one time a home style indian meal. The Indies is awesome. They are open for breakfast and lunch only. The owners are aged and they are nice to everyone. They have someone who can deliver the dinner meal to hotel, I paid little extra bucks for delivery charge. Trust me, it is much better service than Deliver ME food site. 

The samosas are very delicious. The food was great great.
Try break fast at this place. The omelete and paratha are awesome. If you like Aloo Paratha that is good too.
Great place, I wish they were open in the evening too.
