MWcN6qLWTfRJqLySxwJNqQ I absolutely love this place. I always wonder why it was always so empty because I think the food is very good. I've ordered take out here twice and every time I enjoyed my meal. First time I ordered Falafel, a Spicy Lamb Curry, and Garlic Naan. Second time I ordered Samosas, Spicy Bone-In Goat Biryani, and a Kefta Kabob. The main entrees had a good spicy kick, but it wasn't burning my tongue. The Falafel and the Samosas were very filling and would definitely recommend the Biryani if you like savory rice pilaf. Will come back when I'm craving Indian/Afghan food.
