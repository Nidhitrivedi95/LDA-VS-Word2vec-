TNRJvG_R1njEdid-UdCjBQ I recognized the Amaya name from their food court locations but was curious to try to this sit down version in my 'hood since decent Indian in the West end is hard to come by.

We arrived around 6:30pm-ish on a Friday night and were seated immediately.  Restaurant was pretty empty but filled up quickly within a half hour.

We ordered the cauliflower chaat ($7.95), two chicken dishes - butter and one other ($12.95 each), side of rice ($3.75), garlic naan ($3.25), raita ($2.95) and two glasses of pinot grigio ($8.95).  

Our cauliflower came out first and it was simply delish...I could have eaten just that as my main!  Our chicken dishes came next and I was impressed that there was a smouldering piece of charcoal in my butter chicken which the waiter told us was for flavour and quickly removed it.  Even though the chicken dishes were not indicated as spicy on the menu, I still detected a bit of heat, which we cooled down with the cucumber raita.  Main portions were big enough to split between two people if you want to load up on appetizers.  The garlic nana was super fresh, very light and flavourful. 

Service was attentive and they answered all our questions.  Definitely a welcome addition to the Junction 'hood.  I'm dreaming of the cauliflower and will be back!  I hope Leela is here to stay.
