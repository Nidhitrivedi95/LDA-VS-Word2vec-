The restaurant isn't the biggest and it has a really friendly, chilled out atmosphere with clean, neatly laid out tables.  The staff are all pleasant and they seem to take no time to get your food out the kitchen.
I had the Butter Chicken with boiled rice and a naan bread which cost only about £10.  It tasted amazing when it arrived and we all agreed that we'd come here again any day.
