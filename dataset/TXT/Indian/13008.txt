b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Gave this place a second chance and had a much better takeout experience. The food was excellent, and to my great surprise and pleasure, very spicy like I asked for.  I'm writing this like 2 months after the fact so I don't remember exactly what we had, but I had a lamb dish and my wife had a vegetarian dinner with 2 orders of naan.  Fast and friendly service and very tasty Indian food, so I'm happy to upgrade my original review.
