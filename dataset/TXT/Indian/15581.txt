cuxC5smoo7m8Z-nAGDWMaQ I went to the new location. While the place may be bigger, the attitude of the owner has not changed much. I don't know what it would take for this lady to smile. 

When I am out at a restaurant to eat, I am there not just for the food but also for the ambiance and customer service. I think it is too much to as for from these people. 

Restaurant business is customer facing and the owner does not have a customer centric attitude or personality. She is very cold and seems like has a chip on her shoulder. 

We have catered from this place in the past and we tip really well. A smile is the least you can ask for. 

As one of the yelpers mentioned, it may be a family business but it is still a business. 

As far as the food is concerned, I have noticed that most of the curries taste the same! And I am not exaggerating. We had one veg and non veg curry. Both tasted the same! 

They have a ton of dishes but if everything tastes the same, there is no point in having so many. 

I may go here for take out once in a while. But I will not dine in. 

I do not recommend this place.
