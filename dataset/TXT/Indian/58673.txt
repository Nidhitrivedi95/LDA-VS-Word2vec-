YNut5B1o3FDtcdzwf9F_bw Food tasted good, but highly priced. Very pathetic service. I have been to this place twice (dine in and take out), always had a feeling they are understaffed. They prove me right every time. Had tough time trying to call them over phone to place carry out order, almost tired 10 times and without any luck went in person to place order. They messed up my order, charged me for a chicken appetizer but I recvd veg appetizer. Manger apologized but it's still bad experience for me. As Restaurant is not only about food, but service matters a lot.Hope the management will take notice of this.
