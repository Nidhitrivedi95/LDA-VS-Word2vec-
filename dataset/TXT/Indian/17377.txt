DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Sangam is a great place for Indian food.  Service is very good, and the food is perfectly spiced to your taste.  They also have some of the best naan I have ever had - piping hot and freshly made every time. The Chicken Tikka Masala and Shrimp Korma are our favorite entrees - we want to branch out, but can't bring ourselves to get anything different!  They recently freshened up the dining room with new paint and pictures for an even nicer atmosphere.
