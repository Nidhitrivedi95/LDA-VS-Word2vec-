0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w Went to this place with my wife last Friday based on all the positive reviews that I read on Yelp. I have to agree with most Yelpers, this is definitely a gem of a place.

My wife had the Matar Paneer and I had one of the chicken dishes. Both of them were  very delicious and well prepared.

I'm only giving this place a 4 because we had to wait a few extra minutes for the waiter to get our orders. Otherwise I would have given this place a solid 5.
