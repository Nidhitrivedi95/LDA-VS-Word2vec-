li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ Imagine the pickiest eater in the world.. then times it by a million.  That's my boss and most times I'm afraid to even suggest a place to eat to him.  He took me to this underrated downtown gem and I was instantly hooked.

First of all, if you don't know Indian food that's OK... Simply ask one of the servers for a sample.  They will let you sample everything but the made-to-order black pepper shrimp.

My favorites are the chicken vindaloo and butter chicken.  You must order some rice and garlic na'an to have the full taste experience.  This is why you see some yelpers complain about the sauciness and/or lack of fulfillment with their meals.

The spicy chicken briyan (sp?) is quite good, but has that all spice taste to it that always rubs me the wrong way.

My cousins are half Pakistani and I have had excellent Indian food.  This place is not far behind, so give it a shot.  And again, don't be shy to ask for a sample!
