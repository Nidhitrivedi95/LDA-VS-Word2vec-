svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w It took months for me to finally go in and get some samosas from this place.  What kept me away? There's an indian restaurant up the street on Lansdowne that sells cheeseburgers and a dessert named, "burfi." I bought the burfi, ate the burfi, then barfed the burfi. If you're into syrupy cake balls then you should grab a burfi. 

Anyway, so SIDMR is good.  The food at this place is CHEAP and delicious... if you're into potatoes and curry.  I tried all of the samosas and the pakora.  Thumbs up!  I tried the chutney and didn't care for it tho.  I brought a friend in with me one time and it smelt sooo weird.  It smelled like they were boiling armadillo skins and diesel fuel back there but they were probably just cooking burfi. 

If you like samosas, you should at least try this place out!  If you like gagging then check out the other Indian restaurant that sells the burfis and get two.  Why two? Because you'll bite into the first one and spit it out immediately; but then you wont believe that it was actually THAT heinous and you'll talk yourself into trying a second one (different flavor).  I bought six different burfis that one time, all six were escorted to the dumpster where they were likely rejected by wildlife too.
