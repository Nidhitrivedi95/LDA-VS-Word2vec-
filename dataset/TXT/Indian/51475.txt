Slightly better than average Indian food.  And when you tell them spicy, believe me, they make it SPICY!  The staff is super friendly and the prices are a nice break from the typical overpriced Vegas food.  And this was probably the best meal I had during my stay in Vegas... and the cheapest... and no ditzy waitresses/waiters.  Woot.
