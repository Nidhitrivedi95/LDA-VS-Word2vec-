Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ Fantastic restaurant to enjoy lunch in the bustling neighborhood of Yorkville. The lunch special is ~$10 per person and comes with a small garden salad (basic mix of lettuce, some tomato and cucumber slices), long grain rice, naan (crispier and less doughy than I'm used to) and your choice of entree. When dining for two, all dishes except the mains are purposely provided to share. The salad was quite small and appeared to be the serving size for one; however, we were told that it was for sharing. It's unclear if you dined in for 1, if you'd receive the same portion size. In terms of the mains, the flavors were robust with just the right amount of spiciness. We were not asked what level of spiciness we preferred, so if you like something on the spicier scale, it's best that you speak up and request it. The chicken tikka masala was light on the cream, so the tomato base wasn't as heavy and overpowering as others that I've had. The lamb saag was very tender and seemed fairly light/refreshing for what usually is very thick and rich. We very much enjoyed all of the food, and after cleaning virtually all of the plates, were utterly stuffed!
