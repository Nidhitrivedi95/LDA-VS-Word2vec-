gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I have to update my review to once again say how amazing this place is! Everytime we come here the wait staff is always so nice and attentive. The food OMG the food! It's absolutely amazing. We ordered the chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and chicken Kadai. They were all amazing! They had the perfect blend of spices and the chicken was very tender. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!
