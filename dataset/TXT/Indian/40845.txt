PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g I went there two weeks ago with another couple who really like Indian food.  I had made reservations there as I had eaten there a few years ago and the food had been quite good.  Our most recent was a huge disappointment.  They now serve Canadianized Indian food that is extremely poorly executed.   We ordered Onion Bahjis for example and what we received was something that looked like Harvey's onion rings.  We had a veal vindaloo that I am sure was diced precooked square cubes of veal that had been the last minute tossed in a very odd spicy bbq sauce.  It was clear that none of the meat had been cooked in any of the sauces cuz the butter chicken was the same.  Blocks of boneless chicken tossed in the sauce in the last minute and served to the table - none of the lovely flavours that absorb when you actually cook the meat in a delicious sauce.  Not only was the meal bad overall, the meal was actually quite expensive.  My husband actually woke up two days after we went to the restaurant and said I can't believe how bad the food at  Kamasutra was - I still can't get over it.  I would never go back - there are way too many good restaurants in Toronto.
