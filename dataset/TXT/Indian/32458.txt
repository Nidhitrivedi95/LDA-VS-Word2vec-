LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw If I could give this place more than five stars I would! The market section has an incredible range of middle eastern goods from candies to halal meat and a frozen section. The restaurant is straight up amazing! It's not much to look at but the food is to die for and the people who work there are always so nice! I go here at least once a week to shop and pick up lamb curry with paneer and fresh naan. You have to try this place!
