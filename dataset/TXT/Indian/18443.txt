Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ For Indian food, this place does good things. The dishes are definitely a step above the buffet joints and closer in quality to what a standard Indian restaurant should be like.

My only real qualms with the place is the price-point to value ratio. Location, interior, food and quality doesn't seem to justify the prices. They're competing in the same space as Pukka in Toronto or Vij's in Vancouver, but they don't come close. 

It seems almost as if they're successful in bringing higher quality food to Toronto, but are a little carried away offering it at the same price point as higher end refined Indian food. 

They just need to turn it down a notch and they'll have the right formula. It is undeniably tasty food.
