jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Decided on Indian food today for lunch, all five of us got there at 11:40 and had no wait. I perused the menu and opted for the lunch buffet for $11.99. 

They had a wide variety and all the naan bread you can eat :-). I tried the tofu curry, vegetable curry, butter chicken and veggie spring rolls. I also tried some f the sauces with the spring roll. The basmati rice fried rice and white rice was very good. Love to soak up the excess curry with it and dip the garlic naan bread. 

The views from this second story restaurant are amazing as it overlooks the airport runways and excellent views of the strip. Could be a great place for a New Years party as you could see the entire show!

The lunch buffet was delicious and I will be back. After looking over the menu I might come for dinner as well so that I could try the chicken or shrimp vindaloo varieties.
