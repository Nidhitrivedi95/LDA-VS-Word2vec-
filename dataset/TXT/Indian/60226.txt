ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Passage to India is essentially 2 awesome restaurants in one: a wide ranging, well-tended buffet at lunch and a great dinner spot with an exhaustive menu. You would be smart to try either, genius to try both.

At lunch, for under $10 you get your run of the buffet table which usually consists of at least two kinds of rice, paneer dish, at least two other veggie dishes, tangine chicken and two other wet entrees, plus salad. The choices are never allowed to go empty and can rotate so it may be worth a second pass if you are still hungry...or if your taste buds insist. The chicken tikka masala is often on the table and has a great flavor.

For dinner Passage to India is my perfect hole-in-the-wall dining experience. There are many choices for each of your main categories, be you chicken, lamb, veggie, or seafood lover. I love the Hydrabadi Keema (Indian hot, of course) which has a deep flavor and practically leaves me licking the serving bowl.

The service is okay. Not overly attentive, but they don't leave you hanging. Like I said, I love the hole-in-the-wall feel but if you are looking for a classy date spot the atmosphere might not be what you want. If that's the case though, bookmark Passage to India and go later. You won't regret it.
