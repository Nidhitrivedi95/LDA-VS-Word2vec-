GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Once again was let down by the quality of food. Each time I've been there, it seems to have degraded. Tikka masala fries were oily and the fries themselves were not crispy/ undercooked. Seekh Kabob and chapli kabob were not very flavorful and the size of the serving seems to have shrunk. The chana puri combo was abysmal. The chana dish was watery and for the Puri, they seemed to have used the naan batter and fried it, so the Puri was more like fried naan! Looks like the only thing they seem to do OK with are chicken items. 
I have given them enough chances and won't be returning.
