UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Ordered for take out so this review is mostly based on the food.

When i picked up my food, this restaurant looks a tad mysterious from the outside but on the inside it is very modern, almost an upscale take with big booths great for medium sized parties or intimate dinners. 

Ordered a lamb vindaloo, a butter naan and a garlic naan that came out to 24$ before tips. I thought $15 for a lamb vindaloo and $3.50 naans was a bit pricey but apparently thats what the Indian restaurants around UNLV charges so this was my first test.

Pros
-Lamb Vindaloo, although not spicy (medium), was tasty that came with A LOT OF LAMB. Good cuts of lamb as the pieces were neither tough or fatty. 
-For $15, the portion of vindaloo was well sized and the rice it came with was more than enough
-Very well packaged for takeout to ensure none of it spills on its journey to the stomach

Cons
-Weak naan, was not big and fluffy. It is possible that it became soggy on the ride home but they did not have crispy edges that the good naan have.
-Butter naan was not buttery and although garlic naan had garlic, the flavors did not transfer to the palate. (Surcharge for garlic was understandable, but for 'unbuttery' butter?)
-Pricey naan considering it it was about $3.50 each.

Will definitely come back to try the buffet soon, but will try the other Indian restaurants nearby before I order takeout from here again.
