sUGlSS0AF2xPYFEjvKJbSA I came to this establishment when it was still Maharajah and after this visit, I find myself wishing I was back at Maharajah. Don't get me wrong, it's still cheap eats for lunch for all-you-can-eat! It's not that the food is inedible but it's just not super yummy anymore. On the day we came, lunch time ran until 3pm. We got there around 2pm and most of the chafing dishes were either half empty or practically already empty. It didn't seem like they were going to refill anything because they were getting ready to close at 3pm. 

Of all the things I ate, here are a few that hit the spot: The chicken tiki masala had a really good sauce but the chicken was super dry. We really liked what looked like a blood sausage; it was full of spices (not temperature wise) and good. The garlic naan that they brought out was hot out of the oven and fragrant with the smell of garlic. Very good! The best thing I think I ate there was the spicy chicken (it's red and reminds me of Chinese sweet and sour chicken). 

The staff that we encountered with were very happy, polite, and attentive. That is something I can vouch for! The restaurant is also very clean, but the food has left to be desired.
