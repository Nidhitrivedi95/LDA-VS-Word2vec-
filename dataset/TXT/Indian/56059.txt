xhc-bSw2Cz2Inskzjve3Rg Probably more like 3-point something stars based on two visits for the lunch buffet (they just opened a few weeks ago).  However, I'll round it up to 4 stars based on the fact that they actually have some appropriately SPICY food available at the buffet (there's plenty of non-spicy as well-- chicken tikka masala, palak paner, etc), and because both times I've been there both the main selections as well as the desserts have had things that you don't see at all of the  other Indian buffets nearby. At this point I'd probably compare Kangchen favorably against Dhaba and Swagat, and a step up from Maharaja and Minerva (all about a 5 minute drive from this place, so there's pretty stiff competition nearby!)
