xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw Had a great takeout meal tonight! My cousin and I just moved back to Cleveland after many years in NYC, and we were very excited to find an awesome Indian place here. The owners were very kind and took time to explain the food and the love that goes into making it. Will definitely be back!
