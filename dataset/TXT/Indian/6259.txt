3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Great atmosphere. One of the best waiters we ever had!! The is the first time eating Indian food and because of the perfect wait staff it won't be the last! ( haven't got our dishes yet so can't say on the food yet! Our bread with sauces ( in the pic) is great though)

By the way the food was perfect also! Got to try the garlic naan too. Been in vegas almost a week and hands down the best place we ate so far and definitely the best service! Thank you Dehli!
