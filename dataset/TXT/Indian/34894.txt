Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg It's a nice Indian restaurant in Vegas. My parents liked the place a lot and we went here 2-3 times during our visit. The only thing I didn't like is that we can't order on the phone and come for dine in. We were getting late and receptionist didn't accept this on the phone. I was disappointed by that but overall food is good. Not to forget, service is bit slow at times so be prepared for that.
