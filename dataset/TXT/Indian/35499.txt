Mw4OBWvBQ-L_a0EOFKFDjQ I have tried the Dixie location and there is something wrong with this MTC location. 

Although they sell the same dishes, prices are different. The level of spices used also seems to differ. I find this location to be much lighter in taste. Take the fried fish for example. This place charges you $7.99 for a box with 8-9 pieces. he Dixie one charges $5.99 for about 6 pieces. I'm fine if a franchise doesn't want to standardize prices, but the MTC one's fish was very bland. 

Also, don't bother with their lunch special. If you like to be cheap, you are only screwing yourself. Their specials boasts a long list of stuff but you only get like a sprinkle of each item. Except for rice which they will happily pack into your box. 

I tried their grilled meats once. You should take your money to Café de Khan or Aunty's Kitchen which are not too far away. The grilled meats here lack the punch I would expect from an Indian/Pakistani place. Save your money. I'm not coming back. This place is only good if you have no taste buds and just want to feel full on rice.
