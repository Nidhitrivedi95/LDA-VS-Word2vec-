Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg My sister and I were expecting a run of the mill Indian joint on our way back from SC, but this place far exceeded expectations! The owner/chef came out multiple times to give us extras and ask how are meal was. He even explained the cooking process to us and told us how he makes everything daily from scratch. Will definitely eat here again.
