rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ Pukka is a hip, modern Indian restaurant with a clean somewhat narrow interior. The ambience works well for groups but may be a bit loud for an intimate evening for 2.

A group of 5 recently had the price fix Summerlicious menu. The consensus on the Chicken 65 app was delicious but could use more spice. The eggplant tartare was decent but small and lacked complex flavours.

The lamb rogan josh and butterchicken mains were a hit. The vegetarian in our group was mildly disappointed in the  vegetable curry. An off price fix kale salad was ordered but was also not fantastic (too expensive for the serving size and did not have the promised spice)

Desserts were great (chili chocolate torte) to above average (rice pudding and mang mousse).

Pukka is worth a check if you want an upscale Indian alternative - just don't expect the typical blend of true indian spices and flavours you get at 'hole-in-the-wall' establishments.
