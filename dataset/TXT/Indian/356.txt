We tried the tandoori chicken and lamb boti kebab, with garlic naan and basmati rice.  You can order your food mild, medium or hot. We went with the medium and it was perfectly spiced: just enough spice to add some heat, but not enough to need constant water.

Service was excellent. Our food came out fast, waters refilled before we realized they were low, and they really cared if we liked the food.

We will definitely be back!
