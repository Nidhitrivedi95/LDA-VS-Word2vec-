IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA I stayed in Edinburgh a couple of years ago and discovered Noor's Chicken Shajani dish. It's the best curry I've ever had and whenever I go to an Indian restaurant I look out for it but haven't seen it anywhere else. Luckily I'm back in Edinburgh now so I know where I'll be heading when I want Indian food.


 As other people have mentioned, the portions are a good size and the taste is amazing. The staff are also very friendly.
