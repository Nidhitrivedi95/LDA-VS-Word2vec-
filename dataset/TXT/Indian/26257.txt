IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA Tried Saino for the first time today. Went for the lunch buffet. All in all, we were quite satisfied.
The assortment was ample and fresh. The service was very good and friendly. Our server was the owner's daughter. She was very informed and helpful. Will return soon for dinner and to order from a very abundant regular menu. Encountered absolutely no language barriers. One very positive note relates to the authenticity of this restaurant. They were fairly busy  for an ordinary weekday lunch. Seemed like almost all were regulars with a good number of them being either Indian or from Nepal. That is always something to look for in a place like this.
