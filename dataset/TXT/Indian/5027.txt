The food is really good. Like, stupid good. The staple, butter chicken, was spicier than most, but on par with Sweet Palace, which is the golden standard for Indian food. The apps were really good, we had the crispy fried vegetables and they were so delicious. the paneer dishes are also great, very fragrant and delicious. 

The parking kind of sucks, the plaza is very busy and it's at a strip of road directly across from the Heartland Walmart. That's a terrible place for anything, but trust me. If you survive the left turn into the plaza, you're in for a great meal!
