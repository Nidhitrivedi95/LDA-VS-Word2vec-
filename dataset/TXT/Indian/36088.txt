NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw We just happened to pass by this place and thought to give it a try.  The place is small but the food is pretty good here.  I really enjoyed the garlic naan and paneer curry.  I especially liked the fact that when we ordered our food to be spicy,  it actually was spicy, and I love my Indian food to be very spicy:) Overall I really enjoyed eating here.
