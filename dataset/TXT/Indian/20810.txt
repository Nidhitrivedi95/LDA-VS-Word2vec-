Combo meal chicken curry is something from out of space and wasn't that good. Rice and roti in combo were ok and kind of revived my taste buds a bit. Chicken puff is good, but a bit expensive @ 2.99 a piece! Chaat - vada pav (good) but no sauce or anything was provided, pav bhaji - the curry was not that tasty .. A bit bland. Pizza - chilling chicken pizza - I was kind of expecting Indian style chilli chicken, but it was different with a ton of American greasy cheese and a hint of green chilli sauce as a base with capsicum and cucumbers I think. It had good amount of chicken pieces though! Needs to improve taste in the food items and less greasy cheese please.
