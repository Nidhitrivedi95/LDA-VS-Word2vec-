xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Never a disssapointment. In the past as I read the reviews I see attitude with the employees, but that is gone with the sister running the place. My guest and I had a wonderful experience and everyone was very helpful and friendly.

We ordered the beef and vegetable stew and powder sugar fry bread.

The beef was wonderful and a little bite to iy. Dip your fry bread and you would be in heaven. My guest also really enjoyed her vegetable stew which she commented was very flavorable.  My only complaint would be the quantity which could be more for the price.  I felt like the bowl and quantity were too small. Maybe because it tasted so good.

Now the best part of all is the Fry bread with powder sugar and honey. I can only say I went back for seconds.

Definitely worth the 20 mile drive and we will be back.
