svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w The Mysore Dosa plate is highly recommended. My friend and I had lunch here yesterday--I ordered the biryani combo (vegetarian), which was tasty. My friend got the Mysore Dosa combo (or something like that--or was it Madras? My brain says Mysore. It was one of the spicy selections.)--which was absolutley fabulous. There were many of the same items offered, but the Mysore dosa plate presented more options and larger sizes (it was done South Indian style, as a thali, in which there are portions of a wide variety of dishes provided in separate containers or compartments on a plate). We ended up sharing our plates, and everything was delicious.

Definitely stop by. We also purchased some of the fried takeout items. They looked good, but some of them were a bit dry on their own--I hadn't thought to get sauces for any of them. They were fine, but not the highlight of this spot! Go for the dosa!!

Also, though my biriyani plate was supposedly medium spice, it wasn't that spicy, where the Mysore dosa thali had a decent kick to it, but did not obscure the delicious flavours of the dishes (I don't like too spicy, because then the spice is all you taste--this wasn't the case, here).
