They definitely set the standard for customer service. First time visiting, they are very busy and there is limited seating but I haven't seen anyone wait too long for a seat. We got the buffet which I think is what most people do. I don't know what most of the food is but it is all very good and the bread keeps coming.  My wife and I both like the lamb dishes the best. I reserve 5 stars only because it is my first visit but I understand and agree with the 5 star reviews.
