3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Visited Kama based on location and reviews while visiting Canada. Good Indian dinner buffet. Range of choices to serve different palatial needs. Blend of vegetarian, chicken goat and fish dishes.  Some dishes the heavy cream was overpowering the traditional indian flavors. Loved their butter chicken and the gulab jamun desserts. Found toronto indian restaurants( the ones i visited) were great (Best indian food outside india ( after brick lane restaurants in London).
