v38zwJvJiLv-yC7uEhhcKA I was craving Indian food, and this is right across the street from my hotel. I ordered the two combo meal with channa marsala, chicken balti marsala, rice, and naan.

I was so disappointed. There was spice to the dishes, but they were bland. The naan was stale.

They were speedy when it came to service, but I will not eat here again.
