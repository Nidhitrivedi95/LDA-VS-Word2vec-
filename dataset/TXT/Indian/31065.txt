KK7H1bVOMAJnDqMhBv2zpA I've been going here for years. The food is great and spicy. The Hakka Chinese Pakistani food really hits the spot. Many folks opt for takeout and this seems to account for a great part of the business. They really shouldmgive a discount if you bringnyour own containers for takeout. I highly recommend Chung Moi.
