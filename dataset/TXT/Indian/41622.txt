Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I've been here on three occasions and this place has some of the best atmosphere I've ever experienced. The staff are amazing - they've let us stay past closing time twice - and they really know their food. I like their take on the unique Indo-Chinese spice and their suggestions about choosing your spiciness level, and also the freshness and the selection of the food. Priced as one dish, portions are big enough to have for two meals! I love coming here and look forward to my fourth trip soon.
