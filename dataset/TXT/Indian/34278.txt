MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ This place is in a good location, it looks very nice inside, and I would not mind a nice celebration there.  The staff is dressed very formal, and there is an air of low tone and low lighting.  We had lamb curry, chicken curry,  and chicken coconut curry.  The favorite was the coconut curry.  I was not especially fond of the lamb curry becuase the lamb was a bit stiff and dry.  I don't think they cooked it very recently.

The portions were suprisingly small.  The pricing is quite a bit higher that I would have thought it would be when I looked through the menu, but when I saw small portions I thought this is hopefully excellent quality.  It was good, but I have to say that I have had better and we were probably paying for the staff to dress up and the very high rent... both good reasons to pay a little more for a meal, but it does not draw me back to the place.  We have numerous better options that we will probably stick with.
