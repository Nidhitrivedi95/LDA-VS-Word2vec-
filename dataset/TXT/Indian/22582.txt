gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Im going to start this off by saying that because of my ethnicity being of South Asian descent, I go in with high expectations of any Indian restaurant I dine at. With that said, Ruchi has been the only Indian restaurant in the valley so far, that has made me feel like there is a South Indian Paradise going on in my mouth with every bite I took! 
First off, the restaurant is very clean and has a very nice ambience. The staff and owners at Ruchi were amazing! They were so attentive and polite and over all just really friendly. 

My husband and I ordered vegetable cutlets to start with a mango lassi. ( The mango lassi is on point) We ordered the Ruchi special, garlic naan and a mysore dosai for our meal. All the food was AMAZING! The dosai is crisp and huge! The garlic naan was so flavorful! If you like things spicy, definitely go for the Mysore dosai! The flavors were exceptional and spiced to perfection! The chutneys that were brought to the table were to die for and complimented all the food so well. 
Overall, if it were up to me, I would eat here all day, everyday! 

We will definitely be going back to try out their lunch buffet!
