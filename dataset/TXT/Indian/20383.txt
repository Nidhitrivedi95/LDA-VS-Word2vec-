FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ Great food- both the yellow and red curries are very good.  Lots of vegetarian choices as well and menu has surprising depth.  Storefront strip-mall type location has no personality, however.  I'd recommend takeout rather than eating in.  Prices are a little high for lunch- $8.50-$9.00 ish, but there are a few lunch specials in the $6.00 range.
