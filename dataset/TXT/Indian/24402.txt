h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Every table was occupied by Indian families so this gave me the impression it must be authentic. I had the lunch buffet and was disappointed. The food was so incredibly over spiced that it was difficult to taste the main ingredient.  Steam table management is lacking as temperatures of each dish ranged from ice cold to simmering. Then came the bill.  There could not be a greater gap between the quality and price.  It was twice what it was worth.  While I've had excellent Indian food before, judging by the patrons (all Indian) perhaps this was too authentic for my taste.
