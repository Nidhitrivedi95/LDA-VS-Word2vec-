CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A The food is solid enough. If you're unfamiliar with Indian food this place is a good entry level place. It has two main issues though...

First, the table are all glass covered. That's not bad in and of itself but the staff makes of point of cleaning the tables with Windex while diners are present, leaving window-cleaner stench hanging in the air to ruin the taste of the food.

Second, if you are planning on eating here for the love of god, BRING CASH! The last time I ate here I paid for it with my debit card, only to have the restaurant withdraw the funds over a week later! Seriously?
