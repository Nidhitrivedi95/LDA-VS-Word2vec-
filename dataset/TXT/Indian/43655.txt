RROOK4PBvXnzuBtUHMbLMA They open for buffet at 11:30am, yet when they opened,they were still mopping floors. The menu is in English as well,our waitress knew basically no English at all though.  Our wish to order a starter from the menu but eat from the buffet slightly overwhelmed her. Not very attentive either. Buffet consisted of mixed salad and a soup as starters,rice and 3 curry dishes for mains and something that looked like pudding as dessert. The big plates for the main dishes were stored in a warmer which was unfortunately switched off. The food was bland and watery and until today I did not know that chicken could be cooked that way that it will turn hard and chewy. 

We will not try this place again.
