rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA Food is consistently great!  Kebabs are big, juicy, flavourful and tender.  The rice is spiced just right and they allow for lots if flexibility in your rider. Just about anything can be doubled or replaced. I agree with previous reviews that the service is lacking in a couple of areas.  Would highly recommend it for the food.
