CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ Nice little hole-in-the-wally sort of place, with the feeling of a family owned neighborhood joint mainly patronized by locals. Great value for the money. For example, they serve a little cup of excellent lentil soup and a small plate of salad with every dinner entree. The naan was unremarkable, but the lamb dish and saag paneer we got were pretty good. We'll be back.
