zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q I didn't think that I would like Afghani food and I was a little nervous to try, but everything I had was WONDERFUL! The waitress was such a sweetheart and she was patient in explaining the types of dishes to me.

I had a chicken samosa, garlic naan and the mantoo.

Would highly recommend, everything I tried was amazing!
