DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg When I first moved to Scottsdale I had no idea where to order Indian food.  I turned to Yelp and found this restaurant. It was pretty close to my apartment and I decided to give them a try. They also have Eat24 so I could order online and it was ready when I got there to pick it up.  Sometimes I have to wait a little while, but it's never more than 5-10 minutes.  

I tend to get the same thing every time- the vegetable samosas and the palak paneer- and I am never disappointed. The spice can sometimes vary on the dishes but I've never had it be bland or unbearably spicy. The food is always hot and the portions are quite large. The palak paneer also comes with rice which is nice because a lot of other restaurants in the area don't include the rice.  I always have leftovers and can eat it for lunch the next day. I order from here probably every other week and even though I now live farther away, I still order online here and make the drive.
