cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg Having grown up in Nepal I was SORELY disappointed to find that all Nepalese restaurants in Toronto, are just Indian restaurants that also serve momos. I don't get it... the market is saturated with Indian restaurants, and the only place that sort of serves Nepali food is Himalayan Kitchen, why would the Nepalese not want to take advantage of being the first?  Kind of ironic, Nepali people serving Indian food, and Tibetan people serving Nepali food. 

Ahhh, anyways, I guess this is meant to be a review and not a rant. So I will say, I went in expecting Nepali food - so I tried their momos (tibetan/nepali dumplings) and thaali. The momos were okay, but then for me any momo is better than no momo. When I read thaali, I expected the Nepalese curry, daal and veggies, but it was all Indian. :( oh the travesty! 

Don't worry Kathmandu Restaurant, you're not the only one I'm disappointed with (here's looking at you Mt. Everest). Come on Nepalese people of Toronto!!! Open an authentic Nepali restaurant already! I would cash in on that so fast if it weren't for the fact that I suck at cooking, but I excel at eating, so you'd already have one loyal customer in me.
