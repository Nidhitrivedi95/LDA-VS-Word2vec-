7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Maybe I'm just spoiled off of the variety available to me in my years spent living out east, but this establishment didn't do it for me.

I had the Paneer Tikka Masala. The depth of flavor that I have come to expect out of that dish was not present in this restaurant's rendition. 

The rest of the reviews have great things to say. Maybe I came in on an off day?
