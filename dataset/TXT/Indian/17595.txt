DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ This is a place I visit often. Delicious Indian food that tastes like home and reasonable prices. Their sweets are a lovely way to end a meal I recommend the "milk cake". I've enjoyed the channa bhatura, butter chicken, roti, chat papri, paneer dishes and all are yummy. The service is good. Don't be fooled by the appearance of this place. I do wish they would stop using styrofoam plates and cups as this hurts our environment.
