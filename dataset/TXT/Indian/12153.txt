auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Taj Palace is a great option if you're in the mood for Indian food. I've tried their appetizers, Onion Bahji and Chicken Samosas were pretty good. The Garlic Naan & Chicken Biryani is to die for! The two is cooked to perfection, ughhh so good! The Chicken Tikka Masala was alright, the meat was just very chewy in my opinion. I've been here twice during their dinner time, but I'm looking forward to trying their lunch buffet special very soon. If you're around Henderson area, definitely give this place a shot!

The only downside I experienced was that the servers seemed bothered when my boyfriend & I had a question about the menu or needed extra napkins. The service was okay, but could of been better.
