GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw Had such a great meal at this little Indian restaurant! Although the description says Indian and Thai I would stick with the Indian dishes. We started with Pakoras, Samosas and and Spring Rolls - Pakoras were awesome and would definitely order again but would always pass on the spring rolls. 

As for mains, I ordered the Eggplant Bharta and Chana Masala with no added dairy since I'm intolerant. They were happy to make changes for allergies :) Both dishes were delicious with the plain basmati rice. The rest of my table ordered the Garlic Naan and really enjoyed it also. 

Service was slow but to be expected since they make each dish to order. Will be going back!
