kl3qVhrVcdKkZAHWOo1caw I found this place by accident. I was craving for butter chicken., didn't even bother to read the sign that it's vegetarian so of course there's no meat around.  Because I do not know how to speak punjabi and even though i tried to explain what I wanted they ended up giving me full meal,.. that I didn't even get to finish. Some of it are nice..I thought I would want to come back which I did... but .. for some reason the inconsistency of the food and how it's made quite disappoint me... sometimes it's right... sometimes too salty... sometimes you have to beg for more paneer... sometimes you don't even have to ask,.. The inconsistency of the food goes along with the service.  ..There will be times that  they'll be nice and smiling to you... and sometimes  they make you feel so unwelcome.
