9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw Pleasant surprise. Probably the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.Complicated menu but they do have a member of staff that has real culinary expertise to help with making the correct choices. The Indo Chinese menu has some excellent items on it too.

Personal Favorite Madras curry and burnt garlic fried rice with vegetables.

Enjoy!
