My mom comes down to Chandler twice a month, not to see me. She wants to go to Woodlands and eat their Malai Kofta and Parotta (bread). 

This place has lots of Vegan options which are clearly labeled on the menu which is just divine for me. Regardless, if you are a vegetarian or not this is some of the best indian food I have ever tasted. I think the dosai is expensive but it tastes very good like everything. 

Recommend the Chenna Batura, Poori Masal, Samosa, Mango Lassi and if you get curry or vegetables don't forget to order the parotta!@
