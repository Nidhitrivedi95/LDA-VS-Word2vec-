RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg OK. 5 Stars might seem weird, BUT for the mid-west, this IS as good as Indian cuisine gets outside of Chicago. It is such a HUGE step up from the previous Basmati owners in the same building, I can't believe it. The food is absolutely delicious, with generous and interesting portions. I LOVE that they regularly serve a Goat special, it is always amazing. TOTALLY a fan. Like, totally.
