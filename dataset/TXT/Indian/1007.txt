-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw The only and only thing about this place is the ThumsUp cans available here. I've ordered a Chicken Spl Biryani and Chicken tikka kabab. The biryani was extremely bland and I had to search for the damn chicken in it. 

The only way i can describe the Tikka kabab is Pieces of boiled (one or two semi boiled) chicken with red paint and some kind of Everest masala sprinkled on them. I went upto the serving lady and asked her to add something to make it tastier and guess ehat she does!? She sprinkles red chilli powder on them and gives it to me. 

I enjoyed the boiling heat outside this place better. 0 stars
