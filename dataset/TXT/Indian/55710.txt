x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ I had a pretty bad experience here recently. This has been one of my favorite Chinese place till recently, but looks like the popularity and patronage from Asian clientele has gone to their head. Went there on a Sat afternoon, thinking that there would be less of a crowd to sit through,and was surprised at the level of mismanagement this place has.
To start off, while the place was mostly unoccupied, i did book a table in advance just to be sure. As soon as i entered, i could figure out the place was not completely ready though it was already 130pm, a good couple of hrs from their opening time. Booking didnt seem to make any difference as the restaurant crew were not interested to know if i had one!
The Air conditioning sucked like anything. With peak summer temp of 115F outside, the least you expect from an eating place is a breath of cool air. But probably the Bamboo garden folks were trying to save some $$ on their power bill. The food preparation tasted Ok but the presentation was bad. And for some reason, the staff seemed to be in a hurry to wrap up the table and make us move out. Dishes were being removed while some of us were still eating, tables were moved while we were still sitting. It felt as if the management would be happier if people paid upfront, boxed all stuff and went off quickly. To top it off, my bill included a 18% gratuity for a party of 6...which included 2 kids...1 being infant!!..Ridiculous!.
This place is definitely avoidable now and out of my list of favorite places for food.
