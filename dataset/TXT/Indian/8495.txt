7ovjGF8h05Fc9pRXgInLcw This is one of my favorite restaurants in the US and Canada, and I've been all over both. I used to live down the street from Taj Mahal when I went to university in Montreal, and I ate there or got takeout pretty frequently. Last summer when I graduated, I had my graduation dinner there with friends and family. It's a tiny place so we took up most of the space and the staff and head chef were so accommodating. I couldn't have been happier! The food has always been consistently good. I am in LOVE with their butter chicken - I have yet to find another Indian restaurant that can do it so well. I also love their lamb curry and before I had to switch to a gluten free diet, their naan bread. Since going gluten free, I can still eat there, easily. I just avoid the naan and the samosas. All the curries and rice and lentil papadums, some other things (can't remember) are gluten free. I love it and make a point to eat there whenever I'm in Montreal. I live in Southern California now, where there is no shortage of good food, but Taj Mahal is still tops on my list.
