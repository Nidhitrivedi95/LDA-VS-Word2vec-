TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw The way I found the India Palace was to ask the locals where they go. Over and over the recommendation was the India Palace. This place is consistently good. Never fails to please and I've been going here for  years. Make a point of at least one meal here on every Vegas visit. Can't go wrong here. Great service, great food, great price.
