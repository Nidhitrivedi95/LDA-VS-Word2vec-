TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Stopped in Namaste for an extended lunch the other day with a date.  After striking up a convresation, Melque the "new" owner serenaded us for a full set!  What a treat!  She checked on us frequently and talked with us quite a bit about her home of Goa, India.  

Food is lighter and fresher than some other spots in town, consistently good and the buffet is frequently replenished.  Great value considering the price.  

What I love most about this place (besides the ultra convenient central location) is the dark, sultry wood decor.  I treasure the places in Vegas that DON'T feel like Vegas...and Namaste fits the bill. The energy in the place is authentic...and I came out feeling strangely rejuvenated and refreshed...I thought it was just lunch??
