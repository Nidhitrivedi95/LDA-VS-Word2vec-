Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Good buffet at a decent price. If you're staying in Vegas for a few days and craving Indian food, this is a great place. The location is really convenient and the food is great for the price. Their dinner is really good as well. You can sometimes get a 20-30% discount coupon at one of those tix4tonight stands. Service is good as well. The buffet has lots of vegetarian and vegan options, which is nice. Highly recommended.
