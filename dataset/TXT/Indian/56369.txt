XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw It is not a given that glowing Yelp! Reviews guarantee a great experience. I wanted something a bit different from the ordinary where I could take some out of town guests without spending a fortune.

Tibet Kitchen is delicious. The steamed beef buns, fried chicken buns, noodle dishes, and recommended chicken dishes were all excellent. If you are not a fan of spicy, tread lightly with the accompanying hot sauce.

Service here is excellent.

Prices are extremely reasonable. We agreed that if the same food was being served by some celebrity chef downtown, people would gladly wait in line and pay 2-3 times as much.

Can't wait to go back.
