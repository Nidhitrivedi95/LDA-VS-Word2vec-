OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I think this place is beyond horrible. I should have known that this place was horrible when we were the only customers in the joint.  I've had better Indian food from the back of a gas station. 

Food taste: bland, dull and trite.  

Waitstaff: annoying and overbearing, to say the least.  The must have asked us if we needed anything about 10 times. They even tried to take away our dishes when there was still food on the plates. 

Price: a total rip off. $70 for dinner for two, nothing fancy. I didn't check the price for a side of rice--because it is f*cking rice. But they charge $10 for two tiny bowls. 

Decor: decent, modern
