TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw It was my birthday and I decided I wanted Indian food. My spouse has never tried Indian food and I was really scared that he wouldn't like it. After reading great reviews we decided to try this place. We made reservations which were not needed because he were the only ones in there. 

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, he ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, this little lady came up to us and recommended the Chicken Biriani rice, and a side of garlic naan. 

WOW the chicken biriani rice I have never tried anything like that, the flavors were just amazing! They made the vindaloo mild, but it definitely still had a good kick to it. The masala was delicious with a creamy tomato sauce. The naan was hot and fresh. I would have however done without the masala we could have just ordered the biriani rice since it is an entree, and the vindaloo. 

Then the lady sang some beautiful songs for us, the chef came out and started singing as well. The food was delicious the experience was even better. 

Anyways I will leave the review with saying you have HAVE TO try the chicken biriani.
