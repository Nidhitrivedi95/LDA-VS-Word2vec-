fCdcxvZJjkwh7PbOOWUmJQ Came here for a groupon deal.  Had trouble finding the place.  It is located south of rutherford but on the north west section of vaughan mills.

Waiters are very polite and friendly.  We ordered the $20 lamb korma with butter naan and the all new jumbo tiger prawn dish with butter naan for $20 (which is not on their menus because it's a new dish).

The lamb dish tasted great, but lacking in quantity of meat.  For $20, everyone expects a nice portion size!  Most people will not return to this restaurant because of this little portion size.  I found about 7-8 little bite sized cubes of meat in the dish.  Sauce was fantastic and the meat quality was very good.  The lamb was tender and moist.

The jumbo tiger prawn dish is 11/10.  The sauce was fantastic.  The vegetables that came with the dish was generous and fresh.  Green peppers, broccoli, mushrooms, sundried tomato, onions, garlic, spices...  Mmmm yummy.  I found 5 huge tiger prawns inside the dish each one cooked perfectly.  This is the BEST shrimp dish i have ever had in an indian restaurant.  Highly recommended and i would come back and eat at this restaurant just for this dish!

The butter Naan bread arrived hot and fresh but i could hardly see any butter on the naan.

Overall we enjoyed our food and would return again for that shrimp dish!
