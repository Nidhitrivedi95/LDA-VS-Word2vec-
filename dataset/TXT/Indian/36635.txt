They have the cool computerized soda machines.

The man who took my order gave me a really quick and detailed run-down of the menu and he was nice.

The service was really fast. I thought it was going to take longer because they gave us the little buzzer things, but it took like five minutes.

There were a lot of Indian patrons, which is always a good sign when you go to an ethnic restaurant.
