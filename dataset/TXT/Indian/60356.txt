ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA This restaurant is a hidden jewel the food is fresh and the flavors are so delicious and fragrant. We ordered delivery and went to the actual restaurant the next day. The calamari is to die for. The goat curry was very tender. you must also try the butter chicken. The naan was hot and fresh. I can't say anything bad about this place. Delivery was awesome as well our food was still hot.
