LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Thank you to Yelp for helping me find this place while visiting for the weekend to watch a Phillies, Pirates Game back in April. Such a cool little place, I wish I could visit more often. Cafeteria style food on one side and an awesome market on the other side where you can watch them butcher your meat right in front of you. They have a fairly extensive collection of middle eastern food products.

The food was fabulous. My wife and I had shawarma's and they were up there with the best I've ever had, and soo filling. They were great for a day of sighseeing. I always kinda worry that the staff in this type of place can be kinda indifferent and/or just make you feel awkward but these guys were super friendly. Also, they had these Lebanese non alcoholic malted fruit beverages called "Laziza" which were amazing! Its basically like a soda but not as sweet. I can't find them anywhere here in the Philadelphia and am definitely gonna get a couple cases next time I'm in town. 

Even if you're not looking to buy any goods from the market you should pop in and take a look... unless you're squeemish about seeing full animals with no skin. Lots of fun stuff over there. I can't wait to come back
