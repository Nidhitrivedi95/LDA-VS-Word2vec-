LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This is hands down one of the best places to have dosa and idli with the perfect ambience. Ordered the mini idlis for appetizers and they are the perfectly made idli: spongy but not chewy. I ordered rava dosa and it was super thin and crisp without being difficult to eat, not to mention large. Jeera lassi and mango lassi were also delicious!!! Two people can share one entree and an appetizer. also if your not much of a spicy person 1 chili level is perfect as anything beyond may be spicier than anticipated. The place is usually busy so service might slack. Only reason why this place gets 4 vs 5 stars.
