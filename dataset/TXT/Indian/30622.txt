KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA I ordered delivery from this place thru Skip The Dishes and was very excited, given their high yelp rating. 1 hour and 15 minutes later, my food arrived cold and in a giant mess. The curry spilled inside the bag and was on everything.  Granted, I don't know if the delivery person was responsible for this, but in any case, they should invest in better take out containers. The use of styrofoam should be completely eliminated by the restaurant industry...my humble opinion. 

I ordered :

1 Vegetable Samosas 
1 Tandoori Chicken (small) 
1 Roganjosh (goat) 
1 Plain Basmati Rice 
1 Plain Naan

The samosas where made with Phyllo dough and the only vegetable I could see was potato. Potato everywhere, as far as the eye can see. The green chutney it came with tasted good, but it was an unnatural shade of neon green, I suspect food colouring was involved . 
The chicken was undercooked, who serves undercooked chicken??? It's the easiest thing to cook, how can you get it so wrong???
The roganjosh was another disappointment, there were only 4 tinny pieces of meat with bone, FOUR! so the meat was swimming in sauce, lots of sauce.  
The rice would've been nice were it not for the excessive use of anise seeds and all other kinds of spices. I mean you could not take a bite of the rice without chewing something unpleasant. It became a chore, dig and scoop out all the seeds and giant pieces of cinnamon bark.  
In the end, the naan was the highlight of the meal. 

To the cooks of this joint: get your s@&* together!

To the future guests: don't expect authentic Indian cuisine, in fact skip the entire Indian food section of the menu.
