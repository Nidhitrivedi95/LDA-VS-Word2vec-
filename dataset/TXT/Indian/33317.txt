llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I was very excited to order from here.  I am giving a low rating because of the service used to deliver my food.  AzMealMan.  I ordered my meal and it was delivered; after the girl left I noticed that I was missing a dish and there were no eating utensils or napkins.  I immediately called Azmealman...already closed.  I left a voicemail and I even wrote on the facebook page.  They responded on the fb page by telling me to call...which I already had!!!  I called again tonight.  Nothing yet.  OH...and now they don't allow comments on their fb page.  So.  Two things....missing dish, no eating utensils, no follow up, no facebook posts/comments from public...thumbs down.  AS for the food I did get...it was ok.  RIce with peans/nuts was generous and tasted good,, tandoori mixed plate was good...and there was alot of it.  The naan was not worth $1.50 at all.  In fact...it wasn't worth the $41 at all.  I might try it again by actually GOING to the buffet...perhaps I can recoup some of my losses then.
