PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Today my friend brought me to Tandoori Flame because he claims it's the best Indian buffet ever. I've never eaten Indian food before so I was hesitant to try it out...but I went in with an open mind and tried it. 

When I walked in I was surprised by what type of customers were eating here. The majority of them were Caucasian and there were a few Indian families. I expected a large buffet but it wasn't that big compared to Mandarin.

The things that I tried were the bite-sized samosas (yummy!), naan with this orange and green sauce that had cottage cheese in it (don't know what it's called), tandoori chicken, butter chicken, and this orange rice (looks like fried rice). The food was good and I couldn't stuff myself after the 3rd plate...and this was when my friend was forcing me to eat more.

In conclusion, I would suggest this place to anyone who is looking for an Indian buffet to dine at. Also, I would come back here if I was in the area or if my friends invite me.
