FlOvCwPUrRCicfbpd1tUIQ Its a really nice restaurant - quite nicely done makes for a good ambience.

It was voted in BlogTo.com as one of the best Pakistani restaurants in the GTA which inspired us to make the trek out to the west end.

We orderd a BBQ platter, yellow Daal and Chicken Tikka Masala.
The platter was really fantastic - a great assortment of beef and chicken kebabs including bihari kebab and hiryali chicken as well. All the meet were tender and perfectly flavourful and grilled.

The daal was mediocre and not memorable which was the same case with the Chicken Tikka Masala unfortunately. The naans were made in house and were perfectly baked!

The service was okay - we were attended to in a timely fashion however they forgot out chicken lollipop chicken as an appetizer which we were looking forward to and one of the glasses set up on the table actually had lip stains on it - really bizarre and made me question the sanitary conditions of this place. But we had made it this far to the west end and i wasn't about to not try the food because of it.

Overall, it was a decent experience but not one that i would specifically go back for.

ps: its Halal
