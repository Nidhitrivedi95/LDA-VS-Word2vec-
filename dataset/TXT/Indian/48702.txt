TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA I really want to love Tamarind because it is right down the street from my boyfriend's house and he LOVES Indian food, but every time I give it a chance, something offputting happens. 

On Valentine's Day, the kitchen made a mistake on our takeout and gave us one order of Tikka Masala instead of 2. Now, we were looking for a romantic dinner, but sharing one order isn't exactly what we had in mind. That time, the Tikka Masala was really good, but since then, we've had takeout in which the chicken was almost spongey. I found it completely inedible. 

I think we'll give it another chance or two because it is close and has been delicious in the past, but if we don't and I never end up eating there again, I'll really be OK. 

And a $5 corkage fee? Really? That's just ridiculous.
