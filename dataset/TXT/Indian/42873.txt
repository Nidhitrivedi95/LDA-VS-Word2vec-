RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg As an Indian, I normally can't justify going to a pricey Indian restaurant & paying for food that either I can cook at home myself or that my mom or an aunt can cook for me. But, in the last few months, I've found myself at Blue Taj twice (once with co-workers for lunch, and once for an anniversary celebratory dinner) Both times, I was impressed by the food, the ambiance and the service. I still believe it's expensive, and may be not entirely worth the money you pay , but it's not complaint worthy. It's worth visiting at least once, specially since I haven't found or heard of any other good Indian restaurants in the Charlotte area.
