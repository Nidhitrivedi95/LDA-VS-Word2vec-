CzwowIhuiBfW9O0MqUJhKA I've been going to Tandoori time since it was just  a square room with a glass wall wher eyou could see the cooks sticking naan into their clay oven... forward to 15 years later..and they 've managed to maintain their same recipes along with the 2 extra extensions of their locale. Having said that I only go back for Their  chicken tikka with naan and rice..juicy flavorful and fresh off the grill super moist chicken chunks and colorful spiced rice. Fries and onion salad too.  I hop they don't change as I would hate to go on a quest for a new restaurant.
