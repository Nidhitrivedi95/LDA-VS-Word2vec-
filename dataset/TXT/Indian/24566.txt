H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ My husband and I came here for lunch.  We got vegetable pakora for an appetizer then pineapple chicken and Manchurian chicken. 

The food was quick, hot and cheap. Our server was friendly and came to our table quickly. 

There were 12 pieces of pakora in our appetizer and the lunch special portions were huge too.  Great value for money here.
