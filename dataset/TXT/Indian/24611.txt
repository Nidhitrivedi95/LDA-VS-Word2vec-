H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw Went there for the first time last week and it was just a lovely experience. The food was very good - light and even the dishes that were sauced up tasted fresh. It was served quickly and presented well. The service was attentive without being intrusive. Like the best family-owned restaurants there are one or two people there who must be relatives because they weren't hired for their experience :-). But even they were charming. And the ultimate test of customer service: we used a groupon and still felt we got VIP service. We'll be back.
