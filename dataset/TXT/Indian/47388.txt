TD3IX1KfkJ3X-llJ9sLunA Horrible customer service. They don't cater even a bit to customer's request. Just asked for a different table as it was too hot for me to bear the sun on my face on a hot day like today. Flatly  kept denying upon requesting more than once. So just walked out!! Some amateur waitress!!
