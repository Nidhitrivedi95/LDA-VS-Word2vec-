gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I went today for the lunch buffet and the food was great! My favorite thing about this restaurant is the abundance of vegetarian options. I had the bismati rice, green beans with potatoes, spinach saag, vegetable korma, and samosas. 

The rice was perfect and not overcooked. Since I am vegetarian and absolutely love spinach, the saag was my favorite. Everything was seasoned well and had just the right amount of spice. I am glad this restaurant did not go light on the seasonings to appease some delicate palates. 

I will say I am not a big fan of buffets, but all of the food was hot and fresh. I also liked the fact they had someone keeping a close eye on the buffet to quickly replace rice and any other food item that was running low. 

On a side note, as a local, I forget there are a lot of tourists in town. When a large group stopped by on the way to the airport with luggage in tow, no one gave it a second thought and they were quickly accommodated. 

I will definitely be back.
