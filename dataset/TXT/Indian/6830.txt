I ordered take out, and the food was surprisingly delicious.  Bhuna gosht and Daal masala were great with the garlic naan.  The basmati rice (ordered seperately) was also very flavorful.  If anything, the lamb was slightly overpriced for the portion.  This place needs more customers!! Gotta try it!
