UmcOChw3fm-GgbpK2o_t5w I believe this place used to be managed under a different name, anyway, we found ourselves in Scarborough on a Sunday night and there wasn't a great deal of choice. However, we were pleasantly surprised by this place. I am not sure about the decor being nice though, well, unless you like dark blue walls and violet strip fluorescent lights (almost like the sort you have in some public loos..), but the staff were very polite, the service swift and the food good. The bill was very reasonable and it came with a complimentary drink, which on its own deserves a mention and another half star, if I could possibly do so.
