UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I'm no expert at Indian food but I know a few people who claim they are, so I found my way to Banjara on a recommendation and have since revisited several times.  When you first walk in and cut your way through the wall of spice and aroma, you'll notice the awkward setup reminiscent of a past burger joint.  Every occasion usually results in us waiting for about 5 or 10 minutes (not referencing Seinfeld here, going literal now) but we're always quickly served a pint by attentive staff which subdues any mood from having to stand and wait.

I will admit that I will base my entire experience and any recommendation solely on the holy grail of Indian food, the butter chicken. There are very few foods that I have the urge to smother over my body but this would be one of them. From the moment the spices burn through my nostrils to my tongue wrapping around a piece of chicken, the experience can be described as flawless. A perfect combination of creamy sweet tandoori and savoury bliss that makes my eyes roll back into my head. The old adjective saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" applies here as we always order the same thing. The chana masala and palak paneer are excellent choices and a perfect compliment to the the most excellent naan.

In addition to the superb food, you can expect hardy size portions, decent prices and a friendly staff.  Accompanied by a lively atmosphere where everyone always appears to be enjoying themselves  helps complete the experience.

On a concluding note, if you happen to think there is better butter chicken in TO, please locate the 'send message' link and enlighten me. However, if I find myself in disagreement, I won't be the one smothered in creamy butter chicken ;)
