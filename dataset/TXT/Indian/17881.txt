e8_Xt-ldpDgWHn92s3rBaQ Not bad, my firat time trying it. I live next to it n see it all the time. Its a deff hole in a wall place, pretty good food , service isn't bad. If u like indian food u might wanna try it. Looks kinda iffy when u walk in cuz its like a fast food n a small market i mean small. But dont judge a book by its cover. I give it a 3 cuz presentation could be better, food is good though. Pretty fair portion i guess. Would i come bak ? Probably if i was feeln indian food n spicy in my appatite..
