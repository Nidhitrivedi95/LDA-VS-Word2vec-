zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q The Good: Decently priced and huge portions.  My boti chicken kabob had a nice flavor, with the cucumber salad.  The yogurt sauce was passable.

The Bad and the Ugly: The Saag Paneer was DISGUSTING.  It was bland as hell.  I had one spoonful and tossed it.  And their Goat Karahi, which is a dish that is close to my heart, was DISGUSTING and watery.  How does karahi get that watery?  It actually looked weird.  It did not taste like it was cooked in a wok, the spices and tomatoes were not cooked down at all, and there was an inch layer of fake ghee on top.   And when I asked for it to be spicy, someone just dumped pickled jalapeños in the dish---which made it look less like a karahi.  And I love goat meat but this tasted so gamey and it really looked unappealing, I also threw away 90% of this dish.  And the naan, as someone else said, was thick and spongy, with a yeasty after taste.  I hated it.  Everything was $34 and I threw away practically all of it --- it was nasty to me.  The kabob (and me being a huge softy) saved it from being a one star experience.
