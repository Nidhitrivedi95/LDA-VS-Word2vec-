LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw What a pleasant surprise...off the beaten and crowded path of the Strip District but close enough to walk to from there,  this is an oasis of deliciousness. We sampled much of the menu, Chicken Masala, grape leaves, shawarma, lentil soup, etc etc. Each more fresh and delectable than the next. Get out of the long lines and crowds and walk down to Salem.
