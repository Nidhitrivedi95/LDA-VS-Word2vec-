nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA First - this place offers food from the Kerala region in Indian. If you love Indian food and want to try something else other than butter chicken and naan, eat here.

I grew up in South India and have travelled all over the Malabar coast so I know this area and the food pretty well. That being said - Maroli comes close to the style of food offered in that region. This is where I come to when I want appam, fish or shrimp curries. Also their famous Malabar chicken is quite good - meat is always cooked well (not dry) and flavored with a myriad of spices. 

Step outside the generic Indian food that is offered in Toronto and try Maroli.
