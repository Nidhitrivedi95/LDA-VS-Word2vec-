Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Don't not go here, but if you like Indian comfort food, make sure to keep your expectations low. They are overpriced (the worst, by far, of all downtown spots east of LVB - and I thought Therapy was bad in that respect!), and you don't get your money's worth; apps are $10-12 and you get a fist's worth of food -- totes fine at a nice place, but here? Are they trying to be "fancy" or "fusion?" Mint Indian Bistro already proved you can have more "upscale" Indian/Nepalese offerings and do it right. The menu here is very limited and won't be what most people are looking for in the form of familiar or comfort food. Most of the crowd favorites aren't even on the dinner menu (masala/makhani, korma, sag, rogan josh, etc.). I'm told the other location(s) are way better/different, so maybe it's just this one that has an identity crisis? It's as if the owners decided they're close enough so they should pretend they're on the strip price & run things accordingly. The beers were ridiculous -- $8 for a Blue Moon on tap, $10 for a pale, $12 for an IPA. My partner ordered an old fashioned, and it was overly sweet. He wrinkled his face and noted it had way more sugar than it was supposed to. I've heard lunch may be better, so I plan on trying that eventually.
