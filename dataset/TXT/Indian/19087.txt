f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg A great addition To Charlotte. Better than any S Asian restaurant I have tried here. Food is at par with many of the NY and SF hole in the walls. 

I do take out frequently from this place

What's awesome
Kababs, Kabab rolls, Chicken Tikkas, Biryani totally rocks, the Naans, Parathas - some of the best. 

If that was not enough, Mr khan is quite a gentleman and a great host. I always get offered multiple cups of tea (free of charge) while I wait for my food.

What's not to love
