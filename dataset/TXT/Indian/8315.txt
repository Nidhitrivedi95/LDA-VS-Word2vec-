The water carafe was dirty too. The service is severely lacking. I waited 45 minutes for a refill on my soda and never got one! It took 1 1/2 hours to eat dinner. I think they were doing a event along with takeout and dine in customers, they just could not handle it! Food was going to the wrong tables and other people were visibly pissed off. I'm not sure if I will go back.
