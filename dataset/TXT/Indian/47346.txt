TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ My boyfriend and I went there today based on the reviews and we were NOT disappointed. We got spices and pepper shrimp, spicy wings, manchurian chicken fried rice, and manchurian fish. Everything was absolutely delicious! This is our new favorite place. The people in there are super nice and helpful as well. Must go!!!
