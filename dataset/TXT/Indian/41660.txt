Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g THE BEST PLACE FOR HAKKA IN THE CITY!
Absolutely love the food! It is delicious with decent portions. I have had their gobhi manchurian, veg manchurian, chilly paneer, hakka noodles and none of the dishes have disappointed me so far. All hakka places I have tried so far have ridikkulus amounts of oil in their food. I am so glad to have found this place. Will definitely recommend to more people and ofcourse coming here anytime I am craving hakka food.
