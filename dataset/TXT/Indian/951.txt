-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I'm originally from DC, the selection of great Indian food is plentiful. Trying to find decent Indian food was rather hard here and finding this little gem was a total score. Food was spiced well and service was friendly. Their samosas was amazing! It's great that it's vegetarian even though I do eat meat, I didn't feel heavy or hungry leaving. Still had leftovers to pack home. It's great that it's located in a grocery store just in case I needed to get ethnic items.
