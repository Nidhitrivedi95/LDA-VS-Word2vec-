K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g Went to this place with high expectations as we got to taste some good food on our previous visit . This time we ordered veg briyani, the rice was too dry and didn't taste fresh, then we odered rava onion masala dosa , dosa itself was good but sambar tasted odd , so we called up the waitress and asked . we were surprised to hear her say that no one else has complained.after this incident we decided not to come here again.
