iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw This place is unbelievable. If you like Indian food at all it will blow your mind. I was ready to do it all over again once I finished. I loved it so much that I decided to write my first review on Yelp because of it. 

If the question is secret sauce...the answer is yes. The fries are even seasoned perfectly to mix with their sauces. The korma sauce was out of this world. 

It will only be a matter of time before this off the strip location is found out about by the mainstream....and these guys deserve every bit of that attention.
