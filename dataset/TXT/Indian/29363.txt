My Experience:

I have been looking forward to trying Woodlands after reading all the wonderful reviews.  I live on the East side of town so I was excited to hear about a restaurant that is actually good over here!  

The location is not ideal and let's just say it isn't in the most "vibrant" part of town.  When I first stepped into the restaurant I was not exactly impressed with the decor or the customer service.  I was there to pick up an order so I didn't get the full dining experience, but the overall vibe wasn't exactly cozy.  It looked like an old motel lobby that had been transformed into a restaurant but they decided to keep the same wall color, carpet, pleather chairs and cloudy chandeliers.  

So, after I got past the dive aspect of this place I was excited to actually try my meal! 

I ordered the mixed veggie curry in a cashew sauce and a friend ordered the Szechwan Noodles (w/ mushrooms).  And, of course, garlic naan.

Mine was good.  The sauce was lacking some flavor but it was decent.  The veggies were a little disappointing because it seemed like they took one of the frozen packets out of harris teeter and cooked them in their homemade sauce.  It was peas, carrots and green beans..pretty generic and definitely not fresh.

The Noodle Szechwan was good.  The coloring was a little off-putting (like a pinkish/red) because of the sauce but it was tasty.

The Naan was awesome...great flavor, crispy and warm--even for a take-out order.

Overall Summary:  This restaurant draws a diverse crowd and those looking for an authentic Vegetarian Indian meal cannot go wrong.  They have a ton of vegan options as well so there is a lot to choose from.  In the scheme of Indian Food in Charlotte I don't know that this was the "best" I have had but if in a crunch I would return.
