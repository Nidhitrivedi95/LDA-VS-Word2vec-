RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Why is this place not packed on a Friday night?!  The food is outstanding....shared the vegetable samosa and vegetable pakora for appetizer.  I had the fish vindaloo and friend had a cauliflower based dish for main course.  All were excellent....which is saying something considering I am primarily a meat eater.  I urge you to check this place out.  They deserve your patronage.
