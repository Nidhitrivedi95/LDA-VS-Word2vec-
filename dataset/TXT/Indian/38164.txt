ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw My native Las Vegas (Las Vegan?) friends said that Origin India was one of the best indian places in Vegas.  And as a whole they were correct.

The food was quite good.  I'm not up on my Indian food names, but I can tell you that we got a lamb dish, a chicken dish, a potato and spinach dish and lots of lentils and naan.  They were all quite tasty though the lamb dish was no where near being as spicy as we requested.  

For the price, I thought the food was just so-so, but I'll give it an extra star for being the "Best in Las Vegas."  The wines were reasonably priced.  The waiter could NOT grasp the concept that we wanted to share everything, which made ordering overly complicated.  

A DJ started playing right when we got there and though the music was pretty cool (techno Indian music and live bongo drums...seriously, it was pretty cool), it was pretty loud and we had to scream and repeat ourselves to uphold our conversation.

Overall a good place, but I can't wait to get some SF dive Indian food.
