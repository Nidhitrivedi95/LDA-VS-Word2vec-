rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg When it comes to Indian food this place is always my fisrt choice. They offer a very complete menu. The dosa are amazing ! The byriani is to die for. Everything I've tried there was really good. They have a good variety of vegetarian choices as well. The serivce is friendly and quick; you might not get it in French but they are really trying their best. It's an BYOW, that's a nice plus. The prices are really decent for teh huge portion you get. The decor and lightening are not the best but it's really not a big deal.  Might just not be the place for a first date:)
