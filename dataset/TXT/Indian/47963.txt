TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This was such tasty punjabi food, I just loved it, we were visiting with family from India and even if my taste buds have changed a lot living here, they said this was the best that they have seen so far, the place got really crowded soon after we were seated that did not frazzle them a bit, service was awesome, food arrived in no time and in all one of my best experiences for Indian food in a place filled with visitors, can't wait to go back. : ))
