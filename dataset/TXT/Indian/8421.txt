Pros: Price is good, for two people it was about $20. I loved their tandoori chicken, so moist and just the right amount of spice. The chicken curry and biryani was good too. The place is also super clean and staff was so nice!

Cons: Wish they had goat curry during weekday buffet. I also wish there was a little more selection. 

Overall, I will be back again! Good value!
