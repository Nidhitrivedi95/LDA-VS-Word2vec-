We order a lot of food, Tandoor chicken, garlic bread (addicting), garlic rice, Chicken soup, and an appetizer or Gulag.

New flavors and new types of food! Can't get any better. The chicken soup was very small it was $6.99 so that took me by surprise. 

The Garlic bread was addicting be ware!! 

The tandoori chicken was very good. Had lots of flavors and different spices I haven't tried before. With garlic rice, it was a great combo. 

Get the groupon for a great deal.
