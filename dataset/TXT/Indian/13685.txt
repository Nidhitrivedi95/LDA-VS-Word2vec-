bO_JX-lDo5D5JGZhK5Ly3A True - they don't serve meat. True - the lunch buffet is reasonably priced and darn good. Have eaten here several times. Dishes change everytime I have been. Not a huge selection, but I left full and quite happy.

Noticed a bunch of comments on the service. My experience has been that the service is fine. I would not call it stunning, but it is lunch buffet after all. My needs were fairly low - water and some bread. The servers have always been helpful in explaining what everything is when I have asked. 

N*joy
