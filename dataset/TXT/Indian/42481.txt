Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA Decided to check this place out and i have to agree with Rahim The Spicy Dragon Chicken was quite tasty.
Gotta say it's certainly not a classy joint but it sure makes up for it by giving you tasty food, good portions and a good choice of dishes.
From the time we walked in There was non stop traffic. For a small place the move more food than most restaurants on the block put together. Everybody's waking out with giant take out orders.
And looking around at my neighboring tables I'm gonna have to go back and try a few more dishes from their menu.
