0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Lunch and dinner buffet! While the food isn't the greatest, the value and service can't be beat. We went here on a Friday night to indulge in an endless supply of Indian favorites. Some of the selections included chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, goat curry, dal, and baingan bharta. Some of the chicken dishes were off seasoning-wise. One was too salty, while another was too sweet. I was also surprised to see beef on the menu for the buffet. I tried some but was disappointed that the beef meatballs were reheated from a frozen food company. 

A nice perk here is the freshly made naan to go with your meal. 

Desserts included gulab jamun, mango pudding, and kheer (rice pudding). 

Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed. The owner at the check out counter was very friendly and we had no problem redeeming a Groupon that we bought.

We'll definitely be returning for the dinner buffet.
