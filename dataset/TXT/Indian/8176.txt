7IF5cjvH1d97pzvYPnf9Mg We have eaten a few times and we were not disappointed.
I think they could afford to go a little heavier on the spice.

I've had the Paneer dishes and they are fantastic, sometimes a tad oily. I've had the Chicken Tikka too, it came on a big crackling plate and it tasted good, but lacked spice and seemed just a bit overdone. But overall the food is delicious and the service was great. 

The portions were just right for everyone eating, with a bit left over.
