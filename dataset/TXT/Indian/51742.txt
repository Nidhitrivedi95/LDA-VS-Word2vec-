UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Great little restaurant.  Different from other Indian restaurant because they also serve Nepalese cuisine.  Nepalese food is like a marriage of Chinese and Indian, very tasty.  You gotta try.  The wait staff is very friendly and courteous.  I'd definitely bring friends and family here.  Their lunch buffet also looks very good but I haven't tried.  they had a lot of the same food as a la carte menu.
