RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Great experience.  I came here on a Saturday, shortly after 2:00, there were plenty of seats.  As another reviewer mentioned you are seated first, given a menu, and you place your order with the cashier, who gives you a number to put on your table.  Your server offers you drinks, and eventually brings the food.  Service was extremely efficient and friendly.  We had the sizzling chicken with mint sauce, the king fish in a stew, vegetable samosas, garlic naan, and the dal and spinach.  Everything was very good.  Nothing was over-spiced.  I look forward to eating here again!  Oh, and the styrofoam plate thing, if you're knocking off points for that you're a complete fascist.  Part of the outside appeared to be under some kind of construction, but it did not affect anything.  We had mango lassis for dessert.  Go here right away.
