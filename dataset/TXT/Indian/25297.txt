HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A The food was great !! we loved it. The "Dinner for two" in vegetarian course is the best you get to taste among all of their best dishes. I loved the Naan and its curries. 

Though its bit harder to find this place, we eventually managed to locate it and the day we went was totally crowded yet they managed to accommodate us for the dinner. And the service is fast and quality of the food is excellent.!!
