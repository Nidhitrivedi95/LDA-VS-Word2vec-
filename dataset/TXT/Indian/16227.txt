DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA Wish I had known how small and QUICK this restaurant was. It definitely would not have been my choice for my anniversary dinner. 

Flat naan, bland samosa chaat, good lamb vindaloo..... Oh I just remembered we ordered pakoras too, and those tasted like fried nothing. Was excited for the spices and the textures or the onion, cauliflower, and potato but this was just potato hash, the flavor came from the chutneys. ;(
I was also very sad that we were in and out in 30 minutes and we were trying to eat slowly. Everything came out in minutes and our mango lassi was delicious, but I wish it were cold! The temp made it just seem like a bowl of yogurt in a tall glass ;(

My boyfriend and I have been spoiled by eating some really authentic and great Indian food and these were our favorite dishes there. Wasn't terrible, but won't be back.
