TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Really expected great things from the friendly looks of the Palace outside.

This is the perfect example of a hole in the wall. You would never expect to find a restaurant so fancy inside from where these guys are located. They have a wonderful set up inside including a full bar that not many hidden restaurants have to offer. 

Upon ordering takeout...
Looking through their menu, most of the entrees were ranging as low as $14. That doesn't even include rice or any other side dish, which is an additional $6. So I ordered the Lamb Curry with a side of rice and Garlic Naan. Everything was delicious and had the perfect amount of kick. To be on the picky side though, I have to complain about my Lamb being really tough and the pieces were just too large to be eaten. I had to cut every piece into 3 before eating it. Not to mention there were only about 4 pieces in the Curry itself. Like always with Indian food, I enjoyed the Naan the most by dipping it in the Curry sauce and downing it with the free Mango Lassie received upon checking in (which I "forgot" to redeem hehe).

Staff was really friendly, greeted me as I walked in and sure love Yelpers that stop by to eat! They were all up on my phone when they seen the noticeable Yelp App. asking about what I was going to write about, it was funny lol. In the end i do have to say that prices were higher than expected for the quality and quantity of food prepared.
