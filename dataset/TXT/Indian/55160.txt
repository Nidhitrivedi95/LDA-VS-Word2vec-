Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw This place was amazing although we were bummed to find that the buffet was just lunch. The food was amAzing and well priced the portions were totally legit and I loved every bite of my roasted cauliflower dish my friend ordered a less legit mushroom dish that was wrapped in naan type stuff like a giant mushroom panini (was really good as left overs with its three sauces 2 Of which ruled 1 or which was tasteless and odd . there wasn't na'an on the menu thou just other bread not called na'an . I would def think I should point out there's no pictures on the menu and the staff seemed to lack the English skills to convey what exactly each dish was if I was to ask so I just choose to guess turned out well for me not as hot for my buddy
