UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg If someone asks me out for an Indian restaurant; I prefer to steer clear but this time I couldn't and landed up at Banjara Indian Cuisine restaurant.

 Apart from the Indian food and Indian servers there wasn't anything so Indian about the ambience. But as I entered, the aroma just got stuck in my head. This was the tandoori meat and naan that I can smell.

We asked for a table for two which we got after waiting for 10 minutes on a busy evening at 8. I like the servers here and must say they were very warm. Soon we got the table and our order was taken swiftly. We waited for 20 minutes for the appetizers and mango milk shakes to arrive which I would say was worth the wait.

As we proceeded with the main course, Banjara continued to flatter us with the quality of the food. We ordered very spicy and hot version and we got it exactly how we like. I must say there is a huge scope for improvement for garlic naan as it was very low on salt and the half cooked garlic was little depressing. But as the chicken preps were on best side, it covered up for the poor naan's (in terms of taste).

Overall good food and happy experience.
