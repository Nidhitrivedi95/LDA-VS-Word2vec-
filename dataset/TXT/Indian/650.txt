-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q Excellent service, delicious food, happy customers. Came here on a Sunday for the lunch buffet around 2pm, an hour before the buffet closed. The owners were so nice, and they cooked more food when they saw us come in. Everything here is absolutely delicious, especially the naan. I've never enjoyed a buffet as much as Mirch Masala. 

The samosas are amazing when hot, and make sure to mix the sweet chutney with the cilantro chutney together to make a sweet and savory sauce for the samosas. And the tikka masala? Amazing! I can't have dairy, but I couldn't stop eating it after I had some. Mixed on top of the white rice and eaten with naan... Worth it so much. I need to find a lactose pill that'll work for me so I can enjoy this every day.

Servers refill water often, and they didn't turn people away coming in for the buffet close to when it was closing. Space is very large, and the decor is very calm and neat. Parking is everywhere (street and a parking lot a block away). Just rememeber to pay at the front when you're done!

Love it here, and I plan on coming back when I feel like eating like a king.
