8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Should have discovered this place earlier. Best Indian restaurant in town with very reasonable prize. Awesome environment and good services. My boyfriend and I ordered sauteed shrimp as appetizer, a chicken entree, a lamb grill, plus two lasses for only a little over $30. The tandoori specialties are must-tries! I ordered seekh kabab, a lamb sausage kabab, and it tastes awesome!
