gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Excellent!  We love Indian cuisine and this place is great. Shrimp korma was very tasty and chicken tikka masala was also great. Had the garlic naan and also a rice pudding dessert that was yummy. Staff friendly and helpful, food was out fast. Nice environment for families with kids, but not too loud for couples. A really nice night out!
