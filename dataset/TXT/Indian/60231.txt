ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA My review is based solely on the mid-week lunch buffet offered at $8.95.  If you like lot's of rice and lots of sauces, you're in luck.  Lentils, potatoes, and three chicken-based dishes that had very little chicken made up the buffet.  I was expecting a greater variety of entrees including lamb, goat, and tandoori.  The chicken biryani was tasty; however, like the other dishes I wondered, "where's the meat?"  I don't think I'll book my passage to India anytime soon based on today's buffet.
