BLx1j_3rNdZAtdHhZrJIKw Tucked away in Hunter Square behind the Tron Kirk, we would have never seen or known about this restaurant had they not been handing out free pakora samples on High Street. The restaurant itself is nothing special, but the people and service are excellent and the food superb. I have access to great Indian food at home in California but still thought that their onion bahji, veg pakora, and tandoori roti is some of the very best I have had. They can easily accommodate vegans at all levels of spiciness (my wife cannot handle most Indian food). 

While Kushi's has a good location and long reputation, we found their food and service average and they are not able to accommodate vegans very well. Forget Kushi's - head to Royal Spice.
