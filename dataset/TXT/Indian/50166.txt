uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA Maybe the buffet is a better deal. The a la carte is pricey and the portions are small. The food has great taste and the naan was warm and puffy, just like I like it. Ask for ice in your water or you will be stuck with room temperture. 

Waitress was maybe having a bad day, seem to have been distracted and moody. 

I'll give it another try for their buffet and see if they can redeem themselves.
