cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA I went to 5th Elementt with several friends for Summerlicious (lunch menu - $15) and was really impressed with the food and service overall. I also tried several other dishes that my friends ordered. The food here is good for those that enjoy spicier foods, however, you can always ask for a milder version. 

The dishes were generally well presented and the portions was just right (if there was more, I would've felt bloated because the food was delicious). Unfortunately, the naan was very burnt. 

Service: 
The waitress was attentive and friendly but not overbearing. She listened to the individual needs of each order (requests for milder level of spiciness) and was accommodating. We didn't have to wait too long for service or food and the food arrived all at once. 

Food: 

Appetizers
- I selected  the Fennel Spiced Ricotta Chicken Kabab. Unfortunately, this was my least favorite of three dishes. The taste of the food worked wonderfully with the sauce, however, the chicken was a bit dry and the presentation seemed a bit lonely with three small pieces of chicken.
- The Maryland Baked Crab Cake was delicious and delightfully presented in a crab shell. It is on the spicier side (love). The sauce that came with it was mouthwatering. Of the three appetizers that I tried, this one was a favourite.
- The Samosa and Papri Chaat was fun and spicy. It was the most textured out of the three appetizers with a smooth sauce with chopped tomatoes combined with the crunch of the puffed rice and soft interior of the samosa.  The dish was  great but the presentation, although fun, looked a bit on the messier side compared to the other appetizers. 

Entree:
- I chose the Slow Cooked Nizami Goat. It was honestly the best curry I've ever had. The meat was soft, sauce was flavourful, and the level of spiciness was just perfect for me. It was however, the spiciest out of all four entrees that I tried. The rice seemed a bit dried out but tasted fine after you ate it with the curry. 
- The Shrimp Moilee with coconut curry sauce (mild version) was good. It had a nice kick to it but nothing that really stood out for me. 
- The Madras Beef Curry was also good. Unfortunately, by this point I was overwhelmed by the flavours of the Nizami Goat and had little interest in anything else. 
- The Butter Chicken was also well done. It is a bit spicier than I expected and my friends all commented on the interesting flavour as it was the most distinctive out of the 4 dishes that we tried. 

Dessert
- I chose the Pistachio Kulfi and it was an absolute dream. It was like frozen ice cream but full of the nutty pistachio flavour. Combined with the light raspberry (?) drizzle, it was just sweet enough to be a dessert without overpowering the pistachios.
- The Lychee Cardamom Mousse was alright. The taste was there but it was a bit too warm for the occasion (hot day). 

Overall my experience was good. We were also given a $15 voucher (min. amount to spend $35)to use for their regular menu.
