Tv8uaK1ymZES4vjSpr1unQ Nothing impressive. Mediocre food. Usually Iskcon restaurants are very good. This one didn't meet expectations. Just because this restaurant is in the temple, it can't be reviewed as great food. They could do better. The people serving were nice and the place itself was spacious and clean.
