iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I wanted to give it 4 stars because they got rid of my favorite Macedonian wine on their wine list, but I am not that type of a person, this place is legit.

Great food and atmosphere, came down here on a Wednesday night around 7-8PM and it was packed. 

We shared a couple of aps and some small plates, they were all really good. You won't make a mistake by choosing whatever from the menu.
