TlWXWTycakYiPeRc4d3yTQ We tried this restaurant seeing there was a management change.  Although the people seem genuine and helpful there is no customer service....no smiles...no thank you's.......the food was awful....it's almost as if they steeped everything with tea and let it go bitter.   Overloaded with spices there is a terrible aftertaste.   It's too bad because this restaurant could have a loyal following if it executed right in Quality, Service and Ambiance.   Sadly the ownership change has not resulted in a revamped operation.  Tables were not cleaned right away...no uniforms....this place shows desperation to a paying guest....I'm taking my food spend elsewhere.
