New decor. Bigger restaurant. Same fabulous beer menu. Same silly menu. But the name has changed and there's now a lunch buffet.

Sadly, the new lunch buffet is almost all Indian food with little Himalayan or Nepalese. BUT....this is one of the best Indian restaurants in Vegas, and I'd even put it up there with some of the best Indian food in the San Francisco Bay Area.

This ain't your typical greasy Indian buffet. The food is fresh and delicious. This is one of the best budget restaurants in town and my old review gave them 4 stars, but I'm adding another star for the new, beautiful decor.

Old review: 
1) Why go to a Himalayan restaurant and get Indian food?
2) Maybe it's because this place has been under new ownership for about 9 months but at least half the menu is Nepalese/Himalayan food. Yes, there is Indian food on the menu. But I didn't eat any of it and you don't have to either unless you want to.
3) there is no lunch buffet anymore.

We had the Nepalese Sampler Platter (split one between two of us which was plenty of food for a not-heavy dinner) and it was wonderful! The only thing that looked even remotely Indian was the dessert.

We had some kind of black eyed pea dhal-ish kind of thing that was a bit bland but still nourishing and tasty.

A cucumber, potato, cilantro salad was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten.

The lamb was scrumptious. I'm not huge on chicken but it was pretty good.
There was some kind of bamboo shoot salad that was oddly compelling. No clue what was in it.

And the momo! Oh man it is ALL ABOUT the MOMO!! I could eat these tasty dumplings all day long.

Phenomenal beer selection. Friendly owner. Great food.

If you like spice, don't ask for 5. The 5 was really quite mild.
