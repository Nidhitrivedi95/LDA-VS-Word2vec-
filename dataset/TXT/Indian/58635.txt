yLmZPpg57FRukoqlLZH_dQ I just ordered some Dabeli, Chaat and Masala Fries today for Valentine's Day and it seemed to have been a big hit! The food was authentic and very flavourful. The food also looked like it did in the advertisements.

Jalsa also had great customer service - I live out of the province and wanted something delivered to my girlfriend's place at a certain time and the food was there at the exact time that I requested, along with a kind "Happy Valentine's Day" wish.

Thank you and will definitely order again!
