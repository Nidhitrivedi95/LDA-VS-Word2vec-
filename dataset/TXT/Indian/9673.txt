8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw I started working in downtown Pittsburgh about a month ago and have been looking for a place to grab reasonable lunch when I don't have time to pack.  Sree's fits the bill.

I often eat vegetarian and chose to try out three of their entrees.  The grape leaves were by far the best with fresh, lively flavors.  The chickpeas and mixed veggies, while also good, were fairly bland.  I do appreciate that the food is not greasy, many of the other options in Pittsburgh hit the stomach hard with grease.

Lastly, and while I hesitate to use strong words here, the naan is pitiful.  It is strikingly food-service-esque.
