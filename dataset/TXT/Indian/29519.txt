jRxLnJ9my31Re_O2MvQGhw Welcome to the neighborhood guys. This place has been open less than 6 months and it's quickly making a good name for itself. I visited strictly because of the great reviews on yelp so far.
 I was greeted by the owner right as I walked in. His personality is very lively and infectious. You get how passionate he is about what he is doing.
 I told him I had never been there before and so began the train of samples. It was unreal. "Try this, try this, try this". I was stuffed when I left and my order was to go. 
 The rice bowls are different. They like to play with flavors. It's like going to you buddies house that everyone says should open a restaurant. We'll this guy did. 
My wife is celiac, so he ran through the ingredients he uses and made her something we both felt was safe for her to eat. She loved it. It was a buffalo chicken bowl. 
 I ordered the gyro, which was very good. I ate even though I was stuffed. To be honest, I bursting at the seams. My fault for over eating. 
If you are in the Steele creek area, visit this small business and show them some love. They deserve it.
