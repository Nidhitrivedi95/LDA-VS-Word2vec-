CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A Admittedly, I've never had the lunch buffet; as for the dinner menu, though? Delicious! The Boy and I eat there at least once a week, often twice. We go through withdrawals if we're away too long!

Since we're both veg*n, I can only attest to the Vegetarian offerings, but between the two of us, I think we've had everything in the Veg section, and we've never had a bad meal here. Every plate has the option of mild/medium/spicy, and extra rice is always available free (even when you take half of the food home, as I usually have to do). The portions are perfect in that, if you're like him, it's a perfect stomach-stuffer -  and if you're like me, I always have leftovers for the next day! 

Particularly good dishes are the Baingan Bhartha, Vegetable Mango, and Bhindi Masala (The cheese-eating Boy swears by the Saag Mushroom and Paneer Jalfrazie). The Samosas are wonderful, and the onion chutney is always amazing. Be sure to add a Taj Mahal beer for the perfect meal. :)

The prices are great (two meals, an appetizer, and a couple of drinks comes to less than $30 before tipping). The service is always prompt and friendly, and while the atmosphere is casual (we often venture in in hoodies and jeans), you could easily make it a nice date outing (the lighting is soft and the decor nice enough). Taj is an all-around great establishment with a great family-owned feel that's friendly without being overbearing.
