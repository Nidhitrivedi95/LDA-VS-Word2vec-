xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w The food was fresh, well prepared and delicious. The service was friendly and attentive. Not a fan of the ambiance, but I'm not there to eat the decor.

I went on a Saturday night around 6pm it was busy but not packed. I had samosas and they were freshly made, crispy on the outside and tender inside with a little spice. I tried the szechuan chicken, basically fried chicken pieces with onion, green peppers and hot peppers which again were freshly made, crispy outside and tender inside. 

I was looking for palak paneer (cheese in creamy spinach) which they call saag paneer, and they were helpful in pointing me to what I was looking for. It was a large portion with tender rice. I also had the garlic naan, which was good but I wished they had cooked the garlic a bit before putting on the bread, it came out kind of raw. Regardless it was delicious, including the mango lassi.

I like spicy so I asked for some chili sauce which went wonderfully with everything, so be sure to ask for it if you like spicy. A bit on the expensive side considering there are paper napkins, but the portions were generous enough that I had plenty for a meal of leftovers. All of the servers were friendly and professional, no complaints there. My one complaint was the music - a bit obnoxious and a little loud for my taste.

Overall a very good Indian meal.

The strip mall it is in is on top of a hill with only a sign with all the shop names visible, so keep your eyes peeled if you are from out of town.
