RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Writing this review, I'm almost scared to express anything less than wonder, for fear that my infinitely more culturally authentic friends will smack me upside the head for having the nerve to speak through my ignorance - and about their beloved Lahore TIkka at that (though, fear not, my uninformed thoughts are nevertheless quite positive) - but in my mouth I trust, so I will say it as I tasted it.

We had the karahi gosht, sizzling beef ribs, and chicken biriyani, along with naan and kashmiri chai (mmm). I loved the kashmiri chai, which has inspired me to make it my next DIY project (but then, you throw pistachios in just about anything and I'm sold). And the chicken biriyani is, without doubt, the finest I have tasted, with exquisitely tender, perfectly seasoned chicken, which was saturated to the bone with flavour. The rest of the food was also quite good, and expertly seasoned... but (and I tremor to say this) I think it is possible that I have had better (gasp!). It's also worth noting that the food was liberally oily, all was served almost fast-food-style (styrofoam + disposable cutlery, order up front), and you will come away with a day's worth of gastritis as a souvenir - but I can get over these things pretty easily, if only for that chicken and the kashmiri chai.

Overall, I can see where people are coming from - on both sides. This is a place where flavour rules, but they're not going out of their way to please you. They do what they do, and if you don't like it there's more than enough people who do, so you can just move along and stop taking up space from someone who will appreciate it.

I think I have to come back for that chicken biriyani though. It's really not an option.
