auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ The last time I ordered take out from this place I got extremely burnt naan bread. Willing and excited to give them another try, I put special instructions on my next take out order for non burnt naan bread.... 

Still got some. Really wanted to like this place because the rest of my order wasn't bad But this killed it for me. Not ordering from them again.
