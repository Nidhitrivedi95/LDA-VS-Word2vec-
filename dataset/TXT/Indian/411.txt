-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Updating my review based on owner's rigid, arrogant ,unacceptable attitude and inflexibility to improve based on customer feedback-

If there was an option of giving ZERO STARS.. i would promptly do so..! Highly disappointed with the quality of indian food served here.
First of all THIS IS NOT INDIAN FOOD GUYS .. BLAND,TASTELESS without any indian aroma whatsoever. I wonder how is this place even 4 stars..REALLY??
Stopped by this restaurant during a recent visit to AZ and i must say being an indian i wouldn't recommend this place at all for all who seek for good aromatic authentic indian food.
First impression - THE PLACE SMELLS BAD.
Second - biriyani is not cooked blandly in a rice cooker & left out on a buffet :)
third - BAD & ARROGANT CUSTOMER. BEWARE!!! 
fourth - hate the food .. how can food be so BLAND & TASTELESS
fifth - you guys are representing indian food here in states, do not give an wrong impression by justifying people like mild food. People appreciate good authentic food not hybrid ( TASTELESS ) one.
Waste of money.. never would return to this place.
