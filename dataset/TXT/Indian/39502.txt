Came here with a large group of friends, this was my first Hakka experience so I really was not sure what to expect. We came in and were seated rather quickly, this is a small place in a Scarborough strip-mall. Being a large group we decided to order a few dishes and share everything (which is probably the best thing to do at this place since the portions are so large). 

The best dish of the night was definitely the pekoras (we ordered the veggie and chicken) these were moist, crispy and seasoned with cumin which gave them a nice smoky flavor, this was probably the least spicy dish of the night. The house shrimp was also very good, lightly breaded fried shrimp that had a nice spicy kick to it

Honourable mention goes to the Manchurian rice which was a neon red fried rice made with red chillies, it was quite spicy. The special chicken which was another neon red dish it was pretty good. The chili chicken and Manchurian noodles were just ok nothing special. 

The service here was surprisingly friendly as most cheap Chinese restaurants in Scarborough tend to have atrocious service. The server was very patient with our large group, we had a vegetarian who could not eat eggs and he gladly had our rice and noodles made with no eggs and was more than willing to make sure the chicken and veggie pekoras came on separate plates, A+ for service! In the end we all ate until we were stuffed and the bill worked out to about 10 dollars each including tip, SO CHEAP. If you are looking for a cheap and spicy meal this may be the place for you, I for one will be back.
