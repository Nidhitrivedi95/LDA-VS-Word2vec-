MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg I reluctantly give this place 5 stars. I say that only because of the line ups and I feel that their system could be greatly improved. But it didn't feel right hitting them with less than 5 stars because their food and prices are so damn good. I always get their samosas and everyone LOVES them - at your next event you have to get them... your guests will love them!  At 5/$1 you can't go wrong. This is a place that I crave every now and then.
