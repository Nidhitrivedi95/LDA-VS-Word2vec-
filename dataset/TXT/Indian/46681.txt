SZuroTnXB7FwOlHp8Jahyg The place has amazing interiors, with the big bar and seating in two floors. We ordered Peshawari Chicken Tikka, Bhatti ke Kebab, Atlantic Salmon, Butter Chicken, Lamb dum biryani and Garlic Naan. The food was great, the best I've had in Indian restaurants in GTA. Highly recommended!!
