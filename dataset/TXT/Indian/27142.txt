Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag This is the best indian food I have eaten in Las Vegas. We went at lunch and orderedChhole bhature,  Shahi Paneer and Palak paneer kofta and it came with naan and little tice. Quantity of serving was not much in my opinion but the taste was good. I would recommend this reataurant in Las Vegas
