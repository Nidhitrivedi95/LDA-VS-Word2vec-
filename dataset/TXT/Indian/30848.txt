KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Atmosphere was fine and the service was excellent but the reason I come to restaurants is.....to eat and in that department PTI falls apart.

We ordered drinks to begin and I asked the waitress if the bartender knew how to make a sloe gin fizz.  She said she didn't know but would ask then came back to tell me "he's looking it up".  I gambled but shouldn't have as the drink was nothing even close.  Not a good start.

The four of us ordered an assortment of food and shared it between us.  The lamb meat was grisly although the taste was good.  Prawn dish was fine with big, meaty prawns but not many of them and the sauce, ordered medium, was anything but spicy.  Vindaloo was spicy enough but only about 10 chunks of chicken in the dish.  

We got both garlic and onion naan and it was good.  

Summary: It wasn't bad but isn't worth going back either.
