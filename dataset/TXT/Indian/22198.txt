GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw We were on the strip and starving after a night out. We explored multiple buffet options and found Bombay Indian cuisine!! We had amazing authentic Indian food!! The ambience was amazing. The best part was the fresh&hot naan served directly to the table! Very friendly service. Will be back next time I am in Vegas.
