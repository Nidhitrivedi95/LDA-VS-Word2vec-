2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw It wasn't too packed for dinner on a Friday at 6PM and there was quite a few parking spots. We ordered the biryani, butter chicken, chicken platter, and a paneer curry.  We also ordered the lassi for dessert. 

I thought the highlights of the meal was definitely the biryani and the garlic prawns. The biryani was wrapped in naan and you had to cut it open to get to it. It was fresh and flavourful. The prawns were equally amazing. They wee tend and flavourful. If you were looking at an appetizer to start, I'd definitely go with the prawns. Naan was refilled frequently and service overall was quite prompt.

I'd didn't like some of the types of chicken on the chicken platter. It was a bit dry but the sauce that came with it definitely did help with the taste.  The shahi paneer and butter chicken were alright.  I did like the chilli paneer. 

After eating all of that, it was time for dessert. We were pretty stuffed and the lassi was quite heavy. So be warned if you are already fill. It did taste  good overall. If I'm ever looking for Indian food in the area, I'd definitely return.
