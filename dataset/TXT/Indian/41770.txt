Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw Honestly, given the level of vitriol in some of the reviews here, I was expecting the worst from Chef of India. But it's really not that bad. (I've had much, much better Indian food, but I've also had far worse.)

We ordered two dishes: Vegetable Korma and Chicken Vindaloo.

The Chicken Vindaloo ("Chicken cooked with red hot chillies with potatoes in hot and sour gravy") is clearly the superior of the two. The sauce is rich and spicy, while the fairly plentiful chicken was devoid of bad, inedible pieces. (It might've been a little dried out, admittedly.) The presence of a bay leaf notwithstanding, I really enjoyed eating this dish.

Not so much with the Vegetable Korma ("Mixed vegetables cooked with cashew nuts, onion, cream and spices"), unfortunately. First and most egregious, the vegetables had clearly emerged directly from a bag out of the freezer, as they were uniformly soggy and tasteless. (The telltale jagged cut on the pieces of carrot gave it away immediately.) Other than that, the sauce was hopelessly bland and devoid of spice, so there was really nothing within this dish that worked.

I mean, would I ever order from Chef of India again? Probably not, given the wealth of other, better options in the area. But you could do worse in a pinch.
