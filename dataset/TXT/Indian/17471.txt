DPsbhgdHty--Jegj_yNaUQ Chef of India seems to be the only surviving Indian restaurant in the neighbourhood considering there used to be 5+ less than a year ago.  The food and overall selection is solid.  They have lots of veggie options and are pretty consistent on a return visitor basis. I'm a big fan of their lunch buffet takeout.  For approx $11 (tax in) you can walk out with a huge amount of fresh food.

Decor is nice and the staff is friendly.  I have never seen this place full or particularly busy, but it would make a nice place for an evening out.
