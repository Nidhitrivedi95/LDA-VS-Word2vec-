The waitress was very nice, although too young to serve alcohol and was extremely inexperienced. We ordered an appetizer to share and 3 entrees, about 5 mins later we were told they didn't have ingredients for one of them. No problem, we changed the order and happily waited about ten minutes until they brought out 2 of the 3 entrees we ordered, telling us it'd be a bit longer as the 3rd was coming from a clay oven. The 2 with food started eating and shared our food with the 3rd, so she wouldn't faint with hunger. The entire meals were both completely finished, so we took the 3rd meal to go. No one over the age of 16 seemed to care that we weren't happy. We tipped the waitress 20% and will never be back. Too bad, as the food that we actually got was decent.
