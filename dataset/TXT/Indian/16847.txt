DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg This place is a savior on work days .Lunch buffet is a pretty good deal and the highlight of it is you will be served dosa's of your choice to your table. All you get is just vegetarian and typical south Indian touch in every item. I basically not a fan but sometimes it's OK when your crowd is vegetarians .

Coming to the ambience and the staff , you will not have a complaint . Recommended for a try.
