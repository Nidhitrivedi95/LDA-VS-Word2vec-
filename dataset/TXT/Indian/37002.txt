o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I am giving 1 star because we never even tasted the food. There was one waitress and she was completely overwhelmed. I actually felt sorry for her. We waited 10 minutes just to get our menus. We waited another 30 minutes and still nobody took our order. We paid for our drinks and left. Unfortunately, we had to leave in order to get back to our office. We set aside time to specifically try out Saffron but were disappointed. Maybe we will try again in the future.
