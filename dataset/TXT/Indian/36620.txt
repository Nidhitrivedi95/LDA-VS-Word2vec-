NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I have been here numerous times now and have yet to be disappointed. The food is excellent and the staff is super nice and helpful in figuring out the menu - which for a first timer can be overwhelming. Anytime I am in the area I make a special stop! Always happy to stop in and get the lamb meatball bbq meal with tikka masala... Keep up the great work.
