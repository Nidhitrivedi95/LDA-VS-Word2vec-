iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw I'm simply amazed at how great, delicious the food was. Along with its great decor: Cozy look with the mix of casual and a little fanciness. I ate butter chicken as my main course, butternut squash soup as an appetizer and house wine (white) for a drink. Lastly, white chocolate berry for dessert. All of which were DE-LI-CIOUS. 
Me and my girlfriend, we were more than pleased to be here. Very quick service, kind staff, amazing food! Definitely recommend it, one of the best food experiences I've had in a while. A 10/10
