9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g I've been here four other times since the opening and have enjoyed the lunch buffet. At the most recent visit, the desserts were off as the gulab jamun was overly soaked in the syrup and too sweet for my tastebuds. I usually can eat two of these sweet dough balls but not that day. Also, the homemade mango ice cream had a lot of ice crystals in it. The fish fry had some cold pieces and the chicken vegetable soup,  we think,  was labeled wrong. It was a dark brown broth that tasted strangely like watered down soy sauce. Perhaps it was because we arrived right at the beginning of the work lunch crowd on a Monday?  
What can I say,  I have a sweet tooth and sometimes that makes or breaks my experience. I'd definitely  go back but I won't be counting on the desserts.
