I had the vegetarian special on Sunday which gives you three vegetarian curries, rice, an order of naan, yogurt sauce, rice pudding, and soup/salad to start for $8.95!!! In Madison, that's a bargain; at any price with food this good, it's awesome. The staff was great and it was nice and cool; clean space.
