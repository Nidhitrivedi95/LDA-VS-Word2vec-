GyHJAwBQ58L3ORBLm0G-hg When we moved from CA a few years ago, we tried in vain to find an Indian restaurant in the valley that could deliver the amazing tasting Indian food we enjoyed in CA.  Then we tried India's Grill (their former name at their former location in Mesa) and rejoiced.  Hands down best Indian food we've found in the Valley.

We were sad when they closed the Mesa location but recently learned they reopened at India Grill in Tempe.  Since then we've been back half a dozen times.  The Chicken Tikka and Chicken Tikka Masala are incredible!!!  And the naan bread is great.  They even have Flying Horse beer, which is not easy to come by.

The new location is even a little nicer than the previous one, although neither are convenient to us.  It's still way worth the drive!!

FYI, we never do the buffet.  Not our thing.  We always order off the menu, so this place shouldn't be tagged a "buffet" only place.
