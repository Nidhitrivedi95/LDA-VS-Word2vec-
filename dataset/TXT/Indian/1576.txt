-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA The bad reviews must be old,  this place is fantastic! The food is always excellent and the service is friendly and attentive. Seems like they get a late rush, Monday we were in at 7 and the place was empty but by 8:30 there were at least 10 tables full. If you like Indian food or have never tried it you should check it out.
