PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ There is a lot on the menu, but I found only two things decent. The goat curry and the white ridicules. Pani puris are mediocre and rest of it, below average as well. 
If you like quantity, go, if you like quality, you may have luck with one or two things.
Over priced, but you pay for the wastage!!
