0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I changed my mind.  I've come back a few times since my last review and have had the chili chicken (dry), butter chicken and hot and sour soup too.  The dry chilli chicken is delicious.  However, what I really like about this place is their service, even for takeout.  In most cases, when you order takeout, you just sit there and wait.  While you wait here, they are nice enough to offer you a glass of water. I know water is free, but it's those little gestures that I really appreciate.  

During one of most recent visits, I had butter chicken and hot and sour soup.  I've never had butter chicken from a Hakka place before and I was hesitant, but it was listed under "Chef speciality", so I had to try it.  While it wasn't the typical orange butter chicken we have here (it was a dark red), it was absolutely divine.  It actually had a nice aroma and you could taste the butter and spices.  It wasn't spicy and maybe it's not what I'm used to, but it doesn't matter. It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!  And all dinner entrees come with rice so the butter chicken with rice was such a delicious combo.  I got up with the intention of getting tacos this morning, but now that I am writing this review, I am conflicted lol.  

As for the hot and sour soup, it had plenty of tofu and veggies and chicken (I think), and while spicy, it had a good flavour to it.  Probably one of the best hot and sour soups I've had.  

Overall, while this place is slightly small for Mississauga standards, it's probably one of the best hidden secrets in the area! Done salivating yet? Just go there.  Peace out.
