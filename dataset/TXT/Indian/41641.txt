Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g We have been here a few times and I last reviewed it in February. Sadly, things seem to have changed. The poor waiter was overrun by a lot of customers. We were given lunch menus and they were yanked away as it was a few minutes past lunch time. I felt William Foster in the movie Falling Down except for the redemption. They have a very diverse menu but there are no explanations as to what is in the dish.
We were hoping for some nice onion bhaji...They didn't have any vegetable bhaji so we tried paneer bhaji. They tasted like bocconcini (I have panner many times) covered in heavy fish and chip batter. Tolerable at best. Our 2 curries (1 veg and 1 beef) were horrendous, they tasted like MSG and plastic, no spicy flavour at all. We both took a bite of each and found it inedible. I ended up eating rice. Despite the rush the service was good and quick. We very politely commented on our food and in a classy move they comped both of our dishes. I have never had  poor food at the two other restaurants in the trio. Perhaps it was just a bad day.
