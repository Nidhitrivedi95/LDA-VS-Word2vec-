prFx0Kg92PfPkoU8OY4KxA I dropped by today to have the lunch buffet.  Nirvana is the former Indian Paradise which was located on Hayden.  It was my favorite indian restaurant so I made it my business to find their new location if there was one.  Fortunately they relocated on Northsight so I breathed a sigh of relief.   
The buffet was varied, fresh and of course delicious. It included veggie dishes, salad items, rice, soup, and chicken dishes.  Many vegetarian options.  We were served fresh bread which I believe had a hint of garlic.  My hubby loved it. I tried the mango lassi for the first time and really enjoyed it.  
I spoke to the owner, Anjeli, who was happy to see us again but not as happy as we were to be at her new place.  She was a delight to speak to.  This is one of the great things about this restaurant--the owners are attentive and focussed on customer service.  I hope everyone rushes to Nirvana as a new restaurant needs a lot of customers to make it a success.
