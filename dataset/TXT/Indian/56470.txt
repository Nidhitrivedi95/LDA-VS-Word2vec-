XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Came all the way to downtown to try the place. Worth the trip :)
Owner and staff are super nice, more like a family kitchen, we saw lots Tibet people having lunch here too. Food are great! especially the milktea, the first time have home taste since I came to torono. 
Will come back again for sure! :D
