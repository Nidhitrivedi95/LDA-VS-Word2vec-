kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A Was expecting excellent food and pulled in 6 of us but was dissatisfied 
. Iddli felt frozen and defrosted rather than fresh batter
. Dosa was made from yeast, not naturally fermented
- chatni was made from dried coconut, not fresh

Last but most importantly, the quality of a restaurant is measured by the cleanliness of its restrooms. Don't store table cleaning sprays under the sink in the restroom !
