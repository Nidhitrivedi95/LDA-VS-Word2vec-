zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA The good: The food here is incredibly delicious. They really do a good job with the quality/quantity of food. We've had many different dishes, and they are all top notch.

So why the 3 stars? The service is remarkably bad. Allow me to explain; it's not that the servers are douches or anything like that. In fact, they are pretty nice. But the timing out of the kitchen is really really bad. Both times that I have been here, we have waited for our food for an hour. Now, to be fair, the food is good enough that we were willing to wait, but at no time did someone come out and warn us how long it was going to take, or even apologize to us about the wait. 

I think they have their act together for lunch - my guess is that they have a bunch of stuff already prepped in back for that time period. But for dinner? Hit or miss in terms of timing. We saw other tables of two have their orders taken and food brought out and be done with their meal before we ever saw any action at our table. So, maybe the secret is to come in party sizes less than four. Whatever the secret is, just be forewarned: don't come here if you have somewhere you need to be in a hurry afterwards.
