0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw For those who don't know what Hakka cuisine is, it's basically Chinese food with an Indian twist. Apparently created by Chinese who moved to India, this style of food has become a category of its own and grown to follow people around the world, and I'm grateful! 

Danforth Dragon is a really great place for Hakka. The quality is good; not the best, but pretty darn good. More importantly, it's not too oily which can often be the case with Hakka cooking. The prices are bog standard for the city but that's a good thing as it's very reasonable.

You can't go wrong with Danforth Dragon if you're a fan of either Chinese or Indian food.
