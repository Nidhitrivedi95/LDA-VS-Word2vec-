yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Hands down, the best Indian food in Las Vegas!!!!! 
Being a Las Vegas resident and having eaten Indian food across the world, I can honestly say that India Masala is an absolute winner.  The interior is plush, comfortable, clean, and well built.  From the moment you walk in, you feel that you are transported for a dining experience half a world away.  I think what knocks out the competition are the unique and flavorful spices.  Spices I have never tasted before.  The entree melts in your mouth and wanting more and more.  The menu has everything you could ask for in an Indian restaurant, and the service was top notch.  I was also shocked at the outstanding prices.  Basically, I cant wait until I have the chance to eat there again!  Recommend for any occasion without hesitation!
