xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Still the same rating, even though the food is quickly growing on me! (I think you'll understand why in a sec.)

My family decided to order takeout today, and were intrigued by the side orders whereby you can order by 8oz., 12oz., or 20oz. We thought that this was perfect, and a great value - we'd be getting almost a pound of meat for only $7 to $8!

However, when we went to get our order, we were massively disappointed. It turns out that the 8oz wasn't by weight (which was what we thought the reasonable person would expect), but by volume. For what we paid, we received only 2 tiny containers of food!

Despite all this criticism, the food was tasty, rich, and delicious. My favourite is without doubt the goat, but it turns out the duck is really good as well! All are fall off the bone tender.
