VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg Good food, with a nice menu. Some people have complained about the price. My wife and I have used discount cards from Restaurant.com and it's made the meal much more affordable. They always honor the cards with no complaint. The service has always been good. Nice waiters and the owner always comes to check on how things are going. While not as good as some Indian places I have been to in other cities, for food in Cleveland Hts. it's pretty decent.
