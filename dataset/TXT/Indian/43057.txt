RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg It's 4th of July and most of the restaurants were closed, we saw this place and thought we'd try it. We have been to India numerous times, and this is amazingly good and authentic Indian food.  A great menu with lots of choices, and the quality was first class. We highly recommend this place if you like Indian food or if you want to try something delicious and different.
