_Q0JeKDrzldpBUgswhlLyA Via satellite the industrial parks near Dundas and Hwy 403 resemble a featureless grey morass. George Orwell no doubt envisioned these sort of drab units when pondering the future. But unlike 1984, there is White Gold at the end of the dystopian rainbow.

Open seven days a week, this Gujarati-run place is a doubleplusgood place to score fried Indian goodies, sweets and snacks. It's a takeout place, so there isn't room to stick around and it's adviseable to call ahead. We placed an order for 30 samosas for $0.50 each, and also picked up a pound of assorted sweets ($8). 

The samosas here are quite different than the soft, flaky and plump variety I am used to. These are firm, crispy, and uniform in size. You'll probably notice the potato filling is cleanly chopped rather than mashed. In a sense, these samosas are a bit too perfect. Not my favourite, but OK. 

They fare better with the sweets. Standouts include the almond and cashew mithai (look for the beige diamonds with silver foil on top) and their peda. Their peda are soft-round circles with a cross on top. Brilliant.

There are better options for both sweets and samosas in Mississauga, but White Gold is certainly a great choice.

Obligatory Title Pun: Worth its weight in GOLD.

Menu Readability: There is is a price list above the counter, but you're best to just ask what's up.

Need to mention: You could get a decorative box for an extra $2, but the regular ones are shiny enough for me.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'm pretty casual about the use of terms like "dystopia."
