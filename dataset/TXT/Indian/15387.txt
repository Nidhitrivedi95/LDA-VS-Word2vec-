ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ Service there is TERRIBLE! We were seated at our table, 15 minutes later, we got our menus and then had to wait another 15 minutes to get water and have our order taken. They are so disorganized that we had 2 different people come and try to take our order after we already did. I can understand if they were busy service can be slow, but there were only 4 other tables with customers.  I could see other people looking around for their waiter so they can order. One table complained to the waiter that they have been waiting for an hour and a half for their food. On top of that, their order was wrong and the waiter tried to tell them that what they were eating was chicken, even though it was really lamb.

Our food went to the wrong table and our waiter got yelled at by who I am assuming is the owner in the middle of the dining room. When our food did arrive, they forgot our naan and so we had to wait for that. When we asked for water, we had to wait 15 minutes and had to ask two people for our check when we were done

Another table next to us kept receiving doubles of everything they ordered, even though they ordered one. When they tried to put in another order for take out, the waiter came by 3 times to verify the order and he still couldn't get it right. Finally, the man at that table told the waiter to "be attentive and listen closely" to what he is ordering because the waiter could not get it right to save his life.  

I was wondering why there were hardly any customers in the dining room on a Friday night, but now I know why!! Avoid this place!

I registered on Yelp just to write this review because it was one of the most worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.
