a8o8OMGhWg4JwbuMMnVOHQ I LOVED this place. First off, all their food is hallal which is a definite plus. Every dish we got was absolutely delicious! The steak was smooth to cut through and so juicy. The appetizers they gave was a bonus, it was hummus and breadstricks. The restaurant has a beautiful sleek and classy vibe to it. The staff was ridiculously nice and welcoming. It's definitely a place you want to dress up to. We were there for a surprise party and they were really helpful in helping us coordinate it.  Their menu ranged from sandwiches, to pasta, to steaks. They sadly had maybe 3 veggie options. I eyed some that maybe could be customizable.  The prices are a bit high, but I would say fair. Most dishes were about 20$+
