Im a big fan of their pakoras to start, with some tikka masala and tasty naan to finish.  Their tandoori chicken is also pretty good, and is all boneless pieces of chicken breast with lots of sauce, just like butter chicken or tikka masala, whereas a lot of places in the past I've had tandoori from are actual chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, breasts, etc) that have been baked in a tandoori oven and less saucey and usually on the bone. So take that into consideration if you are looking for more of a half/full chicken when ordering.
