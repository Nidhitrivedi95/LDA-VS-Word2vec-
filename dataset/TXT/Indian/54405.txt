vzjmi_Cxom5b1OVQC3B6MA Indian Spice Kitchen is pretty cool. Located in a weird area, away from solid restaurants, and I don't count the Bombay Palace as 'decent'.  The system is mainly buffet during lunch and everything is offered in relatively smaller portions at the buffet table and frequently refreshed. 

They have an appetizing assortment of salads and DIY Chaat, about eight to ten vegetarian mains and about six to ten meat options. They also have a well-used tandoor. 

I would give this place 4 stars but many of the mains were very hot and spicy. Obviously, I should be well-prepared bearing the name, but heartburn after a meal is not really my thing.
