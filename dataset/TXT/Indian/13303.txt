bfR-vJvrjdOJaWsXGJgzPA I ordered the 2 curry choices with the rice pilaf; saag paneer ( cheese & spinach) and the tofu butter curry. It was horrible. There was no flavor, it was cold and not fresh. I don't even know how they call this stuff Indian food.

People have a misconception that Indian food is greasy and unhealthy- if you go to any cheap fast food joint chances are that quality will be sacrificed!

This place should call it quits!
