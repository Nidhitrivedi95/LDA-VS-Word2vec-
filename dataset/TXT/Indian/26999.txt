iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I came in and had lunch with my wife and she got the chicken tikka misala. I got the shrimp korma. And it was AMAZING!!! Best Indian food I have ever had!!! Hands down!!!! Service was on point and quick. And our server told us that the restaurant is going to be remodeled with a bar. Super excited about this! They gained a new regular! I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
