Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw Nice Indian buffet with what seemed like a decent selection. I really enjoyed the butter chicken. I finished 2 well-filled plates and left stuffed. I only wish that Chef of India trimmed the meats with more care. When you smother meat in sauce to the point that the diner cannot see fat or bones, there shouldn't be any. It should be easy to eat. 

I don't want any nasty crunchy surprises, and neither do my teeth.
