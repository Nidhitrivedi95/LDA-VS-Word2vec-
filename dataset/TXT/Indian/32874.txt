llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg As a first time visitor to Madison, this place was a great way to start exploring the restaurant scene. 5 stars for their food. Reasonably priced, perfect amount of oil, fresh taste, adequate amount of spice and decent serving portions. Staff is friendly and accommodative and genuinely cared about making sure we had a good experience. They give plenty of rice on the side so I would recommend sharing one naan between two people. I will be going back to try their daily lunch buffet !
