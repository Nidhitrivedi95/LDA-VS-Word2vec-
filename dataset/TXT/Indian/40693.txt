PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw I order shrimp biryani on yelp, I was given chicken. I need to start verifying my orders when I got to this places.
Also the biryani was the worse I have ever had. It was plain, not full of flavour like biryani should.
If you love biryani don't go here.
There are other good ones around.
