C_chktl5jFeRqu1C0rmScA Authentic dishes with good flavor. Large amounts for a low price.  Their Pomfret fry and cooked dishes are splendid. Their vegetarian options are also nicely done which is rare in most other places. However it is a small place with limited seating so the seats are pretty close together. When we went there, there were just 2 waiters doing a tough but admirable job of catering to all customers. I hope they can increase their space and cleanliness, which will make the place roomier and prettier.
