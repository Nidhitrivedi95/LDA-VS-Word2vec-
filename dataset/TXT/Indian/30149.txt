JziBbXfW_SRE8hAV9vzq8A First time I ate at the restaurant.  Staff did not know their own menu. They were slow and untrained. 
I figured maybe it is because it is a fairly new restaurant.  I decided to give them another chance for take out...
Staff were rude and still not trained. I did a pick up order and they over charged me for 3 items.  Two of the prices were different on the take out menu than the in restaurant menu. Another item is listed twice with 2 different prices.  Staff argued that I was wrong until I went to my car and got the brochure they sent out. With the 2 sets of prices in front of their eyes - they still argued with me. Eventually they got a managers approval to refund the difference to the lower price - but did not refund the tax on the difference. 
Food was bland and boring. 
I will never return.
