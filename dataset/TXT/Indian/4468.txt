1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g I have been to this place couple of times in the past. Earlier the food used to be great.But recently it seems the cook/cheif got changed and the food quality has detoriated since then. I ordered sadako pork and chicken and the food was super super spicy. There were red chilly powder and some chillies too all over the food. Momos also were not properly fried and the edges were uncooked.
