sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Well, I am not from Indian decent, so I am not sure if I really know what I am talking about....but i'll give you my opinion anyway. I just LOVED it! I thought the spice was right on, the medium was excellent; not too spicy but a good amount of kick. The raita is a little weird with those seeds in it, I  have only been served it with vegetables at other establishments. The mint chutney wasn't fabulous, but I mixed it with the raita and it really complimented my Butter Chicken Roti. I wasn't too pleased with the fact that they told us it would be ready in 8 min and it turned into 20+, but hey...I am late a lot as well. We will def be returning, and I suggest that you should too! So why the five stars...because it's freaking good!
