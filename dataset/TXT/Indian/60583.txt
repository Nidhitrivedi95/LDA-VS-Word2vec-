zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Want good food for your buck? Come to Khyber Halal. A family-owned restaurant serving Afghan/Pakistani/Indian combo platters, and boy is the food great! The only unfortunate issue I could think of this place is some items on the menu may not be available. Other than this, bring your appetite cause the portions are HUGE!
