GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I need to clarify why I'm providing a mediocre rating.  As a family, we've been ordering from this restaurant for years (and periodically dining in as well.)  The food has been consistently good and l really like the variety on the menu.  Besides the traditional Tandoori options, curries, meat and vegetable options, they've got some wraps which I really enjoyed.  However, the service level (for our last couple of visits) has been very poor.  

It's as if the customer is inconveniencing the establishment if you're dining in.  So, in a nutshell,  I would rate the food as being quite good.  The naan is sometimes over charred but I'd still recommend the various dishes.  However, the service level detracts from the dining experience.  In addition, although I'm all for creating an ambiance, I'm not sure the belly dancing adds to the whole dining experience especially since it's a Middle Eastern art form.

My recommendation:  Place a carry out order (because the food is good) but avoid dining in because the service level is very inconsistent (including some of the supervisors that assist the cashiers/service staff).
