3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Normally I am skeptical of Indian restaurant ratings because I come from Indian background and I am a good cook. My husband and I were craving Indian and we absolutely loved this place. The quality and variety of foods in the lunch buffet is amazing! LOVED the Tandoori chicken with garlic chili naan and chicken makhani! And Gulabjamuns (dessert) were soft and absolutely delicious! Food was hot not cold as it is normal in buffets sometimes. Definitely the place to go if you are craving Indian food!
