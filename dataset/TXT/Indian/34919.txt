Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Stooped by this hidden gem while in Vegas for a conference. It's off the strip but kind of tucked away. I love Indian food and this did not disappoint. I had the goat curry with parantha bread and it was delicious. The mango lassi was good too. Service was prompt and Kumar made sure I was well taken care of. Would definitely come here again.
