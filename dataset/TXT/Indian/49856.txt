U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw We decided to go back to this restaurant for lunch. This time we both ordered the lunch bowl. The service was really fast and the food was really good. The rice bowl came with paneer masala, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, okra, garbanzo beans, & some cauliflower and potato. The paneer & chicken tikka were my favorites but the rest of the choices were good as well. The cost for the plate was $6.55 with tax. Definitely worth it! I'll definitely come back for it.
