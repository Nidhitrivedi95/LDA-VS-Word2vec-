YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ You don't go there for the decor, nor the bring your own wine option. They don't have time for that ;) You go there because it's one of the best Indian options in Parc Ex, and trust me, I've tried them all few times prior to writing this review. The tali are generous unlike other places, the butter chicken is delicious and the lassi is also good. The service is efficient not really friendly but good. Our favourite spot in the neighborhood!
