1LdvubOnn7Uf_xDpc5JcMA I have been to this place 4 times, all for the buffet and all were good.

Their Tandoori is decent, they always have some varied vegetable selections and the Tikka is pretty good for a buffet.

They have a varied selection and the staff are always friendly and helpful

I like that you can get garlic naan with the buffet.

I have nto yet ordered off the menu there....
