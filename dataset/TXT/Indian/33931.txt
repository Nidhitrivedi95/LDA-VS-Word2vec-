m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew Changed my rating from 2 stars to 1 star, due to the attitude of either the staff or friends of Joe's Buffet Palace. I don't know why 8 of them think my review is "funny" (are they trying to troll me?) but I was not amused by the bad food experience I had here. I hope they continue to make fake 5-star reviews of this place because that is way funnier to me. I will never step foot in Joe's Buffet Palace again and will tell everyone I know to avoid it.
