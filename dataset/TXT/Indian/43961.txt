RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Can't get enough of this place!
Once you eat here, you're spoiled and no other place can measure up!

I've been eating here at least 1-2 times a month for about 6 years now. It's just fantastic, and the food and service make up for the Styrofoam plates and plastic cutlery. Every time I have a guest in from out of town, THIS is where I take them. My boyfriend always jokes that it's the only place he's ever eaten where he can't help but make yummy-noises with every single bite. I used to live right around the corner, but even though I'm in north Toronto now, we still make the drive frequently to get our Lahore Tikka fix!

Every time we come we get the butter chicken, palak paneer, channa masala, aloo ghobi, and several rice and naan, with sweet lassi. In the summer, I'll get a kulfi which they make in-house and which is just fantastic, and in the winters I'll sometimes indulge in their Kashmir tea that they make at your table for you. I've never once been disappointed in all the times I've been there.

It has a nice community feel, with the big open-concept dining room. I LOVE in summer time when they open up a huge covered patio for diners. Although the staff there is huge - which is great, because you always get great attendant service - they make you feel at home. Several of the servers there always recognize me, and give me a big welcome, asking how I've been, cracking jokes about how recently I've been in, or noticing if something kept me away for awhile. 

Everything is made fresh, and it comes out sizzling. The flavors are deep, and complex, with just the right amount of spice - makes your nose run, but doesn't flay your tongue and palette! Be prepared to have your clothes smell of curry when you leave...but it's SOOOOOO worth it!
