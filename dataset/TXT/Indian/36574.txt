NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Quality food with a good price!  We got the biriyani chicken bowl and the lamb meatball plate.  The plates come with two additional side dishes (we chose the chana and the daal).  Overall a wonderful meal! We were surprised when we opened the box for the biriyani, as it comes with a light flaky bread covering that it baked on top (keeping the biriyani nice and warm!).  The biriyani was a tad bland on its own, but once we added the mint sauce and chana over it, it was delicious.  The hand-washing machine was also a plus!  A flavourful meal, will definitely be going back.  Likely will stick to the plates as it comes with more food (and side dishes).
