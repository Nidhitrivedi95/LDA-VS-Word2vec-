f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I came here looking for haleem, and they did not disappoint. Incredibly friendly owner and staff. The food was nuanced and delicious--even better than the Pakistani restaurant we used to frequent in the DC area. I only wish I lived closer! But it was so good that I will be making the trip to Charlotte again (and again...) just to eat there.
