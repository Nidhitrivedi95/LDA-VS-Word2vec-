q7T-qCW0WLemnnLt88OuWQ 100% amazing, spicy (if you want), authentic Indian food. Take the lack of descriptions in the menu as a sign of the restaurant's authenticity and your opportunity to learn what some dishes are without a cheat sheet. The server will describe what things are if you have questions or, if you are ordering takeout, you can GFG it.

This is no longer Southern Spice, and the mediocrity of that other restaurant is no longer there, either.

We've ordered takeout several times through GrubHub and LOVED IT. They honor requests of spiciness and make it just right. Kormas, vindaloo, biryani, paneer or chicken tika masala, basmati rice and samosas have all been piping hot, fresh, served with love and absolutely delicious.

Go go GO. Forget any other restaurant that has ever been in that location.
