8cDP0mjK0J6lk292IeKRGg Pros: 
- Good value
- Food tasted alright for the most part
- Staff and friendly and a nice vibe to the restaurant

Cons:
- Wait times could be improved

Ordered:
Doubles - Pretty good doubles for the most part. I liked mine with pepper
Stew Chicken - This was okay. Nothing killer but it wasn't bad. I got a side of macaroni which was a little different than what I'm used too

Conclusions:
Overall, Duprati's is average. The doubles are good and stuffed to the brim with the filling. The mains I got there were okay. Nothing outstanding or unique but nothing bad either.
