S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA i ordered beef curry and garlic naan and non veg appitizer plate...samosa , chilli pakoda.. and 2 pcs of wings.. it was good... but the curry wasn't.. doesn't have any indian spice flavor in it.. and the naan doesn't had enough garlic on it.. and was not cooked well... but the 3 stars for people who served the food... really had professional way of dinner... thanks.. and good luck..
