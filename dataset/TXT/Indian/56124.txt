XlFfik938wxi745YQy44qw Nice little restaurant tucked away on South College St. Its small and cosy and serves great food. Service was a little slow even though it wasn't that busy but reward was great fresh food. The waiter was very helpful to explain the differences between dishes and really enjoyed my visit. Another great find.
