H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ We've been here numerous times, mostly when it was fairly new. We find the food tasty and the servings generous.  Definitely great value for your money.  When we dined here recently, we were thinking that the food/servings may have changed already.  However, we were pleased that it hasn't.  Food still great. We ordered Chicken Pakora, Chili Chicken with gravy, Cantonese Chow Mein and Manchurian chicken n shrimp fried rice.  There were 3 of us, all big eaters, but we have enough leftovers to last us another meal. However, service kinda slowed down. Also, when it was time to pay, we were told that their machine was not working and they can only take cash.  They should at least let us know beforehand. No sign on the door or anywhere. That' s just not cool.  But we would still come back, for sure.
