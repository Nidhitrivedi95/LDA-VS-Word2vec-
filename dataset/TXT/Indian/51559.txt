UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We were the only patrons on our visit, so the service was first rate!  Appetizers were flavorful, including the MoMo's that we tried.  I didn't realize the Nepalise element here (Turkey on the menu at Indian places is odd!) but the food was very good overall.  Beer selection was impressive but I didn't have the right circumstances to participate in that.
