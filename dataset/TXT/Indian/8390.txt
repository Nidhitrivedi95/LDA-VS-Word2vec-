7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ By far the best Indian food in the area my wife and I have eaten at numerous Indian restaurants around the country and Persis is definitely worth the price of admission. The other restaurants In the area are ok but Persis is definitely better overall and the service and ambience are very friendly and welcoming. We had the buffet today and it was phenomenal there was plenty to choose from and everything tastes delicious and are authentic. Try it out you will be pleased you did.
