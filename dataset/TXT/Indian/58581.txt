yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ This place is absolutely wonderful for dinner. Their naan is always freshly made and perfectly done. Their chicken tikka masala is pretty good, but any lamb combination is great, (lamb kaddai and jalfrezi are good choices). Their rice is brackish and not the best you can get.  The service for dinner is alright, they do tend to take a long time to take your order and bring your food.  However, the wait is worth it.  Their portion sizes are very deceptional, they come in a small metal bowl, but the bowl is deeper than you think! With naan you will definitely leave very filled.

I would NOT however, recommend this place for lunch. The service is beyond awful and the food is not of the same quality.  There is no waiter during lunch and you are served on cheap paper plates.  Now, I do not necessarily have a problem with the paper plates, but when I am spending a lot of money--as a broke college student--I at least want a decent presentation.  

Overall, I would recommend this place ONLY for dinner.  It's good for a date, very nice seating, dimmed lighting.  It is also good for groups as they do separate checks and have tables big enough to accommodate large groups.  If you like Indian food, have a few bucks to spend, this is your place.
