ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w Ugh, this review has been a draft for weeks.  Like I-went-here-to-watch-the-federal-election weeks.  I thought I'd go back and try the place again, because checking out a place when it's slammed isn't fair, but honestly, I know I'm not going to go back: on a night when they should have known they'd be busy (we were one of two large parties that had made reservations, plus all the people who ended up dropping by to watch election results on the TVs over the bar), they only had one guy working.   Bartending, busing tables, taking orders.  

Needless to say, service was terrible and I didn't get my beer.  SADFACE
