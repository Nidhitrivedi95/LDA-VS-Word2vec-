c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg The food at this place has definitely dipped in taste. Everything looked great, but didn't taste very authentic or good. The chutney, sambhar etc that came with it was quite bland. There are far better places. Even the thali (meal) was average at best. Unless there's no better place to go, I'd give it a miss.
