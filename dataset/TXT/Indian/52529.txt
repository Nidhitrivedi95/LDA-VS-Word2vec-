UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw I've been to this restaurant twice and each time has been a not so appealing experience. The service is slow and inefficient. Very well acquainted with the Indian cuisine, I found the food to be highly average.
First time, I reached 15 minutes before the noon closing time. They said we can't sit and eat. That's fair but I asked if I could take a parcel (as I saw quite a few people still eating) and the answer was still no. That felt rude.
Second time, I walked in and the place was empty except for 3 tables. It took forever for the waiter to arrive and note our order for a samosa plate without chaat. Even if I did ignore the lousy service, I couldn't ignore the food. Samosas seemed stale and had higher quantity of turmeric powder which in turn ruined the taste.
Nonetheless, I liked the partially covered seating on the left as you walk in.
