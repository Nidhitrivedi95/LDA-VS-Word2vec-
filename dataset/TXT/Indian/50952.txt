uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw Very disappointed. 
Think twice before ordering the rolls - they are oily and not in a paratha but instead use bhathuras... disgusting owner and his service - did not want to cancel the order and said that the good biryani will compensate for the bad rolls! Think before you eat here! Horrible! 
There are zillion Pakistani biryani places in town - please try Desi corner or even Silver Spoon (silver spoon has poor service) but much better quality food.
The best chicken rolls are at Al Kahan (heartland) and ask for paratha roll!
