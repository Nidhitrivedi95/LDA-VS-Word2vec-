uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA I've been to Babu's many times since they opened (which, by the way, is not anywhere close to the 20 years they claim - they're closer to 2 than 20, more like 5), and I have to say that their food is subpar.  I don't even go to them for naans because they are so bad.

Unfortunately, my family and I would keep dropping by since they're so close to FreshCo, but the food is just as bad or worse than we remember.  The flat breads are not the way they're supposed to be (I won't go into comparisons of their naans and rotis) and their vegetable and chicken curries have the wrong spices in them in that they don't taste good.  I don't know if it's because they have South Indian or Sri Lankan chefs but their North Indian is sub-par.  If you're going to eat there, stick with South Indian / Sri Lankan dishes.

Even though we're based in Unionville, my family and I will end up making our weekly Indian food pick-up run to Samosa King at McCowan and Finch or Mistaan at Victoria Park and McNicholl.  That says it all as we hate crossing Steeles and we hate standing in long lines, which the former has.
