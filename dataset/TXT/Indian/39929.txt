As we were waiting for the food the lady came back to us and said "can you pay?" Which I found extremely rude! After we paid she went to the only table that was there which was  a bunch of guys she told them to pay and leave because they're closed and it was only 9:55! She needs to get her attitude right before they lose their customers.
