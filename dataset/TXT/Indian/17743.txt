E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw I have a sneaking suspicion some (or most?) of their curries are somewhat pre-packaged. But as a non-Indian/Indian American (what do I know about "authentic" Indian food, really?) this place does the trick for my occasional cravings. A tad pricey but what can you do?  I've had the chicken curry mostly and its surprisingly yummy. The inside is a little gloomy for decor, which is one reason I always order take-out. But yeah, I guess I'm a fan.
