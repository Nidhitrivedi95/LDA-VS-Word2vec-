4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q We just left this terrible restaurant with my wife after she chewed on a piece of porcelain in the salad and it cut her tongue causing bleeding.

Guess what? Manager and kitchen staff only asked which salad it was, and no apologies were offered!

We decided to leave as she couldn't eat anymore and the manager was right there he didn't even say sorry!

I have a picture of the porcelain piece which will be posted on here soon.
