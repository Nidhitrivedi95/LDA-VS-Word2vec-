GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I love, love, love this restaurant! This is the best Indian food I have found. I am addicted to Curry Corner. I have tried bariani, chicken masala, simosas, garlic nan bread and so on. Not only is the food amazing but it's a family owned business & they know how to make you feel at home.
