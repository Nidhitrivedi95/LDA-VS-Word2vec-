Maybe not as knowledgable as I would have liked; had some interesting things to say about the wine that were untrue.  I don't think he meant to lie to us, I think he actually believed the things he was telling us.

The goods: Naan bread was scrumptious.  We all ordered a little of everything, and everything was delicious.  I didn't try the lamb (not really a lamb eater) but from what I heard it was no exception to the rest of our table buffet.

The atmosphere: I couldn't stop staring at the lights.  They've got killer lights.
