UePWfaUMDNrcL4oreTtiSQ If Sri Lanken and Indian food is what you're after - you've found the right place but....

You kinda need to figure out how this place works. If you've never been here before and if it's busy - you'll walk out after a minute after you walk in. There is no system, no way for anyone to know you were there first. No glimpse of a line up or any form of organization. 

What there is though is delicious food. 

My go to are the chicken biryani and the chicken curry and Roti. 

So how to order:

The responsibility of knowing where you are place In order of arrival is squarely on your shoulders. If you don't know what place you are then I'm sorry - this place just isn't for you. You need to keep track of who arrived before you and who was there after. 

The biryani is perfectly cooked and the chicken curry is perfectly spicy. The Roti is fresh and is delicious. Unfortunately my curry chicken was served a little cold but still tasted great. 

All in all great food as long as you can figure out how to navigate the lines.
