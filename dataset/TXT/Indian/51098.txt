UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Amazing Indian food!  Very reasonable prices and good portions.  Had garlic naan, vegetable samosas, malai kofta, and aloo gobi.  Everything was delicious!  The malai kofta was probably the best I've had anywhere.  The aloo gobi was more flavorful that other places I've had it.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  Definitely a new favorite!
