9y2MS2VyXZzFRi2zGV0AFg I'd like to recommend this outstanding Indian/Bangladeshi restaurant Britannia Spice in Leith for atmosphere, taste, and customer service. Friendly and helpful staff, and advice on what drinks or side dishes to have with your main meal. You feel like you're dining on a yacht tied to the harbour!
