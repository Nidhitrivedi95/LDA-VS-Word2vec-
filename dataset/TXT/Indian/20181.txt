fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Yesterday was the second time I went here. I didn't realize this was the restaurant I went for my neighbors confirmation.
-It is clean
-Yes, i agree the curry is too thin...not the best when i'm dipping my naan in
-Wide variety..i ate most of the vegetarian dishes, since I don't eat meat
-They make fresh naan, but it's not fluffy..crispy though
-Service is very friendly

Overall, I've been to way better buffets. This is nothing special. Trust me.
