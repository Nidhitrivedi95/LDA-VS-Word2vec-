gVrVevX_rjgY2uTJaKSStA After reading so many great reviews, I was anxious to try Samosa Hut so I went there for lunch today. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed.

I ordered the butter chicken with biryani rice and a mutton spring roll. For $1 more, I got a pop and a (lamb) samosa. With a 50 cents upcharge for the biryani rice, the total bill, with tax, came up to $11.01. Doesn't seem so cheap for lunch anymore.

The texture of the samosa was nice and crispy but the lamb flavour didn't really come through. The spring roll also had a nice crispy texture but I felt like there was more potato or similar filling than meat.

The butter chicken was the most disappointing. It was very sweet and the meat was dry, despite the sauce. The biryani rice had no flavour. Sadly, I've had better butter chicken from a frozen meal.

Unless I'm really missing something, I can't recommend Samosa Hut.
