CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ So, I absolutely loved this place when I first went.  I don't write a lot of reviews, but I'm writing this one because I think the restaurant could do so much better, and I'm on the verge of not patronizing it.  I think some of the things that are sometimes wrong are easy fixes. 

A lot of times they are out of things that seem like they should be staples. I kid you not, I have been there on separate occasions, and they've been out of basmati rice, chicken tikka masala, to go cups for soft drinks and even naan!!!! They are open until 10pm most days, and they may be out of these things at like 6pm or 7pm...not even the end of the night. Sometimes their staff, who are always nice, look really embarrassed to tell you they're out of things...like they have to do it a lot. 

So it's very hit or miss. When it's good it's really good, but it's a bummer when you go in expecting to get things you like and you never know if you can count on them being there.  This place has such potential. Please get it together guys!! A few improvements will go a long way.
