FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ This is absolutely one of my favorite places to go for curry even if a person doesn't like spicy things it's still good. From what I remember of my Japanese grandma making curry a couple times or when my mom used to make curry off of her recipe this is likely more Japanese style curry than Indian or Thai. Has a lot more sweeter flavors a lot more emphasis on the flavor of spices vs hotness factor. You're going here looking for your next sriracha buzz maybe look for somewhere else this place just has really delicious food. I really recommend one of the peanut curry dishes such as the peanut noodle which my girlfriend always gets. They have some pretty good dessert too the coconut custard is a must-have don't be off put by the color of the custard it is amazing and delicious. Their chai tea is pretty decent too sweet somewhat milky and perfectly spiced. I've had the masala and beef curry the sweet potato curry most of their peanut curries and can say from what I've had I have no complaints. Portion sizes are adequate even on an empty stomach. It's one of those restaurants for you order, pay  and then sit down so if you're in more of a hurry you don't have to worry about waiting for the waiter to come for your check.
