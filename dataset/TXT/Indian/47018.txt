When I first walked in, it felt like a place where you sit down to have a quick lunch and go. I didn't like the chairs very much. They were hard to sit on. lol 

Service was a bit slow. We went there during a weekday for lunch and there was just one person serving us. Many times I had to get up from my seat  and walk to the counter so I could tell the waiter my order.

I'd say food wise, everything was pretty mediocre, but I would say  it's one of the better hakka restaurants I've been to. My favourite was the paneer curry. That was amazing. Too bad it wasn't part of the special lunch menu.

Overall it was alright. I think next time I come to eat would be if I am in the area to grab the lunch special.
