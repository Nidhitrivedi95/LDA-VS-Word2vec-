NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg This was my first time trying Choolaah and my husband and I were quite pleasantly surprised!! We can be picky about Indian food bc his family owns Indian restaurants but they're a bit of a hike for us to get to. Choolaah was a great, affordable way to get those flavors!!!

The restaurant itself was clean, chic and had ample seating both inside and on the patio. The staff were very friendly and professional, which is always a plus. Definitely casual but we really enjoyed sitting out on the patio with our (LARGE!) trays of food! 

I actually still cannot believe how much food we got for the price! We each ordered the BBQ meal bowls (I had the paneer and he had the chicken) which came with naan, sauce of choice (we both had the tikka masala), rice and your "protein" all for $8.99 each. We also ordered the samosas, and quite frankly it was too much for us to finish! Haha When my husband carried the trays out to our table I was shocked at how much food it was!

It was really delicious!!! I would definitely recommend saying "yes" to the complimentary chili sauce on the side and add it to the tikka masala if you're wanting that "Indian kick" to the tikka masala, otherwise it's a little too mild for our tastes. 

We really enjoyed our meals and will definitely be coming back again and SOON! (The hand jacuzzi after eating is also a MUST try!)

OH! And we really feel that you can tell that the owners pay attention to the reviews bc I had noticed that some of the older reviews mentioned bland naan or things not benign spicy enough, and we both were then surprised to find how flavorful the naan was and then knew the chili sauce on the side was a necessity!
