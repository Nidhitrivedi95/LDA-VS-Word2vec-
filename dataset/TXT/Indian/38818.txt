OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I love Indian food. And Urban Turban made me love it even more! Such friendly staff and delicious curry selections! This place is clean, spacious and modern; a nice change to most outdated Indian spots I've been to. 
We ordered two of the bottomless curry bowls - the Bombay Lamb Masala and the Palak Panner Masala. Both with large portions and Oh SO good! The lamb was tender, cooked to perfection and very tasty. I love the spinach base in the Palak Panner but if you're not a fan try this dish with the red sauce (a masala twist). 
I can't say enough of how much the friendly smiles and genuine spirit of hospitality made this visit so complete. I will definitely be back here when I get the chance. Highly recommended!
