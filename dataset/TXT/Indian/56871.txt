xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Yeah... I think Frybread house relocated, and is now replaced by "Two Hippies Magical Mushroom Burger"...correct me if I'm wrong. Anyway, this is about the frybread, not the burger.

Last time I visited this place, I had the frybread, opted with steak instead of shredded beef, with everything on it- cheese, carmelized onions, guacamole, and all the other stuff that makes for a good artery-clogging lunch. And were my arteries clogged indeed! The frybread I ordered was good, especially when I sank my teeth into the stuffed mess, could feel the grease stream down my mouth and chin. My table etiquette was totally abandoned here, but if you could care less about the calories and like grease glossed lips, come here. It's okay.
