22nkIQ4BeSYwsyaPOczOeA Flew in to Edinburg from Malaysia via London. As soon as I entered the Restaurant with my family, someone very rude entertained us, he was so arrogant and said that they don't accept customers today. I asked why, he said that Friday, Saturday & Sunday was dedicated for people who book in advance. I told him the least he could do is to put it up on the website or yelp. He was so rude and replied, we don't care. 

The least you could do is share correct information, and not being rude. 

Thank you
