H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ If I could give zero stars I would. The food was horrible and the service was even worse. The food was extremely bland and tastes like nothing. I ordered shanghai noodles with shrimp and there were literally 2 shrimps in the entire plate. The beef with broccoli I ordered had absolutely no taste and probably 5 pieces of beef. I should have ordered a plate of beans broccoli to be honest. 
Our waitress was extremely rude and did not give any eye contact at all. She made me and my mom feel very unwelcome. I would highly recommend to not come here. Tangerine has wayyyyy better food and service, it's worth the extra 15 min drive to whitby.
