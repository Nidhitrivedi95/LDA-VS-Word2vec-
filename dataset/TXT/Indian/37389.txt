o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Went there with friends on Saturday afternoon expecting a great lunch buffet but we were greatly disappointed. We went there by 2pm since they only close at 3pm. They stopped refilling food by 2pm. Food was very cold. Vegetarians be ready to be highly disappointed. The only thing that was warm in the entire buffet was the plate. Plate is left there directly from out of the dishwasher. This is such a disappointment. I have been to this place several times and every time the management changes and every management has done a terrible job. Their alacarte is extremely expensive and food is sub par.
