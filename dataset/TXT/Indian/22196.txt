GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Dishonest and unprofessional. This is in same complex as another Indian restaurant and we ended up here by mistake. Few points about dishonesty
1. We reached at 2.30 pm. They said only buffet can be ordered, so we ordered for 3 and half. My mom doesn't eat onions/garlic and there was nothing to eat for her, so she just sat there without food.
2. When she was not eating, he comes and says, now cook is here and we can order jain food. (We could have ordered non-buffet already as buffet was closing at 3.00pm).
3. In the end, he charged for my mom's buffet as well as full charge for additional dishes. We separately ordered her nan and rice dishes for her as we were told she alone cannot eat buffet. But they charged for her dishes, they did let her eat rice etc from buffet, but charged for buffet anyways. (it was not a mistake, because they didn't correct it when asked. It was knowingly done)
4. The buffet had chutney etc, but no pakoras or samosa were finished already. No response when asked about it.
They were talking nicely and it didn't occur that cheating business was going on on the side. When I carefully looked at the detailed calculation later, we spend hell lot more than just few extra dollars. It was too late to go back and fight and felt cheated.
