DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA **** The BEST NAAN BREAD IN TOWN!!! ****

This is by far my most favorite Indian food place in Vegas. I've been to many and in my opinion you need to go the restaurant that makes the dish you like the best. My 2 favorite dishes are Chicken Korma and the Shrimp Vindaloo. This place makes these dishes off the hook! I've had these at other Indian restaurants here in Vegas and they just don't match up. Even though I don't like the lamb here I'm still giving them a 5 because they make my favorite dishes the best. The garlic naan is by far the best I've had too....
