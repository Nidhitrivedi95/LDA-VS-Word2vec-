wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Found this restaurant on yelp since I was in the area. It's Ina great location in old town. Nice restaurant to walk into w a fairly large space. Have a full bar as well. Owner is friendly and was walking around talk to everyone and also taking orders.  
We ordered a few different items, chicken tikka masala, biriyani, tandoori chicken and naan per his recommendations. Unfortunately the food was not very good. The lassi was made well. The food portions were definitely on the smaller side especially for the price. It was also not spiced very well and did not feel very authentic. 
Will likely not return here for Indian food as there are better options in the Valley.
