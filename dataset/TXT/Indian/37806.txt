ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw This restaurant is the BEST Indian Restaurant ever in Las Vegas. The ambiance, food and service everything is 5/5. I always go eat here when I am in Vegas. MUST GO!!

Warning: Its a bit pricey.. 
$$$ with 1 drink from the bar and main course. No appetizer.
 $$ with just the main course. No appetizer.
