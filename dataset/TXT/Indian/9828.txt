9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw I really like the atmosphere and cleanliness of the place. I also really appreciate how for every dish it indicates whether or not is is vegan, vegetarian or gluten free. However, after seeing all the great reviews I expected the food to be better. My SO and I agreed that it was lacking flavor/spices which is odd because Indian food is usually is loaded with flavor. The curries seemed as if they were very watered down. Even the sight and texture of the curries were very watery. Too bad because I really wanted to love this place.
