U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw If ambiance is not part of the pleasure of your dining experience, I give this Indian restaurant 4 stars because the food and service were very good. 
Having said that, the restaurant was small, tight, pokey and so dark that my husband was a black silhouette against the window light behind him. The decor is very dark and tired, however, I understand that the restaurant will be expanding to next door with a big renovation in the summer (of 2017). We will revisit then. 
The host was cheerful, charming and obliging.
To me the meal was rendered less appealing also because of the plate which was a kind of metal camping or prison dish divided into sections .
The food itself was tasty and the meal more than enough. I really appreciated the fresh coriander on top of the vegetables.  The butter chicken was tasty. My husband's beef curry was too 'cinnamony' for my taste but he liked it. 
Overall it was a tasty meal in a less than pleasant environment for a reasonable $9.95 but things will be changing for the better!
