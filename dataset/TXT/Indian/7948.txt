6wZIRMkNY3XVF3rSoMLHNQ I feel a little conflicted about the cultural appropriation involved in a bunch of white guys opening an Indian Restaurant and charging more than the Indian chefs who work hard to made exceptional and authentic food all over this town. So that has to be said I think right off the bat. 

But I will also say, these guys travel in Southern India a lot, and have clearly developed a real love and respect for the food and culture, and obviously treat their customers and staff with love and respect as well. The place glows with care. The food and drinks and even the beer list show attention and love of local. Even the small menu of appetizers feature things I haven't had before, super tasty street food stuff done really well. 

The thali was expensive at $18 but big enough for us to share and have leftovers. The room is so comfortable and lovely we wanted to sit there and snack and drink and watch the rain. 

I'd suggest working to develop relationships with the local Indian community, maybe inviting guest chefs, hosting cooking classes, fundraisers, culture sharing events - ways to continue to create the bridge of respect and love for Indian culture that is already evident in the food. 

Just my two cents, can't wait to come back!
