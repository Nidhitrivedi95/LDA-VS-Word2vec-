PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Of all the Indian buffets in the GTA, this is one of the best.  You can't beat the sheer selection of tandoori and curry dishes and they also taste amazing!  I've tried Indian food at many places throughout the Toronto area, but I keep coming back here for the best Indian buffet.  It speaks volumes to the authenticity of the food that many patrons are of Indian descent.  I realize many people think this is the Mandarin of Indian food but unlike Mandarin, the food does not cater to the virgin palates of the Caucasian public.  You'll be pleasantly surprised by the Indian flavors and spices!  If you've never tried Indian food before, this is the perfect place to get your feet wet.
