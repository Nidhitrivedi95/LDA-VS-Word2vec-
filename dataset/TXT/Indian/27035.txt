iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Food was FANTASTIC!!  My husband and I eat a lot of Indian food, and this was by far some of  the best.  Stopped there for lunch with a Groupon.   We each received a tray with all kinds of different dishes.  Super fresh and savory.  Waiter was extremely  nice, very attentive, and  very cheerful.  (You don't find that too often).   Indian pop music was a little too loud for me, although my husband liked it that way.   Tables were too small and close together for two people.  Good thing the place wasn't too crowded for lunch.   If  they open a second location in Mesa (please do!) we would eat there on a regular basis.
