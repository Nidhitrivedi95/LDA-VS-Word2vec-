oMt3FrXtmYiP2ayn46PHtQ My friend and I wanted to try something new and I had heard a ton of people who really enjoyed this restaurant.  We made it over for lunch and we're some of only people there because it was later for lunch.  

They had both the buffet and the menu available, and the man working was super helpful!  He explained what everything was on the buffet and also brought us fresh naan to the table.

I have had Pakistani food before but the Indian flare was new to me.  Many of the dishes were very good- not totally my thing, but I'm happy I tried it!  If you do like this type of food I'd highly recommend.  Lunch is 9.99 for adults, kids 11 and under 1/2 price.  Kids under 6 free i believe!  Not sure what kids can eat unless they are into spicy- my son (1.5) was with me and had tikka masala and naan and loved it!

Definitely a different addition to The Burg and the Town Center.
