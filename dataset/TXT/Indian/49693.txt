tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Mmmm... just thinking about my visit to India Oven makes me hungry again for Indian food! They have many options on their menu, but I only found two or three that were dairy free, so unfortunately for me, I could not try the good stuff. The dairy free options are tomato-based, which isn't my favourite. Nonetheless, the flavour is still really good. I only wish that rice or bread didn't have to be ordered separately. Also, I had ordered lamb as the meat, and it was a little hard, but lamb is difficult to cook. I'll know to get a different meat next time. Overall, the food here is really good and leaves you craving more!
