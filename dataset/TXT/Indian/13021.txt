The service the first time we went wasn't  good, the girl that waited on us was a very unpleasant  person.  This time however, the service was amazing the gentlemen was very attentive. He made us feel at home and very welcome.  When you visit this fine establishment you need to at least order the Gobi 65 and Mysore Masala Dosa !!!!!
