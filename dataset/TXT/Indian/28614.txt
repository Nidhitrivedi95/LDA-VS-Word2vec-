j9YFHVQqxM_qKHIc4nck-A Man o man this place is a winner across the board. The owners are absolutely fantastic and so is their cooking. 

I had the chili beef (gravy) and my date had the chili paneer as she is a vegetarian. Each dish cost under $10 and the portions were very large and delicious. Added a couple of veggie spring rolls and the wonton chicken soup (also huge, cheap, and delicious). I honestly liked it so much I ordered a plate of curry beef to go (it also is amazing). Just really flavourful without the typical greasy feel. What a winner.

The owners were super friendly and engaging and we will definitely be back here as this is the best Hakka I've personally had in Toronto so far.
