Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg Cannot get over this place. I would love to stop thinking of this place, but I honestly just can't. The food was so delicious and our waiter was so hilarious and attentive.
It's got an amazing design to it, and manages to feel traditional, indian, but sexy and sophisticated all at the same time.
It's got a nice bar at the entrance, and more intimate seating in the back.
Our meals were both super delicious and I can't wait to go back. Already recommended it to a friend and she fell in love with it too!
