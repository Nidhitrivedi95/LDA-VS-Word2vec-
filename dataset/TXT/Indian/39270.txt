OtdwJIrDJ_U3vj4Ns9T3pg The food is okay - around 3 stars but the delivery and service is -3 stars.  However least I could give them here is 1!

My order was delivered 1 hour late (ie 1hr 45 min delivery time instead of the promised 45 min.) and half the order was missing.  Got one Roti instead of the 2 we ordered.  

Re the food - I had the boneless chicken Roti and they clearly cook the chicken separately from the potato filling, with no spices and in big chunks instead of little morsels.  This means that the Roti is very inconsistent.  Bite into potatoes and you get a nice soft spicy mouthful but bite into chicken and its dry and bland.
