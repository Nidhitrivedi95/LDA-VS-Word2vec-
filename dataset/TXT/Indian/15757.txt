CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ One of the better tasting Indian buffets I've been.

Service www excellent owner always ensure the food is good for their customers. Always full food when empty. Butter chicken and the goat curry was the star . Chicken was actually grill first before the butter chicken sauce was mixed in.

Minus one star for a dirty cup we got but, overall I would recommend this place. Look out for the $20 for $25 Yelp coupon
