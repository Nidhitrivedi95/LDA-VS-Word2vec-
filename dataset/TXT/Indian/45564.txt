ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Delicious inexpensive Indian food. Yeah, they bring on the heat...but if you like it a hot and crave Indian food like I do, then you must hit India Garden.

The service is good, but the food just hits the spot. At $8.95 for an all you can eat lunch buffet, you can take the risk and dig in. They usually have 4 vegetarian dishes and 4 meat dishes complimented by a mess of sauces/condiments, naan and rice. 

Live the good life, enjoy a little India Garden...
