-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ This is the one and only place I will go to for authentic Indian food! I started off with the traditional "safe" stuff, such as the Samosa's and Butter Chicken, and eventually began diving into the rest of the menu. But no matter what I have tried, I have not been disappointed.

The samosas are gigantic, for starters. I always thought samosas to be small little things that fit in the palm of your hand, and consist of more dough than filling... but not at Kwality. For under a dollar each, you get a massive softball-sized samosa that is just packed full with incredible tasting ingredients. Even just two of these would be enough to fill your stomach.

Their Channa is also second to none! They recently had a contest for customers for a chance to win Free Channa Bhatura for a YEAR, and I tried so desperately hard to win it! Unfortunately, I did not, which is cool because you never mind paying for something that tastes so good!

Their Dosa selection is something that separates Kwality from most other Indian restaurants. Their Amritsari Dosa and Masala Dosa are my two go-to dishes, and it simply does not get any better than this.

The sweets counter is something that gives me trouble walking by without buying 2 pounds of treats. I usually grab a box of 5 or 6 of my favourites before walking out.

They also have an impressive display of cakes and pastries, and although I haven't tried any myself, my son absolutely loves their cupcakes.
