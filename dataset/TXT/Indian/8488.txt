7NurnM6G9b_2jTEKpIkQpg Great spot! Went at 6pm on a Saturday. Steady stream of Sri Lankin people - must be good lol. A little intimidating being a tall white girl. 
Only take out. Tried the mutton rolls, kuthu chicken roti, samosas and the chicken Biriyani.  All good. $20 total. Samosas are my new fav but cheap and good. You can see most of the food through the glass. The Kothu roti took a while to make but super fresh. Next time I want to try the idly and vadai and I'd grab a dessert.  
Super close to my new place and I'll likely be back.
