SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ Well, it was a surprise!  Some reviews said that the food quality was very poor and such, quite a contrast actually.  
The food was good (chicken tikka, chicken curry, aloo tikki, aloo gobhi, chhole, dal makhani).  The dessert section had kheer (rice pudding) and gulab jamun.  The chicken curry was good and the naan was soft.  The aloo tikki was nothing special and I did not try the vegetarian items as I was full.  
For $9.62 including tax this was a good place.  They even had lassis and fountain drinks but I didn't try it.  They do take credit cards too so that helps travelers like me.  I'd have given it a 3.5 stars rather than a 4 but 4 it is!
