QT4Ub4DlaDX52vdnKutD0A We tried this place out of curiosity. In the evening they had buffet. Owner and chef both were good , helping with setting up high chair for baby. Food wise for vegeterian its good. Nice part they prepared veg briyani separately for us and gave it as part of buffet. Wow. Best part of food was naan. It was soft and crisp
