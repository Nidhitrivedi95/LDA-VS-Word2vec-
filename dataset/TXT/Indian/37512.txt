OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A This is the first time I tried Indian food, it's said to be authentic, but actually I didn't enjoy it as much as expected. I ordered thali chicken, Maybe the food is good and the problem is on me as I am not used to it. But I like the Naan so much, and the tandoori chicken is also not bad. I came here on Thursday at about 12:30, no much people and no need to wait, lucky for that.
