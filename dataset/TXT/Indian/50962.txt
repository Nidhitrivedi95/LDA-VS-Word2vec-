UoS_IvuwY-8mAq0PY7n0kg I had no idea I loved Tibetan food until I ate here. To be fair, I haven't eaten there for a while and I forgot what it was that I ordered, but I just remember this feeling of sitting back after the meal with the biggest smile on my face. Give it a try, and I'm sure you'll feel the same.
