DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Simply put, this place is as good as it gets! From the decor, to the warm and friendly server, to the incredibly tasty dishes, this place doesn't disappoint. 

We were looking for a place for dinner today, and finally landed on this piece of culinary heaven. We ordered the somosas, the (free) onion appetizer you get for checking in, and the chicken korma. By the way, if you've never strayed from the regular Indian curry dishes (tikka masala, butter chicken), I highly recommend you get the Korma. It is creamy, and slightly nutty. Every bite of the evening was an explosion of flavor that left me wanting more. 

I will definitely be visiting this spot again, SOON!
