pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Dining in Rasoi was an enjoyable and flavourful experience. We were party of nine and our long table was in process of being set up when we arrived, so the bar was the obvious place to attack with an immediate demand for Bloody Caesar. The smiling bartender fixed a pretty good drink for some of us, mine being non virgin and non vegetarian spicy version with beautiful piece of bacon. 

Once seated our orders were collected promptly. Bring a magnifier if you have one as the menu is written in the smallest possible script and it may be hard to read the detailed descriptions of the dishes. Appetizers and mains arrived orderly, and were served with a smile, even the chef checked on us. The arugula salad was nice mix of fresh ingredients and could be ordered without the few fried calamari pieces, which I realized too late. For mains I tried two of the traditional Indian vegetarian dishes: okra masala and chick peas. Both were absolutely delicious and quite spicy, definitely not spicy hot, but seasoning was used generously. The food was served in small bowls and its quantity is more of a tapas size, but I find it sufficient in terms of value for money. 

The interior design of Rasoi is to write for, there are a lot of nice cultural elements incorporated in the brick walls that indicate the ethnicity of the cuisine you would try, but the ceiling is what made me smile that night. Its colourful hippy flowers remind the 70s and made me sing in my mind "love, peace, freedom, happiness". My only complaint is the fact that my cloths smelled curry the next day, obviously the ventilation in the kitchen can be improved, but this is not a good reason to remove rating starts. Great dining option in the area!
