pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I'm a fan of Taj Mahal.  If you're not sure if you'll like Indian food, their buffet is a really cost effective and easy way to try a little bit of the staples.  The restaurant itself is clean, cozy and very sensible.  They are equipped to accommodate large parties, and the buffet runs several nights a week and everyday for lunch.  Parking is ample, if you don't mind McKnight road - it's not hard to get to either.

The staff are friendly, and the menu has really great selections.  I recommend giving them a try....a cornerstone of North Hills.
