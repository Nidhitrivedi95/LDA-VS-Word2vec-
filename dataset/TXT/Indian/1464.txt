-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA My family jokes that we had a 15 year committed relationship with our previous Indian food restaurant that ended once we found Chutney's.  Sometimes we come for the weekend buffet, which has a huge variety, love the chai and all the chutneys.  Other times we come for dinner.  Usually we get the dosa since I can't eat naan.  The dosa is amazing.   We came down one night when they had live music and wow, the guy turned out to be a top notch jazz musician from Seattle.  

Other reviewers have written about the slowness of the service, but I think that people should recognize that Chutney is not a place for speed dining.  This is a place where one comes to relax, enjoy a leisurely meal, soak up the ambiance.  It's a great place for a date, or enjoy a night out with friends.  It's good for conversation.
