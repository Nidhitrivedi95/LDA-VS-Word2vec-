KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ Excellent food! We tried this Jaipur Junction location after having their food at a friends wedding event. We have so far tried the methi malai, saag paneer, malai kofta, chicken makhani, Chicken Tikka madrasi style, lamb kabob, samosa chaat, bullet naan, garlic naan, jeera rice, gulab jamoon and chicken hariyani. The meat was perfectly tender and service was A-1. Definitely one of the best Indian restaurants in the Greater Cleveland area!!!  Also, excellent dessert.
