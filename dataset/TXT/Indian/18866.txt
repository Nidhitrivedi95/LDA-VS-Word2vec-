epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg Roti portions are enormous! Roti bread is crisp and fresh while the fillings are very rich. I strongly recommend sharing different rotis among a group to balance between the richness of one and spiciness of another. One roti is enough for 2-3 people unless you are trying to consume a days worth of calories in one sitting. I had the chicken saag roti extra spicy and my boyfriend had the butter chicken medium spicy. No complaints although I wish they would make the rotis smaller so you could sample through them. I kept picking at my boyfriends butter chicken when I got bored of eating my saag. All in all this is a great place to order from if you want to really fill your stomach.
