0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Horrible service from the owners, the lady at the front was coming at me like she wanted to fight simply because I had a Groupon.  They then proceeded to tell me their Groupon is worthless and shouldn't have been purchased.  I don't know how anyone can run a business like this...I will NEVER be back.  Horrible service paired with less than mediocre food.  There are so many restaurants that are way better than this place in the same area.
