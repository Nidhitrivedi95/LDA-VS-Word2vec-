TElfyEowMFTPR1gAwMLcNQ Have catered from Copper Kettle for parties and their dishes are always good. Biryani, Nihari, Afghani Boti are consistently a safe bet if you do not have time to cook up a spread yourself.
Once we got a batch of bad biryani and as soon as we called then about it, they got new trays started for us. While sending out bad biryani is never a good idea, they redeemed themselves right away by fixing the problem. I still get food from them.
