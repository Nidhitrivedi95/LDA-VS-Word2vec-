yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The food gets 5 stars most definitely. What brought our experience down was one of the servers. We had contact with two. One was a younger lady who seemed to be irritated that we had little experience ordering at an Indian restaurant and needed a little help with the menu. When she attempted to explain her accent was so thick we still found it hard to understand what we were doing. when asked to repeat herself she became even more irritated and only spoke louder, she then left the table and could be overheard saying 'I don't know what to tell her' in reference to my date's very basic questions. 

Then an older lady who appeared to be the owner came to our table and was fantastic, she explained everything to us and was very attentive for the rest of the meal. 

I would eat there again however it seems that they are big on making reservations. This didn't really occur to us as it was late Friday afternoon and we were thinking we'd get an early 'happy hour' dinner in at the end of a busy day rather than going home and getting ready for a later more formal dinner later in the evening. 

All in all, good food, good service if you have reservations if this is your first time with Indian food do your homework before getting there and you should be fine.
