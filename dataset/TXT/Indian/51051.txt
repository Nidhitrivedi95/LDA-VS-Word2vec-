UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Not terribly impressed with the food at this restaurant.  I have eaten the lunch buffet a few times and feel that the flavors in the vegetable korma and chana masala are not as rich as they should be.  The spice level is not very high.  The naan that is served on the buffet also does not seem as fresh as it should be.

I always tip at buffets, but when I was paying this time I questioned why I should be tipping.  We were given a pitcher so we could refill our own water.  In addition, during the entire course of the meal no one came to take away my plates.  I had to stack them on the side of the table on my own.

To give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt, I also ordered an entree off the menu, as the food on the buffet is never as good as something served straight from the kitchen.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala, and while it was okay, it was nothing special.  Again, the flavors didn't seem as rich as I've had at other restaurants.  Also, when I got back to my office to eat my lunch, I realized they neglected to give me a fork and a napkin in the bag they stapled shut.  I had to go back out to another restaurant to get myself a fork.  Not happy.
