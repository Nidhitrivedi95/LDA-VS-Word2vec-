I went with 2 friends & we shared chili shrimp appetizer (amazing-the spice was perfect) and we each got curry goat, chicken tikka masala & curry vegetables. Lots of vegetarian options and server was efficient. Portion sizes are generous and we left with leftovers. Do yourself a favor and stop by. (Here's a pic of my friends curry goat plate) as you can see, it was good. She said the goat was tender & flavorful).
