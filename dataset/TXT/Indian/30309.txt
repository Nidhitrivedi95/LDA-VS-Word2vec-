K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g Under new ownership now since my last review, here are some of the things I found need to be improved:
1) Masala Dosas that are included in the buffet need to be piping hot, golden brown and crisp, savory and delicious.
2) Idlis also ought to be fresh, soft and steaming hot.
3) I'm not in favor of water bottles rather than fresh cold ice water from pitcher.
4) Service can be a bit more attentive with customer feedback/questions etc.
5) This must be for the duration of the buffet and not just at opening.
It would be nice if staff explained the variety of South Indian delicacies and their traditional popularity and reasons for it.
People need to know how Indian food is healthy and painstakingly prepared as opposed to just thrown together and cooked.
It is labor intensive and that needs to come out and speak for itself when tasted.
Good luck to these guys, they seem to be making a decent effort.
