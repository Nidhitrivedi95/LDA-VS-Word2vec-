XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw I love to come in during their buffet hours and eat plate after plate if the chicken masala on rice. It's a little hole in the wall place, the atmosphere may be a little off point for some people, but it's one if my favorite places to make an early trip out to. 

I definitely recommend trying to go in during the buffet hours for your first time. The price is cheaper and you can get a taste for what you like and don't like.
