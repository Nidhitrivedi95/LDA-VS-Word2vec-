B9QJToIrPjRAUuPoemMUNg So I was walking down Gerrard St trying to kill time in between meetings and stumbled upon this place. Being rather bored of Lahore Tikka House (mostly due to its decline in quality and taste) I decided to give this place a try. 

First impressions wouldn't leave you "speechless" so to speak, but if you can overcome the basic and dilapidated decor you're in for a real treat! I ordered the foot long kebab and naan as it was highly recommended to me by fellow Yelpers and the owner himself. The kebab and naan was made to order, something I appreciated as that doesn't usually happen anymore; however this caused my meal to take some time to make. Once I got my meal I was very happy with the taste and quality, both the naan and kebab tasted phenomenal. I unfortunately didn't get to try anything else as they were closing midday for religious reasons (they close around 2pm on Fridays for prayers). I intend to back one day and sample other things on their menu as this place does look somewhat promising.
