8cDP0mjK0J6lk292IeKRGg A friend and I shared a chicken roti and stew chicken with rice and peas for lunch. We both had upset stomach( I must have farted like 50 times after the meal) and progressed on to diarrhea over the course of 24 hours. 

FYI I've had Drupatis roti and doubles before without any issues.

If you've had the same experience after eating at this place on Friday Sept 16, 2016, you are not alone. Something is horribly wrong with Drupati. If I can rate it ZERO star, I definitely would!
