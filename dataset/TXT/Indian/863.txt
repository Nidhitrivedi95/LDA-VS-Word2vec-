-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw Excellent home style thali.

Taking off one star as the staff is apathetic towards customers waiting for tables and did not volunteer to help acquire a chair from another table (even after pointing out that a woman was using a chair to keep her handbag).
Lack of courtesy from the customer and the staff.

I appreciate the person behind the counter who makes chaats and takes orders. She was empathetic enough towards us when we told her we were hungry and needed something quick. She made us a papdi chaat while we waited for the excellent veg thali.
