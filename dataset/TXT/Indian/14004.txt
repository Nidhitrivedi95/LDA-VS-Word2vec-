Palak Paneer (V) and Keema Sheema are worth keeping an eye out for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Rice is normally a better bet than the naan bread and the mango cheesecake is good. 

It *is* a really small restaurant, everything is bit crowded and seating can be uneven, but don't let it put you off as youu'll never be rushed out.
