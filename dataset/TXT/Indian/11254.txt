aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q Sadly, Yelpers, I was disappointed with New York Subway.
True, like others mentioned, it was frigid in the little shop on late January visit around 1pm. Thanks, though, I never would have noticed if it had I not intentionally made plans to meet my cousin there based on your reviews. Indeed, it was dingy and ugly. And yup, we steered away from the subs and ordered burritos - from a very nice guy at the counter, then a stern man did cook them.

I paid much more than I'd expected, but I assured myself that Yelpers would ensure it would be worth it. As we sat, I anticipated big, honking, deliciousness in a hungry delirium. And then, anticipated some more...

It wasn't busy, but our order took about 25 minutes to prepare. When my cousin went to pick up our order from the counter, I thought she had returned only with hers because when I took a quick glance it looked (I hoped?) that I saw 1 super burrito. It was really 2 skinny side-by-side shlongs.
The shrimp in my jumbo shrimp burrito was cooked well; not too long as to be rubbery at all. But barely pink. Though I was impressed with the quality and quantity of the shrimp itself, it was bland in comparison to the finely chopped iceberg lettuce and mayo mix.  I had ordered medium, I guess by mistake, in this neighbourhood. It tasted like negative medium. 
My cousin said she liked hers. But then again, she only ate half and had been starving.

I might be back, if it were not for the fact that there is no such thing as jumbo chicken or jumbo beef. I thought that maybe I'd just read the menu wrong, or they left out the comma. Had what I ordered actually been called: "jumbo shrimp, burrito"? Grammar-schmammer. Time and taste can't make up for a mere pause.
