ro-4-3USXvGKnp07BrxSKg Had ala carte last week for dinner, was good. Called to order Togo on Sat for lunch, they said I can come in & take Togo from buffet. I go there and the guy at the host stand, tells me to wait for 2 mins and no one to attend for 20 mins. It hardly takes a minute or two to help with a Togo box and then me to make selections. Very bad customer service, at least be courteous. Maybe you can get basic respect if I speak Telugu...P would give -ve 100 stars if yelp allows. Pissed off with the treatment.
