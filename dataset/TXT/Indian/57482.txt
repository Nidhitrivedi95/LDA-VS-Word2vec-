YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw Just had a FABULOUS Indian feast!
The lunch buffet is nothing short of delicious! Known for their biryani dish
The veggie and chicken served is spiced perfectly with just the right amount of kick. The tiki masala is rich and creamy and the curry dishes are delicious!
Highly recommend for those who love Indian food! Yummy
Definitely coming back!!
