iX0XUpk34WqHfUuLjPhR9g Stella won my heart about a year ago when they first reopened. It's such a chill atmosphere where you can go for a drink with some friends and have a wonderful time. Their events such as open mic night, spin your own and Lansdowne high fi are always fun. They have a great selection if beer and mix drinks and best if all a wicked menu of delicious curries and appetizers at are well priced and a portion that leaves you satisfied but not over the top where u feel u need to hit the ER on your way home. The fish curry especially is just perfection with a smooth meaty fish that is just spicy enough to leave behind the memory of that last coveted bite. I caution you to take a lot of yourself control with you otherwise you will end up in a curry coma...a well worth it curry coma! Makes me want to run down the street with a white tank screaming STELLAAAA!!!! My only complaint is that they don't accept debit BUT I'll gladly take the trip to the bank
