GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Hi,

I will explain why I am giving a 2 star review ! Food Quality is excellent BUT my reason of giving a 2 Star is pricing. Menu Prices on Yelp are different as to the Menu Prices in the restaurant. This is giving a consumer a false impression about the prices. I am serious, this is not right. 

Message to the owner - If you think I am right then you should compensate me for the difference. I am willing to come back and order the same food but you should charge me per the menu prices on Yelp, if not, I understand but I am not coming back to your place.

Thank You !
