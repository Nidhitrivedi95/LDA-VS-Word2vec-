P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg Had take out... The person who answered the phone was very efficient and precise about time (when the food would be ready and how much it would cost). If you pay cash you do get a 10% discount on take-out food only. When you walk into the restaurant, it looks very clean and well kept. The person at the desk said they've been there for fifteen years. Very impressive.  Customer service was great. He checked our order twice to make sure everything was there. We had chicken pakora, Mumbai fried rice, mixed vegetables and golden fried shrimp. All taste amazing. We even had an extra steam rice (for free) I guess. Pakora and rice nicely spiced (fair amount of heat). My only suggestion: add sauce for pakora (too dry to eat alone) and for the shrimp (like plum sauce).  Would I go again? Yes... For sure will be try a dine in experience. Will definitely try the chilli  chicken as I heard it's something not to miss!
