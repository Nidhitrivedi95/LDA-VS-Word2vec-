zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q I just visited Khyber Halal. The food was great, the price is right and the portion sizes were a little larger than necessary. The service was pretty slow though. I think we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our order and we had to ask for our check. Plan your lunch or dinner date accordingly and I think you will be happy. I am going to be bold and say, this is the best Afgan food in Phx.
