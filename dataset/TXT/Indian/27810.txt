iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w My husband and I were staying near by for a business trip and decided to stop by for supper one night, one word AMAZING! when we walked in we  didn't realize there was no menu, we were confused, and then we were notify that Ancila's herself was going to take our order and cook it. My husband loves spicy food, so he had some spicy lamb and I like decently spicy food so she complimented his lamb with the chicken I had. I forgot what it was called because we threw away our receipt but we didn't stop talking about the food until we left Canada! Will be stopping by again!
