PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q We came here for dinner on a saturday night around 8'sh. The last time I was at this Restaurant was probably 4 or 5 years ago.

The decor has changed a bit since then but the food is still great. We ordered the lamb vindaloo, Goat Masala Curry, Palak Paneer, Biryani and the bread/naan basket  along with extra garlic naan. They were all amazingly good and the naans were soft and fresh out of the oven. We also ordered the appetizer but I would recommend skipping that part and wait for the entree. For the desert, we got some kheer (pretty good) and a Gajar Haluwa which none of us really cared for. The masala chai wasn't that great either.

The service was mediocre at best.

As one of the reviewers pointed out, there are some deals on certain night including the buffet. So, you might want to check that out too.

Overall, Great food!
