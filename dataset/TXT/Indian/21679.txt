GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Really excellent food. The malai kofta is as good as any I have ever had. They have several choices of dosa. Their mint chutney tastes fresh and delicious (and is not too spicy, for those who want it milder). And yes, who does not love a chutney bar? The guy at the counter is not super friendly, and the place is certainly not fancy. The food, however, is terrific! It is as good as any really good Indian restaurant (Indian food is my favorite!), and the service is very fast. I noticed a lot of people there getting takeout, and also noticed half of their clientelle was Indian.
