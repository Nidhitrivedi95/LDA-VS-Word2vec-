ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA So... I was craving Indian food and searched for somewhere new and came across passage to India in the university area.
Hit or miss?
COMPLETE MISS.
As it was my very first time there, I walked in on a busy Saturday afternoon around lunch time. I was quickly seated at the only booth available and that was it.
No server showed up, no menu placed down... I looked around and saw a buffet, I wasnt sure if that was the only option? 
(Its my first time here and no one informed me of anything).
 Or if I was to wait forever until I received a menu? 
Either way- this place I ventured out to wasn't worth my business. 
We walked out and went somewhere that was WORTH our business,  the Thai house!! 
I got the pineapple curry chicken!
 It was delicious and satisfied my craving! Along with excellent service! Take some notes passage to India,  or shall we say passage to rude service??
