7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Since the normal Indian restaurant I go to on this side of town is closed on Tuesdays, I decided to give this new spot a try. Apparently they just opened in December. The location of this place is in a very unassuming area but don't let that fool you. As soon as I walked in I immediately like the layout and feel of the place. There aren't too many tables but it does also have a bar so there is additional seating there. I ordered take out and while I waited they gave me a brief appetizer on the house and also some water along with it. For my meal I ordered some samosas and Butter Chicken to go. I'm a big fan of spicy foods so I told them to make it spicy. And that they did! It was just the right amount of spice where I could taste it but I could also fully enjoy the flavor as well. The chicken , sauce and amount of the butter chicken dish was a great amount for the money spent. I will certainly try this place again to checkout a few other items on the menu

Also I gave the buffet a try. Not too much of a selection but the food was very well prepared and it was very good!
