LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Guru Lakshmi has the best, and highest quality Indian food I have ever tasted.
This is the best dosa you will find in Canada, and in fact, is even better than anything you will find in South India(where I have travelled to once). The most exquisite flavour combinations, and the highest quality ingredients combine to make this an absolutely mesmerizing taste experience. 

This place has high standards, and the chef's goal is for the food to remain true to its Tamil Nadu roots. The Mysore Bhaji Masala Dosa, Spring Dosa, Cheese Dosa, Pav Bhaji Dosa are a list of the ones I've tried- and they are all fantastic. Every time I go here, I am conflicted as to what to choose since everything ont he menu is delicious.

The Idli is pretty good too, and so are the Vadas. Being Maharashtrian, the several marathi cuisine infused flavours sit well with me. Owing to the large Punjabi population in Canada, most of the Indian restaurants here serve Punjabi cuisine, so having South Indian food is a nice change.

I love this restaurant, and have been here more times than I can count. Please do yourself a favour and go here today!
