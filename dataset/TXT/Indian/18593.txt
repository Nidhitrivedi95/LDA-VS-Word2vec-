eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg First time dining here. This review is strictly in regards to their dinner menu and not for their buffet. Personally in my experience, I've never enjoyed any Indian food buffet I've ever tried. Starting off, our party of 3 found the service to be very inviting and gracious. They really had a family business vibe. The cook, which I assumed to be the dad or patriarch, personally helped to deliver food to the table. We ordered the sampler (non-vegetarian) platter for an app which consisted of 2 chicken samosas, 4 chicken pakoras, and 4 shrimp pakoras. Delicious! Do not let the description of the pakoras defer you from order it. "deep fried fritters" yet they do not taste oily and the batter is made from scratch! For entrees, we ordered the sag chicken, lamb vindaloo, and paneer masala. Overall we liked the sag chicken the most because we thought the vindaloo could have been spicier (we requested 8/10 spice level). The sag was requested to be 10/10 spice and still wasn't up to par but made up for it due to its delicious flavor. We ordered the garlic naan and the peshwari naan. Garlic naan was a hit with the whole table. The peshwari naan was still decent (had coconut shavings inside which we thought to be a bit odd). Everyone had leftovers which definitely was a welcomed surprise. We do not know when we will be back but I know we will be sometime soon.
