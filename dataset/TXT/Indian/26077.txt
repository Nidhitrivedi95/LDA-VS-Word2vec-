Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw The food was just okay. The atmosphere/service was such that it felt like a fast food joint. The waitress was rushing us through, even thought the place was empty. She didn't ask if we wanted drinks, etc. She had her pen and pad ready like a diner waitress before we even had a chance to review the wine list. It is very un-classy. I wasn't expecting upscale, but I was expecting something a bit more civilized than a diner-like atmosphere. I had high hopes because it's really close to me, but I'll simply venture farther next time.
