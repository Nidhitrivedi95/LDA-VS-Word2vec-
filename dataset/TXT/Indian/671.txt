-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q If I had written a review for Mirch Masala when they were located on the square I would have easily given them a 5 out of 5 stars, but I can't due to my last visit. To be honest I have to give them 3 stars due to service... But the food was very flavorful and I love Indian food, if the service wasn't bad I could easily see myself giving them 4 or 5 stars.

We were attending a concert last Saturday at the Orpheum Theatre and wanted to grab dinner before the show. I had a craving for Indian food and remembered how much I enjoyed Mirch Masala previously. We arrived around 5pm and there were 2 other tables already dining. We were seated right away. Unfortunately the service was extremely slow. We waited about 5 minutes before the server (the hostess) came to get our drink order. At that point we each ordered a beer, and our food. It took another 10 minutes for her to bring us our beers. After another maybe 10-15 minutes our food arrived. Maybe we should have told our waitress we were in a hurry. Mind you we have now been waiting at least 35-40 minutes.

This is where I was even more upset. I remember Mirch Masala previously served Daal soup as an appetizer.. That was not the case this time. I was a bit let down but it is what it is. If I wanted it that bad I guess I should have ordered it off the menu vs assuming it would be included like it previously was. 

The food was delicious as I remember. We ordered 2 types of naan, my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (spice level 3), and I ordered the Seekh Kabab (spice level 2). I thought my dish was spicier than his was. Both were good but I think I would bump up the spice level if I go back. 

Once we were clearly done, it took another 5-10 minutes for our waitress to come with our bill... Since we were in a hurry we just gave her our payment and left as soon as she brought back the change. For as empty as the restaurant was, the service should have been much faster.
