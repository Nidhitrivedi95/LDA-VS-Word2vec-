UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA After reading the mixed reviews about this place, My husband and I took a chance and went in for lunch. We were seated quickly and our waiter took the drink order. My husband got his drink right away, I had to wait 20 mins and having to ask three times for my glass of water. We asked our waiter if he had any suggestions and he said yes I recommend any of the samplers.He told us it was more then enough food for two people. So we ordered one of the samplers and an order of samosas for our appetizer. It took over 30 mins to get our food and once we did it was barley enough food for one. The food was dry and very bland. We asked our waiter about the samosas and he said he had already given them to us, Turns out he gave them to the table behind us. He had to re-order them for us. The manager ended up giving us the samosas for free. We left this place hungry and ended up going to Mcdonalds on the way home. I will never go to this place again and do not recommend it to anyone. If I could give zero stars I would.
