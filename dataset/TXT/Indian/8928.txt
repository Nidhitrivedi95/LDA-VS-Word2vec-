They taste great cus they are filled with excessive amounts of fat and cream and ghee which tends to cover the poorer quality ingredients and mass-produced taste, but your body isn't fooled and hates you afterwards.

The true test proving the quality of the food at Copper Chimney is when we took my colleagues mom here for lunch - a native from India - and if you know any Indian mom's, you know they know food and that they can cook...and that they will be more than happy to criticize any restaurants food and convince you to just come back home to their home cooking :)

But this mama was impressed! Awed by the authenticity of many of the dishes, she liked them all and even compared a few to back home. She didn't rave about this too loudly mind you, but all the food was cleaned off her plate by the end of the meal.

The samosas are fresh, hot and crispy, and all of their curries are rich, hearty and fresh. And they will always accommodate when requested.

4 stars because the service can be a tad slow at times, hard to find parking, and the ventilation is a bit lacking.

Check it out if are craving a home-made Indian meal, without all the work!
