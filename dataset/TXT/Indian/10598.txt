A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Don't be skeptical about the grubby look of this restaurant - bright lighting, white tiles and chaotic ambiance. This is authentic food in an authentic setting - as good as you can find outside South India. I love Udupi palace's food and I've tried a great variety from their menu. My favourite is the combo meal with an uthappam or a dosa with a side of idli and a vada: I think that's a good value and fills you up enough to result into a satisfactory burp. 

They also have North Indian fare such as chhole-bhature, pav bhaji, saag paneer etc. but this is not the place to eat north Indian food (they don't do a good job anyways). The service is friendly and simple, so is their cutlery, table arrangement and the overall look. Enjoy your meal!
