nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ I came here for a Meetup and they graciously shut down the restaurant for our crew of 35 to 40 people.  

It was $25 for a full three course meal. This is a bit over my budget as my limit is usually $20 before taxes but i have to admit this was great value.  

Order: Mussels in white wine tomato sauce broth (appy), Cajun blackened salmon with fresh fruits on top and veggies on the side (entree) and espresso panna cotta (dessert).

Likes:
-The white wine tomato sauce broth was delicious.  As my dining neighbour said "Broth is so good, I'm literally licking the bowl".
-Everything was extremely fresh ( and is locally sourced).
-Largest portions I've ever seen for a prix-fixe menu.
-They aren't cheap and for the fruit toppings, they give you fancy fruits too such as Dragon fruit.
-I'm not the best picture taker and my photo's don't do this place justice, but presentation is beautiful.
-Service is very friendly.
-Open kitchen.  You see all the cooks make all the food in front of you.

Dislikes:
-While the salmon was amazingly fresh, it wasn't spicy enough for blackened food.  

Yeah that was my only dislike.

Verdict: Though it doesn't look like much from the outside, this is definitely one of the better " fancy food " places in Toronto and I'd visit again.
