P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA Solid food at this Indian restaurant but a little disappointing overall.  The best part of our meal was the vegetable jalfrezi as it had a lot of nice flavour and zing.  The bhuna beef was ok but on the otherhand, the jumbo prawn masala was overcooked and rubbery.  The rice and naan were just fine as was our onion bhajia appetizer (a little on the small side though).  I also found the layout to be cramped inside making for somewhat uncomfortable dining.
