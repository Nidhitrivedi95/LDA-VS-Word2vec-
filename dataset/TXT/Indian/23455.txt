gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Went for a dinner while on visit in Vegas. Ordered Tandoori chicken,  chicken makhani(butter chicken),  paalak paneer,  and raita. Tandoori chicken on sizzler was okay; it was moist from inside but not as flavorful as I had at couple restaurants in the bay area. Chicken makhani and raita were very good. Paalak paneer was decent, Garlic Naan was good, soft and right size. Ambience and service were standard, nothing exceptional but acceptable. This is not a fancy restaurant but certainly a place where you can go for good Indian food.
