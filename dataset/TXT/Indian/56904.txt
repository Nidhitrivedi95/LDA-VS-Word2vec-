The parking lot is pretty small - maybe enough for around 10 cars, but I found a spot even at 12pm.  There are probably 25-30 seats available in the restaurant itself.  Looks like there are quite a few people who order to-go.

I had the regular old green chili fry bread taco - it came with beef in a sauce, lettuce, and shredded cheddar cheese on top on a deep fried bread.  It was very good.  The beef was tender and not chewy or rubbery at all.  Good thing they give you a fork and knife because I don't think it's possible to eat the taco without it falling apart with the sauce.

I probably took a year off my life with all that grease, cholesterol, and fat, but it was definitely work it. I would come back here if I'm ever in the area again.
