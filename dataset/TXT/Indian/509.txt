-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g Oh my goodness!!  I went thinking I'll have a small bowl of lentil soup, but lucky for me it was a buffet of many things I've never tried!  I had a piece/ tablespoonful of everything. After 3 plates, I still hadn't tried everything, but I was full.  It was to die for! So fresh and so many flavors! The desserts were dreamy, especially the one that resembled a little boiler potato!
