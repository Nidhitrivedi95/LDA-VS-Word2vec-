TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Don't let the sketchy area keep you away, the food pisses amazing! I've been twice and had the goat curry both times. I actually stabbed my dinner partner in the hand when he reached for a bite. The cheese bread is so good and is perfect with the green mint sauce. The staff is excellent at describing the dishes and both times they have brought me samples from the kitchen at no charge! I would have given 4 stars if not for the fact I found hair in my goat the last time I visited. It ended the meal, I but I will likely be back for more. I'll just hope there are hairnets back in the kitchen.
