YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ Very good food at reasonable pricing.  I let my friend do the ordering but all the dishes we good were very good.

Expect to leave this place with a curry smell so if you plan to go out after dinner, I wouldn't recommend you going there.

The place is renovated so it looks pretty clean compared ro other Indian restaurant in the neighborhood.
