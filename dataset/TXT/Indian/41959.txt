qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA The sangria at Red Room was cheap ($16.50/pitcher) but that's probably owing to the fact that it's inconsistently mixed and has hardly any alcohol in it. My group was scattered amongst four different tables and everyone's sangria looked different. Some was light red, some was concentrated, some had carbonation (club soda, 7UP) and some had none. 

Also, I hesitated before ticking off "YES" to "Waiter Service" as it's so scarce you sometimes wonder if Red Room is self serve. 

Still, it's an OK place to meet larger groups and have cheap food. Just don't expect to be in and out in a jiff.
