gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I'm surprised that I haven't been to this place sooner. The staff was super nice and made sure that I was satisfied with my meal from spice to side dishes. I went to both lunch buffet and dinner so I could just write a single review. I recommend going to dinner and ordering everything separately because I felt the food was extremely filling and although the it's only $11, you could only eat so little (1-2 plates). To me, it seemed like the dinner also had a little better quality but everything was still really good.
If it's your first time, I recommend going to a dinner first to get a meal that you are expecting and want. I don't recommend the lunch buffet for the first time because the food will not be as fresh or made with quality and that may ruin your view on the restaurant.
Hope you guys are apply to enjoy this restaurant as I did.
