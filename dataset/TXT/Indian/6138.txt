3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I was travelling through Las Vegas and found this restaurant through Yelp. Thanks to it.
It seems a new restaurant and 5 to 10 mins away from strip. I usually go to Gandhi but found this better for various reasons.
This have plenty of parking space for vehicles and plenty of area for dining. 
We are larger group with three kids and  we need a plenty of space to move around. This restaurant was perfect for us. Coming to the food it was better than other Vegas Indian food i tasted. Since it became crowded the items are fresh that makes it delicious . I wont find anything in the heating tray for longer time. It always better to go early for buffets, we went late by 2pm so some of the vegeterian trays are already over so we got a little wait time for the foods to be prepared and filled up.

The Non veg starters are more , so you will get good options. This is typical north indian resturant so you cant expect a South indian briyani or the idly at its best. But its typical briyani and an better idly served at north indian resturant.

The butter nan and garlic nan was really delicious. 

And at that time there was option to get a Mango lassi for yelp check in, Its really very good. I found this as best among Indian resturants in Vegas.
