9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Haven't reviewed  this place for a while and though it time. The food is still great but the service was terrible this noontime visit. It was a day off for four of us so we had some beer. Had to order it twice  for the two beers and the soft drink was completely forgotten. Our used plates were building up with no one around to remove them. There was waitstaff around and it wasn't busy so it was a mystery why this wasn't done. None of the help ever made eye contact with us and it was like we were invisible! Not a good experience. Very disappointed that they don't value their customers more.
