-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw We did our usual Yelp and found this place. We were attracted by the 40 reviews with a 5 star rating. There is no name on the restaurant from the outside of the building, It turns out its inside this self professed dive bar. I walked in and asked the bartender where the Toddy Shop was and he pointed to this cut out in the wall. The food is a self order, delivered on chinette paper plates and plastic forks. So, it's raw from a dining experience, but delicious from every other perspective. I have to say it was some of the most flavorful Indian food I've ever had and I consider myself an Indian Food snob. It's not a full menu, but what they served was off the charts. We had a Pompano sautéed fish with well blended aromatic flavors and the Chicken Biryani rice dish was infused with so much flavor and the chicken tender....it was just so friggin good!! They also have pub food, wings, fries and burgers. I would definitely look at the menu. We found out, this is a temporary secret and they are in search of a new place to serve this fantastic fare
