UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Like I really have experienced better. And this isn't me being condescending and saying "my mom makes way better food" but there are other places to go to for Indian* food.

To order you press a bell and the server comes to you. We got the shrimp pakora, veggie samosas, green beans, butter chicken, and garlic naan.

It was all so ho-hum. There is a word in Hindi - swad. Swad is more than just flavour - it is the lip smacking that occurs after having an incredible bite. Indian* food is usually packed with swad. This had none. Not worth the calories. I will say their butter chicken had huge chunks of white meat which some places do lack. 

Other places to go - Lahore Tikka House, The Host, Bukkhara Grill (in sauga). 

Overall - wouldn't come back. 

*Indian food is a misnomer. India is a massive country with many different languages, ingredients and culture. The food that represents North India is completely different than South India - so really there is no such thing as "Indian" food. It's like saying "European" food and thinking that pasta from Italy should be grouped the same as bratwurst from Germany. Just a little food for thought :)
