ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ I hate to be harsh, but this is the worst Indian food I have ever had, by far. So so bland, no heat, the rice looked like it was out of a box. Prefer my gulab jamun warm and theirs is cold. I mean, it was like $8 so I guess you get what you pay for. I was just extremely disappointed in the quality
