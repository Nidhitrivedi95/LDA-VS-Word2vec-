S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Our new favorite. So fresh. So good. Nice place and wonderful owners. 
I had the Vegetable Korma and my husband had the Lamb Korma. Both amazing! 
We also had Samosas. Theirs are light and delicious. 
I love all the choices, especially all the different bread options. 
We will go back!
