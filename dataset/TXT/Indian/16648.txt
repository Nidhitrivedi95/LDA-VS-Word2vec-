DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I went to write this review, and forgot I had already written one. But here it is anyways!

This place is amazing! Everything on the menu is phenomenal. We've tried a bunch of different things:
Dosai - chettinadu cauliflower, thirunelveli spinach;
Uthappam - vegetable uthappam, chickpeas uthappam;
Curries - palak paneer, navratan korma;
Thali - the traditional Indian meal on a giant metal plate;
Other things - Pongal Avial, iddly, lassi

The food comes out quickly, the prices are great, and the portions are generous. We always get too excited, order too much, and come out too full...
