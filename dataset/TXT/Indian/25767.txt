HY5IM3dzUgO8yNgi9c0DIw Although the neighbourhood is teeming with Indian restaurants, Flavours of India remains my go-to. It used to be called Moti Mehal, and took its present name after changing hands a few years ago. It was recommended to me by Indian friends, who described the food as very good and authentic.

It's a small neighbourhood restaurant, so don't expect the decor or plating to be a wow-factor - to their credit, they did renovate about a year ago, good for them!
What really matters is the food, which is fresh, delicious AND cheap!  
We tried the vegetable pakora, butter chicken, chicken korma, baingen bhartha (vegetarian eggplant dish), garlic naan, and paneer naan. The chicken dishes could have used more meat and less sauce, but everything was delicious flavour-wise. Due to the delivery service they offer, the hardworking staff can be overwhelmed at busy hours, so waiting times varied in between courses. 

A great casual restaurant if you're obsessed with naan fresh-out-of-the-tandoori, like me.
