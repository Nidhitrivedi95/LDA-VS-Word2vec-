KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw My friends and I decided to make a trip to Toronto to fill our bellies with good food for the Thanksgiving holiday. On our way, we decided to drop by Ricks based on its trendy foods and great reviews. I would have to say, I was not disappointed and very satisfied. We decided to try out as many items on the menu as possible. We ordered the Punjabi burger, RFC sandwich, Dosa burger, loaded butter chicken fries, chickpea and meat samosas. Oh my goodness, everything was just outstanding. The punjabi burger was juicy, and packed with amazing flavors that separated this burger from every other burger I've had to date. The Rick's fried chicken burger was also just so dang good. The fried and crispy outside with juicy hot meat inside was made to perfection. The achari mayo and ting tang sauce utilized in the sandwiches made the difference. So goood. Unfortunately, I could not try the dosa burger as my friend had gulfed it down before I could take a photo or snag a bite. By the looks of it, he definitely enjoyed it. As for the loaded butter chicken fries, bombbbbskies. Although, I was starting to get full, I'm glad to have stuffed my face with the pile of hot, juicy, and buttery chicken fries. And to top it off, hot fresh samosas. Overall, LOVED this place, it definitely lived up to my expectations and the reviews. If I am ever in the area, I will have to come back and try a bunch of the other items on the menu. Super nice staff as well.
