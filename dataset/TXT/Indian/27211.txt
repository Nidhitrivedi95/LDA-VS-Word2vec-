The veg stir fry Manchurian we ordered was extremely spicy. She never asked for our spice tolerance.  Many other Indian-Chinese places ask for spice levels & in the rare instances that it is forgotten the dishes are made mild as default. 
When I mentioned this she argued with us. Whatever happened to accommodating the customer, apologizing for a mistake? This place doesn't care about customers.They also only give 1 fork - have to specifically ask for spoons?!
Most people put up with this kind of treatment in Canada. Eventually such places close because of lack of customer treatment. I'm not sure if we will go here again.
