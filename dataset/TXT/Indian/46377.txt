STukQhp01a__zTsHMBiyow The spicy chicken sandwich is easily one of my favourite sandwiches in Toronto. A great blend of flavours and their homemade bread is fantastic. The jerk chicken and curry chicken are also pretty fantastic. I highly recommend this place. On another note, they are not normally open for lunch hours, so just check their website before going.
