H75ud6IWd0lsbclqb_H0Aw This place is surprisingly good. It's not your ordinary Chinese food though as the Yelp search signifies but does serve a small amount especially the soup selection. 

I decided to give it a try cause I was under the weather and the goat sounded quite delish. Guess what, it is. If you're around the area then check it out and relax a bit inside. 

The owner is nice, there's a huge tele, pool table and if you like Indian music, well there's an abundance of it in the background. 

Also, don't be a douche and forget to tip if you're taking out. And if you're sick Chinese happens to be a fine choice anyways.
