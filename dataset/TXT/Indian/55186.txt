Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Hello, my name is Jeremy and I'm an addict.... I am NEVER going to quit! My stomach is blind and loves all foods. Today, Indian! Delhi Palace is very good. I have enjoyed every dish. If you are a beginner I truly recommend a dish called Chicken Tikka Masala. It is a real starter dish and is a mainstay on almost every Indian menu. It is fragrant, creamy, rich and warming. It is not spicy. That's just a tip for newcomers. For foodies and ethnic eaters do try the Karahi Goat very hot. It is delicious. Vegetable Korma quells the heat a little. The Paneer here is some of the best I have tasted. Fresh, firm and creamy. Daler Mehndi the "Punjab Pimp" is humming beats in my head now. I must go , my food has arrived. Oh, I love when reps bring me free lunch.  Please, do not forget the Naan. I hope you enjoy.
