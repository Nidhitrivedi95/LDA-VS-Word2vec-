xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw This is my go to place whenever I'm in the mood for fry bread. Since I'm vegetarian I order their Indian Taco most of the time. Their dessert fry breads are really good too. The restaurant is a bit pricey in my opinion and it sucks that they moved from 7th Ave to 10th street. The workers aren't all that friendly sometimes but I truly enjoy the food here. Overall I feel this place is worth 4 stars.
