pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Have been there four times, one of them I celebrated my birthday with a group of 30 people. Twice I went for brunch. It shows I enjoy that restaurant. The decor is colorful and beautiful. The ambiance is fun. Good choice of music. Service is good, with always good recommendations. The food isn't typical Indian. The fusion of Indian food make the experience more exciting. Favorite dish fig paneer pizza for dinner, lunch or breakfast...it is a must to try. Love the hot lips drink... ou la la!
