cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Came here on a Groupon due to hesitation to fully commit to trying new cuisine. So Groupons are my way of trying a restaurant without fully committing. I read some reviews and decided to give this place a shot. I am glad we did, the food and the service was a very positive experience. Not being able to handle spicy very well the kebabs appetizer were on the fire side. The mains we ordered were butter chicken (of course) and creamy cashew lamb korma . Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful with helping us choose the right dishes for us. Which meats complimented which curry/sauces. We ordered 1 rice and 1 garlic naan. The naan bread bread was very good and the garlic was a very nice touch. All of the mains were well balanced and not overly spicy. For dessert I ordered the gulab jamun (milk balls in syrup) and my bf ordered the mango cheesecake. The highlight was the gulab jamun which was so good! Also the butter chicken and the special Sweet sauce the waiter brought out for us. Really good service and the food all had a lot of flavour. I hope my review coming from a noob helped anyone who is not familiar with Indian cuisine.
