6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A I've had a lot of Indian food in my lifetime, and I was excited to try this place out for a lunch buffet. Service is good and friendly but the buffet was lacking in my opinion. There was only two popular dishes and the rest were dishes no one really orders or cares for. I had the butter chicken which was really tasty, but would have liked for there to be more options.

According to another reviewer, it seems like their weekend buffet has more options so maybe I will be back to try that out instead of the weekday buffet.

Otherwise, a spacious and clean space with friendly employees.
