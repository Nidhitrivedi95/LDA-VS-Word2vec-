gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is by far the best ( and most authentic) Indian Cuisine I can find in Vegas and I've eaten at multiple locations prior to finding this one. Their chicken Tikki masala and lamb vindaloo are my favorite dishes... but that's just my favorite I enjoy any of their curry dishes, especially the goat, and their spicy dishes are always done just right. I come AT LEAST once a week, and have for about a year now. All the people that work here are really nice and the service is amazing. When you dine-in your water cup never goes unfilled and they're very attentive. I. Love. This. Place.
