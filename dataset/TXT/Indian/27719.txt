Iqu-RwRA4XfwILKQLKQZew This review is just for the super tasty and satisfying Vijayawada biryani that I had.... sooo good.
Great for quick Indian bakery snacks and chaat  and biryani items. It remands me of street food snacks and bakery in south India 
Service is very good and friendly staff 
Definitely a place to stop for an authentic Indian experience and well worth the price
