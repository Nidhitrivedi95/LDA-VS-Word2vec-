Hasn't it always meant that the closing time on a restaurant is when it's kitchen closes and the doors close, implying anyone who has entered and ordered can stay inside. This restaurant deeply disappointed me on this regard because the manager (maybe? She had food stuck on her fingers in a manner that would be gross) told us that they would have to make sure that we leave at 10 PM.. that was literally how she greeted us. I ask her," so can we or cannot we eat here?" To which she replied,"It's your call.. we can get the food in 15 minutes but you will have to leave  at 10". 
Reviews are usually left for food, ambience and service taken into account. I leave this review just based on service. Ambience wasn't great when we visited because there was a tantalizing smoke with customers coughing all over. Stayed there for a mere 3 mins but managed to acquire a cold hearted service, a bout of cough and a stench in our clothes without having a chance to taste the food
