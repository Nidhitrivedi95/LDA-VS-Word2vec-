a8o8OMGhWg4JwbuMMnVOHQ First time dining at Pepperwalk and  our visit started with terrible service.  

The person waiting on our table didn't know the menu well, they could not make any recommendations and simply stated "I don't know" to inquiries rather than "let me find out for you".  Next, this is a dine-in restaurant, a hoody is inappropriate attire and if the restaurant wants to charge high prices for their food items, the quality should match the price.  

The double cheese burger was mediocre for $17 and the chicken parmesan sandwich at $17.50 was bland.  I ordered the chicken parmesan.  Instead of a bun or baguette, regular white bread was used.  Most concerning is the fact that the chicken was undercooked, a good portion of the chicken  was raw, for that reason I could not finish my sandwich.  It went to waste and I left there hungry.  Although the manager apologized, I still had to pay for the food, I was not offered a replacement.  I did receive a mere 15% reduction in price (even though only half the sandwich was consumd) which amounted to$2 and something sense.   Absolutely terrible.  I highly regret not snapping  a picture of the meat as verification.  Undercooked/raw meat can cause food poisoning .

The only thing decent from the foods tried by our group was the grilled portobello chicken supreme.

Would I recommend this place?  ABSOLUTELY NOT.
