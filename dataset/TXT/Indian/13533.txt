I was very sad when the Afghan owners sold their restaurant--the food was fabulous.  That said, I love southern Indian food and was pleased the first few times I ate here under the new ownership, even though they had NO chutneys, lime pickles, etc on or off the menu.
Sadly, the quality has been sliding down with each visit.  When I went this week with my family, the meal started badly and continued that way.  The pappads were awful, stale.  When I informed the waitress, she went in the back, then returned saying, "Oh, we tried to keep them crispy but the kitchen must be too humid."  She didn't take ours back or offer us an appetizer.  Instead, they sat there on the table, untouched, until we requested that she take them back to the kitchen.  For the rest of the night, I listened to her warn guests that the pappads were a bit "off."  Good grief.  Still, we didn't come for the pappads, so onward.   As usual, we ordered a LOT of food: chicken and paneer pakoras, poori chana, butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, and more.  Alas,  everything seemed like reheated leftovers.  Not horrible but certainly not what I expect when I pay someone else to cook for me.
It's not every Indian restaurant that serves dishes like dosa, utappam and idlis, so I'm sad to see what could be a good restaurant going down the road to mediocrity.  Next time, I'll drive the extra ten minutes and go to Dhaba.
