RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Wow, this has to be the worst service I have ever experienced at any restaurant, and I've been to places that no human being should ever set foot in, around the world.

We waited here for over 15 minutes, and not one person came to take our order.  That doesn't even happen in Manhattan!

You can see the workers here play favorites, though: I don't know if it was the the manager or just some worker running the show that day, but he had a long conversation in Hindi with some family with their kid, and then let them in and serve them....all the while pretending that we and some other patrons were not there.

Whoever owns this place: this took place at lunch time on Veterans Day, 2013.  I think you need to fire or deport some people here.

One person who was really nice was the lady up front.  She was really kind and welcoming,  and it looked like she was angry at the servers for being slack, but they were disrespecting her.  It was sad to see.  

This place looks nice and has nice decor: but 15 minutes with no service?  Maybe they think they are in India, and patrons need to bribe the servers for service?  Seriously, do NOT go there if you are starving or on a date with someone you care about.  You will be utterly humiliated.  It's like that episode of "Seinfeld" where they go to a Chinese Restaurant, but never get seated; the only difference is that you get seated, but then forgot about and left to die.  lol.

We just walked out and got great service at Mellow Mushroom a few doors down.  Great vegan pizza there.  We were visiting Charlotte and whenever we return, we won't be coming to the Blue Taj, which should be renamed the "Ewww Taj."
