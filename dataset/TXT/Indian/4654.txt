We were taken to a lovely seat by the window and brought a selection of dips and sauces with lovely light popadoms to nibble on whilst we salivated over the menu. Both opting for a kingfisher pint we decided the we would go for the recommended amount of dishes between two, four. We ordered butter chicken, garlic mushroom pakora, lamb sag and a minced meat pancake. 

All were tasty, filling and very well made but my favourite was the lamb. Tender and jam packed full of flavour. 

For dessert we both opted for a gulab jammin with Porreli ice cream. Wow! 

Now I've tried mother india's cafe I can't wait to go to the Glasgow branch to try more tasty treats.
