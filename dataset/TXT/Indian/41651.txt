Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I was really only recently introduced to Hakka in general and truthfully I am still quite the novice however I am officially hooked on Hakka because of this place!!

You can find it on Lakeshore East of Royal York and West of Parklawn; in Mimico I believe with enough street parking that's free after 6pm yay! 
The restaurant is cozy and quaint with limited tables but they are large enough to accommodate a pretty nice meal. I have yet to eat in as I tend to be a takeout girl these days so I can't comment much further on the dining experience. 

They have a large menu of indo-Chinese inspired items many of which they give you an option of how spicy you would like it. I have not gone any spicier then medium and even then I found it a tad hot however I am a bit of a weakling when it comes to spice. However every dish I have tried was bursting with flavor; the veggie Hakka noodles, Manchurian chicken... Ginger honey chicken... Ect. The mango lassi was absolutely incredible I do not even know how to describe how rich and fresh it tasted like the most amazing mango smoothie ever!! The portions are decent, I find the price affordable and the service is above par. They can get a tad busy at times as clearly this location is a neighborhood staple which doesn't surprise me at all....

I most certainly will be returning to satisfy my Hakka craving soon
