iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA This has to be the worst Indian restaurant I've ever eaten at. Maybe they were having a bad night, but the food was atrocious.  I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and the color of the Masala looked like light brown dog food.  The taste was super bland and I could only eat about one third of the meal before throwing it out.  The chicken was dry, chewy and far from any kind of tenderness. We also had the Chicken Tikka and the chicken was also the same, hard and chewy. Super disappointing meal!
