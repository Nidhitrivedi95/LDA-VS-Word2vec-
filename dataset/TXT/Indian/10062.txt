CONS: ?

One of the better Indian lunch buffets in Madison, for sure! They have a great variety of curries with both vegetarian, meat, and seafood options, and everything was pretty good. The restaurant was also very well-kept and the service was great. Overall, I'm not much of a buffet person, but I would return when the mood strikes.
