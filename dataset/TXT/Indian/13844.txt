bswktkxTqTFdhg8uvcuWWw Food was delicious - lamb kababs were super tender and fully flavoured. My dinner for one was great value and good sized portion, rice, three pieces of naan and butter chicken for $12!!

Service was lovely - my female server was super friendly, helpful in giving advice about food and beer. No complaints here.

Ambiance was alright, I sat by a window, which was nice, a view of Jane street, not bad.
Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, and I was delighted by the friendly service. Definitely will come again!
