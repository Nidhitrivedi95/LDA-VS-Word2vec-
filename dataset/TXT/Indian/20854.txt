g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Tried Bhel poori - seemed some ingredients are missing but tasted okay! Then comes Dahi poori - there was not much of sweet tamarind chutney recognizable in it but they made it sweet whisking yogurt with sugar, but tasted good and mouthful, soft and sweet ! I would revisit this place to try out their other chaats !
