S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Great food! Stopped by on a Wednesday night while traveling through the state. The place was pretty empty but I'm not sure why. Everything we tried (butter chicken, tikki masala, garlic naan, sauces) was amazing. The staff was super friendly too. They just opened a few months ago I think and I hope the have a great future. Awesome food!
