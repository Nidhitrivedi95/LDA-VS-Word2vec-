zdqvzYtIZYMCRAQRNfcKIw There's a new owner and this place has gone downhill really quick. 

* I've seen insects in the sweet display. The restaurant doesn't look or feel the cleanest (especially the washroom in the back).

* Very slow, and rude service. On one occasion, I placed my order with the older gentleman at the front. He took my payment (debit) and went to the back to tell the kitchen my order. When he came to the front, he accused me of not paying until I pointed out the the debit machine receipt (still attached to the payment device!)

* The prices do not reflect what is advertised on the menu. They'll come to a random figure and expect you to not ask any questions. Also, they charge more for eating in, despite the lackluster service and dirty cutlery. 

* The receipt is not itemized, they'll push whatever button their finger touches first on the register. Need to claim a work lunch? Try explaining $45 on 'Soda.'
