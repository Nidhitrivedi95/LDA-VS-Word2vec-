prFx0Kg92PfPkoU8OY4KxA Been to the place more than a few times in a very short span of time. Attended the grand opening which was amazing. Excellent music and very reasonably priced drinks. A very out of the box Friday night. The delicious food made me go to Nirvana again for dinner, twice. Not many indian restaurants here have the authentic taste of the cuisine, Nirvana surely does. Me and my friends have tried different dishes every time and have always been blown away with the amazing taste, so much so that I have a watering mouth while writing this review. The staff is super friendly. The owner, Anjali is extremely warm hearted. It's always a delight to see her smiling face. Highly recommended!
