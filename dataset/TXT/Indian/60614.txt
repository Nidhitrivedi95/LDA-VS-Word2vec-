zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Been in kabul know what good stuff is and hands down this best Afghanistan dishes in Phoenix. Lamb shank is to savor with carrots raisins, chicken boti and amazing garlic bread. No mud hut bread with goat smell but it's great to compliment dishes. Best Phoenix secret for Afghan food!
