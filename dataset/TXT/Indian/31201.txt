kMgdZVLzAXM1JQwFsPXIlg Got the medium spicy butter chicken roti to go. Guy taking the order was pretty surly. With tax it came to about $15.

It was alright. For $15 I expect a lot more. Also, my order of one item took about 25 minutes to get, which seemed excessive. Can't say I was super impressed or I'd go back.
