h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA Walked in to an empty restaurant with one man standing behind the bar. My girlfriend seemed frightened by the emptiness and wanted to leave immediately. I looked at the menu and basically took a huge risk by deciding to sit down. The man who served us may have very well been the owner. Very sweet man. Alright down the food. Very well priced. Great portions. Typical Indian style dishes though. When I eat Indian, I really don't ever expect to be wowed and I certainly was not today however the food was hot, fresh, and tasted well according to my standards for Indian food. Indian food can only taste so good and the food here is pretty good. No mistakes in any of the dishes. Ordered some Naan (fresh tandoori naan bread) with two appetizers those being the pankora chicken and vegetable samosa. Entree was a curry shrimp. Like I said, Indian food is always the same and just really isn't that great. But this place cooked the food well, everything was hot, fresh, and tasty as it could get. Last but not least all of that and two drinks were around 40$ which is practically like a free lunch. Anyways, give it a try.
