The place has a homelike yet sophisticated atmosphere. Their menu has a wide variety of options were one can adjust the level of spiciness between mild, medium and hot. Most of the options come with a bowl of rice. The lamb nihari is one of my faves. The meat is so tender and flavorful. The lamb tikka masala is a curry with onion tomato sauce. We also had choco naan for dessert which is a naan with chocolate and coconut stuffing with vanilla ice cream on top. Will definitely come back.
