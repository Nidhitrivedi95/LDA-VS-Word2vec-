RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Came here for lunch on a tue..place is very nice inside and clean..looks better interior than u will think upon arrival,but we all know that doesn't mean the most,as i've had Indian food at more shabby spots that was a bit better...food and choices was not bad.my suggestion is to invest in better buffet containers to make sure the food stays more than lukewarm,which is what the temperature was today..will come back
