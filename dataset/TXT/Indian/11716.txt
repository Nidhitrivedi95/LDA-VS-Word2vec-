aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q This place qualifies as a hidden gem. There's zero advertising - the only way you know about it is by wandering by or by word of mouth. 

This is by far not the fanciest place. Probably not a first date location. It would qualify as fast food but it is delicious and cheap. Catering to the lunch crowd mainly they are now open until 6:30 PM YES! (love it because I live next door). 

Their chicken is always tender and they have SO MANY little variations on their curry bases but they are all excellent and not overdone. 

Someone mentioned that their rice is not Basmatti this is true but I usually get their brown rice. Also, their naan isn't the greatest but it is usually very fresh. 

I go here mainly for their curry special which is an entire gigantic plate of chicken curry (up to 3 types) for $6!! Unbeatable.
