md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA Came here with my wife, the foods fantastic. Very authentic Indian restaurant, my wife and I can't get enough of the butter chicken because it's so good. 

Overall it's clean and has a very good presentation. Neat and organized. Will love to visit other branches in the future.
