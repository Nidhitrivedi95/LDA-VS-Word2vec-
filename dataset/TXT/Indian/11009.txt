A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ Decided to try Desi Spice mainly because of the reasonable price for an all you can eat buffet ($12.99).  When I read the reviews and saw all the positives I figured it would be a small investment to lose if the place didn't meet with my expectations.  The place exceeded my expectations.  The atmosphere and ambiance was great.  Indian music got our feet tapping.  The staff are very helpful and friendly.  I give the place two thumbs up for cleanliness.  The food was spectacular.  There is a huge assortment of vegetarian dishes as well as non-vegetarian.  Tandoori chicken was awesome, two kinds of goat curry.  I didn't eat any of the cake type desserts but had ice cream.  I loved the banana and chocolate ice cream combination.  The fruit was fresh and sweet.  Defiantly recommend Desi Spice and my go to place when I need an Indian food fix.
