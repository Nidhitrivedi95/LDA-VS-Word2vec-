KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Bombay Chopsticks is a regular go to place for my wife and I. It's a very home-y place that serves hot and tasty food very quickly. As regulars, the staff has grown to know us. They're quite friendly and very efficient.
We always order the Crispy Beef and one of the fried rice. You simply cannot go wrong here. The wife orders the Hot and Sour Soup almost every time we visit. She swears by it. Other items we order are the Eggplant with Manchurian Sauce with the sauce on the side. (We do this so that if we have to take it home, the fried eggplant doesn't go mushy.) I won't go into describing each item. In general, I just have to say that the food seems home cooked - which is a very good thing for me. Okay, if you're home has a high temperature wok :-)
 The menu has a lot of items. However, if you take a look carefully, a lot of it is just a mix and match of the meats/veggies and sauce/cooking style. Whether this is good or bad depends on you. For me, it just makes selection much simpler. For example, I like the fried eggplant with the Manchurian Sauce. Maybe next time I'll try it with another sauce. 
The place itself is very clean. The decor is lightly South Asian with subdued lighting. It's a good place for a quiet dinner with a date or some friends and family.
