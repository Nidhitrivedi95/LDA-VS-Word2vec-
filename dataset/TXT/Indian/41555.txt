Was a bit disappointed that our Groupon was not honored-- the hostess said that the previous owners posted the Groupon and they've been trying, unsuccessfully to have it removed. She made up for it with quality service.... we were the only people in the place at the time, so we had her full attention. 
When I'm in the mood for Indian/Pakistani food...I'd go back.
