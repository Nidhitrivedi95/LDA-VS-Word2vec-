3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I love this place. I think about the food, ambiance and experience as soon as book my travel to Vegas. I've never been here during the lunch buffet but the dinner is always quiet, Intimate, and on-point.  The waitstaff is appropriate and the food is exceptional, $20 for sampler menu. I just love coming here and Krishna (ask for him) is the best.
