-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw I normally do not review, and having worked in food service before, I do my best to give the benefit of my doubt to the restaurant. But my experience taking out food involved chicken bones where there wasn't supposed to be any and inedibley salted dishes. The only things we could eat we're the mango lassi and plain rice. Avoid going.
