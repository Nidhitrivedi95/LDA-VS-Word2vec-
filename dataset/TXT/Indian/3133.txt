0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg Omg Ive been coming here since it opened and havent been disappointed. Truth be told: i order the same few things every time I go. The Samosa Chaat is by far the tastiest thing on the menu and best value (can easily feed 2 as a meal). I also like the papdi chaat, the gobi manchurian, and the bullet naan. Bullet naan is spicy in a really good way! And mango lassi is cooling to counter the spicy naan :). Definitely one of my favorite spots in Mecklenburg county.
