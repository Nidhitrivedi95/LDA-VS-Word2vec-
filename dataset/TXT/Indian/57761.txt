yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Wow.  Incredible.  Found this restaurant via my frequent flyer dining program.  Sure glad I did.  Warm and friendly and owner recognizes me every time I visit.  Take visitors there too.  Usually go with my my friend.  TG we both love Indian food.  My mother, now in her eighties, always look forward to eating there when she visits from Ohio.  Taken a number of friends there, and have a couple of friends coming from England in April.  It will be off the plane, straight into Dhaba from there.  Can't think of a more wonderful place to re establish old, long friendships.  Hope they are there forever.  I've eaten Indian in England, Canada and the US.  This is the BEST by far!  Try it, you'll love it
