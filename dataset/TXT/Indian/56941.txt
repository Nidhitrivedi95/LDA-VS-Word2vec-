xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I have a natrual affinity for grease...so reading the reviews, I had one of those "aha" moment...square peg, square hole.

But..(sorrowful violin in the background)...me and FBH...we just weren't meant to be...I was looking for a bit more crisp in my deepfry relationship...while FHB had that mysterious salty yeasty flavor that I didn't even know that I was looking for...it was seriously lacking that soul-filling crispiness that break against my teeth on first bite before falling into pillowy steaming breadiness

Conclusion:  Definitely worth a try if you haven't had fry bread before.
Now that I tried it...I'd go back if I'm in the area...but personally not something that I would drive out of my way for.
