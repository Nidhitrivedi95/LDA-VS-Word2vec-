ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ I have been a few times for the lunch buffet and for 9$ it was rather good. It has your Indian basics. They use chicken and lots of veggies to keep the price down but it's still very good. I also like the small dessert bar they set up. I say if you looking for a filling on the heathy side lunch this is a good place to go.
