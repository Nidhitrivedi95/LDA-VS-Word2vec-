51yM2HV5lsE8Feuhvs-pGg I was happy to see that this place is near to my home and we were excited for our visit and moreover for the food. Food is good but the way they do the calculations are not. According to there convenience they add "service fee" extra excluding the exact bill and taxes. And these "Service Fee" is compulsory. We gave extra 10$ just for there "Service"!! So I'll not recommend this place to anyone. They are a bit slow too.
