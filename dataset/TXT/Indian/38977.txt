OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Can only give so many chances ate in once but couldn't go to bar for happy hour as private function. Tried to go to advertised buffet on a Sunday they weren't open. FINALLY  Checked out web site for happy hour says on happy hour menu from 3pm. Then says on web page happy hour from 4pm however go there at 4.30 on a Friday to be told not open until 5.30. To bad don't care about service
