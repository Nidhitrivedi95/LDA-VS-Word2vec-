MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ My friends and I were arguing over which restaurant was the best in Toronto. One of them insisted it was Bombay Palace and after trying this place, I still prefer The Host because you just can't beat the butter chicken at The Host. 

That said, the prawn marsala here is WONDERFUL. My friends and I were scrambling over the last bits of sauce with our naan. That's how good it was -- we were fighting over the dredges. 5 stars for this dish.

We were a large group so we ordered various dishes. The butter chicken was too tomato-ey and nothing special. That's what I find -- unless you get the butter chicken at The Host, there's really nothing great about this dish. It's a safe innocuous dish for timid eaters. The pakoras were good. The saag paneer was decent. We also ordered lentils, but I thought it was weird that the lentils were cooked with red beans. It tasted more like Mexican than Indian. I don't care for lentils and I *really* don't care for lentils with beans.

We also ordered mango dacquiris, which were delicious, but barely had any alcohol. But it was very tasty. It tasted like they pureed a fresh mango right then and there. Would have been better with more alcohol. And if it were colder. 

Anyway, Bombay Palace was really nice to us and gave us free mango ice cream afterward. Tasty!
