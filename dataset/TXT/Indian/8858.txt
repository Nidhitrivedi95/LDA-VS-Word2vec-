7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg The food was really rich, flavorful and delicious -- and my husband and I are pretty particular when it comes to Indian food. We ordered take out and the food was ready within 30 minutes and the server called to let us know.  My only tiny disappointment was that the main features of the dishes could have been a bit more substantial. For instance, while the Malai Kofta sauce was amazing, I was left wanting more than four smallish of the fried potato and cottage cheese balls. We will be back though, and I'm really hoping this restaurant is a success!
