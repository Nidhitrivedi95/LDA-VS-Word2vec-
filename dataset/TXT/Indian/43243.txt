RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg I came in with high expectations. I have eaten at a related restaurant in Southern California and expected the food quality to be the same here. I was disappointed. 
The buffet offered six items, and the flavors were mostly bland with some items on the very salty side. The rice had been out too long and there were hard bits here and there. 
There weren't many restaurant patrons for The Sunday buffet. It was sad. The owners need to get some recipes from the more successful related locations and consistently implement them here. If they do that they'll be set. 
They have a beautiful room for larger private parties. It was set up, but with the empty boxes and other out of place items in there, it doesn't appear to be used much.
