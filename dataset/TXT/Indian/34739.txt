Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Stopped in for a late dinner and we were greeted very friendly and had the best Indian food!  Kumar,
our friendly server, kept our glasses full and made sure we were very happy. We had chicken tikka masala - (nicely spicy!) and chicken korma, creamy and delicious!! I highly recommend this restaurant while you are here in Vegas.  Thanks Kumar!!
