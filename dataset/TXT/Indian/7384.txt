5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q Fantastic. Fresh and excellent. The spices were amazing. If you want good Indian food done perfect recommend this restaurant. And the prices are decent to which is always a plus. 


Had friends bring takeout from here a while after first time went. Still fantastic. Sometimes skeptical when first time really good. But both times great.
