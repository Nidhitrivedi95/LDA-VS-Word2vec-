rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I'd heard this place was "overpriced" for the food they serve so it took us a while to actually get out and try it for ourselves. I'm so happy we did! This was delicious "fusion/westernized" style high-end Indian food!

We ordered three incredibly tasty dishes:
1) the string vegetable chaat: WOW the texture and flavours were so unique. It felt light but filling.
2) the Steak Vindaloo: perfectly cooked sliced steak (although the cut wasn't specified?). sauce had tons of depth and spice. also didn't feel too heavy even though it was a meat dish.
3) The French beans with onions and coconut: perfectly crunchy green beans, toasty flavour from the coconut and onions. 
Also: we had rice, naan, and the chutney platter (the chutneys should NOT be missed, everything on that plate had great flavour.

We will definitely come back here and try more dishes next time.
