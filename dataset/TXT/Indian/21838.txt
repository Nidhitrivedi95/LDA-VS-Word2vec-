gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw On a busy downtown Las Vegas evening, my friend and I decided to get some food for dinner. This time, we wanted to try something different than the normal pizza and food truck options. Although this place has been here for a while, I keep forgetting that Kabob Korner existed. Well, no matter, this particular night was definitely going to happen!

At first sight, the place is a little drab. Red and wooden brown are the color schemes. Wall seating also had a blue padded backing to it. They don't offer wait service here, so that might be the reason for the non upkeep. You basically approach the counter, and order. When the food is ready, you'll go up and pick it  up. 

For dinner, I decided to get the number 1, the Beef Kabobs for $8.99. Two strips of beef, saffron rice and a salad of tomatoes, lettuce and cucumbers. The beef was nicely seasoned however I little dry. The saffron rice had a nice flavor to it and the salad, in my opinion was just there as a filler. The overall dish was alright. 

I've been to Kabob Korner many times and thought their food was great. This visit was just OK, but it won't stop me from returning. In a place like downtown, it's a great option for locals and visitors alike! If you're on Fremont East, come by and check them out!
