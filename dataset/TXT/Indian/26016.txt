We've had a few veggie options, including paneers in the butter chicken sauce and I can tell you that my boyfriend is already addicted to the place. You can bring your own wine. The gulab jamun aren't the most flavourful I got but the rest is very decent. They also don't have homemade chai tea. If you order to go, call beforehand as it can take 20 min to get your food.
