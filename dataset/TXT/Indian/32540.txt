LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA The best place For dosa. The wait is SO LONG but it's ok because you can get hungrier while you wait and the food will taste even more delicious. The dosa are always huge I can never finish one have to take it home (not a good idea as it gets soggy try your best to finish at the restaurant). The service is amazing, servers constantly asking if everything is alright and making sure everyone knows the heat level for the dosas they choose. 
Great place must check it out!
