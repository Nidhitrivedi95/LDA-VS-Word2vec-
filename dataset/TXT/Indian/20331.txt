The spicy onion rava masala dosa is a must have with its crispy texture, the vada were incredible along with the pav bajji. To top it all off was the madras filter coffee wwas as authentic as can be. The service provided by Vinod and the rest of the team was excellent from start to finish. (They also had some cool Tamil music playing in the background which was also very cool)
