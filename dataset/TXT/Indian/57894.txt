yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The $11 a-curry-a-day lunch combos was paltry and plain bland. Dal was flavorless and the rice was tough. So I effectively paid $11 for a few mouthfuls of chicken curry (which was decent) and two pieces of naan. I'd rather go to a place like little india where they charge half as much without the fancy decor.
The paneer entree dishes though are just fabulous. If two people are going I'd say forget about variety and just order paneer.
