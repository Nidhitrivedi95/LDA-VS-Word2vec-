RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Stopped by this restaurant for dinner after flying into Charlotte Airport. The decor is lovely and the food is rich and on point. Service was great as well. I recommend the sweet lassi (I'm sure the other flavors are great as well). It was a little pricey for what we got but still a great spot to go to if you are craving (North) Indian food.
