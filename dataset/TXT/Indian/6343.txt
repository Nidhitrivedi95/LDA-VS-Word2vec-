3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Ate at the Curry Twist for the first time. Enjoyed the veggie and non-veg entrees. Aloo tikki reminded me of my mom's aloo tikki. The Laccha parantha was lovely too and so were the chicken dishes. Loved the ambience and were so glad we had a chance to eat at this divine place at the Junction. The chef was wonderful and so was the staff. 5 stars all the way!!
