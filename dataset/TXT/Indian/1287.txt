But it's in a particularly obscure area of Pittsburgh (who would thought there'd be a restaurant of any type on this stretch of road). And it was 3/4 empty on a Sunday evening at 6:30 pm.

The extensive menu is packed with Indian food like you've probably never experienced. Fortunately, there were three of us and we were able to try a variety of dishes. This is vegetarian food and it's spectacular - clean and distinct flavors and interesting condiments.

The service was plain. As someone else said, they take and deliver your order, and then leave you alone. We didn't notice the interior much (our eyes were in the menu), but it seemed pretty ordinary. 

We ate a lot of great food for $36, including tip. What's not to like?
