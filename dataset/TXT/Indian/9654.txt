8vq9tnnH5qvnbBdeXYBJyw I have gone to this restaurant several times as a student at York and over the years the quality has gone down for the most part.

First the food - some of their dishes taste really good and are really well prepared. Their food is good in the morning and afternoon but usually stale and cold towards closing hours in the evening. The quality has gone down because their dishes are more watered down now and they giving miserly portions of vegetables/chicken with lots and lots of rice.

Second, the staff. This one is a hit and miss. One or two of the employees are generally pleasant to customers but a lot of them are apathetic students, quite a few with attitude problems. So beware and do not be too pleasant for disappointment may be just around the corner.

Finally, the atmosphere itself. Love the paintings on the wall and the ambient vibe of the place. The music is usually good with many eclectic songs played from the South-Asian sub-continent. One negative part is that there are just way too many signs clarifying the rules of the place. Signs, for instance, clarifying what kind of food you have to order so you can sit there and eat, or how you can't pay with any pennies or how to eat a wrap. Yes, instructions on how to eat a wrap. I understand that they cater to students but this is the only place on the entire campus with such a large litany of rules. 

All in all, I give it a 3.5/5 for the times when their food is so good that everything else comes second. Bottomline, Get take out and avoid the staff.
