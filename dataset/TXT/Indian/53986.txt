Vp8Dkam_Hv204Or0hul1NQ Note of Caution: If you order something to be spicy, it becomes TOO spicy. Like suicidal spicy. 

An accompanying friend made this mistake by ordering his biryani as spicy. All he could taste was the spiciness and nothing else. Needless to say, he didn't finish his dish. 

The hostess/waitress/co-owner was welcoming enough. She was dressed in a traditional Indian sari. That was a nice touch. 

The butter chicken was pretty heavy, and I guess it's meant to be like that with all the spices and cream. I was pleased with the tenderness of the meat. (Random thought: I have a feeling that I've been lucky to come across only tender chicken this month.) Butter chicken came in a smaller-than-expected dish but it was a perfect amount. I literally could not fathom eating anything else after, except maybe a bit of that too-spicy biryani since my friend was in dire straits. Finishing it off with (sweet) lassi was a better idea than water for this visit. 

By the way, what would salty lassi taste like? I shudder at the thought of it. The hostess/waitress/co-owner gave me the option of sweet or salty, but I could not, for the life of me, order a salty lassi.
