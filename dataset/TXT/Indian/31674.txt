KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Detroit needs an Indian-Chinese fusion place as good as this one.  I had lunch here a few months back and intended to finish this review sooner.  I really enjoyed the Chili Chicken Biryani and the HOT and Sour Soup.  My daughter opted for "General George(Tsos)"  Chicken and some Spring Rolls.  

Portions were huge, the prices low, and the service was excellent!
