VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ Please return to the greatness....

Many many fond mouth-watering memories of deliciously complex flavors insist that I rate Guru a 3 STAR (I can't bring myself to rate it 2 Stars it would feel such a betrayal). But over the last year I have found myself progressively disappointed and longing for the pre-2017 yum-splosiveness.

The flavors seem muted now, not bland compared in isolation, but definitely so in comparison to Guru's brilliance a year or more ago.

I hate saying it's just OK now.

I want to hop in the DeLorean, roar up to 88 mph, kick in the Flux Capacitor, and return to the glory days when:

 - Darcie and I were ambassadors to so many friends who had never tried the cuisine
 - Guru Lamb Vindaloo, Sheesh Kebab, and Biryani of any type had the power to arrest all your senses such that you could only live in the complex flavors.

I'll be back Guru. Back fearfully but with the highest of hope.
