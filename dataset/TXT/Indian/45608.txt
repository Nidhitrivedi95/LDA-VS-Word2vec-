ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Love the lunch buffet with fresh hot naan brought to your table!  They have a good variety of items on the buffet and it's always busy, so get there early to avoid the rush!  Chicken Tikka Masala, basmati rice, fried vegetable fritters, goat curry, palak paneer, and kheer (rice pudding) are some usual favorites.  The staff is very friendly and is good about refilling your water quickly.  

The restaurant is clean and welcoming, but could probably use a makeover.  
I haven't tried anything off their regular menu, but I'll be sure to update my review when I do so.
