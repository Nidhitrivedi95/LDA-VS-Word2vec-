jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg My husband and I ate here for the first time recently.  The food is delicious! If you're looking for amazing, authentic Indian cuisine, this is it!  The leftovers were just as good the next day!  I subtracted one star, because the service could be just a little better, but nothing that would keep me from coming back for more!
