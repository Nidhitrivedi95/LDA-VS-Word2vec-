2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw What a great place for fresh baked indian goodies with a to-go options of several hot entrees such as dosas, curries, tandoor. The samosas are tasty but fried. I wish the had names as well to describe what each sweet item is. Bring cash or your debit card as they do not except any other option. I loved the chutneys  you must ask for it otherwise they do not offer it.
