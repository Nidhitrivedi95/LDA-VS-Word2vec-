g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ Came here on a Wednesday with a coworker.  Not far from the hotel I was staying at and what a great find.  As you walk in there is a counter to order at and the menu board behind.  Tables are off to the right.  A few bench seating areas as well as high-top tables.

We decided we'd order and share (family style).  I ordered the daily special (Lamb Curry with rice) and some Naan.  My Coworker ordered a couple of small plates.  Vada Pau, spicy Phel, and one other that I can't remember.  

We took a seat and shortly there after the dishes started coming out.  One by one.  There didn't appear to be any reason for the order of the dishes.  Needless to say everything was very good.  I was told that the dishes are very much Mumbai street food style.  Not that I would necessarily know what that is, but it was all very good.  We had ordered too much food and ended up not finishing everything. 

Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the food served and it felt like it wasn't westernized.  I was also surprised by the other reviews and find it odd that I had such a good experience while others seemingly didn't.  I liked it and I'll go back.
