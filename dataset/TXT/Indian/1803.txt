-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw YES! Good food, good value. The thali option is great but keep in mind that it is A LOT of food, even if only 9 or 10 dollars (including tax!). The lamb curry, butter chicken and aloo gobi were all delicious and flavourful. The naan was perfect. I also tried the masala dosa, which was good but way too carby for me.

A note - I found the food at thali to be only barely spicy, and I'm pretty sensitive to spice. So if you like that burn-in-your-mouth spicy curry that many other Indian restaurants provide, Thali is not the place for it. Thali is the place, however, to more than satisfy a hungry stomach with Indian flavours for not a lot of money.

It's a very casual set up. Pay at the cash, shift down and hand over the white slip to the person down the counter, and wait for food / point to what you want. There's self-serve ice water behind the counter.

Edit: went back and got the lamb wrap (5.50 incl. tax). so good!!!
