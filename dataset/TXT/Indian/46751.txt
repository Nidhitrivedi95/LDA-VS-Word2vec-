t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg There's not many Indian places close by but lucky for me this is one of the great ones! Saffron Flavors of India is 4 stars for a couple of reasons. 

Pretty much every dish I have had so far has been superb. Before I get ahead of myself let me tell you get the garlic naan! I love their naan and it comes out nice and hot. Next comes your main dish. The curry is always a go to. If you want something already mixed try the rice fields dishes as it's already mixed for you.They always ask you your spice level. I caution you if you have never eaten Indian food do not go for the 8 or higher right off bat for spiciness. You may end up like my friends who find it way too hot. I usually go between 3-7 depending on my mood. For dessert I usually do the Peshwari Naan. 

Service is great. They always come by to check and see if you need that water refilled and if you got a spicy dish chances are you do! 

I love the ambiance of the place. It can be the place you go to meet friends or that romantic date with your special someone. Last night for instance it was a little more quiet with some couples on dates and me and my friends were probably the loud mouths lol.
