We went there thinking we'll order just a thing or two but looking at the spread for brunch buffet, changed our minds.

Despite being busy, it was tidy and clean and we were promptly attended too.

Everything had a terrific quality! I know it sounds presumptuous of me but I loved, well everything. The thing is even the best items from Ala Carte are dressed down for buffet but not in this case.

I loved their crispy Medu Vadas and three kinds of Coconut Chutneys. They don't place Dosa and Puri among the spread but regularly serve that on your table. Upma tasted exactly like what I used to get back home.

I bowed out but not before sampling their filter coffee. Ahhh, the bitter sweet flavor of Chennai that I missed.

Economical joint. $35 all in including tip for two!
