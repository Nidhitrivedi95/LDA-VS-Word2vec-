Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg My first time here. The Sunday Buffet dinner was just amazing. The Idlis were so soft, they just melted in my mouth.
You MUST try this south Indian dish to believe it. One of the best Idlis I have eaten outside India.

I had to take a STAR off because they employ kids to serve water and plates.Somehow dint like the idea of that.
