C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I don't understand why people like this place or why it's mentioned as the most romantic brunch place. 

Sure, the atmosphere is great but the food isn't. It's pretty awful. I wish Toronto actually had GOOD brunch places downtown without me having to go to Leslieville. Very disappointed.
