Xl2zyEFXHSHS4Xpo6ja4BQ Right location, wrong taste buds.  We found this place as we were strolling down Rose St.  on Friday evening.  While we knew there are better Indian restaurants on other parts of town, we thought we'd give it a try especially because there were tables available (I wonder...).

We ordered the ordinary dishes: chicken tikka, veg pakora, mix tandoori, chicken tikka masala and goolab jamun.  Now... I'd have given a 3-star rating if these ordinary dishes tasted ordinary.  Unfortunately, only the goolab jamun and the veg pakora tasted ordinary.  We asked the mix tandoori to be spicy and they came out almost bland.  It came (unexpectedly) with a dipping sauce, but the sauce made it worse as it tasted like a marinara sauce bought from Tesco.  We asked for a spicier sauce, but apparently adding chili to the sauce made it taste like... pasta sauce with chili.  The tikka masala wasn't as bland as the tandoori, but it just tasted like they forgot one or two spices.

One thing for sure... there are many better options for curry in Edinburgh.
