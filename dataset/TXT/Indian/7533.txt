The commercial-office unit that the restaurant is located in is in a really weird area.  Although it's facing Erin Mills Parkway, right across from Sheridan Mall (dead), it's not easy to access the parking lot.  There's only 1 entrance/exit on the north side, so this may have something to do with the less than bustling atmosphere.

The menu is quite similar to other Afghani places with an added dimension of Indian food as well.

Service was friendly, although English wasn't 100% proficient.  Communication was still ok.  I ordered fries, but my dinner came with rice, and they just brought a side of fries IN ADDITION to the rice.

Portion EASILY is 2-3 portions where the rice is considered!  The portion of protein was sufficient for at least 1 meal+.

*If* I was in the area and felt like Afghani food, I'd go back!
