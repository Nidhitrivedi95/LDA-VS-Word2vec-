TElfyEowMFTPR1gAwMLcNQ So I've been looking forward coming to this establishment for months and finally last night my inlaws were in town and wanted them to try Indian for the first time.

First of all I didn't realize that it was a buffet - my #1 faux pas for Indian cuisine.   Second the service though she was friendly was not good.   Only two tables occupied in the place and drinks took forever and I had to get up and ask for the check.  And finally the place itself felt off -random Egyptian art on the wall to name one but just didn't feel the warm and fuzzy walking in there.   Not sure if I'm going back.
