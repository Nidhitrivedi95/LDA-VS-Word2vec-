Mutton buns and fish buns - OMG.

They have sharbat sometimes - I like the pink one - tastes like rose water, so heavenly.

They make a wicked crab - be prepared for copious amount of chili.  Mmm mmm.

They had a dish today made with chickpeas, coconut slices and dried chili.  Unbelievably good flavour.  This place is solid.  Tried and true.  Reliable.  Love it there!
