jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I am someone who hasn't had Indian/Mediterranean food in a really long time! (5years) from the last time I remembered it I really enjoyed it and I remember the bread (naan?) was pretty crispy. Anyways this place is really good! The bread is definitely not crispy..but still good! I had chicken samosas, chicken tikka masala, and binyani raita. I loved the tikka masala of course.. because it isn't spicy!! I am unfortunately not in the club for spicy-Ness. It is pretty creamy and it comes with a side of rice! My second fav was the chicken samosas! Some pink sauce is sweet and the green sauce is...green hahaha i can't explain the taste but definitely worth trying! And the last one was the biryani with raita. This one is the some what spicy one. Keep in mind that I don't like spicy food so this might not even be spicy for someone who loves it. The bread (naan) is kind of chewy bread? Still really good! Everyone go try it once!..you might just like it (=


I ordered on the phone for pick up btw.. and the girl asked me the spicy-Ness level for the biryani and I said 0.. she laughed and said the lowest we have is level 4.. hahahhaha! Kind of pricy btw.. but portions are big!
