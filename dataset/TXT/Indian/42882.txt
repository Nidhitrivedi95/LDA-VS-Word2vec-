RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Some of the best food I've ever had in my life. Not just best Indian food, but food period. 

The curry goat is phenomenal as well as the chicken tikka. 

You have to get their coconut tomato soup. 

I recommend going for lunch though, it's the best deal. You get soup, an entree and desert for $12 and it's almost as much as the dinner portion. 

I highly recommend that you try this restaurant.
