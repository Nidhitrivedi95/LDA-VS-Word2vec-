uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA Have been here a couple of times to grab some quick rolls or samosas. This last visit, ordered a fish roll and a mutton roll... and due to lack of protein I couldn't tell at all which one I was eating. Last bite of the mutton roll there was a tiny piece of meat. The rolls ARE a dollar so I can't expect much I suppose. Deliciously spiced - I may have to give other things a try here.
