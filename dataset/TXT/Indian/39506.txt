OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA The Shrimp and Chicken pakoras are quite good but apart from that, I wasn't impressed with anything else. The place positions itself as Indian Style Chinese I.e Hakka but the masala portion is definitely missing. I have had better fried rice, noodles and manchurian at other places (Hakka 77, Fredricks). The pricing is very competitive -I think it's the cheapest out there. The portions are large and the service is fast. It's not a bad option but not my kind of food
