We enjoyed the food here, the service was fine, if a little slow with checking up on us.  My wife ordered her dish mild, but came out spicy. The flavors were good, the portions decent, although not as big as some other places.  We ordered samosas which were tasty but could have been crispier and not so greasy.  I think we would return here again, maybe to get a take-out order.
