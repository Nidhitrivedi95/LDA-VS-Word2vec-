gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg This restaurant was so good. I wish I would have come here before. If you have not tried Gobi Manchurian, you need to come to this restaurant and eat it. The prices are extremely reasonable service is fantastic and as I said, the food is delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and even my enemies.
