i68lkBrGgUVwOk-LSvMj_A Like its other locations downtown and by CMU, this Squirrel Hill storefront offers food for a bargain.  For $6, you can get rice and all four of the vegetarian (vegan, too, I think) dishes OR rice, the chicken, and two of the veggie selections.  The portions are huge, and can feed you two days in a row if you've got a good appetite, or maybe even three days in a row.  Unlike the other locations, the Squirrel Hill branch only serves dinner, and only Monday-Friday.

The four vegetarian dishes available the day I visited were a dal, spinach with black-eyed peas, chickpeas and potatoes, and tofu with mixed veggies.  Of the four, I disliked the tofu and mixed veggies--I'm a fan of tofu, but this tofu was way too spongy.  The other three selections were all right, though not spicy at all and too liquid-y.  As other reviewers have remarked about the other locations, the naan was really a piece of store-bought flatbread that tasted a little stale to me.

Does Sree's have the best Indian food?  No.  Is it one of the best options for dinner in Squirrel Hill?  No.  Is it worth the money, if you're on a tight budget and want something fast and filling?  Yes.
