PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Just placed an online order. New to Indian cuisine. Chose a few items and placed the order. I called shortly after and asked what would be recommended (maybe I should have called 1st) and if she could see what I ordered would be good for a new Indian palette. She was very hard to understand, which is no big deal, I figured we could still try to communicate. I asked what kids liked too and what suggestions she had beyond my order...she hung up on me. I'm not sure if that was offensive in a traditional Indian culture to feel that way by my questions to see if she could recommend something but I sure did feel like I needed to cancel my order stat. I called her back and she said that canceling was ok. Again a language barrier may have been involved; either way - I can't say this experience was positive.
