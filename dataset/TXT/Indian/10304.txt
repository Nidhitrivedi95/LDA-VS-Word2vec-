9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w The taste of the food at this place is good and the portion sizes are decent, but not good enough to allow me to ignore the terrible service that comes with it.
I arrived when it wasn't too crowded and yet to get any sort of service seemed impossible. I was literally waving my arms around for some sort of attention. No one came to refill our glasses of water or take our order, and I also noticed that they give complimentary pappadums to all their customers, but not to us. 
I got extremely frustrated. On top of that the servers finally approached us with a total lack of enthusiasm, as if they were forced to do their job.
     I ordered the baigan bhartha, which was good and my brother got the thali. All of it was good, but not amazing. I have definitely had better in a place that also has great service.
I don't think I would go here again, unless I here that they have re-trained their staff.
