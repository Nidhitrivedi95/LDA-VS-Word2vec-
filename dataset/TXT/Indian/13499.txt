The last time we were there, back on March 1st (my birthday, by the way), the buffet was all but empty, the service had gone downhill, and it was stuffy inside. We kept waiting for new additions to the buffet, but none came. Of course, we were still charged full price. They had better step it up--I just reviewed two new competitors that will give them trouble otherwise.
