epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg AMAZING food!

I ordered for pick up and the food was hot and ready on time and the employee was super polite and helped me cash out really quick.

I ordered the Mattar Paneer Roti and the Butter Chicken Roti. They were so delicious! The portions were enormous so I had enough left over for lunch the next day. The food is definitely worth the price.

The interior feels like a food court but it's easily forgiven considering the food is delicious. Hopefully management will make efforts to make the Dupont location look more fancy!
