xhPdBbduivnHYTnoM0K1Bg Okay, I have quite a number of co-workers from the Indian sub-continent.  They are excellent cooks and represent various parts of India.  So, I'm a little spoiled when I go to local restaurants and the food isn't up to par.

Kohinoor is that exceptional restaurant!  OMG! The bread basket alone will induce fits of breadgasm and make one wish that they were in the Tandoori oven that the breads were baked in.  My inner carb child was definitely satisfied with the breadbasket that we were served,

The chicken tandoori was was unlike any that I have tasted in the tri-state area and is the best that I have tasted, EVER!  Most tandoori chicken relies upon the spices to carry it along the pathway to tandoori heaven.  The Kohinoor's tandoori chicken had various distinct flavor elements that would make a mere mortal drool!  Salty, savory, smoky!  What's not to like?  The crispy edges could induce one to search for the chicken in the daylight with a flashlight in order to find that dish!

Now to the downside....  PLAN  on spending half of your time on planet Earth getting your food..  I was a part of a party of three and it took us over an hour to receive one of dishes that we ordered.  We ordered 2 appetizers and three main dishes and we actually received 2 of the main dishes before the appetizers and waited an eternity for our food.  BE PREPARED TO WAIT FOR YOUR FOOD!

That being said, the food is superb and delicious!
