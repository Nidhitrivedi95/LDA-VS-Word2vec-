tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Once again Yelp gets it right! This was my first time to an Indian restaurant and Indian cuisine so I did my research via Yelp. I found India Oven to have 4.5 star review with over 600 reviews. After all 600 Yelpers can't be wrong. Many of the reviews were from people with Indian sounding names so I decided to give this place a try.

It is not lavishly decorated, but it does lend to a middle eastern ambience. I came for the lunch buffet on a Saturday which was suggested on one of the reviews. There were several kinds of lamb and chicken dishes and a number of vegetarian ones also. I did try them all. 

The lamb vindaloo was good, not as spicy as the lamb masala. Both dishes had large pieces (about an inch cubed) of lamb cooked in a spicy tomato gravy and diced potatoes. The lamb masala was my favorite item on the buffet. The basmati rice was the perfect compliment to the lamb masala. 

The chicken dishes were also cooked in a spicy gravy. he chicken curry was mildly spicy and the chicken vindaloo was medium heat. My favorite was the chicken Tandoori. Pieces of chicken baked with a mild spicy coating.

A few other dishes I really liked were kadni pakora. a kind of dumpling in a curry gravy, and the chana masala, chick peas and ginger on a spicy sauce.

The deserts were nothing to write home about, but the mango lassi was to die for. A smooth creamy mango punch that you can refill as often as you like. And yes, as the yelpers said, unlimited naan. They come around every 10 minutes with more hot off the grill. Thank you Yelpers. My virgin Indian dining experience was truly a good one.
