jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg We have eaten at JOTC many (MANY) times over many years, and it has always been excellent.  Because it is a little bit of a drive for us to get there, we repeatedly try other Indian restaurants around town, but we always come back to JOTC.  Why?  Glad you asked.

As others have noted, the restaurant is a nice place in a good location.  But it is the quality and consistency of the food that brings us back.  The chicken is always tender and not dried out.  The lamb is always meaty, not full of gristle like so many other Indian restaurants.  We love the Chicken Tikka Masala, the Chicken Tikka, the Lamb Saag.  And a cold Taj Mahal really goes well with it all.

As to the service, yes, it is sometimes a little slow.  Nothing is perfect.

But the food is always first rate.   I don't know what these other reviewers expect (free naan??  where do you get that??), but we have eaten in Indian restaurants around the country, and JOTC stacks up against them all.
