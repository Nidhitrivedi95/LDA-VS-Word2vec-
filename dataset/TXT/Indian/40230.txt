pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ A wonderful addition to this fast growing St Henri neighborhood. This is Indian fusion food and not for people expecting the "traditional" menu. They do a wonderful job blending traditional with modern. It's an eclectic menu with freshly prepared food a friendly, chill vibe. 

We went for an early-ish dinner (6PM) so it wasn't too crowded and were able to snag an outdoor table. The mango salad was terrific (but be warned: even though the menu says it comes with tuna, what they don't tell you is that they charge you an extra $6 unless you tell them you don't want it). 

Nice curries, freshly cooked naan, great appetizers too. Definitely worth a stop here. 

Be patient tho -- the food takes awhile (cause it's fresh!). So enjoy a beer or a drink, talk to the people you're with and relax!
