GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA The food is fantastic and reasonably priced. I've been going here when they were in their super small location. My only con is the service. Their water isn't filtered. They don't have enough staff members to handle all their business, both phone orders and dining room. 

If you are going to come, just go in knowing that you will be in for a long wait (1.5 to 2 hours) and relax with whoever you'll be going with. This goes for takeout too, I've seen people wait for awhile for their food.

That said, I highly recommend their hummus appetizer, best hummus I've ever had. I love all their Thali plates. Their masala is so yummy. I've had it with chicken and fish, and I really love it with fish. 

In the end it is worth the wait, but if the service could tighten up it would be such a better atmosphere. Such a shame to sit there listening to new people gripe about the wait and then shut up once it finally comes stuffing their face.

Oh well!
