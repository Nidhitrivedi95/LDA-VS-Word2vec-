YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A I only rarely give Indian restaurants a shot without a word of mouth recommendation from someone because there are just way too many novice owners who don't understand what it takes to be CONSISTENT in providing good quality food. 

Well I took a blind chance on Bindia because it was a cold soggy evening in Toronto and I did feel like walking to my usual places on Younge St and boy did I stroked GOLD!

The owner is a consummate restauranteur, very affable young sikh who makes each guest feel special. The décor, the ambience, the service and above all, the delicious food makes this a must visit restaurants footer me on every trip to YYZ.
