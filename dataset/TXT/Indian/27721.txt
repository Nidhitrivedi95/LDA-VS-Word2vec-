Iqu-RwRA4XfwILKQLKQZew Food is simply awesome here... I come here regularly with my friends and we simply loooove the food. From chaat to biryanis, you couldn't ask for better Indian food. Staff is awesome as well unlike the one's in Chandler location. 

They should improve the seating though... Not many tables inside considering its going to be super hot in summer here!
