jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ Great space and wonderful service. I liked how the three ring binder showed the dishes in more detail. Here are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options to choose from. The desserts looked great too!

The food came out pretty quickly and very warm! But BOY the food is SPICY! I don't think I was prepared to have my nose run the entire time. I ordered the samosas and the chickpea curry combo plate. 

Everything looked and smelled great- I just wish my palette was ready for the spice!

*update- less than one hour later, I'm bloated and my sensitive stomach is not feeling too good
