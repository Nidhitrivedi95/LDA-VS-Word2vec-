J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I would rate this place 3.5 stars.
Pros:
- Location is great
- Butter chicken had only white meat
- Waiters were friendly
- Food was served in less than 10 min.
Cons:
- Butter chicken was very sweet and too spicy for my taste. Our waiter explained that their butter chicken is not spicy so we ordered it mild. When the waiter brought it to the table, he said "not spicy", however, it was. We were later told that the spiciness is masked with sweetness... but some people complain that this dish is too sweet. Oh, well, I actually though that sugar was added but the waitress said that it's pure tomatoes. If so many people complain that it's so sweet, then why do you keep making it sweet? :)
- You have to order rice separate and it's not cheap! Little rice portion that is not enough for the amount of butter chicken sauce cost $3.25 (so I suggest to order naan, as well)
Overall I think that this restaurant is pricy but the food was okay. I would come back to try other dishes. And I wish their BC was not so sweet because it's my fav dish on the planet, but I won't order it here again.
