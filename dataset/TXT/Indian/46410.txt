SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A The food was OK, but not worth how expensive it was(went there for dinner).  I tried asking the waiter what the popular menu items were, but he wasn't very helpful.  It's the sort of place where you have to research the menu items beforehand if you want a more pleasant experience.

The atmosphere for dinner is very qiet and romantic, the dine in itself looks quite nice.  I wouldn't recommend going for dinner, it's much better to go for lunch, cheaper too.
