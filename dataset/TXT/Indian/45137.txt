S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Delicious, I had the paneer tiki marsala. Ambiance was very quiet, at the end of my meal,had the whole place to myself. 
I tried to call in a to go order, but I could not get through the phone line. When I got there I decided to stay as it was so chill. 
Food was great, stuck to a classic. It was a little more citrus flavor than I am used to, but it was good. 
Price is a bit higher for dinner than expected. All items sold separate. So one order with tip was over $20, but that will feed me 3 times...
