0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Best Hakka restaurant in mississauga! Their chilli chicken is to die for, spicy and not overly breaded as some other Hakka restaurants in town. My other fav item on the menu is their heavenly Chicken pakoras..On top of their delicious food, Service is amazing, the owner is always there and is super nice!
