YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw Delicious! My husband, who is not food-adventurous, loved his dinner as did I. The app platter was wonderful even the fairly hot peppers. He had butter chicken and loved it. We got an order of okra which was delicious and the waiter suggested getting lamb with methi sauce.....yum! The wait staff was very helpful, very personable and made great suggestions.  Will definitely be back!  By the way, my husband has said "great choice" three times while I have been writing this!
