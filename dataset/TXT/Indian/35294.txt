Some examples: the bhaji were powdery and fried beyond recognition, the naan were flavorless and hard, come to think of it the bhindi (okra) dish and the other curries our group ordered were also flavorless.  The only thing that was passable was the dosa, though the sambar served with it was definitely sub par.  Save yourself the trip and just get some frozen items from Fresh & Easy.
