-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw Believe it. This is great grub! 

The Two and a Half Beef Patties has the most wonderfully wicked sauce. It's flavorful and just at that point where you teeter back and forth between  "too hot to eat a lot" and "just can't stop eating it".

The Rajah Masala definitely fits in the "I want something different" category. 

Simply a wonderful addition to the neighborhood with expanding cuisine options!
