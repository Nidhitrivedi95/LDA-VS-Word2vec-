UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ First and last impression... I called to place an order and was told there's a $5 delivery charge. When I stated that I thought they had no delivery charge, the individual on the other side stammered " It's a busy weekend for us" and a discussion began in the background between him and another individual. I simply asked for my order to be canceled and hung up. They tried to call back but I chose to decline their call.... Thanks but no thanks.
