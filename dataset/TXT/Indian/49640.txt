tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This place is so DELICIOUS! There is an all you can eat buffet which is cheap and so good! EVERYTHING that I tried was so delicious!! There is a vegetarian, non-vegetarian, and salad and dessert area. The tikka masala had just the right amount of spiciness and the sauce was so savory and went perfect with the garlic naan bread. The vegetarian "purees" were so delectable! I loved all of them! I also loved that the restaurant was decorated appropriately to the origin of the food. To make a long story short, I adored this restaurant and will definitely come back for more!
