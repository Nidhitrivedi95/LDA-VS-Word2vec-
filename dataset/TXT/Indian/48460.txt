tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g My husband and I did some bicycle touring in India for several months. We are not from the area and we're craving some Indian food. Found this place on yelp and it exceeded our expectations! The garlic naan and paratha were awesome and so were our dishes: paneer tikka masala (with gravy) and chicken tikka masala. The couple behind us ordered the paneer tikka dry and that looked great too. We topped it off with a deliciously sweet lassi (the sweetest we've had, coincidentally the tastiest we've had). The service was EXCELLENT and the owner was extremely personable and friendly. Thank you for such a treat!
