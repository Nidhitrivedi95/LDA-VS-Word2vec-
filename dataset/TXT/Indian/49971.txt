u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw If you're in the mood for some Tanzanian Zanzibar food, look no further than Pili Pili. I've never been to a Tanzanian place before, but I was dragged there and was pleasantly surprised.

They have their version of kebobs, which are not of the middle eastern variety, but rather balls of ground beef deep fried served with an Indian style mint chili sauce.  Also on the platter were mogo (cassava fries), veggie samosas (better than the potato variety).  The highlight of the meal were chicken mishkaki made with chunks of breast meat, marinated in a spicy sauce, and grilled with a nice char flavour to liven up the spices.  To wash it down I had a blackcurrant pop which must be a Zanzibar favourite as well.

This place has a solid list of regulars as I saw a family bring in their own plates for a party they were hosting.  It's good to see a place like this supported by the community.
