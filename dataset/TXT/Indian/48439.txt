tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g This was my first time having Indian in Cleveland and it was a pretty decent experience. 

We ordered samosas as an appetizer. They had too much spice for my taste. We both ordered the chicken tikka masala as our entrees. We were able to choose the spice level. My partner didn't like that it had onions and peppers. He ordered a side of naan and it was a generous portion. 

Our beer was served in a frosted mug which is always pretty neat.

The server was very nice and attentive. The manager or owner asked us how our meal was.

I would come again.
