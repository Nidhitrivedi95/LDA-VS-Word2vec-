FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Been to Swagat several times and have always walked out satisfied. #77 (MALAI KOFTA) is amazing. If you're a fan of spice make sure you order your dish VERY SPICY. It still may not be hot enough, so stress the spice. The service has always been attentive and quick as well. I avoid lunch buffets so I don't have anything to offer in that area. Made to order is always the way to go.
