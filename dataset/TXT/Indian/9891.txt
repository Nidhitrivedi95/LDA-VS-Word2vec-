9CGmq4GMEyyPTeNflnW0SQ At first glance, Debu's Biryani House looks like any other Indian lunch buffet at Noon. A sampling of vegetarian and meat dishes, some salads, chutneys and other sauces and a few desserts. But looks can be deceiving. Debu Saha is known for being one of the best Indian chefs in town and the fame is well-deserved. This was, quite simply, some of the best Indian food I've tasted (and that includes a month traveling in India).

A few things raise this lunch buffet far above the pack:

1. The dishes are varied and unique, each with their own flavour - unlike many buffets where the dishes all tend to run together. Everything was fresh and clearly made with heart and soul. Vegetarian dishes in particular shone, especially the unusually good Saag Paneer. Sauces were round and rich, but not heavy; flavours perfectly balanced. Spicing and seasoning were surprisingly good.

2. Everything was homemade. Mango and carrot pickles stunningly delicious, Raita both intense and palate-cleaning (a surprising combination), Samosas complex yet light. Even the Naan bread was unusually good - chewy with a crispy bite on the edges.

3. Service was wonderful. My husband and I came with our bouncy (read: destructive, yet cute) 10-month old, who seriously enjoyed the tandoori, but made a huge mess. The servers kindly refilled our water often and were warm and welcoming, even with our loud kiddo (yes, we were THOSE people). 

Basically, this is just the ideal Indian buffet experience. If you have tried Debu's food before, you will not be disappointed. If you are a newbie, prepared to be delighted.

Can I go back now?
