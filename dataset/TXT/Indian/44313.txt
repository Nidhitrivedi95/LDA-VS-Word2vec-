rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ Server recommended two starts, two sides, two entrees, and we went with that, unfortunately. Too much food. I get that this is kind of "fusion" here, but it is expensive having to order rice and naan separately. I mean, who eats Indian without rice and naan? The butter chicken and garlic naan are a must order.
