When we got there, the dining room was very bright, so I didn't want to eat inside. We chose to eat on the patio. My boyfriend was getting very hot, so we were going to eat at the bar. Our server asked if we wanted a table and I said no because of the lighting. She offered to turn the lights down and lit the candle on our table. Problem solved! We had a great meal!
