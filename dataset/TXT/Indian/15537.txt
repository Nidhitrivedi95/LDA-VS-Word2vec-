Awesome restaurant bery great authentic indian taste.
Had their fish briani( was spicy) - i loved it. The fish did not have the smelly fishy smell like other briani places I had. Well seasoned.

Took a meat dish masala was super spicy but still great taste prepare ur nose to be running. 
Had their lolipop chicken too- it was that great as lolipop. Was ok to eat but not great.

If you are using gps, it will make u skip the entrance to the restaurant lol. Just slow down to look for the entrance
