xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw The food is good. I always get bean & cheese frybread so I am not hard to impress at all. Therefore, service is everything to me.

I walked in on a Tuesday at 7pm. They were open, but the open sign wasn't lit up, went inside anyways. I walked to the counter to ordered. FOUR different people looked at me, and walked into the back room. Okay..... The lady that would eventually be the one to take our orders, saw us, and then began organizing and restocking. Eventually, she came to "help" us. With no eye contact she took our order. I had she made a 30 second phone call to confirm someone's order and she was very annoyed. She asked if I wanted salsa with my order and I said yes.

The food came out quickly.

When I grabbed my order from a different lady, I asked for some extra salsa. The lady who TOOK my order overheard my request and told me that she already gave me salsa, and I can have 2 more, and THAT'S IT.

Well guess what? You can have one star and THAT'S IT. Worst customer service I have ever experienced.
