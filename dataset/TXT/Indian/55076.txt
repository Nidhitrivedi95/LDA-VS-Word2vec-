Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw Sometimes I just really crave Indian food. Is there anything better than a curry dish? My god. 

Delhi Palace is nothing to look at from the outside, and even inside it was pretty empty. Aside from one Indian family and this incredibly attractive, worldly-looking older man with shoulder length silver hair, I was the only one in there. 

As I waited on my order, everyone was so attentive and nice, but I was too distracted by this rugged stranger. I thought to myself, I should see if he wants to date my mom. Is that weird? 

Oh, excuse me, sir, are you single? Here's a picture of my mom ... hot, right? Maybe next time you eat Indian food you don't have to do it alone? 

Instead, I stared awkwardly and left once my food arrived. Idiot. Although, totally worth it as the food was delicious.

Mr. Ruggedly Hot Older Dude, I was the lone blonde obviously trying not to look, but looking anyway. Do you want to be my new daddy?
