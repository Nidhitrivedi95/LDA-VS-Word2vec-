RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg The lunch buffet is usually great, the food is good, and like another reviewer said, a VAST improvement over the depressing Basmati restaraunt that used to be in the same space.

BUT. Oh my god, the service. We've made a game of how many different servers we'll get coming to take our order, or how often the water glasses get refilled (current record: 19 times in a single dinner). It's almost impossible to relax, eat, and talk with friends when every two minutes someone is reaching across you to take away your silverware, switch out one plate for another one, or top up your almost-full water glass. And when the servers aren't at your table, they just stand in a line at the back of the room, staring at you. It would be funny if it weren't so distracting!
