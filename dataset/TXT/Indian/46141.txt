sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ A small dingy restaurant for food to go. There are 4 tables so most likely there won't be room to eat there. If you do eat there, beware you will smell like food.
I shared a tikka masala chicken roti for 11.95 (med heat).
It was quite spicy and was satisfied with just half of it. I think there was definitely more sauce than veg or meat. Somehow it disappears at a good rate as you eat the roti. 
I also tried the vegetarian samosa for $1.50. The sauce it comes with tastes different compared to other samosa places. The crust was not very crisp and thick. It was warmed up via microwave. Filling included mostly potato and rice. Not as herby as other places.
