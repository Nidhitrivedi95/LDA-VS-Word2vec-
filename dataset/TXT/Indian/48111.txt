TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This is THE Place for authentic North Indian food in the Vegas area. You want to order from the menu for the right spice levels. Very nice wait staff. This restaurant has better tasting Curries than Indian restaurants in LA. Highly recommend paneer tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, dal. Even bhindi masala is fantastic. We were helped by a person called GARY. He is awesome! If he waits on your table you know you are gonna have a good meal :)
