Stumbled onto this place while I was in Vegas for a month. 
Has a great selection of Indian spices, groceries et al. Name it and I think they have it.
Was very very impressed with their well maintained space and selection.

The cafe:
Aaah... don't you miss the parathas. Great aloo and gobi parathas. I am a fan.
The lady behind the counter here, very warm and welcoming, very reminiscent of grandma..will tell you all that's laid out is home-made and lovingly made.
It sure does taste good. 
Don't forget to wrap up a selection of sweets. The kala jamun is yummmm! 
The pickles are great too.

Don't let the unassuming outer appearance fool you. It is a great place to stumble upon.
