9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w Amazing customer service. Best I've ever received from an Indian restaurant! The staff are attentive and cheerful! 

Ordered butter chicken, chicken tikka (dry) and fish tikka (dry). Each dish comes with naan or rice and an additional salad for the tikka so a good bang for your buck. 

Everything tastes fresh and the chicken is super tender and juicy. I thought the butter chicken was in a small bowl and wouldn't be enough but it is so creamy and therefore filling (they put a good amount of chicken so it fills you up) 

Bombay Bhel will be a family staple!
