J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I came here based on the reviews on Yelp. I order the dinner vegetable combination plate and my brother had the dinner meat combination plate. Both were delicious and the service as very good. The place is a bit small and it's definitely busy, as other patrons were asked to upstairs for food service when the downstairs filled up.  I thought the naan was good, but a little bland.  Otherwise, it was a great meal.
