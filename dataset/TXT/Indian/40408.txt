PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA Another day and yet another review by me of another Indian restaurant in the Cleveland area... hmmm seems like I see a trend in my eating choices...  : )
We have not tried the buffet yet, but have been there for dinner several times.  The food is very good but it took a bit of convincing for the server lady to believe that we wanted American Hot spice.  Finally she agreed and we loved it.  
The service is a bit off.  Not much personality.  Also the restaurant seems pretty empty most times, which is a shame because the food is really good.
