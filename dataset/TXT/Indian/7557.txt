5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ Who can resist an Indian meal for only $4.99? Certainly not me, which is why I had to check it out for myself.

I made a rookie move by attempting to call in my lunch order.  This place does not accept phone orders for the lunch special because it is already prepared. You just walk in, pick your rice, meat and you're done.  The only thing that takes a few minutes is their naan, but it's worth the wait.

Their chicken curry looked more like a soup, so I ordered the butter chicken. It was on the watery side, but still edible. 

Do not compare them to Gandhi, India Palace or Mt. Everest -- you are only paying $4.99 and you get what you pay for.
