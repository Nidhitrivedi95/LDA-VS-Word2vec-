RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA I love this place.  Pittsburgh is not exactly the mecca of ethnic eating so the fact that there is not only an Indian restaurant but a very good Indian restaurant near me is fantastic.  As good or better and more consistent than Indian restaurants on Devon in Chicago.  Good variety, good flavor, good portions, nice owner(I have never asked, but I assumed she is the owner). Only complaint is that naan needs to be a little more consistent.
