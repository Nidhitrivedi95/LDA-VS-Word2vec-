CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ When this place opened it was just awesome, their biryani used to be out of the world. Having said that it is still pretty good. You cannot beat the price, also now with their combo cards you just pay 5 dollars. My only issue with this place is, it takes forever in the line. It is mostly the crowd who takes too long to decide what they want and they are too polite to rush them off.
