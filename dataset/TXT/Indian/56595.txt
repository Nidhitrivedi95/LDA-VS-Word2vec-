XYnhQq6aUSVcYXymsfngcA It was my first time having Bhurma chicken and that was pretty good, and so was the rice. I am the biggest fan of butter chicken and order it at every Indian restaurant I visit, and I didn't like this one at all. It is very pasty and the sauce is a bit strange to my liking. One note, the spiciness level is very low. Had medium spicy and you could barely tell.
