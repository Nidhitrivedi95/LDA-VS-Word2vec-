gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Cruising in my Lotus Elise rental, I wanted to get some good eats + a nice drive off the Strip. Indian food popped up and I dialed in this place.

The inside was a bit darker/cooler than I thought, with just the buffet lamps giving light besides the natural light. Still pretty nice, the food was great and the waiter/owner(?) was nice. When I asked them about not having rice kheer dessert, they said it rotates with other different items (that day had a mango dessert). Darn. To my surprise, he brings out a complimentary bowl of kheer. Awesome! It is one of my favorite desserts; so simple, yet so good. The naan is nice and fluffy, too.
