After finally getting a table it took more than 15 minutes and the arrival of two other yelpers to get some service. In fact if I remember correctly we had to leave the table to get someone to come over. Once we ordered the pitcher of sangria for the table I supplied my desired food request hoping that one would shortly follow the other to our table. The sangria arrived fruity and delicious if not a little on the less alcoholic side, but my food took another 20 minutes. I will mention that I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich which was good, but can hardly imagine what took so long. The music and seating were eclectic, but i cant really see sitting in that sauna for more than an hour. Happily the bill was on the smaller side, and as a broke student I can fully appreciate a good meal for a good deal. Bottom line, food good, sangria OK, and restaurant ambiance sub par . Try this for an up-from-pub experience.
