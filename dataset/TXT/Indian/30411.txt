K8dYoXbGDWJr_vSlVwDN1A Lived near here for a short while. We got takeout three times. Never ate in.

The dal makhani was great. Liked the fresh ginger added.
Chicken Tikka masala also fairly good.
Naan was fine for takeout  (never as good once it steams itself on the way home)
Rice was....white rice. Not much to expect here. 

This was our favorite place to get Indian takeout in the 'hood. Would definitely order again if nearby.
