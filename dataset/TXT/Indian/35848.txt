Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg Definitely good Indian food. My girlfriend and I were in from out of town (and country for that matter). I brought up the idea of having Indian food for dinner and we happened upon this block. I don't think it was our actual destination but were lured in by the waiter that had assertively come outside to tell us that we'd reached our destination.

We ordered 2 appetizers (veggie samosas & pakoras), 2 entrees (chickpea masala & lamb madras) and even an order of biryani and naan to accompany the meal. We were pleasantly surprised with how absurdly cheap it ended up being. Somewhere in the neighborhood of $30-35 for everything mentioned even after the tax.

The food was very delicious and the service was adequate, though not excessively attentive which was fine.
