ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Awesome place, my wife and i were outside reading the menu trying to decide of it was a good place and a father and son came out and talked us through the menu. Everyone was really friendly.

I had the Gunpowder Dosa and my wife had the Veggie Kofta Curry. We loved both dishes. I was stunned as to how huge the Dosa was but it was terrific.

The only down side was that my wife's dish came out 10 minutes after mine.
