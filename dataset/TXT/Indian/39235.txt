oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw I think this place is pretty terrible (whether it's Greek or Indian food), especially given the prices, but I go back every so often because it's conveniently located.

Upgraded to 4 after two years because my friends and I started going to the bar. Jim is a great bartender, who always hooks me up *and* protects me from chauvinist jerk-offs.
