WCW9a5AfUlyx98Ul-hRMHg We decided to give this Indian take-out place a whirl, as it was just down the street and seemed convenient. Most reviews indicated it was cheap, with good portions. We ordered a few items, and butter chicken was one of them - as this is typically a staple in most Indian restaurants in North America.... and I have to say, I was sadly disappointed. The sauce actually tasted like watered-down Campbell's tomato soup. Seriously.
The pricing was certainly cheap, I'll admit that.... but the quality of the food left much to be desired.
