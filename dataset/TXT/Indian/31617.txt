KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ - Last resort if you want a hole in the wall Indian spot at 3a.m
- Order only items that are prepared fresh (naan, paratha etc.)
- Friendly staff, service is quick. The only positive about the place unfortunately.
- A lot of variety yet almost all items taste similar
- Microwaved food is usually terrible
- Pricey considering the quality. Around $12-$18 per person.
