jCWRMS6XIux7FiPasSoz6Q City Spice is my favourite Indian restaurant in Chester and is situated on City road what between the train station and the city centre.
Even thou in my opinion this is the best Indian I still do my rounds and eat at many of the other Indian restaurants in Chester.
The restaurant is quite small but has an upstairs what they use as either an overflow or for parties.
The outstanding points of City Spice to me are;
1. The friendliness and efficiency of the staff
2. The genuine aim for your satisfaction from the staff regarding your meal and experience.
3. The cleanliness.
I personally enjoy a staff curry and with given notice they always oblige. This is the same with any request for something that is not on the menu as the staff just seems to bend over backwards in their aim to please.
