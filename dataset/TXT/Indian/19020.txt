F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Very nice and clean interior and friendly service.

But the food could benefit from more "zing"!  Only the shrimp pakora was considered really tasty.

The Yin Yang Chicken fried rice/noodle and Chili paneer passable, but definitely needed more seasoning.  And the crispy beef was TOO crispy to the point you cannot chew the meat...it was drier than jerky.  I've definitely had better crispy beef at other Hakka places.  

For the chili paneer, although we asked for "dry", the paneer pieces were still coated with gravy.  I can only imagine that if we asked for the paneer with gravy, it would be like soup! Additionally, the pieces of paneer were tiny.  

There are so many choices of hakka now in Mississauga (and GTA) that I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here.  (And I DO go out of my way for hakka!)
