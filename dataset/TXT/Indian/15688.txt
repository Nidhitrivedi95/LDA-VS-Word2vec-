cVdBHFoDjJZX9JOh-1GWHw Probably one of the best indian restaurants that I've been to I had heard from someone at work that it was a good place to go so I went and the butter chicken was very good and you get a couple of papadum's to start with which are really good also the chicken korma is really good and the samosas the vegetarian ones were really good also a good thing to try there is the Mango Lassi they taste very fresh and the service is very quick.
