gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I ordered dinner because I was craving something exotic and different. I called in and the menu on Yelp really helped me order since I never been here before. This place was recommended by one of my clients that says she always comes here because the food and service is exceptional.
I called-in the order for pick up and a gentleman helped me. I ordered the food items then towards the end I was confused because I wasn't sure how much I should order for 2 people. Then he said, are you ordering for tomorrow lunch as well? I guess I ordered too much. Haha! He said that he recommend removing one entree from the order and that should be more than enough for dinner for 2 people. I appreciated this because it was a lot of food! The gentleman was very professional and nice. 

The food was fantastic! So flavorful, delicious and fresh! The garlic naan was a bit addicting. Chicken tandoori was very satisfying. You cannot go wrong with the food here. If you are into Indian food or you are a first timer, you need to come here and try! I cannot wait to come here with a group of friends.

One thing that I think would make this place even better is background soft Indian music to make the experience better. Just my thoughts :)
