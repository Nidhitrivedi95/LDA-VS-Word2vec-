TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA Are you kidding? I waited in line for 45 minutes when they said it was going to be 15! We got in and turns out there were no potatoes. I mean I can't believe their service! Worst part is the management though. This isn't the first time this has happened looking at other reviews. If there was a way this would be getting a 0 star!!!
