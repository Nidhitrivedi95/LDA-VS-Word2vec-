E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw Best Indian food in Champaign ....

From chats to curries, I love it all. My favorites were papdi chat, samosa chat ... but I have tried all appetizers. Chicken saag is just out of world, I love the creamy texture, freshness it has, I have had it in many places, but this place does the best. I miss this place truly.
