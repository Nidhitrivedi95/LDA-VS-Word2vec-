PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Daawat is a small hole in the wall kind of casual Indian Restaurant. This is a no frills take out restaurant that also offers a small modest dining room for dining in. You order at the counter and all the food they serve will be in styrofoam ware. They serve Traditional North Moghali, South Hyderabadi and Indo-Chinese Style Foods. 

We started with the Cut Mirch. They were tasty garbanzo bean battered hot pepper fritters. They served them with cooling tamarind and cilantro mint dipping sauces. They are tasty but are not for the faint of heart as they are fiery hot and pack a lot of heat.

We shared the House Specialty...The Chicken Dum Biryani and the Chicken Vindaloo.

The Chicken Dum Biryani was extremely fragrant and very floral....it possibly contained rosewater. I enjoyed all the exotic flavors and found it to be the most refreshing Biryani I ever tasted....but I didn't enjoy the dark meat chicken in it because it was over cooked and very dry.  I do warn you to be careful with this dish because it contained pieces of inedible cinnamon bark and whole cardamon pods.

The Chicken Vindaloo contained MOIST Flavorful Fresh Chicken......This dish was tasty but lack heat of any sort. I don't know but believe they accidentally prepared Chicken Masala.

Daawat Indian Cuisine offers different Indian Foods that you don't come across all the time.

Portions are very large and Prices are Low.
