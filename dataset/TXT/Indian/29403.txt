JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Do not let the vegetarian throw you off. A lot of Indian cuisine is vegetarian. I have taken a few meat eaters with me to this restaurant and they loved it, and a couple of them had had Indian food before and hated it. I've since taken them back to this restaurant. It's authentic and delicious! I would recommend this restaurant to anybody!
