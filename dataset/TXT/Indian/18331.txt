EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg I'm not sure if my 3 stars is fair or not because we don't have much experience with Indian food, so I don't have many other places to compare this to. It was just an okay experience. I ordered the chicken seekh kabob dinner plate and the Mister ordered the beef seekh kabob plate. Both were made pretty much the same way and looked like crumbly meat sausages - I guess that's what they're supposed to look like? The beef seekh was good, but the chicken was kind of dry. The rice was flavorful and very loose, not stuck together like some other places. The salad had zero flavoring because there was no dressing, so I ate the cucumbers, but that was it. Stuffing the chicken seekh and rice in the naan bread and adding some of the green sauce made it taste much better, but spicier. I only finished most of one kabob, the second I took with us to go. The Mister also ordered hummus. Is Indian hummus that much different than Mediterranean hummus? The Mister usually LOVES hummus, but this one was very watery, almost like a thin sauce rather than a dip. He left the majority of it on the table, which is unheard of for him! Overall, glad we tried it, but don't think we'll be returning. It's unfortunate that we didn't like the food much because the staff was very friendly and inviting. Really liked them!
