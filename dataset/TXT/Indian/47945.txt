TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I love Indian food, but my husband had never had it. We chose India Palace because they had a Groupon. This place was awesome. We loved every bite. 

The appetizer combo was a great place to start. Lots of things to try and wonderful flavor. My husband had the Dal soup and it was great. He then ordered the Tandoori mixed grill which was equally delicious. 

I had garlic Nan bread which was to die for with my Chicken Tikka Marsala. Amazing!  I'm kind of a spice wimp, but it was the perfect amount of flavor. Make sure to order the rice with it. YUM!

We ate there for dinner, and the owner helped wait on us. Very friendly and helpful and he told us they have a daily lunch buffet from 11am to 3pm for 11.95. 

Overall, we enjoyed everything about India Palace.
