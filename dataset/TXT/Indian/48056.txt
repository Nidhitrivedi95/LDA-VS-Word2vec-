TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We came on a Friday night and ordered 
1. Vegetable samosa appetizer $4.50
2. Tandoori Chicken dinner $25.95
for $5 (Used the $15 groupon to get $30 credit, came out to $.49)

- Seated right away. Fancy restaurant. Dim-lighting. Wine style cup glasses. 
- Edwin was a friendly server! He seemed to appreciate that we came in to eat Indian food and made sure that our drinks were refilled and the food made to our liking
- They didn't have the lamb samosa tonight, which we were a bit disappointed so we ended up with the vegetable. Comes with 2. Cooked fresh and crispy. 
- You are given complimentary flat bread and 3 types of sauces, mild, med, hot. Flat bread tasted a bit burnt, but crispy. 
- Garlic naan was fluffy 
- chicken soup was watery but spicy. 
- Mango dessert was good. Tasted like Filipino fruit salad. 
- Fried vegetables were a bit smushy.
- Tandoori chicken was a slighly dry and the onoins were grilled inconsistently, undercooked or overcooked.  
- India Masala and Mint Bistro packs more flavor for my liking than India Palace, but nonetheless, still a good eat especially with the Groupon!
