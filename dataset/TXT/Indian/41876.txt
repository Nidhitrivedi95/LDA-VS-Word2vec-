QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg I have a friend who is all about Indian food and she wanted to come check this place out so of course I was game. There were three of us and when we got there around 6pm-ish there was one other couple dining. We were promptly greeted, seated, and watered. I looked over the menu and asked my friend for recommendations. She told me to pick a meat first so I went for chicken. I got chicken kurma and chickened out on the spiciness with a 1. Whomp whomp. My friend went for an 8 out of 10 while the other went for a 4ish for level of spiciness.

All three of us ordered samosa individually and the funny part was one of the gentlemen working there came up to us and wanted to make sure we knew each order came with two big ones filled with potato. We laughed and confirmed we wanted individual orders so we could take some to go. He was right. We got the samosa and there were two big ones wrapped up with a side of chickpeas and something else mixed in. The best way for me to describe the samosa in dumbed down terms is potatoes wrapped up in a fried tortilla-looking pastry. It was perfectly spicy - not too much and not too little. All three of us also ordered mango lassi, which is a mango flavored yogurt drink. It was room temperature and I wasn't expecting that (never had it before). The flavor was smooth.

My friend said her 8 out of 10 spicy level was weak for her dish, but then again, she's like master of spicy. I really loved my dish with yellow kind of curry and varies different flavors. My chicken was great. We got a bowl of rice to share and an order of garlic naan, which I loved. Each one of us had leftovers. The food was really satisfying and tasty. More people ended up filing in before we left so that was a good sign. The service was fantastic - attentive and kind. I would definitely come back!
