xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw This is a unique, must-visit spot. The fry bread is good but the real magic is what accompanies the fry bread. The $7.49 special of a 12-ounce stew plus fry bread might be lunch for a normal person, but since I'm an out-of-towner I added another 12-ounce stew.

The green chile stew and the posole were both spectacular, and spicy in different ways. If you have to pick just one go with the green chile.

I also want to add that the service was friendly and fast.
