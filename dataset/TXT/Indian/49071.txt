TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Stepped into this place for a pre-show dinner because there was a wait at Lotus of Siam next door and will definitely be going back for more!

For 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 premium beers and a dessert our bill was $51.

We had the Vegetable Pakora, Onion Bahji & Paneer Naan to start things off. While we waited the waiter brought out some popadoms on the house with a sweet sauce and spicy sauce. Nice. 

For our main courses we had the Chicken Vindaloo (chicken & potatoes stewed with curry over rice) & Chicken Biriani
(Chicken, cashew nuts, vegetables, basmati rice). 

I enjoyed everything we had, and though it was probably a mistake to get 2 fried appetizers the pakora & bhaji were great & the Naan bread was soft and tasty.

The Vindaloo, for me, was perfect. It was spicy but not overpowering, and the flavors really came through in the sauce along with the tender and juicy chicken. It may not be as spicy as some Lotus regulars are used to but I thought it was spot on.

The only complaint my gf had about her dish was that it could have used more cashews. I was skeptical when she ordered the carrot based dessert, but was surprised at how good it was..probably the healthiest dessert you will ever eat.

The service was quick and friendly, and I hope this place sticks around, it didn't seem that busy at 8ish on a Tuesday...though we were surprised to see the Mayor and his wife walk through the door and sit at the adjacent booth midway through our meal!
