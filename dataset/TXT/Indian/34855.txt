Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I just accidentally discovered this place and had the best and most reasonably priced meal of our trip.  It was perfectly spiced, with the heat not overwhelming the flavor of the food.  The service was warm and welcoming.  I never write reviews unless I am really impressed, and we were definitely impressed.
