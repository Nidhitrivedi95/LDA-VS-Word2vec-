xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg This place is 5 star for the price and quality of food combo.  The food is really good, and the lunch buffet price is great.  There are lots of really good veggie options, the staff is friendly and attentive.  The naan is only OK, but this is still a solid choice for Indian food around here.
