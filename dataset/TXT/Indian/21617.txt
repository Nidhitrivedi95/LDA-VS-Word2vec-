GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g My first impression....wasn't too good as it looked not so good...they really should fix up the place.
The food on the other hand...great vegetarian menu....dosa was tasty. Had also dahl with rice...very good. They even have choices of chutney. I do recommend to anyone....even meat eaters.
