RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg A great experience! I had wonderful service that was only matched by exquisite cuisine! I ordered the non-vegetarian thali at my servers recommendation, and I am so happy I did! The tandoori chicken, saag paneer, yellow daal, butter chicken, etc. (I know I have some mis-spellings here) were great. You are started off with a tasty Paddum and two chutneys and finished with a satisfying and attentive experience. I eat a lot of Northern and Indian food in my hometown - Houston - and this certainly compares.
