epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg Staff super friendly and helpful with dish choice, especially accommodating kids. Portions perfectly generous. Chicken Biryani hot is divine. Set the new bar. Wife and kids enjoyed lamb jalfrezi on rice. They'll do any roti dish on rice. Except Vindaloo, all dishes mild by default and can specify medium or hot. Spice addition is done just right. Mango lassi is from powder like many places nowadays. Still a treat. Will go out of my way to get back here. Very short walk from Dupont subway station makes that easy though.
