vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Very authentic Indian place. I would say it's the best Indian food I had for this price, maybe even for any price. The owner welcome us with her Indian accent English and served us very good food. We wanted to try some of their sweets after we finished dinner, she even gave some to us for free. Very worth going for!
