KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw We ordered the Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken Mac & Cheese, and two Butter Chicken samosas for a lunch takeout. Cost us about $27 to upgrade both entrees to a meal which means you get a samosa and a pop. 

The best thing out of our entire meal were definitely the samosas. The pastry in the samosas was crunchy, not too bread-y, and delicious. I've never had samosas like those before! Definitely glad we ordered them. The Mac & Cheese was okay... everyone in the reviews seem to really like it but maybe it's better as a side dish instead of a main entree. It didn't seem particularly flavourful nor was it that cheesy. Maybe it would have been better if we ate it right away, who knows. The biryani was pretty standard. We liked the casual atmosphere and the fusion aspect of their dishes but weren't blown away... well, the samosas are enough on their own to merit four stars. Oh man, those were good. So on the samosas alone, I'm sure we'll be back the next time we're in the area.
