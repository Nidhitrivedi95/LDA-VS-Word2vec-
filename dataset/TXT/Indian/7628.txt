5z0qD9Qftputpv37VjFJPQ I'd rank this place in the middle among Cleveland area Indian restaurants. The food was fine but not stellar. Service was friendly and accommodating. The decor could definitely use revitalization. With places like Cafe Tandoor and Saffron Patch offering better experiences, I don't plan to return to Pari anytime soon.
