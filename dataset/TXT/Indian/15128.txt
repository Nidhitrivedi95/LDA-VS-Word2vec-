CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I Went for a office lunch buffet. Nice ambience and good food. Many choices , some great options on fish dishes. Goat curry was nice. The chicken was hard though. Naan and chicken tikka was personally most preferred. Also ordered mango lassi which was nice. The dessert selection was not great though. All in all they could do better.
