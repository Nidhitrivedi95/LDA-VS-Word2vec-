Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ A great find. Their lunch special is ridiculously good for the price. 3 Veggie thali for 6.49? Very hearty and deliciously spiced, and very good nan included. I also ordered the veggie pakoras that were crisp on the outside, fluffy goodness on the inside, served with three sauces. What a gem of a place. I had the butter chicken lunch 2 days ago, which was served with a juicy and crisp tandori chicken AS WELL, AND a veg dish, salad, rice, nan .... for $8.99. So yes, I went back today. And I'm so happy after the veggie meal I took a delivery menu home. The "non-lunch special" dishes are not expensive either. Maybe this weekend!
