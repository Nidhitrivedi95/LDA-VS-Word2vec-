Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg The methi chicken is delicious and so is the apricot naan bread.  They have 3 dipping sauces for the naan.  I prefer the white one.  We're so glad to have found Tamarind on Yelp because we really love it.  
The only reason I can't give 5 stars is due to their seating.  I regularly fly in small aircraft seats and even I find their small metal chairs to be rather uncomfortable.  I would not recommend this restaurant to a very large or feeble customer.
