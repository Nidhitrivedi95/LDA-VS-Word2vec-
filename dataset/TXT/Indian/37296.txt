O6RnkQnuVyRTXk4e_tADPw My flatmates and I was first made aware of The Curry Leaf when they posted a flyer with their menu under the door of our flat.  It literally sat there on the doormat for about two months until one night in December, whilst in the throes of exams, we decided to order a curry.  
Their menu is extensive, offering chicken, beef or lamb in a wide variety of sauces and all for more or less the same price.  Further, they serve vegetable curries for only about £4.50.  I ordered the lamb balti with plain rice and a shawermah naan.  In total, and including delivery, it came to £40 between four of us which seemed like a lot but it was delicious and we were absolutely stuffed by the end of it.  We even had left overs to put in the fridge for lunch the next day! My only criticism is that the shawermah naans turned out to be just plain despite us paying extra for them.
Regardless, however, The Curry Leaf serves excellent food at reasonable prices and is definitely worth a visit for a late night Indian feast.
