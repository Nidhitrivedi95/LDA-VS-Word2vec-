h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA Our first venture into Indian cuisine in the valley was mostly a success. Royal Taj appears to be an authentic Indian restaurant, which is exactly what we were looking for. They also serve alcohol (almost always a plus), and interestingly, they serve meat too (which is a first at an Indian restaurant for us). Here is what we ordered, impressions, and the like. 

Vegetable Samosa (2) served with tamarind dipping sauce: very tasty with nice filling and pastry-like shell.

Tandoori Chicken (whole) served sizzling with vegetables on top: the chicken was drenched in oil, which unfortunately took away from the flavor and added on to the heart burn. The hostess recommended the chicken tikki masala, and perhaps we should have listened to her.

Aloo Matter (potatoes cooked with green peas and spice): this was also served in a very creamy yellow sauce (almost like a rich corn chowder). The vegetables were good, although the sauce was a bit heavy for our taste. 

Rice: I have no idea why, but I really digged the rice. It was moist without being buttery. 

Naan (plain): plain good, and it also helped balance the very saucy main dishes

Chicken vindaloo: ordered but not served. The waitress takes orders by memory, and I think this one slipped her mind. No matter, we ordered too much food anyway!

Service & ambiance: nice size restaurant, pleasant atmosphere with the Indian music in the background. It was a slow Saturday night (at least when we were there), which made for a very homey experience. The owners are in no hurry to kick you out, so you can eat, drink, and be merry at your own pace. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Next time, I hope they bring the Vindaloo and forget the Tandoori.
