t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Food used to be good, but it's gone down-hill over the last 2yrs. No wonder they have to use Groupons to get customers.
Service has been decent consistently, but the food has been erratic since Fall 2015. The waitress suggested that their chef quit, so they brought in a new chef.

We've had their lunch specials and dinner menus, and the food's quality has been on a constant slide downhill.

Not only are their no longer as spicy as they used to be, they're bland (un-salted) too. That along with excessive amounts of MSG is killing it!!
