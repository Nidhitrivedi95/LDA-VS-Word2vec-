The all you can eat menu (I love that everything is made fresh for AYCE here) is a little small but that's a good thing since it includes everyone's favorites. A lot of parking space available outside and easy to find even though they're sign outside could be bigger or lit at night. The food was delicious. The recipes are within family and handed down from generations. Definitely coming back here. The price was also amazing for the quality of the food along with the service. Our drinks never fell below half way even when the restaurant got a little busier throughout the night.
