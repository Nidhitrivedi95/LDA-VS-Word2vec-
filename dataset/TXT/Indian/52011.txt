UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We didn't have a good experience here. We had made a reservation for 10 people, a dinner to celebrate a big milestone for one of our family member.

This place let us down tremendously. We turned up and they realized they had forgotten about the reservation. Made poor attempts to rectify it. And all along as we waited no apologies given. Manager didn't bother checking up on us and we saw him idly sitting in the corner.

Food was okay. Nothing to rave about.

Customer service total let down.

I had come here reading the positive reviews but what can I say, I left utterly disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this place. There are better Indian joints in the vicinity.
