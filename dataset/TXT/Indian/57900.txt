yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Just came back from this restaurant. We ordered chicken korma and Rogan josh. The meat on the korma was not done and it did not taste like chicken. I have a stomach upset within half hour of eating there. I could barely drive home with the stomach ache. I dont think we are going back there ever. By the way we are from the Indian subcontinent so we are well-accustomed with Indian cuisine. Horrible experience!
