So many dishes are amazing but the standout dishes for me are the tandoori chicken (best anywhere), the fluffy naan, the great eggplant, and the tikka multani.  You really can't go wrong with any dish here.  The $9.99 lunch buffet is an amazing deal!  The decor is a little dated, but the staff is friendly and the food quality can't be beat!
