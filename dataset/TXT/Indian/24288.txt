For its price, the chicken biryani is definitely a steal. The biryani is not too spicy, but at the same time, has that wonderful taste that any good biryani should have. They also have lamb biryani on weekends, but they always run out of it by the time I get there.
Ghareeb Nawaz is not somewhere you take your girlfriend to, but it is quite perfect for those lazy evenings when you crave for some decent biryani.
