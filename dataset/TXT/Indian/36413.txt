NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Great place. Really good, solid Indian food. Think Indian Chipotle: Prices are very similar with the quality just as good if not better. Chicken Tikka Masala and Chai are a go to, it's real Chai and doesn't taste like it's from a tea bag. Tikka Masala is very well executed on flavor. I highly recommend this place to anyone, especially if you haven't been a fan of Indian food in the past, you'll probably change your mind.
