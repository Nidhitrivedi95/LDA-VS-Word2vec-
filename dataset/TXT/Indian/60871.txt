ZXMlmZgdzhEYWQgJKduSGA This restaurant satisfies two of my addictions: spice and spicy.
I have ordered take-out from DK 4 or 5 times and every time I am impressed by the price and the flavours.

My go to is their beef vinaloo. It is not for the faint of heart or tongue. Do not order it if you do not REALLY TRULY DEEPLY love spicy food. It is incredible. With chunks of tender beef, rich sauce and a fair amount of veggies, when I crave it no other beef vindaloo will do.

Their samosas are also delicious. I would recommend the meat vs the veggie samosas only because I find the meat have a very unique taste vs other samosas I have had. The meat is ground and spiced so well that it's hard to eat just one order (2 pieces) they come with a nice simple salad too which is a bonus.

I have also had their saag dishes, although I find them to be salty if you eat them with some of the other dishes they are very delicious. 

The other item that I find unique about DK is their butter chicken which is actually too mild for my tastes, but my bf loves it and it is extremely creamy!

Overall I always recommend this restaurant and it is definitely worth making the trip over the bridge is you live on the island. I'm a big value for money person and DK satisfies everything I want every time! Love them!
