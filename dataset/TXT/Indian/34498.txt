It had all the street treats I grew up with a child, along with plenty of Greek delicacies. It's run by a passionate Greek lady who spent time with Parsi friends in Bombay, and who clearly picked up a flair for delivering on the mumbai street culinary experience. 

The bhel puri and dosa were tasty, and just crisp enough, and had all the elements to bring me back to my childhood.
