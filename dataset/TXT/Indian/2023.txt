_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg What a great deal on great food. Of course, this 5 star rating is for a $7.99 buffet; I'm sure fancier restaurants would have better food. But the value is excellent and the staff are courteous and solicitous. I especially liked the tiki Marsala, yum yum. We are definitely adding this restaurant to our rotation!
