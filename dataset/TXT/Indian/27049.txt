iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Read good reviews so went to order a takeout. Ordered their most expensive lamb sheekh.The seekh got burnt in the oven, over burnt. But that didn't stop them from packing it knowing it was a takeout. Highly unprofessional and cheap mentality. Will never go back.

Update - The manager contacted me after my review and issued a refund. So they get some brownie points for customer service. I will still be careful IF(that's a big if) I go there again and order a takeout. I would check the food before I leave.
