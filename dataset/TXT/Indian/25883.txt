i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ This place is a little gem when it comes to dosas. Their parking is impossible to find so be prepared to circle around a couple of times. I find the quality of the food is pretty consistent. The servers themselves are a different story. It's a hit and miss with getting their attention. I have noticed that when I order the vegetable dosa that it sometimes comes stone cold. The staff has to be reminded to bring it hot. All in all it's good food. Their chutneys are very good (peanut, ginger, tomato, coconut) but the amount they give you with the dosa varies on each visit. I have visited this place numerous times and haven't been disappointed yet.
