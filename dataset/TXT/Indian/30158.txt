JziBbXfW_SRE8hAV9vzq8A Interesting and varied menu. Unique taste. Fresh made food, with good portions.

This new restaurant is setup where Indian Kitchen used to be, and they did a great job updating the space. Very clean and modern. The only thing missing are blinds to block the sun. Half the tables at sundown can be quite blinding right now.

The menu is definitely a smorgasbord of Mediterranean and Indian flavours that marry well. I split a mung bean salad,  courgette fritters, and a chicken shwarma board. I hadn't had mung beans before but they had a great texture. A mix between a lentil and a grain. The courgette fritters were fresh. Soft on the inside, crunchy on the exterior. The chicken shwarma board came with a variety of delicious sauces and toppings which made it a delicious mess to eat. It was definitely an elevated chicken shwarma compared to your regular shwarma place. Their pita bread is good and is more of a mix of naan and pita.

I tried some of someone's short rib and it was cooked well. Definitely had a melt in your mouth feel that you want. Though might have had too much big fatty pieces on it. The cauliflower dish with the puree was delicious. Though the eggplant might have been missing something and was more just a spicy eggplant dish...  Overall the portions were good and reflected the price.

Definitely would go back. Everyone who I ate with said the same thing. Just remember that the food comes as it is prepared. Not all at once.
