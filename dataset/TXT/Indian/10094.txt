9K2FHkajUaTU4P2cfFJmGQ Absolutely loved the food! Ordered Peacock chicken OOA as starter and it was delicious with right amount of spice for an Indian. Main course was chicken dum biriyani and it was tasty too.. N ofcrse mango lassi is always the best drink with Indian food. Overall awesome experience!! Special shout out to Mr.Vamsi, our waiter for today!
