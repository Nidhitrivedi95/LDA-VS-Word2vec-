C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Kalendar is one of those places that's perfect for a little rendezvous.... it's oh so very cozy and inviting. Like most the reviews have already stated their menu has a good selection. 

Summer or winter you need to check this place out.. I suggest if it's a cold winter night (obvi. not the case anymore) this is a good place to go to warm up with an espresso or hot chocolate (so yummy!) In the summer the patio is great and you can watch the passersby. 

Kalendar was recently in the movie 'One Week' with Joshua Jackson so if you're into checking out places where movies have been shot you should check this place out!
