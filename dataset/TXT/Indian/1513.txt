-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Just ordered a chicken manchurian from here. Sorry to say but there was NO FLAVOR what so ever!!! Stir frying Huge chunks of chicken in tomato sauce does not cut it! Not to mention the portion size for the money you charge. I absolutely love food and am more than willing to pay for the food and experience but this kind of food is not appreciable. Extremely disappointed!!
