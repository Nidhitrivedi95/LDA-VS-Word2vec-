xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg We visited Paradise in Sep 2016 and all I can say is if you have real taste for Indian food, this place is no short of heaven..... I couldn't thank the chef RAJ enough for his excellent taste... I am someone who is extremely difficult to please especially when it comes to Indian food. Victoria.... A beautiful young lady helped us with everything we needed and definitely added to the hospitality.... The food items at this place are extremely different from most Indian places... Zucchini... Okra...Chilly chicken... Biriyani.... Yum yum... The list just goes on... This place definitely charmed us and we are definitely coming back.... Keep up the quality Paradise...You guys Rock!
