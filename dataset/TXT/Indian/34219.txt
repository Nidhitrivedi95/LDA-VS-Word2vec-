MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ 3 stars because we ended up leaving and didn't try the food, so I don't want to be rude... 
The sign said closed but they were open, the lady seemed nice.. but odd atmosphere... no music which, when there's only 3 other tables, it can make it kind of awkward... and unfortunately it was only a buffet, no menu?
Won't be back :(
