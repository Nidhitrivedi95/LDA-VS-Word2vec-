WZKGbLstywdLQ9jAR46XDQ We went to have lunch and were disappointed to find the menu did not have any Konkani items. After asking the chef mentioned that they can make it for us. They only had couple of options available. We ended up compromising with sannas, chicken sukka and prawn curry with rice. I was very disappointed.
