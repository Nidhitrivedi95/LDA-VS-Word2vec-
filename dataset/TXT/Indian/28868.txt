jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q This place is awesome for watching planes and relaxing after a long day. Came here tonight with my husband and we had some apps, I orders the chicken korma at a medium heat, there was no spice level to it. My husband had shrimp balti at a level hot... Again not spice what so ever tasted like shrimp in marinara sauce. The lamb naan was spot on! Service was fine, waitress was very sweet. Just wish that everything was a lot spicier.
