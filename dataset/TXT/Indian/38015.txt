ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I don't even know where to start... WE LOVED IT! My husband and I went here on 4/1 with the Groupon that we bought and we were expecting an "ok" experience...boy were we wrong! IT WAS FANTASTIC! Everything from the service, our waiter Amad, the atmosphere, to the FOOD was awesome! We ordered the Lamb Kebab as an appetizer and that was super flavorful and moist. For our entrées we ordered the Hyderabadi Chicken....OMG! SUPER DELICIOUS! The flavors exploded in my mouth. Creamy, just the right amount of spice, and a hint of coconut...PERFECTION! We also ordered Lamb Vindaloo, very spicy and great taste. Make sure you order the Raita with this dish to cool off your palate. :) Naan...oh the naan! Fresh, warm, and super soft! Was perfect! For dessert we ordered the Poached Pear with ice cream...I've never had a poached pear before and man, I've been missing out! It was very good and the ice cream was a nice addition. My husband and I are still ranting and raving about what a great experience we had and what AMAZING food we had! WE CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK!
