2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Hole in the wall place that is just okay. Got the butter chicken roti (approximately $13) and it was decent, but I've had better butter chicken else where. The roti itself was pretty good. 

Place, as the sign in the restaurant describes, is not "fast food". It takes about 20 minutes to get your food, so you should definitely call in first. I had to stand there awkwardly for 20 minutes for my food. I got it to go because I wouldn't want to eat there anyways. Such a sketchy vibe.
