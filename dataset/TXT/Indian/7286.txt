5KsvP10z9InBcI6hhqjjKg Don't bother. Service was slow and indifferent. The food was bland. 
Bland curry, what's that? Not much. 
The food is plentiful, there's variety (at least there's a number of name cards over the items) but then again it's a buffet. It's inexpensive but so what? I've had much better Indian food at a local food court in a shopping mall. 
So - pros: it's cheap and it's a buffet. 
- cons: it's not great. Not even close.
