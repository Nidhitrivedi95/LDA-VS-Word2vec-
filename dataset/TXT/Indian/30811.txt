They've improved their in-person wait staff a lot and that's great. But the staff don't know what the dishes are most of the time and can't answer questions because they don't know what is in them and they've never eaten them. The menu is unreliable and often they will say you can't have something because they don't have it that day or the chef is out. I have *never* been able to order from their south Indian menu. Half the time their phone is off the hook so you can't order takeout and grubhub has had to cancel my order because they don't have what their grubhub menu says they have. 

So, all in all, there are lots of good Indian places in Tempe. Try somewhere else.
