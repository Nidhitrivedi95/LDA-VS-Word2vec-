g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ I love love love this place. Great service and exceptional food. Sometimes I order take out from this place for lunchtime but I prefer to dine in because it feels like I am about to indulge in a different world. One has to walk down a bare white stairway from the street to enter the spacious wood clad restaurant...it really takes you by surprise. 

Split the appetizer platter, butter chicken, malai prawns, and delicious mixed veggies with Indian spices. Naan it up to soak up the sauces and finish your meal with masala chai. 

One star less because the tikki masala I've received for take-out can sometimes be dry.
