gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Truly my favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.  Across the street from the community where I live I am happy to say I'm in this restaurant sometimes three times a week!  The waiters and owners know me and know what I like. They have a great buffet during the weekdays at lunchtime.  The restaurant is always full and sometimes there's a line out the door for the buffet which is always a good sign - their ingredients are fresh and the dishes are thoughtfully prepared.  The naan is home made. 
I take friends from in and out of town as often as I can and everybody always really likes this place. 
They serve Indian beers as well.
