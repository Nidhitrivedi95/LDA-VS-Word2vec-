yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg My new favorite indian buffet. I used to go to Kohinoor Cuisine in Tempe but they closed down permanently recently. The owner of that restaurant told me about this place, he said his brother owns this spot. This buffet is just as good. Saag paneer, naan, ect everything tastes perfect with the right amount of spicyness. I just wish we lived closer cause then we might come here everyday. The buffet ends at 2:30pm and restaurant is closed every monday. This is the best indian restaurant in Arizona.
