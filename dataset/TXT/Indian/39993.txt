pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Love their buffet! All the food is really excellent. Big fan of the naan, spinach, potato, and chickpea dishes. (Yes common ingredients in a variety of dishes, but any combination always tastes really good!) The rice is a delicious compliment to all of the above. Lots of options for vegetarians and meat eaters. If you have a tree-nut allergy I'd probably steer clear as some of the dishes have creamed tree nuts (cashew) in them.
