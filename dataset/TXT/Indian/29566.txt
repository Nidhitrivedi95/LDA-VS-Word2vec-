jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg This food is amazing! We're still talking about it a couple weeks after. 

The atmosphere isn't anything special, "no frills" if you're a glass half-full person, but you're there for the food. We were there on a Tuesday night for dinner. Service was friendly and attentive, had a few different dishes and everyone was satisfied. 

The only negative was they weren't able to split the bill on two different cards. If that's your plan going in, let the waitstaff know before hand and you'll avoid that problem.
