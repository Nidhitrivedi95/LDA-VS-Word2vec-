-z_DR7omzpcR__l7MbDu0A Possibly the best and most authentic hyderabadi dum biryani in all of Cleveland. I have found places like this when I travel, but never in Cleveland. We finally have a great biryani place here! The veg biryani is served with a wedge of lime and raw onion, and the flavors are so so excellent. If you truly love Indian food, this should be your next meal out.
