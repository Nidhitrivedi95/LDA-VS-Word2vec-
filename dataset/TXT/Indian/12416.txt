aXGVV7OiKjajjJWd5gZCIQ You could give this place a pass. Food is really average and service not great either. The place pales in comparison to other great options available in the area.
I had samosa and pakoda for starters, chicken curry and paneer makhni for main course. The naan was great but rest of the food was very average.
