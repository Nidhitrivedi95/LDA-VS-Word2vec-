RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg My husband and I have been looking for top tier Indian in Madison for a long time. We were so happy when we found om! Amazing food we had the somosas, their version of chicken 65, and two curries. All fantastic and left overs for days. Later that week I was surprised to see my credit card had been over charged. I was super nervous because I didn't have my reciept but when we called, the owner was incredibly gracious and helpful and had the issue handled so quickly. We were so happy out amazing experience wasn't sullied by this mistake.
