xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA My uncle told me about this place months ago. I used to go to a shop on dundas and hurontario and that was once or twice a month. I finally tried Leela's. Now i'm there at least once a week! Try the chicken pies as well as the doubles with meat. Inexpensive and better than any tuesday specials out
