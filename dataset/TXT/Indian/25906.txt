They have one daily special, however the owner says if you have a special requests just to give her a 24 hour notice. The naan is okay, but everything else is pretty good. The owners are extremely helpful, polite and courteous. If you want a delicious Indian food meal followed by even tastier dessert, this is a decent place to be at.
