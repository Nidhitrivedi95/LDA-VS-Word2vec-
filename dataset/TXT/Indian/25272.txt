hfHHB1MP-x_iDSN5DcWR2A Not someplace I will visit again, thought I will give this place a chance inspite of the bad reviews. 
Summary of my visit:
Ambience: 0 - no air conditioning. Coupled with the musty carpet odor.
Service: 1 - Owner is also the server. Has no clue about smiling to guests or cust service. The 1 is for the water he finally served after 10 mins. I was the only other table occupied.
Food: 0 - BAD!! Felt bad for the pathetic excuse of an Indian cuisine that was being served here to local Canadians. Completely devoid of any taste.
Am usually not harsh on any place but this place deserves a commendation for the worst Indian food I ever had. Avoid.
