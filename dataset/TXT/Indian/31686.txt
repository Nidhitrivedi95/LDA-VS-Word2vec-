KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Awesome service and awesome food! Nice atmosphere for a small restaurant. Very clean. Fresh cotton table cloths (no paper covering them like many restaurants which kind of defeats the purpose of a table cloth). Try the crispy Bombay chicken. It's sweet and crunchy and probably unhealthy but it will have you coming back!!!
