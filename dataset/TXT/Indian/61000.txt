zzCsh8Rx40ZXcyDrzFnfOQ From the outside this restaurant looks abandoned:  the patio is empty of tables and chairs and weeds are growing knee-high out of the pavement.

The exterior is such a turnoff we decided to just keep walking.  If the management can't take a few minutes to clean up their exterior I hate to think what's going on inside.  What a hole.
