9K2FHkajUaTU4P2cfFJmGQ Been here for a lunch buffet - we tried calling in and reserving a table for a group of 8 but the person on the other end spoke little English and wasn't very responsive. We came to the restaurant anyway and found it to be sparsely occupied.

Walking inside the restaurant looks pretty neat and modern with great looking furniture and wonderful "Indian" paintings on the walls. There is also a bar counter towards the middle of the restaurant with a good selection of wines and beers. 

The buffet had quite an amount of dishes. Just by looking at them we were pretty impressed and started to dig in. Some dishes were really good and some were just hard and cold - totally let downs. They also serve you with hot Indian pan cakes "dosai" along with the buffet. There were about three different desserts - payasam, kesari and custard. Payasam was the best. 

The buffet is enormous with too many dishes and you got be careful not to over eat and get sick! Some dishes were made really well. The cost is extremely minimal for the about of food you have access to! At 13$ per person, I would recommend this lunch buffet restaurant to anyone looking for a good selection of Indian food with great ambience!
