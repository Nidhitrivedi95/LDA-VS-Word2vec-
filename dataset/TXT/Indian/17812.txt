E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw The food is just average Indian food, nothing special. What's terrible about this place is that they use styrofoam plates, cups and bowls and plastic forks and spoons. Even when you eat in. The food isn't cheap enough for that. At their prices they could buy a dishwasher and serve their food on real plates. I love Indian food and work nearby but I'll go somewhere else so long as they serve everything on styrofoam.
