9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A Great lunch specials, so this is a regular stop for me. My personal favourite is the chicken sandwich which is literally a naan bread stuffed with tandoori chicken with all of the fixings. This with a starter salad and a dessert for under 9 $, wow ! 

The quality of the food aside the service runs a little slow sometimes after the food has arrived. We seem to always have to flag the waiter down to get our desserts... but that is okay, I prefer that then some of the other restos in town that are always trying to rush you through your meal to get you out as soon as possible !

Would I go out of my way to go to this resto, not really, I can think of other indian restos I would go to like the Taj downtown or Taj Mahal in Old Montreal; but, if you are in the village area then this is a sure thing. So don't hesitate if you are in the area, GO !
