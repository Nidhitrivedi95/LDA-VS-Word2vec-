C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I keep coming back to Kalendar because I know the food is going to be awesome. I've ordered the salmon entree several times as well as the apple walnut salad. They always taste perfect each time. I think the owner has served us a few times and he is always nice. I have special diet requirements and even though it always feels awkward going to restaurants with those, the servers have always made effort to accommodate them. The decor is beautiful and I take note of it each time. It's super cozy in the winter time and has a great vibe in the summer. The servers do seem pretty busy whenever I'm there, but I am honestly too busy enjoying the atmosphere with my friends and deciding what to eat on their awesome menu to be bothered by it! I will be back :)
