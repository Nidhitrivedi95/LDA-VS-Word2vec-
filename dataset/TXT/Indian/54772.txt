wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw My husband really wanted Indian food since we do not have a place in our town that serves it, so we read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give Taj Mahal a try.  Wow!! This place is amazing!  We were greeted by the owner as we walked in.  He was extremely personable and very welcoming.  We ordered the chicken tikka marsala and garlic naan.  The food was incredibly flavorful with just the right amount of spice.  After the meal, my husband said this was the best meal we have had on vacation, so far. If you like Indian food, I would highly recommend Taj Mahal.
