yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This was another Groupon find of mine, although I had heard about it (in a not so good light) from a friend. However, I do love me some Indian food, so I grabbed my partner and headed over there.

The Groupon was for $40, and at most places, if get get apps, food, dessert and iced tea, we hit that mark. Not here. We each order the fanciest Thali they had (comes with salad, naan, biranyi rice, desser, chai, mini mango lassis, dal and two veggie dishes), but they were only $15 a piece, so we wound up ordering two more starters (the potato pancake Chaat and fried Paneer) in order to hit our price point. And then we took a LOT of food home.

The mango lassis were delicious, as was the salad.  I wasn't such a fan of the chaat - it was a little too spicy and a little too mushy. I loved the fried Paneer, but who doesn't love fried cheese? It was great with the tamarind chutney.

As far as the main meal, I loved everything (though next time, will go with plain basmati rice). I especially enjoyed the paneer tikka masala and the malai kofta, my favorite dish ever. The dal was good -- I've never seen kidney beans in it before, but I liked it. The only thing I didn't absolutely love was the Saag Paneer - the texture was too smooth. However, my partner scarfed it down.

For dessert, I was expecting rice pudding, or the sweet balls. Instead, our awesome server asked if we'd tried carrot fudge. We hadn't, so she brought that out.

I liked it, except for the sultana raisins (I hate raisins). It didn't hit the spot for my partner though, and the chai wasn't as strongly spiced as I like (plus I prefer honey to sugar packets as far as sweetening it).

We'll be back, for sure. I might go with a small thali, but it's a really good deal, and an excellent amount of good food for the value. Glad I found it!
