-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Huge variety of food on the menu, and everything I've tried is really tasty. All vegetarian, which is a pro or con depending on your preference. The quantities are pretty large and low prices, so great value here. The space is clean and comfortable enough, but I don't exactly go there for the ambiance (reminds me of a a causal pizza place inside).
