171c2z28JaSYQtWimiZ62A Warning! Do NOT buy a Groupon for Indian Bread Bar!

Groupon continues to sell vouchers for Indian Bread Bar but they are closed and clearly out of business!!!

I bought a voucher a few months ago and went to Indian Bread Bar to use it 4, yes, FOUR times in the past 2 weeks and every time I got there they were closed, even though the hours on their website and posted on their front door showed they should have been open! 

If you call their number it goes directly to a machine that says the voice mailbox is full.  If you try to reserve through their link to Open Table it always says the restaurant is offline - even during their posted "open hours".

Every time I email Groupon to say I tried to redeem my voucher but the restaurant was closed, they send me a stupid email with the hours posted on the website!!! 

I tell them I can't reach the restaurant by phone and they tell me to email!!??

Of course when I tried to email the restaurant I received no reply - what a surprise, clearly they are out of business!

So either Groupon are idiots or are in on the scam.

I bought the voucher before seeing the reviews here, Amaya Bread Bar was a favourite of mine, if I knew it was no longer owned by Amaya, I never would have bought the voucher.

This experience has convinced me never to use Groupon again.
