pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA Visited for brunch in the weekend. The variety has reduced from what it was before. The taste was not bad but nothing exceptional for South Indian food. The idli, vada, puri, chutney were ok, but pongal, dosa and Chana masala were not up to the mark. The coffee was excellent. I wouldn't visit them soon for brunch, but rather try out something else in Brampton or Mississauga.
