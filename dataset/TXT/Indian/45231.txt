S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA 1st time here - we will be back!! We were pleasantly impressed. Clean and airy, with a welcoming staff - not the typical strip mall eatery.  Sorry no pix - we were hungry and began eating as soon as the food appeared.  On the table we had: chicken tikka masala; chicken tandoori; shrimp korma; garlic naan and rice. Tried the mango and pistachio ice cream.  We're looking forward to trying the lunch buffet soon !  When the check came my husband said "reasonable too". This place gets 5 stars and our best wishes for their continued success!
