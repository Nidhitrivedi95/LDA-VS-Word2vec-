epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg I recently discovered this place while searching for indian food in the area online. I wasn't much of a roti person but I'm converted! :D The portions are generous and simply delicious. You've got to be specific on how spicy you want it though it can get very spicy. The decor may not be great but the food more than makes up for it!
