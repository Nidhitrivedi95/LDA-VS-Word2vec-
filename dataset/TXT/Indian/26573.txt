ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I have been to Copper twice.  The food is excellent.  Sometimes you just want Indian food in a nicer setting - this is the place.  I'm not an Indian food expert, but I love it and am continually disappointed with the availability of it in Charlotte.

However, I am totally unimpressed with the service at Copper.  Both times I've found the service to be extremely slow.  During my recent experience, the server didn't even check back after we got our food.  Normally this wouldn't have bothered me, but I really needed a small spoon for my kid, and eventually tracked down a hostess to get one.  She forgot, and by the time we were able to get our waiter's attention, we were done eating.

I probably will not go back any time soon, as I can't justfy spending that kind of money for service that's lacking.

The fact that this place is slammed even during the week at 6pm despite the poor service just speaks to the dearth of other Indian options in this town.
