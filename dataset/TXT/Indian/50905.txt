UI4lGUcqc4YyzXJ2Uqe6BQ This review is based on 3 things primarily: taste, service, accuracy

Taste was alright. Nothing extravagant really. Being from Chicago, I have come across better.
Service was great. As my wife and I entered, we were greeted very politely. We were there to do a take out.
My wife ordered a paneer manchuran. Obviously a vegetarian dish.
Once we got back to the hotel,  we realized that it was indeed chicken and not paneer. Being an Indian myself, I find it appalling that an Indian owned restaurant would make an error of this nature. 
I called the restaurant right away. The girl I spoke to recognized us right away. She verified with the kitchen and confirmed that what they made was indeed chicken and not paneer. 
She apologized several times and offered to replace it next time we r there.  Of course I told her that is not necessary. 
Do try the place out bit if doing take out, I suggest double checking your order before leaving.
