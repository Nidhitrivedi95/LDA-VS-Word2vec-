AsqrPTR00PSqku_MeqwSlA Absolutely horrible. They charge premium prices for less than average food. Fancy place with low quality food. Got the butterchicken was uncooked and had no flavour. Got the chat papri was drenched in there green spicey sauce and unbalanced with the seasonings. Save yourself the trouble and never come here. Want good upscale indian food go to avani in mississauga, this place is just another crap indian food place. Lived in Brampton for over fifteen years never had such low quality indian food for such a high price. You definitly dont get what you paid for here. Also the person bellow is a lier how I know this is bc we told them everythibg that was wrong with the food and they just laughed about it.
