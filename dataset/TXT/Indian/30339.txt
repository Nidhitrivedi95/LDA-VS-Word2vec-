K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g This place is amazing! It has become my new favorite Indian restaurant and I love the fact that it is vegetarian. Not my favorite palak, but the paneer butter masala (add potatoes) and the gobi manchurian are PHENOMENAL! Just had the gobi manchurian for the first time this evening and I think I'm in love. It is now my favorite dish! The only thing two things I have noticed about this place is that the rice they provide is not very flavorful or fragrant. Very plain. I also have to request for everything to be extra extra spicy because they tend to make dishes far too mild for my taste. Other than that, it is perfect!
