nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ This is a great restaurant located near St. Patrick Subway station. The owners are very friendly and accommodating. I got there about 30 minutes before my friend and they seated me and served me water (my preferred drink) until my friend arrived. Their $15 lunch specials are excellent. The food is fresh, not frozen or prepared a day or so ahead of time. The portions are reasonable and a good value for the money. The service is prompt, polite, and efficient. The menus accurately describe the meals and the servers are ready with explanations concerning the spiciness of the food. The lunch special includes an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Mercifully, the dessert is not heavy or large. For $15, on weekday, in the core, this restaurant is hard to beat. I will definitely be going back again.
