FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw Best Indian food this side of town for sure.  Food is great and the service is very quick and friendly!  The naan fresh out of the oven are scrumptous and all of the standard indian dishes we tried were yummy.    Overally prices are reasonable.  Eating in is better than their take-out, but still worth it!
