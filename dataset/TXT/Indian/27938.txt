IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA First off the name is a little fast foodish, and doesn't suit this place.  The place is very classy, aside from the name again and the small bag of lays chips they brought us. (more humorous than anything)

Otherwise the food was good, a little pricey, but big portions to match.  The Grape leaves were amazing, the meat seasoned and cooked well over that amazing rice.  The gyro, very filling and fresh.  I have grown to appreciate things that tend to not be greasy and leave you feeling great after the meal, and this restaurant definitely will have you leaving feeling great.
