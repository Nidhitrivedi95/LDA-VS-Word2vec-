UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I came here with a large party of around 20 for the lunch buffet and we had to wait a while, which is fine, I understand since they don't take reservations but they were not willing to seat us outside since they lacked the staff to serve us.

I had come with some older members of my family so even though I tried to convince him to let us at least seat them, the host responded rudely with "Let me do my job" 

Later when we were seated, food was alright, about 3 stars and a family member asked for some naan and a waiter responded, "it takes time sir" in a rude tone. Honestly, the naan saved the lunch since it was fresh. 

Would I come back here for the food? Unless I really wanted Indian food, probably not. Service and staff was very bad and food was very mediocre.
