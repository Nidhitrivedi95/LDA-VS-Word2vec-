DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew My wife and I came to try this place out. It use to be a sushi place but they're redecorated and it looks awesome. My wife ordered the malai kofta and I the chicken tikka masala. Her dumplings were pretty big and I ordered mine hot, it was very hot!!! We enjoyed it and will be back because it's in our area :)
