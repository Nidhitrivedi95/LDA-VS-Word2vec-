RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Stumbled upon this place because a friend was staying in the Rio and we needed to find something we could both eat. I'm a vegetarian so Indian food seemed like a good option. The place was rather empty but we took a chance and WOW we are glad we did. I am surprised this place isn't packed every night. I thought the food was amaaaaaazing. The cocktails too. They have a full bar, and the moscow mules we ordered were made to perfection, in the copper mugs and then while ordering the waiter was very helpful answering questions and helped us make our choices. We got two veggie appetizers, Veggie Samosas and Veggie Pakora...both were great but the Veggie Samosas were better than any I've ever had! They were big, you get two in an order and they were excellent. For my main dish, the waiter helped me choose...and I got Navratan Korma, a veggie dish with assorted veggies in a creamy sauce...it was out of this world! We ordered rice and it came with some peas on it and of course the Indian naan bread. All around fantastic dinner and I'll go back for sure.
