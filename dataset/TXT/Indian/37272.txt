O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg I went for the Sunday buffet ($10.95), and, as much as I want to support my Indian brethren in NE Ohio, I was not pleased with the food here.
Pros first: naan is buttered and crispy; they had a goat curry (a pleasant surprise) and a decent baingan bharta; and, best of all, they had a do-it-yourself chaat bar (which is Indian street food). Chaat is not always on the menu of restaurants, but it's the food that my girlfriend and I crave the most. Look up instructions on how to put together a chaat dish, or ask the waiter, before you dig in.

Cons: though they had 2 chicken curries and 1 goat curry, they were all too watery. Meaning that not only did they lack flavor, but they didn't give my crispy naan much to grab on to. In addition, their chicken was dry and tasteless, with the red flavor-color just coating the surface, leaving the inside barren. 
The three vegetable dishes also lacked enough flavor to salvage the experience.
Finally - perhaps worst of all - their gulab jamun was kept on ice :( How hard would it be to keep those little balls warm? Unfortunate. 

So, while the chaat bar is unique, I was not impressed by the buffet. 
(Given that the other reviewers seem to have ordered off the menu, I might have to revise my review once I try something else)
