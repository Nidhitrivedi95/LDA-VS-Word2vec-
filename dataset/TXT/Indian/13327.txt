Caught up with a friend here over a work lunch and couldn't be happier. It's a greasy spoon for a lot of wok and fried Chinese and Hakka dishes but it's delicious. They give you over 20+ lunch special choices each at $6.20 which includes a drink. 

It's a smaller joint but lots of tables and if there isn't parking in the front there is tons in the back. 

I got the Hakka chowmein with beef and shrimp. Friend had chilli chicken. Portions are huge and they bring it to you family style. Both very tasty and ready pretty quickly. Good spot for a working lunch in the area and would definitely come back. 

They don't accept Amex but many places dont so no big deal.
