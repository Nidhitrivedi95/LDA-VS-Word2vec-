Stand in line, point at what you want, move to the front, pay with cash and off you go, don't try to bump ahead, be respectful and get respect in return.

5 Samosa's for a Dollar, now that is a steal, and they taste pretty good. They have various indian sweets and some of them are better than the stuff you can get in India itself. I would highly recommend the White Peda's and the Milk Cakes. 

They also do have a sit in restaurant attached next door, that serves a wide selection of food. There are lots of vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options available.

The server's might not know what gluten free means, so you might have to spell it out for them and they will be willing to tell you the ingredients in the dishes (at the restaurant).

Besides samosa's they have various other things for you. If you aren't familiar with the items get at least one new thing every time, so you can get exposed to all the flavour indian food has to offer, and that way you will know what to order next time.
