Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw This is a little hole in the wall Indian place right behind Club Tattoo on ASU campus (Rural and University). There is a Vietnamese, a Thai, and an Ethiopian restaurant all in the same shopping center so my coworkers were joking it was like the League of Nations. We all went there one day for their lunch buffet and it was pretty tasty. They had a good selection of meat dishes (in addition to vegetarian) so that was a big plus for me. I do wish they would have had some spicy options since everything I ate was pretty mild. But the food did have a good flavor. They also had fresh made chai tea which was nice. And the price was good. I will probably go back again.
