RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg The dinner service was quite good and the staff were polite and friendly. For service I would give 5 stars. The ambience was good, though before remodeling last year, my opinion is that it was better. The food was not what I was hoping for. The samosas lacked flavor and the shell was rather thick for a samosa. The tandoori paratha was very good. The main dish I ordered, malai kofta, was a big disappointment. I did order mild assuming this meant minimal hot chilis not expecting little or no spices in the malai kofta and the sauce as well. The sauce tasted too tomato like. It looked like a mixture of sour cream and canned tomato pieces with some food coloring. The pistachio kulfi was passable. It was too green in color. Because it was served in a martini glass, it was a little hard to cut a piece with a spoon when trying to eat it without tipping over the glass. Overall, the food was below average. The only reason why I might give it another try some day is that the service and ambience made it a good dining experience.
