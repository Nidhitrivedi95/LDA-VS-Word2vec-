LZWXP-D4YPlzsFjVx6b9XA Compared to all the Indian Buffets I have tasted, this one is "As good as it gets!  Lunch is a Buffet and Buffet is usually concept I avoid!  Glad for me I could make this exception!  One of the reasons I avoid buffets is the lack of Quality!  Today this Buffet BEAT (Buffeted) the quality of many Indian Restaurants Dinner Quality!

I tasted almost everything on the Buffet, which was quite a selection and enjoyed everything!  Some of the Dishes I returned for seconds (Chicken Tikka Masala and the Okra Curry)!  The Dal and Naan were good, the Rice was plain!  

CURRY!  This was a Curry Lovers dream come true! The wide variety of Flavors (also rare in Buffets) of Curries was surprising, each had a unique Look and flavor.  The Spice Levels included some Mild, some approaching Medium and a few a little more than medium, though none "Hot" and I have NEVER ordered any dish "Indian Hot", though Jason ordered "Make it so Hot it Hurts" once, at another place, not here!
