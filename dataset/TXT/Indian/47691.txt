TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Best Indian food I have ever had in America.  We ordered the goat & lamb dishes, garlic naan & this phenomenal rice dish. The waiter was very nice & helped us place our order. We wanted to try something new yet more traditional. The setting was quiet & comfortable.  Don't let the neighborhood scare you, this is a must have. This will be a place we will always come back to when we visit Vegas.
