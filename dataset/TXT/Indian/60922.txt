zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA Outstanding food/service/personnel! Great value! Worth the 3.5 hour drive we made to get here. We will be back. Gladly we arrived minutes ahead of the dinner hour and were seated before the place totally filled up with locals who knew well the wonderful delights of this great Indian restaurant.
