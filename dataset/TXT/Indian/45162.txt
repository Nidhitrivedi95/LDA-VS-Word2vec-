S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Decided to give this a try last night and I am very glad I did. Ordered chicken tikka and a lamb korma accompanied by keema naan. Chatted with the two sons while the food was prepared and they are incredibly knowledgable and passionate about what they do. These are all family recipes and the process they use to prepare everything is as caring as it gets. The chicken was perfectly marinaded and cooked - great hint of lemon from the marinating process and the marinade was tasty and not overbearing. The korma was creamy and flavourful and the lamb was as tender as it gets. Keema naan was a great accompaniment. I will definitely be going back and I advise anyone to give this place a try. Great job
