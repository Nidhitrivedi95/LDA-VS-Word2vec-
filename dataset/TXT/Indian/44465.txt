rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg I have been here twice. First time I had mango lassi, dosa, and a curry shared with my friend. Second time I had buttermilk and the lunch only big set of dishes. You won't go wrong if you want to try these. 
The masala tea is kind of like a hong kong milk tea to my Chinese taste but with a hint of spice. The waitress told me that ginger. I think it's a very old ginger which gives you a subtle spicy taste. That's a nice Indian style. I like it. 
I like the spices they use in the dishes. Dosa is so unique and worth trying.
