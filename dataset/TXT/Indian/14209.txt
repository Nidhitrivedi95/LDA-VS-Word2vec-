c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A I have NEVER eaten such terrible Indian/Pakistani food. EVER. My husband and I were so disgusted the last time I ordered from there that we tasted it, ate a few bites and chose too dump it in the trash. The lamb curry was a misery of oil, water and burnt spices. It was acrid. The chapati (home made style roti) was so terrible and had a strange colour. The daal was disgusting--and really, how can you make a daal disgusting. The simplest of spices and it tastes royal. What did they do to it?

Delivery: don't even ask. First time I ordered some kebabs and two hours later I find out their driver delivered it to the wrong address. The next time I ordered (the shitty lamb curry, daal and chapati), they gave me someone else's food (marked with my address--different items). I ran after the driver and he realized the restaurant made a packaging error. How can you do this twice in a row to the same customer?

The only good thing here is their beef tikka and seekh kebab, and for that I gave them the two stars. Really if these weren't so good, they deserve negative stars for the most acrid and foul food and curries on the entire planet.
