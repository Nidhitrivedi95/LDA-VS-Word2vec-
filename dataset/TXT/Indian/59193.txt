yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Just had lunch here this afternoon, and I must say, incredibly disappointed with everything from the service to some of the food. More importantly, one of the members of our party had their wallet stolen out of their bag and when we confronted the restaurant, they went and got the video feed and told us that we should only blame ourselves and did not handle the situation in a mature manner. When the police arrived, the waiter who claimed that he was the owner told them that we were being very aggressive and threatened to beat him up, which we did not do. They were very unwilling to help, and all we asked for is for them to look at the video feed for us.

Also, in terms of food, their appetizers were okay, but their main courses were subpar. The vegetarian items were okay, but their meat items were terrible. I feel robbed that I had to pay for that food. They boast that they have the largest buffet for lunch, and that's true if you include the 8 chutneys and fruits and stuff that don't count as lunch items. Never again. Save your money.
