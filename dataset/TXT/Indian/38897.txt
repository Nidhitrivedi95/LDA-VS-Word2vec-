OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Don't bother !  Our waitress proclaimed the new chef was a problem, and this was confirmed by the poor presentation and quality of our food.  We ordered the Bombay Platter which sounded delicious but amounted to a small platter of over cooked meats on a bed of cheap chopped iceberg lettuce.  We ordered Paneer Tikka Masala but what was served tasted like burnt tofu sitting stop a bed of chopped iceberg lettuce.  No taste whatsoever here so don't waste your money or time.  India Palace remains my favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas.
