Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Hands-down! One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to! The decor is beautiful, which makes it look eclectic, quaint, and warm. My friend and I were on our way to Big Lots and just happened upon Tamarind. When we entered, we were politely greeted and shown to our seats. Our waiter answered all questions we had about the dishes, and was quite knowledgable about all. The food was delicious and the presentation of the food was great! I was so impressed, I told my neighbor about Tamarind and that week she went with her family. She and her family loved it. I will continue to support this restaurant. Also, on every visit, the chef/owner came out to greet us and to make sure we were happy! Super experience!
