VrftSduLIducNfEzITOL5A Stopped here while waiting for our sari tops to be altered. Great place! The service was wonderful--very helpful and timely. We had vegetable samosas and they brought us chickpea side dish and several sauces to go with them. Very good! Also had saag paneer which was soooo good. One of my favorite Indian dishes. Would highly recommend!!
