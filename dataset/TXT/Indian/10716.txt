A_05gZ2QwayLb0YeQ_TItQ The mutton biryani is the best mutton biryani i have had in all of montreal. The taste reminds me so much of the awesome biryani we make back in the eastern part of india and although this one lacked the extra grease (which is a good thing) it was absolutely lip smacking. Way to go guys!
