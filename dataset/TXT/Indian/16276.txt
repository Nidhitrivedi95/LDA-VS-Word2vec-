DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I really like this place. The restaurant recently changed ownership, and I think that the change has brought it up from a three star restaurant to four. The samosas went from being somewhat bland to nicely spiced. The service is a lot better (very attentive) too. The food is a bit westernized, and all the Indian dishes that Americans know are definitely on the menu (tikka masala, anyone?). Then again, food is all about fusion and mixing cultures, so who am I to complain? Plus, it's all pretty yummy. 

The portions and prices are excellent. The best part is that they have a rather impressive Vegetarian menu as well as a separate Vegan menu. I'm neither a vegetarian nor a vegan, but I have many friends who are not meat-eaters, so this is a place where we can go and actually eat together without making strange requests.The new owners like to experiment with their recipes and try new things - they are very open with their process, and I like that.
