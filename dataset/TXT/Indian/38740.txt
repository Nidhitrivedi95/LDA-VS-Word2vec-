Service: Really slow. Need to hire additional staff. 
Quality of food: Moderate.
Price: Expensive for the little amount you get. 
Ordered: Chicken tikka masala. Room temperature. Would prefer dish to be a little bit more in the hot side. 
Taste: More on the tomato side. Lack seasoning and flavor. 
More of an Indian American restaurant. 
Would NOT come back. 
Restroom: Well lit and clean.
