7KKugTC6WXZpypifkf9i7Q We order takeout from here a few times from work.  Had the different varieties of chicken, all were good.  Never tried the chilli chicken yet but coworkers say that it is better than the competition down the street.  Gotta make one thing clear though.   This is not traditional Hakka food.  It is Indian-Chinese food made by Hakka Chinese.  This is a common misconception by non-Chinese folk.  The majority of the Chinese community in India are Hakka Chinese descent, so they created a type of Chinese food that suited the taste of the Indian population, causing the misconception of real Hakka food.  Go Wiki authentic Hakka food and it is nothing like what you see here.
