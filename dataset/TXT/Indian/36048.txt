NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ The food tasted really good. Our order was prepared correctly and on time. After a previous experience of ordering and having to wait for a very long time, I decided to give it another try, but just order in advance. I had no issues. The staff is very friendly and they give nice portion sizes. My only complaint is that my naan was a bit on the burned side, and I had to peel off the burnt pieces. I just won't order that next time, but everything else was very tasty. I will be back. Great prices for quality Indian food.
