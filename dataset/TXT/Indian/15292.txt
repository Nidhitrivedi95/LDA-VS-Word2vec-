CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ I was a regular here a while ago...

Their food is close to perfect, not too spicy and everything is vegetarian
YUM
My fav is the mutter paneer with plain naan along side a glass of mango lassi

however, service here is not my fav
i really have a problem when men waiters in particular are always nice to my (now)-ex because they think he's always paying (so they suck up to him -if that's the right wording) and most of the time ignore me, yet when they find out i'm paying, all of a sudden they treat me ever-so-kindly
*rolls eyes*

eventually, i stopped going as much as I used to because I got annoyed when that happened..

I'm probably going to go there on the weekend w/my friend and HOPEFULLY service improved...I'll be sure to give another update

***NOTE: AFTER 6pm (i believe), is when they bring out the mouth watering TANDOORI MENU and the portions are pretty big and filling

and 

remember, they serve the special weekend & holiday lunch buffet between 12pm-3pm

and the smaller weekend buffet from 10am-12noon

and the weekday buffet from 11:30am-3pm.
