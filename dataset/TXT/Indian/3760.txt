0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ My first time coming to this place. I saw the reviews, and they have lunch special and went to try it out but I was kind of disappointed with their lunch special. Maybe dinner is better?

The lunch special come with the meal and 1 spring roll or pop...

I ordered their general tao chicken special for around $9, and the price was reasonable as you can see the portion wasn't bad in my photo.
However, 
1. rice was hard and kind of a bit dry. I know western people have their rice on the harder side but the rice with my general tao chicken was HARD. Maybe it is hard because I have the lunch special?
2. under the general tao chicken was 1/3 of rice underneath. I guess some people like it, but I don't.
3. the general tao chicken tasted "OK", I won't say its good or even bad, it was just soso. Maybe its the sauce? I know some places they use ginger and garlic to their sauce to make general tao chicken and you can actually taste the difference. This place just probably use chili and sweet sauce, but maybe I was wrong, but I just couldn't taste anything other than a bit spicy and sweet.

The spring roll was alright. I don't think they make it themselves, and it just tasted like any other fast food places.

Maybe I will go again to try other food on their menu but I will not eat their general tao chicken again.

I gave them 1 star because hard rice, the general tao sauce was not good, and 1/3 rice under the chicken....
If no hard rice, and no putting rice under the chicken, they might get 2.5 stars
