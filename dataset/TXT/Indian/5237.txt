2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA I like the concept but this place is definitely not worth 5 or 4 stars . Food was average but decent , there are several better indian places in Toronto. You can try it once though , just for the concept. 
If you are preparing a chicken dish it does not mean that you just throw chunks of chicken in the dish. ( indian cooking 101 - fail) . 
The owner should paint the walls , the place looks old.
