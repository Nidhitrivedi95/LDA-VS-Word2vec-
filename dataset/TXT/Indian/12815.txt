B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog Quite a disappointment! We have been dining here for years, for the delicious food and friendly and superb service , every time we visit Montreal. This time the service was sub-par to say the least. I finally got up to pour water for the table; the portions have gotten smaller and -this is why I may not return - the rice was distributed scrooge-like: we ordered 8 dishes in our party of 7 and were brought one order  of rice.  " we don't want to waste the portion" was the waiter's take-me-aback response.
