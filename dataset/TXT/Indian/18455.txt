I'm so happy we ended up here. We made a reservation a couple weeks ago as we had a guest in town. I was a bit concerned about the service having read some of the previous reviews. Reso was for 6, and we parked nearby on the street (free parking after 6pm).

This is definitely not a hole-in-the-wall kind of joint. It's casual and cleanly decorated. We were seated right away at our reserved table. Immediately a bottle of water came onto the table with some glasses, so that was good. We reviewed the menu and the male server came back and asked us if we had questions, which we did - mainly centering on sizing and sharing. 

We initially planned to order the Onion Bhaji & Lasooni Chicken Pakoras; our server countered with that being a lot of fried stuff (fair point...) so he suggested we flip to sharing the Tandoori Chicken Tikka instead. We took him up on that and we're happy we did. The portions were just right for our group of 3. The appetizers came out in about 15 minutes and were accompanied by small salads with this amazing mango dressing on them. Both dishes also had an amazing spicy yet sweet red sauce.

We then ordered a portion of saffron rice & 2 orders of naan as per our server's suggestion. Our table went with an order of butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and chicken vindaloo.

There was plenty of sauce left, so we ended up ordering a third order of naan... so worth it.

My chicken tikka was delicious, and the butter chicken had depth and was incredibly rich. The chicken vindaloo was certainly spicy, but in a pleasant way. I tasted a lot of pepper -- in a good way.

The place was full throughout our dinner, and we saw take out orders being picked up. Perhaps some of the staffing/ordering issues have been sorted.

I'm in real trouble if this becomes my regular Indian spot! ;)
