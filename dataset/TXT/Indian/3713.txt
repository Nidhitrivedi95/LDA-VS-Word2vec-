0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Had take-out from here a few times, and always been very satisfied with the food quality and serving sizes. 
As there are some members of my family that don't eat much spice, it is very important to clearly specify how hot that you would like each dish - to properly balance taste and flavor. 
I have only eaten at the restaurant once, and was very happy with the quick service and light ambience. Great for conversations with delicious food. The restaurant does get crowded over peak times, so you have to be lucky enough to get a table right away. That's why I prefer their take-out option. 
They give you sticky white rice if you order either a certain amount or certain dishes, and their appetizers and entrees are delicious. Great Indian style Hakka Chinese food,  usually end up picking up from there once or twice a month now.
