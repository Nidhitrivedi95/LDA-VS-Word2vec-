iX0XUpk34WqHfUuLjPhR9g I was in the restaurant when the owner went crazy the other night. As in Shary B's review below. Her story is totally accurate. It was a really disturbing experience. We just moved into the neighborhood and wanted to give this place a try. Instead, we ended up leaving half way through our drinks when the owner/chef started verbally abusing the server and other customers. No way I would ever set foot in there again.
