PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA I found this place recently, and I am mad! Mad that I didn't know about it sooner!

The food is top notch, I've been cruising through the menu trying as much as I can. I have made this a once a week stop, since discovering it. (Note: Asking for the Vindaloo to be "very spicy" was unwise. Delicious, but unwise.) 

I've dined in, and carried out, service is excellent either way.  The staff is friendly, and everything comes out quick. 

If you like indian food, get your butt over to this place ASAP!
