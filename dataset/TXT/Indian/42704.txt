RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I recently had lunch at Blue Taj and chose some menu items I wouldn't normally order. I had a variety of spicy and traditional dishes as both appetizers and my main course & LOVED everything including the service. I will definitely be back many times to enjoy the ethnic decor, good service & delicious Indian food.
