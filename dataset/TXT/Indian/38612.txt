OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This place is amazing!  Carlos, our server was one of the best we've ever had!!  He is smart, engaging, informative and very quick.  As a former waitress I'd give him top rating!  The chef, Tarun Kapoor, went above and beyond and made me the most delicious lamb chops (you have to ask for them - they are not on the menu) in a scrumptious sauce!  My husband had a fresh and tasty tikki masala!  Chef Kapoor then visited  our table to visit and share:-). A very traveled culinary expert...interesting, talented, warm, friendly man.. I'd hire him in heartbeat..along with the rest of the kitchen staff!  Wish I could give this place more than 5 stars...we will be back!!  Still licking our lips!
