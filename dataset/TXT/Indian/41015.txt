PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q I have been dragged here on numerous occasions.

Pros:
- Alcohol.  They have it (though good luck in getting it in a timely manner).
- Location.  For Pitt students, it's easy to get to.

Cons.
- Service.  Slow and unfriendly.  This is every time I've gone but I'll tell you about the most recent.  The sign outside mentioned a beer special.  When we got in we asked for the beer special to which we were told there was none.  We asked about the sign then and the server consulted with someone else and said we were right.  When the check came we were still charged full price.
- Food.  Let me preface this by saying I don't typically like Indian food.  However, I have had it at times where I thought it was good.  India Garden was never one of those times.  

Verdict:
One of my least favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's not worth going to thanks to the poor service and food that can't even be classified as mediocre.
