KCxdy3cm7H0jXnDhhPvBYw My first experience here wasn't so great: I ordered one of the paneer dishes and opened the container to find 4 measly pieces of paneer.  Total bummer.  I decided to give them another shot, though.  This time around, I went with the chicken tikka and was not disappointed.  The chicken was tender, the sauce pleasantly spicy, and the rice steamed to perfection.  Their small size is pretty generous -- no hunger pangs this round!  And $4.50 for a generously sized small?  No hunger pangs for my wallet, either.

The only consistent downside is the wait.  This truck is hoppin' during my brief lunch break, and since they make everything fresh (awesome!), the wait is even longer (around 20 minutes today).  However, my understanding is that you can call in your order for pickup if you're short on time.
