b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw So - best Indian food in Cleveland. (west side at least bc I don't venture east often) 
The decor is nothing special but the food is worth it and the staff is fantastic (Brian, the manager, waited on us and gave great suggestions and was very attentive overall, but not overbearing - you know the type) 

We had the butter chicken, paneer chettinad, garlic naan and spring dosa. Would have to say the chettinad was the winner for me but my date preferred the chicken. I don't think you can screw up naan bc it's just fried bready goodness, and we will probably not have the spring dosa again, although it was good, just too many veggies made it a little much (but the sauces that came with it? Heaven.). My Date had come there before and said the Mysore masala dosa is where it's at.

Just go here, you won't regret it.
