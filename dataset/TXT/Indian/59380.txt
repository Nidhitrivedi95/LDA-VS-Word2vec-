z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA Wonderful!!  Fast, affordable, yummy!  Check them out!!  I have eaten here 3 times.  It's kinda like Chipolata in that you pick bowl or wrap, then you pick a rice, then, meat, then they have these 4 amazing sauces!!! Omg! They are awesome!!!  At then end of the assembly line you pick cucumbers, tomato's, cilantro and then flavorful toppings!
