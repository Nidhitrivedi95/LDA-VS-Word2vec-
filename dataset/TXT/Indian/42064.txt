QEqMHowTTj5GKvpiKheGlQ First time here.  Awesome experience. Great staff, the young girls working here were so attentive and informative. 
We got take out, and it was delicious. 
We orders naan and roti which were warm and fresh.  We also ordered butter chicken, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and chicken biryani. Great food. Will definitely be back.
