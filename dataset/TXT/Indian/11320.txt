Ae4ABFarGMaI5lk1i98A0w Pretty good Tibetan food with great prices. 

You gotta love the spicy taste in food though. 

Everything we had was terrific. Definitely will come back for more and to explore different dishes to share with you all. 

If you'll ever in the Parkdale area, you should pay a visit to this place. 

Highly recommended
