sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ i took the advice from my friend H who said this place is a toronto must try, as well as the advice of other yelpers on the menu and ate the mutter paneer medium heat....and i wasn't disappointed.  

this was good indian food served in an innovative way and was enough for two meals...and after the exchange rate from the u.s....a really great bargain!

next time i'm in toronto i'll definitely be back...and i heard about new york subway down the street as well.  another eclectic food spot i wanna try.
