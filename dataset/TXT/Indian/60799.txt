zR12ySz1Ew1qAP-yPJDHAQ We visited Rice Factory on 6th July, 2012 during the day time. We were not knowing that they are open only during evening and night time for dinner etc...we just went there based on their Zagat Rating. That was our first day in Toronto and we were tired from our visit of Casa Loma. But the greedy owner asked us to get in there and have lunch. As this was our first day in Toronto-we got in there. We were sitting in some random area - which is definitely not the customer area to have food. For the price of $12 - they offered us - 200 gms of steamed rice, Dal and one subzi(aloo gobhi). Food was so little in quantity that even my kid(around 5.5 yrs) couldn't feel stuffed. There were no other options - yes no menu, no other options apart from what they gave us. When we asked for extra naans - they charged per naan $3. Even for water we need to get up and get it on our own. Worst ever Indian restaurant experience in North Americas for us. I will advice anybody going to Toronto - never ever step into this restaurent - this is more like snacks place where you can order and carry the stuff....not for your regular meals and that too at this price. There is no parking place - so you will end up paying for street parking at the rate of $2 per 30 minutes. 
It seems the Zagat Rating is being purchased by them and if the Zagat Rating is true-we should stop trusting it at all.
