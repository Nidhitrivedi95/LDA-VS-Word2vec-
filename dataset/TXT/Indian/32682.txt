LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This is my to go to restaurant for whenever I crave for dosas. The variety they have are endless, which makes it impossible for one to get bored of the place. But even though they have such so many choices I tend to order the chaat dosa, which I am obsessed with and is not available at any other dosa restaurant that I have been to. This, along with the plate of 14pc mini idli, is what has made me a huge fan of this place.
This place is crazy busy, so if you don't book a reservation then don't bother coming. Therefore my complaint is that whenever one does get a table they tend to rush them with their order and service so that they can get you out and let the other customers in, which I understand as they are trying to get as many customers as they can, but it does get frustrating when I am yet eating and they bring along the bill and start clearing things from the table. This restaurant is not meant to be a fast food place, but a nice sit-down restaurant that you would like to spend at least half an hour in. Unfortunately, unless you stall your ordering and eat really slowly, you will be in and out as if you just ate at McDonalds. 
Overall, the food is awesome but the service needs some adjustments, and this will still be my favourite dosa place in Mississauga.
