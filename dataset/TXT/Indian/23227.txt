gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We've been going to Mount Everest for yeeearrrrs! The food an service has always been excellent. Prekash (owner) is typically there to great us and always makes sure that everything is service hot, fresh and quickly. Lamb vindaloo and chile pakoras are our favorites but be prepared for the spice! If you a more of a sweet tooth I'd recommend the kulfi ice cream or mago lassi.
