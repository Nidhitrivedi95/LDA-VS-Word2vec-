0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Service at Chilli Chicken House is surprisingly fast given how busy it is. I guess they do have a lot of servers for a restaurant of that size though. I tried the Manchurian Fried Rice because I kind of didn't know what I wanted at the time.

(Plus, it gave me a chance to make a Manchurian Candidate joke)
(Was it all worth it for a joke no one at the table got? Yes it was)

To my surprise the Manchurian fried rice is bright red. Like paprika red. I started getting worried because it looked spicy enough to melt my retainer. The fact that every other table was Indian didn't help cause their spice-tolerance levels has probably towed the average way up for this restaurant.

i was pleasantly surprised when I bit into it though. It wasn't spicy at all, the intense red colour just had this placebo effect thingy.

The rice was pretty good, not clumped together, not too oily, and stuck to your teeth as you chewed it just a tiny bit.

In conclusion, it's a pretty kewl restaurant. I'll dine here again next time I storm out of Bubble Republic next door after waiting too long. B)
