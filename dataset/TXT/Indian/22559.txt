gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I love this place. The food is fresh and tastes home cooked, with none of that canned or stale flavor that some restaurants have. The choices are all vegetarian, and many are vegan if that's important to you. The dishes are well-balanced and flavorful. Try their lunch buffet, it's awesome!
