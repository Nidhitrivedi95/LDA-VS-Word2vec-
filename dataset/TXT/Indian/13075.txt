b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q Being a well-seasoned Indian food consumer, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious, authentic Indian cuisine.

We always order the samosas(stuffed with potato and well-seasoned) and the paneer naan(cheese-filled bread--it's become my fiance's favorite thing on the menu lol!)...I also ordered their aloo papri chaat(read my 'Crown of India' review for a description) and it was top-of-the-line...nice and creamy and crispy!

It's been a month or two since we ordered from Maharaja, so I can't really remember what else we've gotten, but I know that I've had no bad impressions of their fare...try it out!
