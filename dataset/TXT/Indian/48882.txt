tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA July 20, 2016:  still love this place!  Their prices have gone up a bit as w most places around; it's still delicious food at a reasonable price.  They have updated inside so I would think of it as a clean ma and pa shop to have a home cooked style healthy meal.  Good value and healthy options available, what more could a gal ask for?
