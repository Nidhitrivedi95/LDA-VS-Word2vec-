My uneducated guess is that they remove many air bubbles before baking using a docker (a spiked roller often used on pizzas to remove air bubbles that would otherwise expand. Each piece of na'an is also thicker. We ordered a second helping of na'an for the 3 of us just to finish up the rest of our dishes.

The chicken jalfrezi was oily, but it was good and the chicken was tender. The butter chicken looked better. Choosing is very difficult because of the many options they have.

Next time we'll try the daily specials written on the chalkboard on the wall behind the register. Totally missed that. Service was unremarkable.
