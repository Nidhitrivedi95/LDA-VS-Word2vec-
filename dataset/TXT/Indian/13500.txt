biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg Gratuity is mandatory here even for buffet!! This is what this Indian place made us realize!!!! Food is decent but service isnt and the lady at the cashier (Sujata) basically forced us to pay gratuity! Not that we wouldnt pay but literally questioned it because it was buffet. Anyway...we wont be going here as:
- No kabob's were served on our buffet trip
- Food was decent but not necessarily better than other Indian places.
- Sujata was more interested in gratuity which she basically forced us to pay even though we objected.

Will never go here again!!!!
