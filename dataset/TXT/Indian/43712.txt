RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA I got with the tandoori dinner. 18$ for a full meal from appetizer to a nice small desert. Level 7 of spice, it was spicy but if you enjoy extra spicy kick it to a 10. The tandoori dinner was perfect size including the lamb saag I got as my 2nd meat pick. I also got king fisher Indian beer. A Good lager. It was a cold Monday night so I ended up eating my meal and chatting with the guy working the front of the house. It was rather nice since I went alone.

In the end good service and a relaxing meal with a nice hot cup of tea at the end.

It was all very good but I have had better lamb saag in the past.
