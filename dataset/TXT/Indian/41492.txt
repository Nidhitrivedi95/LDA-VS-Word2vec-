Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w This is my first less-than-stellar review on Yelp, but the last time I went here, nobody was satisfied.  We have been before for the buffet (which if I remember well was pretty decent).  So we went for dinner when my parents and brother visited me in Madison.  I don't remember exactly what I got, but it was a vegan dish with peas as a star.  What I do remember is how very bland it tasted.  I'm no expert, but I'm also no stranger to Indian food.  The spicy tomato-y sauce that is a base/part of many dishes was water-y and lacked flavor.  I even ordered it "medium"!  My family all had similar complaints, though they all tasted mine and agreed that it was the worst of the four.  I t was very unfortunate because I LOVE Indian food.  And I love peas.  And I have generally liked the two in Madison, but this fell very short.
