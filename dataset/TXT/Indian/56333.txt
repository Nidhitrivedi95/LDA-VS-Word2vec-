XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw This was the very first restaurant I went to when I visited Toronto in 2012. My hotel room was at the airport and traveled all the way to Parkdale for this food. When my gf and I moved here in 2013, it became a staple for us. 

Their chili chicken (dry), beef momos, and chicken pakoras are honestly the best I have ever had. I always use Tibet Kitchen as the standard for food with other Tibetan/Nepalese cuisine, but none of them compare to Tibet Kitchen. Great food, great people, and ALWAYS a five-star experience!  Oh, in the summer... They have one of the best patios in Parkdale. Its definitely a hidden gem.

Go try it ASAP if you haven't been there already.
