aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q I got the jumbo beef burrito. The menu is a bit confusing. There is a burrito, jumbo burrito, satay burrito, jumbo grilled burrito and subs. I ordered the jumbo beef as per yelp recs. It came to $9 flat. 

The beef is ground beef. Taste was nothing special. It was all ground beef, Mayo and lettuce. No tomatoes. 
I feel like I ordered the wrong thing. Next time I'll get a roti or lamb sub.
