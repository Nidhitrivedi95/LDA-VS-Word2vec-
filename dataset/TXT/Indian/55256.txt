WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA Compared to other roti shops, the vibe of Bacchus roti is quite nice. The sitting area is quite spacious and comfortable. 
We got a double and jerk Chicken Roti. The double was filled with curried dhal, with all its deep-fried goodness. For a split second, we thought twice about our order as we saw the oil seeped through the sandwich wrap. 

The Jerk chicken was delicious. The flavour was subtle, with the right amount of heat. And the roti was fresh and not too doughy. The only downside was that there was a little more potatoes in the filling than we would have liked.

We will definitely be coming to try out Bacchus Roti shop again!
