r71RUi85E60aGuhVqXWjKA Good food, HORRIBLE service.  I've been here countless times with my family, and have even thrown family parties here just because the food is good and the price is fair.  Service on the other hand, is absolutely ridiculous.  No smiles or greetings, and their favourite line in the world is probably "$1 extra for more sauce".  They should definitely consider hiring actual and polite waiters who know what they're doing.  Don't bother tipping either, they already charge it on their bill.  We only come here because its close to where I live, but if you want equally good Hakka food and proper service, I suggest China Cottage--though its a lot farther.
