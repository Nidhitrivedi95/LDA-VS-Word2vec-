It was good servings, great flavor and I will definitely be coming back! The service is great as well. The one thing I didn't like was the creepy stairs to the bathroom but even that won't keep me away from the flavor and beautiful aromas of the food. This is a sure place to try but a tad on the pricey side for dinner due to no specials.
