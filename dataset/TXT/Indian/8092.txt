7d2LqDc0Cb5dcizil_h34A $5.99 (veg) - $6.99 (meat) Nepali Lunch specials on a Saturday! Now I haven't tried Nepali food before so this resto definitely stood out from the others in Little India. Their sign claims that their momos are better than regular dumplings. Now I eat dumplings quite often so that's a big claim. So I had to testify whether this is true. 

Ordered both lunch specials
Thali ($6.99) with mutton curry (option of veg or chicken) - Round platter with a variety of small dishes/soups that tickle your various taste buds - sweet, sour, savoury, bitter. I like it a lot and the curry has a rich unique flavour profile. I would definitely consider coming back for this again!

Momo's ($6.99) with chicken (option with veg) - Dumplings filled with chicken and some chives or green onions. This was just okay but the filling wasn't particularly unique and the dumpling wrapper was a little thicker than what I prefer. I still think nothing beats Chinese soup-filled dumplings (Xiao long bao). 

Overall enjoyed the experience! There weren't any customers when we stepped in at 1pm~ and usually I tend to avoid stepping in an empty restaurant but the sitting area by the window felt private enough that gave us space from the server in overhearing our every convo. The servers were also very friendly and gave us the perfect amount of attention. The lunch specials are totally worth it, go for the thali!
