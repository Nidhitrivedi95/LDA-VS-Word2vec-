CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ Yum! Really liked this place. Tried the biriyani (sp?) chicken with chicken tikka masala. Also tried the samosas. I thought it was reasonably priced, and everything was delicious. I've only had Indian food maybe 20 times, so I'm no expert, but I liked that I could try different things without dropping $20. 

Will definitely go back!
