ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Our second time at Origin India, and it was as good, or better than the first time.  We had tandoori chicken for appetizer - the best tandoori chicken ever.  Not that dyed red stuff you get most places, but moist, tender flavorful dark meat chicken (our fav!)  We ordered papadums and it arrived with two dipping sauces which were fabulous.  The papadums were light and delicious.  We then had lamb shank, baked cod and sag paneer, all of which were terrific and 2 orders of garlic naan  (oh the naan!) to sop up all the delicious sauces and juices.  Our waiter, Ahmed (an Egyptian, actually) went out of his way to make sure we were happy, and we appreciated his attention to detail.

The decor is simple but tasteful.  This has become our favorite Indian restaurant.  The bartender is on UTube making a couple of the imaginative cocktails the restaurant serves.  We didn't have one, but my husband did have a Cilantro Mojito, different but delicious.  

We ate early (about 5:30) but by the time we left at 7:00 the restaurant was mostly full, with a couple of large parties as well.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time, and I know we did.

Bringing the check to the table with the machine to run your credit card is definitely different, but lets you have the confidence that there is no-one fooling with your card.  We like that little bit of safety!
