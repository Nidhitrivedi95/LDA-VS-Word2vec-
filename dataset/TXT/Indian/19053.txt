F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Great place for Hakka food. The portions are great for sharing. We ordered the chicken pakora, Manchurian beef and house special fried rice. All dishes were scrumptious and prepared fresh. Our favorite was the chicken pakora, crispy outside, tender inside. It came with a side of chili sauce that would make your lips burn, in a good way! Highly recommended!
