DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew First time at this restaurant and first time trying Indian food. Server was very pushy. As soon as I sat down, she came over and asked what I want to drink. The menu was not even opened yet, and she made no attempt to make any recommendations so we just ordered water, I did not see their cocktail menu on the table had my favorite mojitos until afterwards but I already lost the mood to order a drink with my dinner. 
Once again, no recommendations on appetizers or entrees. Server just walks up and said "ready to order some appetizers?" I had to ask for recommendations and suggestions. 
Also, we tried to take advantage of the Yelp offer for free naan by checking in but was told it was only available by ordering the chef's special. It felt like deceptive advertising.
All this before my food was even served. The host was polite and the food runner that just brought my food was very nice. Lets hope the food makes up for the service.
Update after dinner: Food was wonderful!
Milica was the name of the server listed on the check, she never introduced herself.
