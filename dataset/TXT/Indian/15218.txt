CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA Yum! My boyfriend loves Indian food so we were trying to find a good place for his Birthday dinner and stumbled upon this place on yelp. You can always tell if it's going to be good by the Samosas! They were spot on, we also got the Vegetable Pakoras which were delicious. We are vegetarian and this place has so many great options! For the dinner the 3 of us (including our 13 year  old daughter) shared Aloo Gobhi, Dal Tadka, and the Paneer Butter Masala. Everything was awesome. Our daughter can't handle spice so we got everything mild and she could and did eat EVERYTHING. The garlic Naan was perfect. The service was also great, our waiter seemed very happy to be there and enjoyed what he did. Very happy with our experience and we will be back for sure!
