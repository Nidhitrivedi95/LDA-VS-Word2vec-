3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw My family and I got into town rather late and hungry.  My kids had never tasted Indian food, or had been to Toronto so they were in a slightly guarded state.  The buffet was barely open, and I went for that.  Everything on the buffet was great, no worries.  My wife and kids ordered from the menu and were pleased as well.

The owners were very gracious and explained everything from the dipping sauces (chutney, mint etc.) to how the chicken was spiced.  It made for a very nice dinner and now my kids can check out some of the awesome O-town Indian cuisine.

They mentioned they had been in business in that store for 25 years and 10 in another neighborhood.   Great relaxing (and filling) experience for us.  Even though it was late they didn't rush us at all.  When we're back in Toronto, we'll be back.
