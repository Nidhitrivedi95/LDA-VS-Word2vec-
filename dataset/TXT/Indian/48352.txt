ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA The attitude of staff is really rude. They charge you $13 for sunday buffet and 9$ for weekdays. On asking why such a huge difference I was told it because of one tasteless and very poorly made mutton/lamb item on the menu. There sanitation rating is way below 94 and you can see how shabby and unhygienic their counters and service areas are.

If you dont mind falling sick or love the stomach aches, you will love the food.
Best of luck!

Never ever returning there.
