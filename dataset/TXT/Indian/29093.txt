jG46RAFm2kWshUIZ4HoJtg look for the "T" and the Chili Sign on the corner of the building. simple, super-casual presentation of your indian favorites.

as part of my ongoing quest to understand and sample the cuisine of india about which I know little, I ventured to Tadka Sizzles on Tuesday for lunch since nearby Bawarchi is closed on Tuesdays.

+ good spicyness in chicken biryani.
+ good rice body, not sticky or too wet.
+ cooked to order may take 25-minutes. and we were the only table. be warned!
-- mango lassi too yogurt-ey. i need to make this more often at home
-- garlic naan doughey and bland.

# signage advertised a lunch buffet, but the bar has been mothballed
# barely-usable IKEA "matchstick"-plastic furniture barely serves. i don't care I'm here for the food!
# styro, plastic and paper rule the fray. it doesn't stop me from enjoying this place, but come on! i'm starting an ECO-violator list. :)
