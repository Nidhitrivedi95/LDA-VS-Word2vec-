hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Went there for dinner on a weekday.   The restaurant had 2 seperate couples having dinner so it was pretty quiet.  The food was pretty good.  The spice level ranges from not spicy, medium, very spicy.  We ordered very spicy and personally I did not think it was very spicy, it still seemed a bit bland.  The chicken biryani is what we had and it was decent.  In terms of the prices and the amount of food you are served it does not compare.  We also had the Badam Lassi (mango smoothie w/ almond) the mango was VERY SOUR!!    
I will/may go back only because it is very close and the food was decent.
