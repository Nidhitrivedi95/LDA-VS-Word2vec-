This place deserves an increase in patrons. Does the location just make it hard to find? They could probably benefit from a sign on the street, not just the building.

I feel like we kept it decently simple with malling kawny (chicken lentil soup), half order of tandoori chicken, lamb curry, garlic naan, mango lassi, and Indian tea. Everything was as good as we hoped it would be. The lassi was better than others I've had. I'm really really glad I tried the tea on a whim.

The manager, Raj Rani served us. She split the soup for us since we mentioned we'd just share it. At the end of our meal she brought us two doughnut hole sized and shaped cakes soaked in honey.
