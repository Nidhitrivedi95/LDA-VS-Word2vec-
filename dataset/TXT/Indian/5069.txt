This place is a big turnoff for me because of the tacky decor - think bright salmon walls, gaudy gold on chairs, over the top try too hard decor. I am not into that. They tried to create some ambience in an empty restaurant by having a gentleman sing. I felt bad because he wasn't doing a great job and it was literally just 4 of us there for a birthday dinner. 

The service was lazy - no servers. The owner basically served us that evening. They do serve alcohol and for drinks I ordered a Paan Cocktail I wasn't a huge fan of. The food wasn't too bad. We ordered a couple of shareables: 

For starters we ordered a vegetarian spinach and paneer kabab (Hara Bhara Kabab) and some chicken tikka, both of which weren't bad at all. And not spicy (thank god). 

For mains, we ordered paneer dumplings (Malai Kofta) and butter chicken. The Malai Kofta was amazing and the butter chicken was rather bad. 

And as sides, we ordered Naans and Rumali Roti. Rumali Roti is this super thin bread that is usually really nice, long and stretchy. I can't say it was very good at The Khana Sutra. The name of the restaurant is a bit inappropriate too. You won't find me back here again.
