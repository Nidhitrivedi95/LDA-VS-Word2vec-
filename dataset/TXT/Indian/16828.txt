DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I've been coming to Udupi for about 6 years now. And it's so good that I just keep coming back.

The food is INCREDIBLE. The spices and flavors are always rich and enticing. The dishes rotate a little different every time, but there's always at least 4-5 main dish options, plus as much rice, bread, soup, and salad you can eat. Oh and dessert too.

I honestly still don't know the names of most of the dishes but I love just about every one they put out. I usually try a little bit of everything over a thin bed of rice, and grab some dipping sauce for the awesome potato-stuffed pancake roll (my naming) they bring to your table.

Most dishes are vegan and gluten free, but you'd be safe to ask if you are strict on either one. I eat mostly GF & vegan myself and it's nice to have a place that caters to my preferences.

I've only ever come for the lunch buffet, which is $10 on weekdays and $13 on weekends, and if you come here hungry you'll get more than your money's worth.

Seriously, grab your friends and check this place out. You won't regret it.
