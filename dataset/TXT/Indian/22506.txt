gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg We found this place because they were at the vegetarian food festival. Their food was amazing there so we had to check it out. I'm glad we did! 
It was empty when we got there but people slowly trickled in. The menu is huge and everything has a name you can't understand so you really have to read it. I got the vegetable manchurian and it was phenomenal! Everything we had was amazing and authentic! The best part is they let you know what is vegan and everything is vegetarian! Dream!!
The staff was super friendly and even gave us a free desert to go. I highly recommend this place and we will be back!
