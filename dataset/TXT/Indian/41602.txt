Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Ordered take-out

Food is pricey-ish but portions are generous. Hubby picked up the food so I didn't check out the restaurant itself. I can only comment on the food. Ordered a couple of their vegetarian items along with noodles. I needed more noodles. Not that the portions weren't generous (they are) but the noodles are very yummy. Would definitely eat here again.
