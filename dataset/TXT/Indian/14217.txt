c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A I used to eat here all the time as a kid with my parents until I started having a mind of my own and realized how dirty the place is. If the tables are that horrid, can you imagine the back and people making your food? 

I've had instances of finding hair in my food and the fact that the majority of it just soaking in oil is such a stomach turner.

My parents stopped eating here and I will never either.
