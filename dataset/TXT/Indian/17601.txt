DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ I found Sweet India Restaurant through Yelp. I was in Toronto for work and wanted to try something that wasn't Tim Hortons (although I love their maple donut!). I was staying near the airport and found Sweet India to be close by. 

The restaurant is located in an interesting strip mall. The strip mall is a bit sketchy and parking was full. Sweet India is located in the middle of the strip mall.  

When I walked in, I smelled home-cooked Indian food. There are display cases for sweets, and the menu is posted on a board. I ordered the butter chicken, saag paneer, garlic naan and rice. The total was $15. 

The butter chicken was the best. It was flavorful and I can taste the butter and Indian spices.  I could have just eaten the sauce by the spoonful, like soup!  

The saag paneer was okay.  It wasn't my favorite and I may have been biased, having eaten the butter chicken first. 

The garlic naan was warm and fresh. But the rice was a bit cold. 

I am happy I tried a new restaurant. I would definitely recommend the butter chicken and garlic naan.
