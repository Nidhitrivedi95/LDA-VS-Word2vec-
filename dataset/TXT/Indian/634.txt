-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q This is a great restaurant to have on state street! I called and ordered a half vegetarian dinner for two for take out (which is not on the menu but asked and they were very helpful and said they could do that for me!). The restaurant looked very clean and well kept when I was there, not many people at 2:30 pm on sunday, but the buffet looked very tempting! I usually like to order from the straight from the kitchen but it looks like I will have to come back and try the buffet. When the food came out i was surprised by how big the bag was! After getting a look at the buffet then getting a big bag of goods straight from the kitchen, i was pretty excited. Three vegetarian entrees, rice,naan,kheer, chutneys, vegetable pakora and a soda for 20$ with tax! The food ingredients seems to be of good quality as well not only that but they are prepared very well. The sauces don't taste cheap or off like they have at other places i have tried, the rice was fluffy and just right, I had just the regular naan and it was great! I'm sure the more interesting naans are even better. The kheer is really top notch as well! taste better than most i've tried. If you're in the mood for indian food downtown this place should certainly be on the top of your list to check out.
