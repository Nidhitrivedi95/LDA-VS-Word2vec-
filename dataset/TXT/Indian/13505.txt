biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg I've been for both the buffet (weekdays, and always before noon) and to pick up food for takeout, and both are excellent.  The buffet is fresh, and items change regularly - probably the best buffet of any type of food I have been to.  Amazing bread, friendly service, fun Indian music videos on the tv.
