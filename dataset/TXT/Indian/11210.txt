ad7lp1JL-gC4d4zDXXNgjg TL;DR Bland food, deceitful practices, & a bad experience

Bland. That is the best way I can describe the food from this place. It was filling and it wasn't bad but it barely had any flavor. My "Goan Coconut Curry" with chicken which the guy behind the counter very highly recommended was marked with a hot pepper in the menu but it barely had a taste let alone any spiciness! My buddy got the Green Curry with chicken and it had even less flavor. Very disappointing.

Deceitful is how I would describe the person working there that night when I went in with a friend. He only decided to warn us at the end of our second order (we came in together but ordered separately)  that none of the dishes came with rice or naan bread and made no mention of the gargantuan size of the rice sides they give us. What a waste! We used one side of rice and barely touched the other between the two of us. I also threw in a naan bread in case the rice side was tiny and, again, totally went to waste because of the sheer size of the rice sides. Ugh, thanks for making us waste food and money, jerk!

It's astounding to me how they can have so many great reviews. Avoid this place
