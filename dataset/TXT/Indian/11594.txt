ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ Simply the best dosa I've ever had and I'm from South India. The dosas are crispy if you get the paper version and their molagapodi (aka Gunpowder) is spicy and full of flavour. Service is great with the servers greeting us by name by our third visit and always treating us like VIP customers. 

Make sure you finish your meal with the Madras coffee. Though they use brew brand coffee powder to make, it rounds off the meal perfectly. 

The place is a bit of a dive but it's easily forgivable because it has confidence and authenticity. This is how a roadside dosa place would be like in India and you get a free trip there if just for an hour.
