OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg I've eaten here once before. The food is pretty good. However, I took my girlfriend and some friends there for my girlfriend's birthday. We called in advance because we were expecting a big party. No reservations no problem. We were told they'd fit us in. 

 We arrive there's a wait. No problem again. Our group ended up being only four people I put our name in and our told it'll be 25 minutes and the next table is ours. Fast forward an hour and a half and having watched them sit 4 tables of three, all of which who arrived after us, they finally sit us. Not a word to us in the hour and a half we stood there waiting. Once sat they tell us we need to order quickly as their kitchen is closing in ten minutes. We explain what had happened since, I guess, the 4 people standing infront of the cash for an hour were invisible. The server is smiles and laughs as we explain this. We ended up calling  another Indian restaurant (Banjara) told them what happened and they stayed open an extra half hour for us. 

I would suggest to actively avoid this place unless you are friends with the owners.
