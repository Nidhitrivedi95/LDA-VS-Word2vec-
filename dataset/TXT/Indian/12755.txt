B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Good Indian food in the vicinity. We tried their weekend thali which we found the portions to be scanty. Also found an eyelash in my rice pudding but I am ready to put it behind me given I ate there twice and wasn't disappointed. I like their dal makhni which may not be matching my high standards of Delhi style dal makhni but still pretty flavorful. Try their lamb over chicken for it is really well done.
