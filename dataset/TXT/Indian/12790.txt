B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to taste. To think it's located in the middle of Wisconsin, really sucks because I really dig this place. Anyhow they do serve alcohol here, which helps for most of you reading this review :).  
Let me get the negative out of here, I felt the service was pretty slow, like I had to flag down the waiter. there seemed to be a language barrier, but the other waiters that came around were hard to get a hold of but there was no barrier in communication.....and heck I speak all the langs they speak here lol Go figure! so when I saw communication barrier, I mean it!

Oh and ummm they could spice up the decor lol

Very Important !! They give you the option of picking the level of spice from 1 to 5. We had the food at level 3 and it was perfect to me, I could have gone up to level 4 but I wanted to share the cuisine with my one of my colleagues, he had level 3 for his dishes..... he was sweating profusely but said it was amazing. So if you dare or are tempted try level 4 or 5 :)!!! Lemme know how it goes!

First time ever I had the Dhaba Biryani that had shrimp, chicken, beef , and Lamb.... and the flavors were on point. Usually when you put those all in a combination they tend to clash and not be to appetizing. You won't regret ordering it......unless you can't handle spice :). Still craving it til this day. 

I miss Dhaba already, if you live in the greater Wisconsin area you gota excuse to go to the middle of no where and give this place a shot.

EnjoY the pics and the Videos !
