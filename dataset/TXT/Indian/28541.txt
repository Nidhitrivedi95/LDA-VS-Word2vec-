J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ This restaurant was a treat! We ordered the veggie combo that was a special for Asian Food fest, and absolutely everything was delicious. Service was very attentive. There was a line to get in. We were the third group in line, and it took no more the 15 minutes for us to be seated. With dessert and lassis, the total cost was about CA$50, including tip. We will absolutely go back next time we're in Toronto.
