C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I'm still not sure what I think about Kalendar. It has earned a few return visits, at the very least to help me make up my mind.

The overall ambiance is laden with charm, the patio especially is a portal away from the semi-dinginess of most of Toronto's streets, while the inside proper feels like the kind of restaurant Paris locals would flock to.

Kalendar's selection of libations is, at the same time, thoughtful and adventurous, while still putting forth several safe choices I fear might outsell simply because of their presence on the menu. Huge bonus points for a purposely heavy pour and extremely good prices, considering, to say nothing of the name 'Cassis Me You Fool'. Wine and beer selection is surprisingly good, without going too far off the beaten path.

Spicy black bean hummus, yes, yes, dear lord yes. Beet root 'carpaccio', also very good. My concern with the menu is that they're trying to do a bit of everything; wraps, pizza, entrees, pasta; Mediterranean, Italian, Indian, Classic French. Everything we tried seemed very good, though it may have just been a case of getting lucky and choosing the right items. The swordfish in a ginger butter sauce, for example, was spectacular and for a moment made me forget that I'm iffy about seafood this far from the sea.

Service is consistent and casual, in the sense that you never feel rushed or unappreciated, though perhaps a little lacking on menu knowledge (it took three servers and ten minutes to figure out if one of the ports was a tawny or ruby, for instance). That aside, it was quick and full of smiles, and I'm really just a big snob.

Great for people-watching, great for drinking, thus far good for eating, understandably busy but painfully romantic. Kalendar is trying very hard to please everyone who walks in, every bit the double edged sword it sounds. So far though, so good.
