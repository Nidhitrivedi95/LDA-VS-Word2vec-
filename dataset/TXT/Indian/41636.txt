Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g This place was small and older establishment. Don't expect anything fancy or even modern. 
Menu was extensive however confusing. Table next to us was having hard time deciphering how to order and asked for our advice seeing we just finished eating. It seems to be separated in many categories that appear to repeat yet it's not the same dish?...lol
Flavours were good but spice level was more catered to the non spicy food crowd. We ordered medium and it barely seemed mild to me and I am not a super spicy hot kinda gal when it comes to my food spicy levels. 
I would still go back but I've had much better Hakka food in Toronto.
