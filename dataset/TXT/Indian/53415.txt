VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Friday afternoon lunch. Yummy food, great service. The waitress saw us having problems with decision making and so she took her time to explain our options and helped us figure out what to get. We ended up with two split lunch specials and garlic and regular naan.
We ate lamb vindaloo, gobi manchurian, navratan korma, and chicken jalfrizi. Plus some awesome daal! 
Amazing lunch! Nicely decorated and clean dining area, outstanding service, scrumptious food.
