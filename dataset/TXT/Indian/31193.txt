kMgdZVLzAXM1JQwFsPXIlg Ordered the saag paneer and it was divine! Prob just as good if not better than Ghandi on Queen. They give you a proper amount of filling so totally worth the slightly higher price point. One roti feeds two people. Will definitely be back to try some of the other options. 

Also cash only.
