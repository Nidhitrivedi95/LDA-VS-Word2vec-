XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I love this place. The service is very good and the people extremely friendly. If you happen to come across Tibetan people eating here they may just ask you if you are enjoying the cuisine and make some recommendations. They have a really amazing beef sausage, some yummy dumplings that feel very much like home cooking, and some awesome beef noodles. If you like asian cuisine but are looking for something a little different, this place might just do the trick.
