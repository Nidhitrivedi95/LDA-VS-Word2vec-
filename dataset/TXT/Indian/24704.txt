h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw This was my very first time ordering from Prince of India.  I was a little nervous to submit my order because the reviews had been so mixed on Grub Hub.  Many had given 1-star calling the food tasteless and greasy.  However, I felt differently about the food...and boy was that a relief! 

I ordered the Fish Masala and Samosa Chaat.

I'd never had fish masala before: the fish was salmon, fresh salmon at that...and it was great!  I loved the sauce.  The salmon was cooked well and the portion was great.  Basmati rice was included.  The portion was so large that I couldn't really get to the samosa chaat.  However, I still managed to taste it.

The samosa chaat was not as high in my ratings.  I'm used to a cold chaat, or at least that's what I prefer.  The few times I've had it warm the yogurt was visible.  I'm not sure if the yogurt was mixed in or just absolutely missing.  I also don't see any crisps...unless they are mixed in and soggy.

I think that I may reorder the fish Marsala!  Time will tell about the samosa chaat...
