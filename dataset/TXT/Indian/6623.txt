483pQIBo1rxjZqms1s6V2Q High quality indian food. Period. My wife and I tried this place last night and it was delicious. Quality food is the main thing I want when I dine out, and The Everest does indian cuisine very well. Many indian restaurants have delicious sauces and curries, but they overcook the meat, especially when it is bite-sized in a curry. Everest's sauces jump out with flavor, and my lamb was still tender and juicy. My wife's chicken was moist. The fried starters were still moist and plump inside. Great job all around.

The restaurant seems to be empty when I go by, so if the vibe/atmostphere of a restaurant is a big deal to you, it's certainly not a popular place. The food? Delicious. Prices? Reasonable. We also brought our own bottle of wine, and they were happy to accommodate. Friendly service. I recommend you try it, as they deserve much more business than they seem to be getting.
