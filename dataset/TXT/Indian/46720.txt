t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg It's about time I write a review for Saffron.  My husband and I eat here so much that the waiter knows our drink orders and what we want to eat.  The place is really good, really! I used to frequent other Indian restaurants down by the strip until Saffron came along.  Not only does Saffron taste better than the other places in town, their prices are much more reasonable.  Best garlic naan ever!
