02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ The best Indian food in the valley hands down. Every time I go it nothing but the best, food service and price! The never skimp on spices like the other places do and everything is always just how you order it (mild, medium , spicy). I have been to England and India and this place is closest I have found. If India is a 10 this place is a 9.5!! Just go and make sure you have some mango ice cream for desert (it's unlike any you have ever had).
