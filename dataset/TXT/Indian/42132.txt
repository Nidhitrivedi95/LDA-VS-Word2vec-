qhKNZTtTT6GLnPzQny-v9Q Poor service, does not have any manners.  Typical don't care attitude.
Waited for 15 minutes at table.  it was Saturday night had customers at two tables and all three waiters were busy doing nothing, standing in a corner chit chatting.
Off course when the Manager or maybe owner asked them to go and take the order they even ignored him.
Maybe they were following the managers attitude.
Avoid, you will be better off eating at home.
