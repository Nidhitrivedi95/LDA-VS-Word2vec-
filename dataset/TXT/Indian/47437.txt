TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This place deserves the high ratings on Yelp. Tried this place because of Groupon and so glad we did.  Their condiments for the papadam were a bit too spicy for my kid. We like that we could customize the spiciness of our dishes from 1-10, we chose a 3 and it was on the spicier side of 3 but all delicious.  The Chicken tikka masala which is usually our favorite dish was very very good, well spiced and great over the rice.  The rice was very fluffy and did not clump.  The garlic naan was fantastic!  The Bindhi (okra) masala was very good as well. Great wait staff and a good experience.
