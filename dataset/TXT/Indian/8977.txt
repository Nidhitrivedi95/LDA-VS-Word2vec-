- lots of flavours (not bland)
- garlic naan and garlic rice are delicious
- veggie samosas appear to be made fresh using a puff pastry and have some good kick to them.

My favourite is the chicken tikka masala.
My girlfriend loves the channa masala.

I love the fact you tell them how spicy you want it.  That's how you know how fresh it's made.

Been here twice, and have done take-out once.  Consistently great!
Would definitely be going back.
