cNAyzZO_vX2Ib_sfkZdrLg I was looking for Indian vegetarian food and thought I would try Shri Bheemas. The fact that it is up a flight of stairs made me a bit apprehensive - I wasn't sure how good the ambience/decor would be. Surprisingly it is a great restaurant! The staff is very helpful. The paneer tikka I had was the best I have ever eaten in my life (no exaggeration) - and I have eaten Indian food for a few decades. You have to try it to understand what paneer tikka should taste like! I also tried the Kothu Parotta. I grew up in India but had never heard of this dish - it was quite good but also very spicy. To be fair, the menu said the dish would be spicy so trust the menu. Overall, a great experience. Again, the paneer tikka is out of this world. The chef should get a nobel prize or something.
