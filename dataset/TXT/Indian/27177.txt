Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Have not had food here yet but stumbled upon this place while hanging with my cousin that lives in Vegas as far walking down Fremont St.  Little did I know that they had a club thing going on at night.  It was $5 to get in and the drinks were cheap.  You can play toss the bean bag here.  They also offer bottle service, good music and a nice view of DTLV.  All for a minimal cost.  So far the best bang for the buck for those looking to save money while turning up in Vegas.  Parking is scattered around.  Watch your time in the parking lot because the parking mafia wastes NO TIME issuing tickets.
