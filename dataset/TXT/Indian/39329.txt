oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q Lollipop chicken was dry, way too sweet. Manchurian was gloopy in texture, and had enough garlic to kill a horse. Chilli chicken was comparable to licking your boots off after stepping in the mud and the price is as justified as the HST. HORRIBLE, Try it for yourself though maybe your tastes are different the place had a LINE OUT THE DOOR, so maybe it's just something I'm missing.
