QMB3hmb_Yv6Vk-HLiM2cdA I came here based on all the great Yelp reviews. It's a nice little place but I'm unsure if it's a five star place. The place was clean and the service was friendly. The food seemed healthy and nutritious but I wouldn't describe it as bursting with flavour. I think I remembered the curries being fairly watered down.

If I lived in the area it's a place I would consider going to. But I don't think I'd drive across town to get there.
