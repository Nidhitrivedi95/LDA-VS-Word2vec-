aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q I love this place! The food is delicious and filling! ! And the Naan bread is cooked fresh, and absolutely delicious! The couple that runs it are hands down the nicest, friendliest owners I have ever met! They put a lot of love and care into their food and their customer service too! If you aren't sure what you like, or what to get, they will let you try anything and everything! It's a great place for a good quick filling lunch outside of the ordinary typical lunch foods and also very affordable! Highly recommended! Try it! You are gonna love it!
