tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This is one of my most favorite restaurants by far! They are very reasonably priced for a buffet. If you've never tried Indian food before and want to give it a go, this is the best place. My favorite dish is the Tiki Masala, and the mango yogurt drink is amazing! I always wish my stomach is bigger when I go, so I can eat more. 
MAKE SURE you note the lunch hours before you go. I think they close shop at 2:30, then re-open for dinner at 5. 
The owners are very kind and all the staff is always friendly and very attentive, especially for a buffet restaurant.
