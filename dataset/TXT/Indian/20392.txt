FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ I had dinner here last night as part of a large vegetarian MeetUp group, so we were served a good selection of items from the menu. My personal favorites were the Tom Kha soup with tofu, the sweet potato curry and the squash curry. The sticky rice with banana dessert is just the right amount of sweetness at the end. Everyone at my table was very happy. I would definitely eat here again.
