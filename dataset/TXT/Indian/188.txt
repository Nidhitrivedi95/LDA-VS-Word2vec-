-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Best Indian food in AZ. Chicken Saag and the Butter Chicken was great, also their naan was beautiful. We love Indian food but haven't had much luck since moving from Utah. We decided to check this place out after seeing such good reviews on Yelp, and it didn't disappoint. The food will no doubt bring us back, but it must be said that the food was pricey ($13 without rice! Who doesn't include rice with their curry dishes?) and the atmosphere was sub par (could have used some Bollywood in the back ground ;) )  Perhaps we will order delivery next time. 

Food: 9/10 (Chicken Saag , butter chicken, and naan!) 
Service: 7/10 (attentive but not personal) 
Atmosphere: 4/10 (turn the music up.. Add decor) 
Price: 5/10 (make sure to use a Groupon)
