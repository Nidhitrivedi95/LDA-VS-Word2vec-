ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Lunch today at Copper was really good.  Parking was very convenient...no reservation required at this very popular restaurant.  Started out with a nice fresh salad...followed by the Amritsari Garlic Chicken appetizer.  Oh my goodness it was so good with the raita.  I had the Chettinad with chicken.  Oh so delicious and full of flavor.  It had a little hint of spice...and the chicken was cooked to perfection!  The lunch was served with rice and naan.  Service was very good!    I am looking forward to another trip to Copper very soon!!!
