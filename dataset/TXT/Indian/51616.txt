UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I am typically not a huge fan of Indian food, but this place has changed my mind.  The decor is very modern and the restaurant does not have that usual smell that comes with Indian cuisine.  The meal is buffet style, and although I was not certain what the items I was putting on my plate were- they all tasted yummy.  I especially loved the garlic naan bread with the sauces they provided.  So good!
