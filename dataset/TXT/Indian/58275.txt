YGYwfoDjTSqhnybVUaDT9w We came here with a group of 17. I was tasked with finding a Indian restaurant for our group and had read good things on tripadvisor of ronaq. They were very responsive via email and welcomed our large group. The restaurant is gorgeous and the food was excellent. Further more the service and presentation was top notch. I highly recommend giving them a try if you are in the mood for Indian. We tried so many wonderful things and many of the options are offered in smaller taste portions so you can really mix together a wonderful taste menu. I highly recommend this upscale hi-end restaurant.
