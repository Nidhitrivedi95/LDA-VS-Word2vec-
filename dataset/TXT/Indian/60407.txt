ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA My previous roommate took me to Passage to India almost two years ago and I was exceptionally impressed with the quality of food. Who cares about decor when you're getting the best Indian cuisine in the area? Much like that favorite diner in a small town or that hole in the wall in a city, it's a gem. If you go to a place like that and it's almost always packed and not a chain restaurant, you know it has to be good. 
I didn't make it back too often, but I found a menu I grabbed the first time I was there in my delivery box today. They deliver within a 5 mile radius and I count myself exceptionally lucky that I live within it.
 I ordered the Eelam Calamari ( I LOVE calamari) and it was actually better than my favorite Greek style. Also, I ordered the assorted bread basket  with enough variety and naan to last me a week. The Hydrabadi Keema (Minced lamb cooked in an authentic mogul style with fresh spices) was outstanding. 
I've never ordered delivery service from them, but it was perfect. 25 minutes for steaming hot, perfectly prepared food that in NO way disappoints. You can also order online. I have no idea why I didn't know they delivered sooner! I was always disappointed in my delivery options in the University area, until now. No more settling for Domino's or Wing Zone when I'm too tired to cook.
Between that and the International Market nearby, I can safely say I no longer have to eat crappy, unhealthy, tasteless food when I'm desperate and exhausted, but hungry. Passage to India is amazing. 
Also, if you're not afraid of (or thoroughly enjoy, like me) spicy food, get the Hydrabadi Keema spicy. Perfection.
