IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Today we went to lunch buffet in Indian cuisine.  The buffet open at 11 am but we have to wait 10-15 more minute due to the food buffet is not ready. 
The veg pokora and noodles taste is good  . Butter chicken need taste buttery ..I think to much tomato sauce. Chicken tandoori and fish pokora is need spice. Naan is so fresh and buttery taste ...is so good touch. 
But the store need fresh up touch, look really outdated . Overall $12.99 /person it to much .
