Unfortunately, our meals were just awful. Starting with the garlic naan and onion kulcha, both were greasy and off-tasting. The kulcha had grit in every bite, like the greens in it had not been thoroughly washed. The main courses were not much better. Tandoori chicken was over-cooked and dried out. It was tandoori spiced but we doubted that it was roasted in a tandoori oven as it lacked char. The chicken spinach tikka was overly salty and almost inedible. We threw out most of the food. This place has a great location and nice staff so I hope the food improves.
