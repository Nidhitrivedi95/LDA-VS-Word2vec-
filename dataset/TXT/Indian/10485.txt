9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw Ugh, frik this place. Honestly, their ratio of BS filler ingredients, i.e. potatoes & peas to the good stuff i.e. Paneer, chicken, Shrimp is flipping whack. I've been here twice and got MAD SHEISTED on chicken and paneer, yea, the rotis are big, but its 90% cheap shit like potatoes and 10% of the protein you should be paying for. Like, get the fuck outta here guys. First time I went here I got the butter chicken roti, and that shit was basically all potatoes ya,ll and I paid like 15 bucks for it? And the pieces of chicken were fucking little baby pieces that an infant would spit at and be like "What the shit is this shit ya fools?" So I held a grudge for a year and promised I would never go back.

Then yesterday I was walking by and the smell emanating from this place was too good to resist so I was like "OKAY BUTTER CHICKEN ROTI HERE IS YOUR SECOND CHANCE."

I went for the Mutter Paneer and asked them to "hold the potaties and make it saucy" and what I got was a FUCKING PEA ROTI. It was absurdly over packed with peas, like straight up exploding with peas, WHO WANTS TO EAT A FUCKING ROTI COMPRISED ENTIRELY OF FUCKING PEAS. It was an atrocity. And yet again, maybe a total of like 7 pieces of paneer.

The cook here is a sheister and this time I AM NEVER COMING BACK.
