tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I've recommended this place to friends several times.
First, being an Indian buffet, the atmosphere is unique and great.  There's a plenty of traditional dishes and being a buffet, you can try as many as you dare.  The decor is also good, with some nice booth seating, chandeliers, and a modern black-ceiling look.  It seems very authentically Indian, with mostly native Indian servers (one was even a turban-wearing Muslim) and Bollywood playing on their TV. There are a few reminders though that this is just a $10 per meal place though, like the cheesy Indian paintings and one or two handwritten signs over newer dishes.
I thought the food was good, but possibly a little heavy on the spices for my taste.  Other than that it was delicious.
The price may not be better than some nearby places if you're looking for lots of tasty food, but at only $10 dollars, I can't complain too much.
The service was fantastic!  They made me feel like I was the only one in the place.  Both my server and the owner stopped by to check in on me several times during my stay.
