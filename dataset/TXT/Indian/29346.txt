JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ This is definitely true authentic South Indian cuisine. I went this weekend with my friend who is Indian and we had a great time. The mango lassi is fresh and delicious, and the dosas are the traditional style which come to your table sitting 3 feet wide. Tons of fun to surprise our friends with who aren't used to foods extending past the end of their plates. :)

The spinach samosa starters were excellent, and I loved the dipping sauces that came with them. My boyfriend got the Malai Kofta and he really enjoyed it. I got the South Indian Thali because I really wanted to experience the most traditional form of the South Indian breakfast. The flavors were diverse and delicious, and the "dessert" bowl really hit the spot.

Like many places in this area, you don't go there for the ambiance, but rather the authenticity. The interior is very casual but the food is high quality (with many organic options) has zero trans fat and is served in the traditional way. 

They automatically add 18% gratuity for parties of 4 or more. I'm a good tipper, so it doesn't bother me. But they didn't tell us this (it's written on the menu) so we accidentally tipped double. I'm definitely not used to that policy starting at 4 people, usually 6. So just be aware. 

Don't forget to wash your hands after ordering and before you eat. It's the respectful thing to do.
