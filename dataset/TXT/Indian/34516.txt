MmwKWBBrR0NF05hGBxnWjA In short: Decent Indian take-out for a fair price. 

You can't go wrong with a small curry bowl combo (don't let the word "small" discourage you from ordering - you get A LOT of food). 

The curry bowls feature two heaping servings (I can vouch for the tofu butter and veggie curry) on a mound of rice with naan and a drink for under $10.
