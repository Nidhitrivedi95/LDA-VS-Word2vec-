Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I disagree with any bad comments on this place! Maybe the buffet isn't the greatest but in general buffets are never that good. All the food just sits around. 

On that note, Me and my boyfriend went and ate here about a week ago bc a friend I had in my summer class at UNLV worked here.  Although he wasn't there that night we went anyways and everyone was so nice.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  I completely disagree with the yelp from Sang whatever bc we ordered the Chicken tikka masala and it was awesome.  We also got the lamb vindaloo and the combo together was phenomenal.  The chicken tikka was so buttery and had a great flavor while the lamb vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat.  We had samosas of course and they were pretty good.  From my memory I've had better but everything else was delicious.  Our water was never empty and everyone was so nice.  We also had some dessert, a round cake like ball thing (dont know what its called) and some carrots.  Very good as well.  

The location is a little strange (I thought it was closed when we were going there) but they were open.  The atmosphere was great, the service was great, and the food was awesome.  The rest of the night me and my boyfriend kept saying how nice of a dinner that was and have been craving Indian food ever since! A+
