TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA came here for a lunch buffet, and i am a huge fan of indian food. Friend took me to one in squirrel hill and it was delicious but this was not the case here at tamarind.  I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem. Okay.. i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i'd consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet, that's a problem. 

c'mon its chicken tikka masala. make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself. this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel. 

the one star is there for the excellent service. who was also nice enough to leave his name, Martin (standup fellow) and number (i wouldn't be so cruel) on a napkin for our friend because she was cute as hell
