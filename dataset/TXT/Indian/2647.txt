02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I've been here regularly over the last at least 20 years (because I went to school with the kids of the owner) i love the lunch buffet but it is really hot or miss every day of the week depending on who the cook is. I've gone here multiple times a week to come to this conclusion. I love this place most of the time and I really recommend it most of the time.
