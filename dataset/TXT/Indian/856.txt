-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I love love love Indian food and this place is the best place in town to vegetarian variety. I actually grew up not to far from this grocery/cafe but I never knew until a recent trip to the adjacent Zia Records that the market also sold food and boy do I wish I could kick myself and go back in time lol the food is so flavorful and I recommend the Potato parartha and pretty much anything else on the menu, I can't stress enough how fantastic the food is!
