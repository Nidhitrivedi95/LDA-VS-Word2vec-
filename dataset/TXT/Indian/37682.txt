OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg Excellent overall experience. Quality of food is good. Variety is great. Assorted appetizer platter should be tried for first comers. 
Service can be a little on the down side if you are eating outside at the patio as I was today. But this was lunch time and there only seemed to be one person serving the guests. Likely to be a different case around dinner time. 
But certainly an excellent place, and great to talk since it does have a nice ambiance with a quiet atmosphere.
