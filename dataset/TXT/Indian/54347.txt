Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A Jaipur Junction is our new favorite stop for Indian food.  Hubby and I have eaten here twice now and both times were wrapped up in warm curry ginger lovin'.  My husband even ended his nine day juice cleanse with dinner at Jaipur Junction. (His stomach paid for it later, but he said it was worth it.)  

Between the two of us, we've savored the samosa platter, two kinds of naan, Kheema Parotha, Alu Gobi, Dhaba Chicken, Chicken Makhani, and the Maharaja Grill.  The portion sizes and flavors are satisfying.

The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is because the food is served on disposable plates with plastic utensils and the service can be slow.

I promise the food makes up for it.
