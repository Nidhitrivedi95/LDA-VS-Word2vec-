Would recommend this to anyone who likes good Indian food. It's not exactly as authentic as some places we've been to (Taj Mahal in Boise), but it's spicier and more authentic than most white boy / gringo style Indian buffets in the U.S.

EAT CURRIES AND SUCH TO ONE DAY BECOME INDIAN FOOD YOURSELF!!!
