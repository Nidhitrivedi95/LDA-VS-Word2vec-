ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ This place has good food but disastrous service. You need to be pushy here to get your food.  We had bad service everytime but keep on going so that says something about the dosa. 
For fun everytime we ask for the chili Bhaji cause they never have it. They always say we ran out. Lol
