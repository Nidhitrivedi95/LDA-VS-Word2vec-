SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg I came here with my boyfriend the other week.

We arrived at exactly 11am, so we were the very first people there. They probably didn't expect anyone to get there that early because when we came in, there wasn't anyone at the front counter for about 5 minutes. Which was okay because it allowed me to take a bunch of pictures of the place without them noticing, haha. 

The lady welcomed us in and gave us a really nice window seat. I thought it was pretty cool that they had window seats, not many places do. 

Once we sat down she took our drink orders. I ordered a coffee and my boyfriend ordered water. Then we went to grab some grub from the buffet. 

The buffet looked pretty small, but it had a pretty good variety. The only thing that was missing was some sort of curry with PANEER! I was surprised, I've never been to an Indian lunch buffet that didn't have paneer. I got over it though, and it actually worked out pretty well since I was able to try out new things instead of sticking to the usual paneer and rice. 

When we went back to our seats, the woman brought us our drinks. I wasn't very impressed with my coffee. It was extremely bitter and I couldn't really fix it. What did I expect though? I don't know why I ordered coffee at an Indian restaurant lol. I guess I just needed my caffeine fix since it was still before noon. 

I probably made about 3 trips to the buffet just trying out different things and I still didn't even get to try them all because I just got SO FULL! 

All in all, I enjoyed this place, it was nice and there weren't many people at all since it was a weekday morning. I bet it's a lot more cool at night since they seem to have a pretty neat light set up and all. Maybe I'll check it out at night next time :)
