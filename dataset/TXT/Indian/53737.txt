ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA Heads up, the second you enter, you will be enthusiastically greeted by Sunny, the owner. He's friendly and helpful and unnervingly good at the upsell- I spent significantly more than I'd planned without even thinking about it! But damn, he was right about that garlic naan...

For lunch, you have dine-in buffet or plate specials as your options- vegetarian plate is $10, non-veg is a buck more, both come with your choice of three courses (soup, app, entree), plus rice. I got one of each plate and basically made my own buffet at home, and there was more than enough food for three meals. Add on the naan, as the meals don't come with it, and a mango lassi for a special treat.

The soups weren't my thing- lentil was more brothy than usual and the tomato was on the boring side. The tandoori chicken app was a bit dry, but the chana samosa chaat was a flavorful favorite. The muttar paneer and the chicken tikka were both robust with great sauces, but neither came with the requested heat level. Overall, I enjoyed our meal but my guy thought it was pretty average. I might come back for the dine-in buffet, but their dinner prices a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I may have to come back for the lamb rogan josh though!

Props for having a nicely appointed interior- I am really hoping they do not utilize their patio seating to offer hookah, which became the focus of previous businesses in this location. Also, management should note that options available through their online ordering system are different from what is available on site- probably something to address to avoid an issue.
