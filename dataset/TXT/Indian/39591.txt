P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I gave the 3 stars for the food based on the price. Food is ok here and options are good. However, they can not have the hot or warm naan and everything which are fired taste bad! Services is not very good here. Asked for hot water more than twice, still gave me the cold water. They need more people!
