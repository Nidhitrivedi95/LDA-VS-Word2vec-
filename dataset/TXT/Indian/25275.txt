Food is bland, over priced and meals don't come with much.
Also never eat there. Music was skipping incessantly and the waiter sprayed pink stuff from a windex bottle all around the air in the restaurant when we were sitting there and it was all I could taste the whole time.

Really the worst experience ever.
