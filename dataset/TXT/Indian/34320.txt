MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ Darn it. The food here is so good; however, tonight we had the waiter from h%##. First he told my husband that the napkin goes on his lap, next my husband asked the difference between two dishes and the waiter directed him to the descirptions on the menu, but the straw that broke the camel's back was when he told our 5 year old to have a drink and relax. Whoa, What? Never again. We did complain to the manager, Mario, he was sorry but what could he do? Fire the guy, I hope he does. I won't go back until he does.
