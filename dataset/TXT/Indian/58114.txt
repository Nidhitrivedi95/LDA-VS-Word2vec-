yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Butter chicken was okay. Chicken Korma was okay as well. Wanted it spicy and it wasnt. The rice is rather dry. The rice pudding was delicious. The service was great. It just really didn't do it for me. I had a bit of a higher expectation but maybe I am being biased because I grew up with Indian friends. The garlic nan is amazing though. And the restaurant itself is a cute little place. Overall a 3/5. I would eat here again If I was in a rush and needed to order take out.
