nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw This was my first Indian experience in Madison, and honestly, I wasn't expecting much.

However, we were pleasantly surprised by their lunch buffet, which was a steal at ~$10. Their food wasn't the freshest, but that's to be expected from most buffet places. Their selection of food was decent, from samosas to chicken masala, from garlic naan to potato vindaloo, from saag paneer to rice pudding. 

The waitress also made sure we never went thirsty, immediately filling up our cups the moment someone took a drink. It was actually kinda disconcerting, but meh.
