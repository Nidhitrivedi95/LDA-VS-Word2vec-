RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Worst customer service ever!  Have never been much pleased with thier customer service but now it went from bad to unbearable.  

We were a group of 16 and agreed to wait for half an hour. When they finally called us a lady (think she is one of the owner) told us that each one of us had to be there to be seated and then decided to count us. I dnt understand how or why would we lie about the number of people eating!! And the way she was behaving it was soooo rude.  

When she took us to the table it was for 10 people! We were 16!! She showed us 4 more chair of which two were already occupied. The couple there just started. Thier foods were mostly untouched. 

When we asked she said we had to wait there for the couple to finish. So basically she was telling us to stand beside total stranger and wait for them finish thier dinner. WHAT!!!. Even the server for that section was embarrassed. But the owner/hostess kept making faces. SO RUDE!!!  Walked out and never returning. 

If there was a way to give negative star I would do it. A lot of amazing places on Gerrard for indian/Pakistani food. I strongly suggest avoiding this one.
