Food so good you can't believe it. Food so good you want to lick the plate. It has an extensive menu with a number of dishes that you don't normally find in Pittsburgh (you can see the menu at http://www.allmenus.com/pa/pittsburgh/294309-coriander-india-grill/menu). The menu includes a section of Goan specialties, a section of "Indian Chinese", a South Indian section with a variety of  dosa as well  as idli (steamed rice and lentil cakes) and vada (fried lentil donuts) all served with south indian sambal and chutney.  And then there are sections of vegetarian dishes, seafood, lamb and goat, chicken, tandoori, and rice dishes. Every section of the menu has something you've not seen on a local menu before. 
We wanted to order one of each, but had to settle for a couple of appetizers, a chili-cheese dosa and a goat curry.  The service was impeccable: polite, attentive, and quick without being rushed. The kind and friendly waiters kept an eye on us from a distance so that water was poured and food was produced just when we were ready for it.  And OMG, the food. was. spectacular.  All of the chutneys were exceptionally delicious; appetizers were perfectly cooked and attractively garnished; and then came the entrees. Best dosa ever. The rice pancake was huge - about 18 inches wide- delicate and crisp but meltingly soft inside. And the curry was excellent as well, plenty of meat in a sauce that was richly spiced and thick with deliciousness.  Unfortunately no room for dessert, but the dessert menu was also interesting.
