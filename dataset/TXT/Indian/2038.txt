_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg My husband and I just had lunch at this yummy buffet.  We have been  To at least eight different Indian buffets over the years, including two in Europe, and this is the best by far.  The butter chicken literally melts in your mouth.  Everything was tasty and the price was almost too little for this great food.  We will go back!
