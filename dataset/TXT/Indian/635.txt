-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q I love the lunch buffet at Mirch Masala and I'm so glad that it has reopened.  My husband and I go to many Indian restaurants in madison and this particular restaurant/chef is our favorite.  I find that their ingredients are fresher and better than some other places nearby.  My particular favorites are their goat curry, veggie noodles, tandoori chicken, and their sweet naan (peshawari) .  What I think sets this place apart are the slight alterations the chef makes to the usual dishes.  For example the palak paneer has more than just spinach in it, I think the chef puts in some leek too which I find quite surprising and pleasant.  Sometimes there is a slight bbq sauce in the tandoori chicken which is awesome.  It isn't the same as other traditionally Indian restaurants, perhaps due to the Nepalese influence.  I really appreciate what this chef/owner is doing with the food.  He was originally the chef of many known establishments, but saved his money up to get a place of his own where he can cook the food he wants and I respect that and hope this restaurant does well in this hidden location.
