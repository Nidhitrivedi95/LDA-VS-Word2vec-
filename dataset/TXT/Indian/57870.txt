yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw When you walk in, you feel like you are in India. I mean the plates, cups, and silver ware are all scary to eat off of. They are all metal and have dents and holes in them, making them seem dirty. The fork and silver ware was already placed on the table. I had to wipe off my fork before I used it. One thing that I warn is do not drink the water there. It tastes like it is fresh out of that man made Tempe man made beach. The server was an asian lady who kind of had an attitude. The food was ok and I hope that it is not the best Indian food in Phoenix. It's worth going to but it is very dirty and a bit scary. I wonder what the kitchen looks like?
