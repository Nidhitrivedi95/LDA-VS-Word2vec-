llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Soo many good things to say about here, they are an established restaurant, the cooks are actually Indian and know how to cook Indian food, the staff are super friendly and most importantly the BEST Indian food my husband and I have ever eaten(this is out of the 3 major cities we have lived in)  Good flavors and good selection.  Delicious.  Go soon, you won't regret it.
