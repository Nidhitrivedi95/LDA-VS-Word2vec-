NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw Got the lamb curry and butter chicken. Both were hands down the best I've tried in the city. 

However the naan was flat, rubbery and not the fluffy, delicious, sweet naan that most indian restaurants in the city have easily mastered (even though their curries aren't as delicious)...... This kinda ruined our meal for us.

The second deal breaker was the number of dead bugs in the window panes ... Looked like it hasn't been cleaned in years... Kinda ruined my appetite.  Lastly, the service was poor- we weren't really checked up on.

Verdict; great take out spot for curry and rice - naan and dine in experience wasn't so great.
