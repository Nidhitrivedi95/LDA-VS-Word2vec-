scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Haveli! This is one of my top favorite restaurants on Madison's west side. Of course, Indian restaurants are easier then most when you're looking for variety of vegan dishes. Haveli has wonderful choices and I've been pleased with the flavor and serving size every time I go in. 

I've only been to Haveli four times, but the waitstaff has already recognized me as a friendly vegan who needs a little guidance on which items on the buffet or menu Are definitely vegan. Today, I had the buffet with a friend and there was only one vegan item available. So the waiter had the cook create a custom-order dish for me in the kitchen at no extra charge. Thank you!!

A few other perks of Haveli... The atmosphere is simple, clean, and comfortable. Tables are spaced well so you won't feel like you're eavesdropping on conversations around you. Lot parking is free and always easy. A great cafe is a few doors down if you want a warm drink after dinner. Or, want a movie? The AMC is about 60 seconds away. 

Enjoy!
