f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg During our sole visit to Zafran, my wife and I were delighted to find this little restaurant full of a diverse crowd comprised of primarily middle eastern families who were seemingly regulars. While that enhanced our overall experience, what first seemed charming evolved into a "third world feel" restaurant-wise. Although the sanitary rating was a 91, it had the appearance of being much lower, made more conspicuous by the fact that it had only one very small, dingy unisex restroom near the kitchen. There also seemed to be no air conditioning which is can be quite distracting to us pampered Charlotteans.

Now, the owner was a very welcoming, amiable fellow who obviously had a real love for his craft. Following a 35 minute wait, the food itself arrived freshly prepared and authentic. We had the kabob mixed grill served with onions and peppers but had to order the naan as a side for $4.99. The servers were either too new to offer any advice about the extensive menu that we found quite challenging, or just unable to communicate in English.

Everything was tasty but we have been spoiled by the plethora of other Lebanese/middle eastern restaurants in Charlotte, namely Kabob Je Rotisserie.  It also attracts a diverse following but has also much better bread baked continually in a centrally located stone oven (and included in the price of an entree), much more appealing plating, presentation and atmosphere, and is a much better overall value.

In spite of its obvious popularity, we will not be returning to Zafran. Still, for those seeking an authentic, multi-cultural experience (sans A/C), it is definitely with a try!
