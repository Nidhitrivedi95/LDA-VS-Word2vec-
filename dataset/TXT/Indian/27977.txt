IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Just had dinner there with my wife, she gives it a 5, I give it a 3 so combined a 4.  Very good service, nice atmosphere.  I wanted a gyro sandwich, they don't make them on Friday and Saturday at dinner so I had the Gyro plate instead.  The meat was wonderful, the rice ok as was the salad.  My wife had the fescnjun which is roasted walnuts and pomegranate spread, she loved it.  The tazaki sauce was great just not much there.  We also had the humus appetizer which was very good and came with lots of sliced pita bread.  I should mention that my Gyro plate did not come with pita.  I had to ask and then it came sliced, not easy to make a pita with slices.
