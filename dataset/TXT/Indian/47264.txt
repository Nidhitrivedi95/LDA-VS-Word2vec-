TBHpa0OX9WnWdlrti-KBxQ Amazing food! My first time eating authentic Indian food. This place is the real deal! I loved it! So delicious! The menu has so much to choose from it takes a while to decide what to get...everything sounds good from the descriptions! I ordered the lamb biryani it was incredible! The lamb was so tender it melted in my mouth! The level of "heat" was perfect for me, I chose medium and it wasn't too spicy, it had just enough kick to it! The Basmati rice was cooked to perfection! The Naan (Indian bread)was so good I devoured it, which was not hard to do! Portions are HUGE, there is enough for two meals. No problem, you'll enjoy it again the next day! The service was excellent, the waiter was attentive to all our needs. He was very polite and professional. He allowed us to take our time and enjoy the meal. The restaurant dining room is very simple, not fancy. It is very clean. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. Basic attire/casual clothes are appropriate, no need to get dressed up in your best clothes. The food is not expensive, everything on the menu is under $20. Oh I will definitely return again and again!
