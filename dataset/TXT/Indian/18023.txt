ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ People's Indian Restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is fantastic (particularly the lunch buffet) and the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. And I should point out that the prices are incredibly reasonable - $9 for a high-quality lunch buffet is just great.
