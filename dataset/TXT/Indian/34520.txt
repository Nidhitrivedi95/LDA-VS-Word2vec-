MmwKWBBrR0NF05hGBxnWjA We went on the recommendation of a friend from India, who was part of our group.  He eats at Veda all the time and told us that it was A-OK.  Indeed it was!

I got a large curry bowl to go ($8).  There were three choices of rice for the bottom of the bowl and about six possible toppings -- you get to select two of those.  My lunch was copious, to say the least.

I agree that the eating area is not very uplifting.  We walked to another building with our takeout and enjoyed our lunches in peace and quiet.
