CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I ordered this for online delivery.  I would have given this 5 stars except the $30 minimum order was really steep.  Also, I requested 8pm delivery and they delivered it at 7:30 to the front desk and I luckily checked my voicemail at 8:10 when I was wondering where my food could be.  Why request a specific time if you're going to be 30 minutes off?  

The food however was DELICIOUS.  I ordered the butter chicken that was SO creamy and delicious, the chicken was juicy and it went perfectly with the garlic naan.  I also ordered the vegetable samosas.  They were literally the best samosas I have ever had.  The ingredients were extremely fresh inside and you can tell they do not use anything frozen.  I also ordered the Okra Milchi Pulav.  Unforunately I am so full I couldn't eat but a bite.  It was spicy and seemed good but I couldn't fully appreciate it.  it will be for leftovers!
