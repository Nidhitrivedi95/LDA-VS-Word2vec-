VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg We went for lunch yesterday and wanted to use a Groupon, but we had the dinner one instead. We both ordered from their lunch menu and got wraps. I got the Aloo Tikki (potatoes) which also had lettuce, onions, mint chutney and tamarind sauce. The menu didn't say this, but it also has mayonnaise in it. It wasn't horrible, but I would've preferred not having it. Overall it was great and their naan is really good. I look forward to trying more items for dinner, like their biryani and samosas.
