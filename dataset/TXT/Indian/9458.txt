8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I go to sitara Indian restaurant quite often. I love that place. Every time I go there I am never disappointed. I usually order samosas as an appetizer which I am in love with. Their chilli chicken is my another favorite item. You should give it a try. It's juicy and a little spiciness just does its magic. The chicken curry dish is simple and very tasty I get that with basmati rice. I am just very satisfied with the food, it's cozy ambience and cheerful staff. Must try place if you haven't !!
