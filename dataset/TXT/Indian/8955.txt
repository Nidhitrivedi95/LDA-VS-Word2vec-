8-4EI1VyBQsMEvScE4LEJw We found this restaurant on blogto.com's list of best Indian restaurants in Toronto.

The two of us ate
- the complementary tubular papadams,
- (veggie) samosas,
- daal bukhara (stewed black lentils),
- lamb masala,
- a side of rice and a rosemary naan,
- a lassi to wash it all down.

It was delicious, much higher quality than we normally find in restaurants. The location is in an area of shops that is a few blocks long but not excessively trendy...  I think this is why the prices were very reasonable, $23 per person after tax and tip.

The food was excellent... the samosas were light and fluffy, the sauces tasty and fresh, the rice was well-perfumed (including *two* kinds of cardamom), and the main dishes were frigging delicious. The naan was fantastic and freshly made, although I don't think the rosemary added much.

Good engineering: we have never seen papadams rolled in tubes before. Pretty fun presentation, and makes it easier to dip.

Bad engineering: the lassi was too thick to drink with the small-diameter straw they provided. We added a bit more water to it and then it was fine.
