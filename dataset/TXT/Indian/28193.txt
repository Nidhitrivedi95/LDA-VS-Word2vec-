iXGqaPR7ucNdwK-HapDnCw We were staying in one of the airport hotels and looking for a good meal nearby.  As luck would have it, the delivery man for Foccaccio was making a delivery to our hotel and gave us a discount card.  We were all glad we tried this place out.  My party of 4 all ordered different pastas (sauce and pasta).  We also had an order of garlic bread as an appetizer.  Everything was wonderful!  They also have an extensive wine list (though I only had a glass of the house wine which was very good).  Friendly service, excellent food, and a good value price-wise as well.  Don't let the location fool you.  They also seem to be upgrading the exterior.  We had a great meal. If you don't have a car, you can give them a call and they will deliver.
