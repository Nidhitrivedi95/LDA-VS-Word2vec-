t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I don't get over to the w side too often, but decided to go out of my way to try this place after spending a morning working @ Red Rock casino recently. 
No complaints about value- $12 lunch buffet in this town's pretty much the standard.
Pretty decent # of items offered too. Specifically, chicken tikka & korma, saag paneer, aloo ghobi, garlic naan were all good. I'll be back...
