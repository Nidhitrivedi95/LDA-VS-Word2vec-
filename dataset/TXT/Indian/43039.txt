RGhWcpC9hA2wvlWSjptxvg I've never had beef patties this good! Just so light and flaky and the filling is so good, creamy almost. Place gets a little packed and loud at times, but for $1.25 a patty it's totally worth it. 

Also the "spicy" beef patty isn't that spicy, feel free to add some hot sauce to kick it up a notch.
