PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q I find it amusing that my very first taste of Indian food was when I was 23 years old, and in Pittsburgh, of all places.  But I couldn't have picked a better place to pop that cherry because the first thing I noticed when I wandered into India Garden for lunch one day was all the accolades posted on the wall.  I've been here for the lunch buffet several times, and while I don't know from authentic when it comes to Indian food, I know that I loved it, and I've been enamored with Indian cuisine ever since.
