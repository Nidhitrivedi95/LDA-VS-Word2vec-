P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag The food is OK quality. However, the customer service is atrocious. I've waited multiple times for significantly longer times than what I was quoted over the phone and time and again I was told (...it'll be another 5 min..) which leads to a much longer wait. The least I expect is basic courtesy from the staff when they are way off but not at All India. Stay away...
