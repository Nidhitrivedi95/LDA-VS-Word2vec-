auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ We've been dining here on and off for a few years now and it's always very good, but today it was totally excellent!
The garlic naan bread was extra tasty, crisp, light and seasoned perfectly! It usually takes a few minutes for the bread to arrive, but they were spot on today and it was ready when we chose our items from the buffet. I am a big fan of the Samosas and they have them EVERY time, where as some other Indian buffets it's there if you are lucky. Every dish is prepared perfectly, the service is excellent!
The lunch buffet is the way to go, you get to choose from a variety of curries, chicken and vegetarian items. They have all the classic sauces and chutney to satisfy everyone from beginner to life long Indian food diners. The very left side of the buffet will have a few Indian desserts to complete your meal as well as some cool smooth yogurt to cool down a spicy dish.
Nice simple decor and they usually have some Bollywood music videos playing on the TV for added atmosphere. Lunch buffet is around $12 and you'll enjoy it much better than getting some greasy lunch somewhere else for about the same price.
We love it here and glad it's close by, no more driving all the way into town for Indian food and it's better here anyways! 5 Stars.
