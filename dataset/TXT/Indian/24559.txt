H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ The food is AMAZING. Just make sure you get it to-go because the service is absolutely horrible. I needed a drink and I made eye contact with my server for an awkward minute or two before he called another girl over to ask her why this customer was looking at him. She looked at him and shrugged. I never got my drink.
