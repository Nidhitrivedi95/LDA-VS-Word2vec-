ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w I've been going to Strats for 20 years. If you think its a "dive bar" you should have seen it back then. And frankly I think "dive bar" is going a bit far. The place has been renovated in the late-90's and since has remained fairly stable. Its not a cloth-on-tables type place but its also not as grungy as the Cadillac or Lee's Palace. I don't think "dive bar" is a fair representation. The food is generally good. Its good value for the money in terms of quality and quantity. Usually a relaxed and quiet atmosphere and a nice outdoor patio. There is an outdoor patio upstairs too that is heated in the winter for smokers. Stats has gone through many reno's and changes over the years to remain consistent with the needs of the neighbourhood. Back in the early '90s I used to play gigs at Strats when it was a "rock n roll bar" and later when they tried jazz. Later they got rid of the live music and focused on food. Regular bar food, mexican, italian and indian food - all decent. Great meeting place too.
