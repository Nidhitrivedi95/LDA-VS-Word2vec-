xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Doing an update on this resto for menu purposes.
Read my previous review as it hasn't really change much. Went here for lunch with my coworker and he ordered the fish soup and curry goat roti. He loved it and said that was the best 11 dollars he spent for lunch.

I ordered the chicken roti as they have 3.99 roti specials on Tuesdays.  I also ordered the doubles. The menu said it was 1.79 for veggie, 2.75 for meat. As I placed the order for my doubles she failed to mention that the shrimp would cost 4.95. They should put a sign saying shrimp is 4.95, so that people are aware

A little fyi would be great. Nonetheless I didn't bother to change it.
