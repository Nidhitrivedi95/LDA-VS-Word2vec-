ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Started with guns powder shrimps and we got 4 shrimps for 11$..that was ridiculous..but then we ordered chicken murgh malai which was yummy and also dessert gajar ka halwa with rabdi was delicious..

Overall food is good and awesome but prices are bit expensive.. please check out their Menu before you go :)
