I've wanted to try dosas since seeing a YouTube video on how to properly eat them (with your right hand only without utensils), and found the perfect place to try this out.

The menu has all sorts of dosas imagineable, with all your standard ingredients, right down to a Hakka fusion version with chow mein inside the hot flakey dosa crust.

I got the combo with one mild dosa, and one chilli dosa with potato filling, with four chutneys.  I found my favourites were the masala for spicy, and the coconut one for when I wanted something refreshing.  The dosas were excellent, and I was able to practice my one handed eating technique.  Afterwards I washed the meal down with a cup of masala tea which had a mild flavouring of masala.  

If only this place were not so far away, I would make this a regular go to place.
