P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA India Palace is by far one of the better Indian restaurants in Toronto.  The waiters are attentive as well as knowledgeable and  I received my food quickly.  I ordered the Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken along with some rice and naan (that free comes with any Tandoori dish order).  The generous portion of Butter Chicken was tangy and flavourful.  The Tandoori Chicken was delicious too and both dishes were perfectly complimented with the fresh Rice and Naan Bread.

The Decor also enhanced my dining experience along with the wonderful music playing in the background. I highly recommended India Palace for anyone looking for an Authentic Indian dining experience.
