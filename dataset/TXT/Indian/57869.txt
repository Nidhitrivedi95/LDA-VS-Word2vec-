yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Been twice to this place. The food is out of this world. We went yesterday and had the goat (which was the best thing we ate the first time), the chicken with spinach (upon recommendation of the waitress), the garlic naan and pistachio, cashew/almond naan, and the chickpeas. (I'm sorry for not remembering the Indian names of any plates.  Take your pick as to which tasted best.  This is delicious food. If you like Indian, I don't think you can find food better than this. And if you do, let me know where to go get it.
