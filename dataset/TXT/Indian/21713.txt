GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g I just tried Woodlands and it's too bad I didn't try it sooner! Being vegetarian, it is very nice to have a place that prepares only vegetarian dishes. The options on the menu are endless, and when I first looked at it, I wanted to order everything! I got the Palak Butter Masala and another dish (I can't remember the name) that consisted of curried chickpeas and came with a delicious puffy bread. The food was so delicious!  All of the sauces had a remarkable flavor! The Chai tea is also tasty! I would highly recommend this place.
