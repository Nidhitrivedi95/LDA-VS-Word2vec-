sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Delicious roti sold in rectangular aluminum containers.  It was almost like eating a lasagna with a roti bread texture instead.  This place has a small dining area and location as the store is easy to miss on Queen Street West.  If you do happen to eat inside there, be prepared to have their food odours stay with you after you leave, as the odours are absorbed on to your clothes, due to their open kitchen space and lack of air exhaust crammed up at this tiny location.  So in other words, just wear clothes that you don't like nor do you normally wear out in public if you eat inside here (e.g. a TAP OUT t-shirt, a 98 Degrees concert t-shirt) or take the food and have it to go.
