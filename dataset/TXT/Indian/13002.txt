b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw I recently dined here with a large group of friends and had an excellent experience. The updated restaurant looks great, the staff was very friendly, and most of all, the food was delicious! Everything that I tried I really liked, but I would recommend the Gobi 65, Punugalu balls, Methi Chicken, and Chicken Mughalai. Another great perk in my opinion, is that the restaurant is BYOB.
