UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This is my go to Indian spot. There are a lot of them in the area but this is definitely the best. I used to come here for the lunch buffet when I went to UNLV but now mostly for a nice dinner. The inside has had some renovations and it's very cozy and romantic. They have a modern bar area now but I don't ever see anyone sitting at it. My favorite dishes are the biryani, paneer tikka masala, rogan josh curry, and vindaloo. I love the paneer so much but the goat is also awesome. We tried the inferno paneer the last time we were there and that was not the best idea. Not sure how anyone is able to eat the curry. The flavor is not bad but you can't eat anything else after your tastebuds have been burned off. We love spicy food but this is next level uncomfortable. They also have a great beer selection!
