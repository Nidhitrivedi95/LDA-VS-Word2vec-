We called, the owner apologized and said he'd send over the food and a refund in about 25 minutes, which sounded great. Over 45 minutes later, the food still wasn't at our house and when we called to ask, the owner said that the money and not the food was on the way over, and that we had never asked for another order, and was extremely rude. Never ordering from here again.
