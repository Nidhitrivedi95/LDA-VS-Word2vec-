ai9r_wv56TPzwtrfUEPXTw We went for lunch to this place. Personnel were friendly. We ordered Biryani chicken and butter chicken with rice. Food quality and price is reasonable. It took more than I expected to get food, considering that we were only customers. Overall experience was good and I will go there again time to time. 
Note: If you are not hot food type of person order mild spicy.
