I popped in here yesterday with a friend to try out BCF's $9.99 lunch special. I went with the non-veggie option as I felt rather compelled to try their namesake dish. For the price, the lunch was a good sized portion. The naan wasn't spectacular, but it served its purpose. I thought the butter chicken was a wee bit on the generic side, but at least the chicken was tender. I did enjoy the channa the most. Our server was polite and attentive, and the small restaurant was comfortable. The food may not have wowed me, but it was still a pleasant lunch and well worth the $13 it cost.
