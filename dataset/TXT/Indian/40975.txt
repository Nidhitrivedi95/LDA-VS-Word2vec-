PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA It's a real shame this place is in the nasty old Riviera, because it really is as good as everyone says.

One of the things I hate about every other Indian restaurant I've been to in Vegas is that I always feel like I pay a lot and don't get a lot. Well, not here! The portions are ginormous -- a great value.

And the two dishes we ordered were fabulous. I can't wait to go back and try more! I just wish we didn't have to go to the Riviera to do it!

This would get 5 stars if I didn't have to sit in a nasty food court and eat their yummy food off of a paper plate.

If you can get over that, though...do it! It's worth it I promise.
