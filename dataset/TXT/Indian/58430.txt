yi1LdN8dBh3TLN1hTTOrGw Just had their lunch buffet, it was phenomenal! Definitely the best Indian buffet I have been to in the GTA. I cannot comment on their a la carte.. Yet. But I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great meal! The food was hot , fresh and full of flavor, staff was pleasant, and the price of $12.99 cannot be beat!
