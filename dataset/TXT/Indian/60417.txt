znc5ZpKCPANquABEm7SJuA Roti was hot and delicious! Came here late afternoon during the week to grab food to go. Got the curry chicken roti with callaloo. It was yummmmmy, paired it with a ting drink. It was conveniently located in the downtown area where I was staying. Food was well seasoned, hot, mostly meat not a lot of potato. Will definitely return during my next Toronto visit.
