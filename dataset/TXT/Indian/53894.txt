VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ My friends and I used to go to Guru Palace in a regular basis. We loved the food and the service for the longest time. Last time we visited we found many new surprises, the quality of the food went down, the service was no longer prompt and friendly, lastly the bill came with an 18% gratuity added. Furthermore when I paid there was an additional line for a tip. I am not a penny pincher, rather I am generous tipping, but please do not tell me how much and when to do it. I will not go to Guru Palace anymore.
