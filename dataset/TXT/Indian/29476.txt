Jq60uSolPAPJKXulKzyP4Q The best Indian food in the area.  Value and quality cannot be beat.  If you're looking for an upscale ambiance, then you might want to try elsewhere.  However, if it's delicious Indian food you're feeling, then definitely check this place out.  It might not look like much from the outside, but the food is very fresh.  And there is some waiting time if you're ordering roti, since the breads are made to order, but it's soooo worth it.  I always get the thali, including the shahi paneer, palak paneer, with garlic naan.  Deeelish!
