We popped in here as soon as it opened at 5pm on a Friday evening for a pre-theatre bite to eat. Our neighbours actually recommended this restaurant from their many trips up for the Edinburgh Fringe and we were chuffed we found it. 

All the tables were reserved ready for a busy eve, but there was one little table near the entrance of the door they could sit us at. 

It's a BYOB and only takes cash, but there is a cash point and a newsagent/offie across the road. 

We opted for the Mango lasse in the end which was scrumptious. The young chap waiting on our table was absolutely lovely  and happy to make recommendations. 

We decided to share an onion dosa as a starter and it was really yummy and a good alternative to the normal starters on offer. 

We had two veggie curries, rice and bread and had change from £30. 

Big groups started arriving and I would say it's a great place for groups to bring their own tipples and enjoy a reasonable and very tasty curry.
