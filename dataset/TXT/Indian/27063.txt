The menu is extensive enough yet not overwhelming. We had the Chicken Curry,  Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan. All entrées come with bottomless Basmati Rice. All were extremely flavorful with excellent texture. The medium heat is not real spicy so I would suggest the hot for those that like to feel it for a while after dinner. Our meal for 2,  with iced tea, was $40. Highly recommended!!!
