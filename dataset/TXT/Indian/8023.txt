75UxkzVhxzdyDvk75AljvQ I have used the shish mahal on numerous occasions but have always been pretty disappointed with their curries, especially the takeaway ones, the food doesnt have much flavour and the cartons half full, something they should remedy as they arent the cheapest! The restaurant is nice however and has a lovely ambience, although again food not much flavour, the staff are nice enough buut I wouldnt go out my way to go here
