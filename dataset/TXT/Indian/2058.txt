_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg Do not go here!  I can't tell you whether the food is good or not because I didn't even get that far. My boyfriend and I love Indian food and we were excited to try a new place.  The grocery store is situated in the front, with the restaurant in the back.  Upon entering,  I noticed the man at the register was CLIPPING HIS FINGERNAILS!!! This obviously made me concerned about the cleanliness of the establishment.  I quietly turned to my boyfriend and asked if he thought it was a good idea to eat there, but he said, "it's okay, let's just try it."  So I continued to the dining area and took a seat.  A lady came and asked if we wanted the buffet,  but we said no, and asked if we could see a menu.  She then looked at us like we were seriously inconveniencing her, and reluctantly went to get a menu, then started talking to the man who was clipping his nails.  At that point, we just got up and left.  DIRTY AND RUDE!
