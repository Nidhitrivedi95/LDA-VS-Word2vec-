TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Another bad visit. We used to go here a lot, years ago. But after renovation, it seemed like they became desperate for money. Prices went up, I guess to pay for all the upgrades. Things went downhill. Last visit, about two years ago, we were disgusted when the waiter tried to scam us on the bill. Believe me: it was not a misunderstanding. It was a trick. Every Indian restaurant serves rice with the (already overpriced) entrees. Not here. Waiter asked if we wanted rice; we said of course. But when we got the bill, they charged us for an expensive rice dish, not regular rice. So we did not go back all this time. Went back again now, same thing. Tried to charge us for papadum refill, which every other Indian restaurant serves complimentary, like bread. Then, asked us if we wanted peas in our rice, which was a sneaky way of trying to upsell us once again. Then, when I confronted the server, he didn't try to listen to me at all. He argued and defended their policy, and said that's just the way it is. Then he told me he is the manager! When I told him every other place will include rice, refill papadum, etc, he said they were number one in Las Vegas, and he did not care what other places were doing. Personally, I don't care if an entree costs $10, $20, whatever. If I order it, then I pay for it, and it was my choice. But I hate to be nickeled and dimed. And obviously, I don't want to be scammed. So, I would never go back. I will inform everyone I know what happened (I am a local). I will blog and Yelp and let the public know what they are doing (BE WARNED), and how management is treating customers. Mint and Mt. Everest are FAR better choices for Indian food in Las Vegas. Goodbye, India Palace. Never, ever again.
