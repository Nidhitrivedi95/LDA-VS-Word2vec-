ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I love Copper's lunch. Even though it's a bit of a trek from South Park, my coworkers and I will come every few weeks because it's that good. Lunch specials are very reasonable (around $10) and if you're in the curry variety, your meal will come with salad/soup, curry, rice, and naan. The portion is large enough that I can usually have enough for another meal. The servers are nice enough to pack away the curry, extra rice, and extra naan in a paper sack. It's pretty much the best.

I don't really like paying a premium for frou frou atmosphere, so I try to avoid Copper for dinner unless it's for a special occasion. This would be a great place for a first date with a more cultural spin though!
