H_DDpVqMjkJmwceBM5CcYQ Blech! three of us bought the general tao, chicken wings, mixed vegetable cantonese chow mein and it was all so bad; so disappointingly gross. The general tao chicken was still moving on my plate. One chunk grabbed my wrist and was like... "kill meee pleaaaase." so I slammed it into a to-go container so my cat could eat it later.  It didn't feel like I was chewing on chicken at all; honestly. The food looked very attractive but it was soo disturbing.  I gagged 4-6 times in front of my own grandmother.  I felt like I was on Fear Factor doing the 2nd challenge!  The worst part is that becuz there are so few Chinese food places in Pickering, people are tricked into thinking that spicy dragon is the best.  It breaks my heart.  The people next to us were like, "this food looks amazing but there must be something wrong with MY taste buds cuz I taste chipmunk."  I wanted to flip the table and say, NO! you're damn taste buds are fine!!
