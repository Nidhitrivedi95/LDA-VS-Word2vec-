uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA The atmosphere and the cleanliness of the take-out restaurant is beyond wonderful. The smell of fresh Indian herbs and sweets enlightens anyone's day. The workers are helpful and knowledgeable of all their products. We bought chili chicken, butter chicken and rice dish. Then several samosas and finally sweets! They were all delicious and very flavorful. 

I was a little disappointed that their chili chicken was not as spicy as I thought. Overall, the food was great and the ambiance is very calming.
