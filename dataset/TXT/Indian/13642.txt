bNXjo8axO89Xp5oiwLzbgw One star- for good customer service ! 

Myself and my hubby went to this place after travelling from Mississauga and took ttc from Main Street .. And ended up eating at this place as we were starving. Guess what, the food was horrible , 6 veg and 6 meat dishes .. I tried the veggie ones and my hubby did the others.. Can't express how bad the food was, tasted pretty bad , not even close to a North Indian tasting dish.. Rice was dried and had crispy taste to it..! 

We will definitely not be coming to this place again on gerrad St. 

Cheers!
