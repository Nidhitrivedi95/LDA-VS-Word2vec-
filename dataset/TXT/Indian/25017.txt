H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ This place is FANTASTIC! I had great Indian food in India, in London and in New York City -- this is on par with the best I have had, anywhere. The service was also excellent. The entire staff are working very hard to build a loyal following. I went today for the first time and I am taking an Indian friend tomorrow -- it was that good. And, save room for the desserts! This is not just my favorite Indian restaurant, it is one of my top three favorite restaurants in the Valley. Great job!!
