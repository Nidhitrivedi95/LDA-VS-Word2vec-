gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I don't know why it's taken me over 2yrs to review this place!!!

Simple put... It is THE BEST INDIAN FOOD I have ever had!

1. The food is just so flavorful, Hot, Abundant, and authentic! (50% or more of the place is full of Indian people eating here... So it must be authentic...right?!)

2. They are on top of filling your water! 

3. It's only 10.99 for all you can eat! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!! Come ON!

The owner always recognizes me and I probably come once a month. Some times 2x a week. Or have a dry spell of 3months. It just hits the spot, when you need to get in some great good that is unlike anything else. 

Love this place!
