t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Saffron Flavors of India is AMAZING!  This is the best Indian food!  Also this restaurant  is so clean and very special care is taken with the food.  The staff is so wonderful as well.  Simply put Saffron Flavors of India is simply the best!  I can't wait for the Curry Leaf to open up in downtown Las Vegas across from the container park.
These people know how to make great Indian food and are incredible restaurateurs
