X-sqtBx78QDbX8kVbqF-dg Pretty, cozy, and shining clean inside with a staff of just lovely, thoughtful, soft-spoken ladies. I was brought here by the ever-wise Krista M who never disappoints, so I just ordered one of whatever she was having. We kept it simple with the butter chicken thali and the flavours and textures were just perfect in both veg dishes and in the dreamy creamy butter chicken sauce. Perfect naan too, light and chewy and buttery and crispy all at the same time. Next time I'll come back for dosas and bring my own wine. Who's coming with me? =)
