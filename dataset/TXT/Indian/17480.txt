DrdhxvpwlZGhwF5vTR_QnA Our favourite Indian restaurant! Great vegetarian special, and we just had the veggie masala which was delish! Sag paneer, aloo ghabi, raita, samosas, naan all wonderful! Had issues with the online ordering (timed out and had to redo my order) and the delivery guy is a jerk. We stopped ordering for a while after the guy demanded a bigger tip, complaining that we lived far, which was bull. We tipped fairly. With tonight's delivery, the guy was trying to vie for a bigger tip again. Service at the resto is always good. Thought the owners should know that the delivery guy could cost them business.
