3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw I got the dinner Groupon. I think we paid $15 in total, including tax (not tip). For a dinner buffet, that's a good price, but I wouldn't pay full price for the dinner buffet here. 

There wasn't much of a variety, as a buffet. The meat that they had was basically stew, so much sauce and you had to look and scrape around to find some meat. If you're a vegetarian, definitely don't bother with this place. The vegetarian selection were spring rolls, rice and one entrée, I don't remember the dish, but you'd basically be better off paying for a vegetarian plate somewhere else. 

I thought it was cool that they had a band perform live, but I kinda felt sorry for them because there were only a few people that were in the restaurant. If anything, people were mostly at the bar. 

If you got the Groupon, cool. Other than that, I don't recommend this place. They food tasted fine and the service was ok, but for the cost that you're spending, you're better of going somewhere else.
