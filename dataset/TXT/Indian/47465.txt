TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw If I could give India Palace 100 stars I would. From customer service to quality of food to quantity of food I give them the HIGHEST rating and praise. But that's nothing. Here's the real review. I ordered a delivery order on possibly the worst day of the year; Rock and Roll Marathon. East to West travel was completely halted across Las Vegas Boulevard South; The Strip. Not knowing this at the time of my order, we ordered. A little while later, Roy, the manager called me to tell me that the roads were closed. But instead of giving up, Roy personally went miles out of the way to bring us our order. He didn't have to and frankly most managers would have just cancelled the order and moved on. Not Roy. He went WAY above and beyond the call of duty to fulfill the order. And don't ask me how he did it, but the order arrived piping hot and DELICIOUS. Oh, and let's not forget the icing on the cake, because the order took longer than expected, he refunded me 30% of my order. This is what I call customer service and also what I call my ONLY go to Indian restaurant. I HIGHLY recommend India Palace. Say hi to Roy for me.
