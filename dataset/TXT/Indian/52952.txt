v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug this is the worst indian restaurant experience  i had ever had. I was there to have dinner with a body of mine who came to visit me from florida. I took him to thus place and turned out to be a disaster. The wait staff was completely lost and barely spoke or understood english. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and by the time we drank the whole wine we were not even waited for appetizers. The couple sitting behind my table was complaining about their appetizer not being served after 50 minutes. finally when their appetizer came on the table , went right back to the kitchen with the complain of fish being very tasteless and salty.
 Finally a lady who did not even seem like a waitress and was dressed like in a house came and tried to wait on us . When i asked how long would it take for the appetizer, she replies in a  rude manner at least 30 minutes. I had no choice to leave after drinking a glass of red wine. 
 This experience is never forgiven or forgotten.I will never return to this place ever in my life nor recommend anybody about this place. My night with my buddy turned out to be a disaster .
