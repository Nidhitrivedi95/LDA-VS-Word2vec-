GdzCnx5OWURyklzTjaQIPw BEST BUTTER CHICKEN in the whole wide world!!

On our recent visit to Scotland, we stayed at Sheraton. Just as we stepped outside the hotel, we spotted this Indian restaurant, across the street.
We ordered Chicken Korma & Paratha for dinner. When the Chicken Korma arrived on the table, my husband asked the waiter for some hot sauce in order to spice up the dish,like most Indians would do. The waiter went back, and instead of the hot sauce, arrived a very polite & cordial gentleman - Alok Singh, the Manager of the restaurant. Seeing we are Indians who might not prefer a mild dish like Chicken Korma, which we had already ordered, he asked the waiter to take the Korma away from our table. He proactively offered to order a dish of Butter Chicken to us. We both were a little startled, embarrassed but definitely appreciated his gesture eventually. Great customer service indeed! Once the Butter Chicken arrived, not only did my husband NOT ask for any hot sauce this time, he heartily enjoyed the lip-smacking dish and inferred this is "the BEST Butter Chicken I have ever had"! He meant he had never even tasted anything close to this flavorful dish, even in any restaurant in India.

We couldn't help going back to Kama Sutra on the following night for dinner....and no prize for guessing - we ordered Cheese Naan & OF COURSE...... BUTTER CHICKEN!!! :)
