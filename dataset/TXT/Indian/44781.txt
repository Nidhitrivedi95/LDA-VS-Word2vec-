S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA I am obsessed with Gandhi's! The food is amazing, full of flavor and always filling. Not to mention the service is great. I rave about this place to everyone. Anytime we have a friend in town we take them here. My boyfriend and I make it a point to dine here at least once a month. I can never get enough of it. We have never been disappointed with the food or the service. If you don't live near the strip (we live 20 minutes away) it's worth the drive!
