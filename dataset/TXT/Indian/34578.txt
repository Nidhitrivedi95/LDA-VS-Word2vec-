Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Tamba offers buffet for lunch on week ends.  on my visit to las vegas i was for lunch in tamba. I am writing this review just to aware everyone that food was really worst, it was not at all fresh. By looking at that we can say that is almost one week backs food. I even got stomach upset because of that food.

So i just wanna suggest you that please think and take good decision if you want to go to indian restaurant in  las vegas,NV.
