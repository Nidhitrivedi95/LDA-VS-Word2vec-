XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Had a craving for roti and this place came up first with my yelp find! Totally recommend this place - it's within a short walking distance from me - always a plus! And when I arrived, there was a long line ahead of me - finally had my order taken after 5 mins, I was informed it would be a 15-min wait for a roti take out. I decided to wait seeing that there must be a reason the line up was long, and it didn't appear it was because of bad service.

Ah - the butter chicken roti - was worth the wait!!!!! Definitely will return many many times in the future :)
