OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I've been here once after planning my boyfriend's birthday. We wanted to try something different as neither of us had been to an Indian restaurant before so we chose to try Darbar. It's a hidden gem on St-Laurent ! I liked the concept & ambiance. I ordered the thali & tried their samosas and enjoyed both of them. Also tried one of their drinks, I really like it. Overall, I enjoyed my experience, good pricing and we would definitely go back.
