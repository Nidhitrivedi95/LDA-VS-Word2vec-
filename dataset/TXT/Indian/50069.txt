U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw This restaurant has among the friendliest and hardest working staff we have ever encountered. My glass of water was always filled quickly! Often before I could finish it.

The food was fantastic. Hot and fresh from the kitchen. The portions were great. A little more than enough person, but not quite enough for two, but obviously, that depends on your appetite.

The tables and cutlery were clean. I did not check the restroom. They accept Visa & MasterCard, but no American Express. There was plenty if parking in the lot outside.

Overall, a wonderful experience. It was highly recommended by friends, and we'll recommend it ourselves now.
