The biryani was tasty but not biryani by any stretch of the imagination. The chicken was chunks of chicken Tikka and the rice had green peppers, peas and sweet corn in it. The Lassi was watery and yucky. And it's hard to mess up yogurt and cucumber- so the raita was fine. The staff is friendly and the decor is nice, but I prefer the Curry Twist in the Junction Area. However today I found out they do not serve Biryani :(
