ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I enjoyed the meal for the most part, but it definitely didn't quell my Indian food cravings. I was left rather confused. 
I got :
Veg samosas, minimal complaints (the tamarind sauce and mint chutney had the consistency of water)
Malai kofta curry -medium spicy. This is what confused me - why on earth was the sauce sweet?? It tasted like they poured a bunch of sugar into it which I've never experienced. - perhaps that's because they also specialize in Indo-Chinese cuisine and that influence has made it's way into their curry? The Chinese in the South is notorious for being way too sweet... please don't let this affect all the Indian restaurants in Charlotte or I will be forced to move back to San Francisco. 
Garlic naan- it was okay
Veg Pualo - this was pretty good, something I never tried before
Gobi Mancurian - I loved the sauce - probably should stick to only ordering it in house though, was pretty soggy by the time it got here.
