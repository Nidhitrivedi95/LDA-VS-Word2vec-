PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ It is said to be the largest Indian buffet in North America and I have to admit its the largest and nicest looking Indian buffet I've been to. The place is huge with different sections, spacious for a very large crowd, food is quite exceptional (vegetarian, non-vegetarian, North and south Indian), ton of varieties, tasty, also have alcohol options. I have never been to any other place in North America that had a bigger menu than this place. They have everything, from appetizers, main courses, sweets, desserts, street food.
