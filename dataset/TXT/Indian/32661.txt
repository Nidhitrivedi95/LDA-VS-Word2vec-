LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Mmmm dosa... I went to guru lukshmi with my friend around 6pm and it was pretty packed.  We got the tomato dosa with aloo masala, dahi vada (lentil donuts in yogurt), and the vegetable spring masala dosa. SOOOOOO GOOD. Everything we ate was exploding with flavour and spices. The dahi vada was very interesting and tasty, very savoury with the herb infused yogurt and donut combination. The dosa is HUGE. You'll definitely be full after one order! The tomato dosa was delicious with all the different sauces to enjoy it with. The spring dosa was also really really good. Definitely recommend checking this place out if you're in the area (or not, it's worth the trek to come down to try this place out!) prices were quite reasonable as well for the amount of food you're being served.
