Go for the matar paneer or the saag paneer. The butter chicken is pretty decent but I go there for the matar paneer, which is basically paneer with peas and potatoes. So yummy! They raised their prices recently, which makes me not so happy, since their "restaurant" is still a hole in the wall on Queen West, and their food still looks like barf (but still tastes delicious).
