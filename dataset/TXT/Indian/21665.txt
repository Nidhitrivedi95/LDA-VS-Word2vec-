GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Woodlands reminds me of the Mysore Woodlands in Chicago up on Devon Street.  Casual atmosphere of ordering upon entering, disposable plates & containers, and no traditional server/waitress to deal with.  Food is among the best in Phoenix for South Indian Fare and prices are within reasonable ranges as well.  Staff was very friendly.

Location is on the NE corner of Ray & Rural, facing the west.
