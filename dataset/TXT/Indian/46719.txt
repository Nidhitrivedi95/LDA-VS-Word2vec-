So I was going home from this side of town, and I desired a bit of good eats to arrive home with.  Here's a shout-out to Yelp for leading me to this place.  I never would have stumbled across this tucked away place otherwise.

Even if I happened upon this establishment, I'm not even sure I would have guessed it to offer take-out.  There's enough class inside that I actually asked if they even did, and soon found out I would be one of three doing the same.  There is a separate dining area from the bar, but from the passersby, I guess it to have accommodated them nicely.  The bar area seems to have a full compliment, and the tender definitely seemed to know his way around it (not that I sampled).  I sat at one of the few bar tables and watched the television they had up.  I was very kindly offered water or soda while I waited for my order; a first for me when getting take-out.

After perusing the entire dinner menu, I settled on the Chicken Tikka Masala -- caught my eye as it brings together the joys of the tandoor (grill/oven) with curry.  Luckily the dish comes with rice, as you really don't get a lot for the money here.  What you do get is quality over quantity, but I'm a fan of both.  I was asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how spicy I wanted it.  After discussion that I'm a fan of a little heat, we concluded that I should try an 8.  Well, the 8 tickled some, and it was flavorful -- not just spicy for its own sake.  It certainly carried the graceful interplay of spices and textures of good Indian food.  It had an acceptable amount of chicken that was cooked to perfection.  Delish it was most definitely.
