OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg Delicious! I've ordered delivery from the Host through OrderIt.ca, and I've dined in, and each time the food has been great. The quality of ingredients can't be beat. From the creamy-delicious Butter Chicken to the pea-tastic Mattar Paneer, everything is fresh and cooked with care. The prices are rather steep, but typical of the neighborhood. This isn't your typical weeknight Indian dinner nosh; the Host takes the fancy up a notch with nice linens, dim lighting and a romantic atmosphere in which you can make goo-goo eyes at your date from across the table. 

It's nan-tastic!
