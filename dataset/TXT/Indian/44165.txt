RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Sadly the quality of the food has declined to the point where this is our last trip here. As well, although the long awaited building is done it's still too cold, we are sitting on plastic chairs at a plastic table eating with plastic utensils off styrofoam plates. I suspect an ownership change since the great days when we sat in an old burger place eating fun food.  I miss that place.
