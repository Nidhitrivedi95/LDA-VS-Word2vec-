aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Was looking for a place to eat lunch near work and passed by this place. Walked in, sat down and the server came over with menus. He asked if this was the first visit then went over the menu and explained some of their more popular items.

The presentation of the food was clean and served to the table on a plastic tray. Ordered the butter chicken egg wrap, it was spicy and that was about it. Was lacking the flavour and spices of a good butter chicken. The egg wrap was bland but held all the fillings well. After finishing the food, walked up to the front counter to pay. While waiting to pay, saw the cook scoop rice into a plastic container and put it in the microwave. Wasn't very impressed with that, not sure the quality of the other food after seeing that.

Overall, won't be back for the food.
