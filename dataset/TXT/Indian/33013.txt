llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Two stars, mostly for a kindly wait staff and cleanliness.  The food, unfortunately, was terrible.  My chicken tikka masala tasted exactly like chicken tenders in bbq sauce.  My husband ordered spicy lamb vindaloo, "I want to sweat!" he told the waitress, and what he got had no discernible spice whatsoever.  Won't be returning.
