_U9_mzobQzDQygH50NoxUw Great little place inside the multi-faith centre, across from the grad student pub at the University of Toronto. The curry bowl is a great deal, and a small is not small at all, it usually feeds me well for two lunches. What I like best is that they offer brown rice, and also that their curries have no secret wheat, they spice them well to a mid-range heat, and there is no overdoing it on oil and ghee so that the dishes are fairly light, or at least less greasy than you might be used to. My staple is the lentil/daal curry bowl, which usually comes with two curries, (I opt for a double-serving of the one). Note: Some of the religious student associations housed in this building won't allow beef curry to be prepared and sold here, so if you want to try Veda's madras, you'll have to walk over to their other location in the Engineering building toward the heart of campus. There are a couple of tables in this space, but needing to takeaway is to be expected. If you want a hearty, comforting, but not too heavy lunch for $7-ish, try Veda and see what you think.
