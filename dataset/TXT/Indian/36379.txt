NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg For my part, I love that the Chipotle model has spread to other forms of ethnic cuisine! To have options for quick-service food that is diverse and healthy is a wonderful thing and Choolah excels at this.

On our first visit earlier this week we tried two of the BBQ Plates: Lamb Meatballs and Vegetable Croquettes, with Naan and Chana Masala on the side. 

The Vegetable Croquettes (think a breaded dumpling of Samosa filling) were tasty, light and not at all greasy. The rice was perfectly done. The Naan was on the crispy side, but very tasty. The Chana Masala was as flavorful as I could have hoped. The sauces that came on the side were well-paired and full of flavor. 

Get the hot sauce on the side - it's great!

The interior, which also borrows heavily from the Chipotle model, is bright and modern. I loved the feature where you can see directly into the kitchen from the dining area. It's a fun touch! Plus, it is SPOTLESS in there!

I look forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. Choolah is a great option for a quick, affordable, healthy meal.
