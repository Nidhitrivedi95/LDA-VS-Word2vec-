hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw I've always seen this place when I drive by the area and was always hesitant to try it. My roommate whom is Indian both decided to give it a try, and I must say it was delicious! Definitely the Chicken Korma, it's too die for. There was no other customers when we were there, and it seemed like they did not have any business. Most of their business is through catering for the Casino's, etc...

They are only from 5-10pm, and it's a bit hot in there because they don't turn on the A/C. Other than that, I definitely be back!
