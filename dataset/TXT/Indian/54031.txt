VqNqJeYvNSv8lkH2EAnLAQ Great food! Everything was delicious. The samosa was amazing...crunchy and light with generous stuffing and mildly sweet sauce that I can eat with just anything. The chicken korma was great and loved their palak paneer and mango lassi. This is a real hidden gem, my new place to go to whenever I'm craving authentic Indian food. I'm giving 4 not 5 stars because the place lacks character and they need to work harder on their service.
