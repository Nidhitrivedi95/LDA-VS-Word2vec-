iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Visited for the first time yesterday. We moved to Phoenix from England 12 years ago and good Indian food has been one of the few things I have missed because other Indian restaurants we have tried in Phoenix never quite lived up to expectations. This restaurant did, the food was excellent and the service very good. We were there on a Wednesday evening and did not make a reservation but the manager warned us that if we wanted to eat there at the weekend we should definitely make a reservation. We will definitely be visiting again.
