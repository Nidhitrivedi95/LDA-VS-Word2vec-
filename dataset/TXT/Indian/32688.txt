LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Being a South Indian by heritage, I grew up eating idlis, dosas, and vadas fairly regularly. Going out to eat South Indian food never held much of an appeal...until Guru Lukshmi that is. Their service is very fast and helpful (true story: my extended family of ~10 eaters was incredibly impressed when a server managed to recite, from memory, the complete order of our party).  The ambience is more 'bustling' than refined, but let's be honest: you're here for the food and food alone. 

Absolutely everything we've tried to date is fantastic - from their appetizers, to dosas, to their lassis and filter coffee. What brings my family back time and time again is the unique flavours and combinations of their dosas. The only downside is its fairly remote location. Come here, you won't be disapointed.
