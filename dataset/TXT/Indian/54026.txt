VqNqJeYvNSv8lkH2EAnLAQ I have tried at least 3 times to come to this place and always closed. But not this time. I ordered lamb with 2 types of nan, while the wife ordered a set lunch dish. Everything was excellent esp. the nan. Garlic and sesame were mouth watering and I could have had just that. We will definitely e back for more.
