13GORSQlSE47HGQgBGmN1A We stopped by here only seeing an Ad in a local South Asian news paper. We were surprised by the quality of the food. We tried their Tandoori platter which was excellent. The vegetable rice pilaf (fried rice) was so good that we brought one order of rice home. The chicken tandoor was very tasty. We learned that they just opened few weeks ago and only thing they are missing now is the liquor license but they will soon get it - so if you want beer with your food wait a little bit or give them a call. We highly recommend this place for a great Indian food.
