BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ The place is brand new. We went there with a groupon, which was pretty nice. The prices are relatively fair, along the lines of 12$ for a Butter Chicken dinner, but you need to pay for Na'an and Rice, which would push the dinner cost to about 30$ each. Also, I made an appointment for 8 people, but they had it wrong and only put me down for 2. I don't know how that would happen. They did end up putting two tables together and made enough room for everyone. The dinner took quite a long time to come, I'm talking about 40 minutes or so. Note, that the restaurant was packed. It seemed everyone was there with groupons. The best part about this place is the food. It was delicious, and would love to try it again.

I also don't understand why they would move so close to their other franchise. If it was closer to my area, I would have probably visited again.
