UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Now I'm only giving this restaurant two stars because of service and the taste of there food. I'm from California and have been to many Indian restaurants from San Diego to the bay area. My aunt and uncles also own a couple of Indian restaurants and I've had Indian food when I've visited India so I know how the food should taste. I went to there lunch buffet which is ten dollars ( not a bad price for a buffet in Vegas). Now even though the price is low, that doesn't mean the quality of food should be low. When I went i noticed that the food was cold and that the containers in which they house re food were all open. This is very bad because that food is exposed to air and bacteria the entire time that the buffet is being served. The food also didn't have any flavor(the somasa were round and only had potatos, they were more like thick potato chips and the chicken tikka masala was very plain and didn't have any sweetness or spice). Indian food should be either spicy or somewhat sweet, it should never be flavorless. When it came time to pay, I had to wait ten minutes because the two guys at the register were on there cell phones and very slow to process my bill. I left them a 4 dollar tip and as I was leaving one of the workers says bye to me all while still on his cell phone, this in unacceptable customer service. If you want to try Indian food, I recommend you try some other place because there are many other Indian restaurants in Las Vegas
