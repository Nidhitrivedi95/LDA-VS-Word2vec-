gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA We randomly went to this place twice for dinner & lunch buffet while on the trip to Vegas.

Dinner:

We ordered Malai Kofta & Paneer tikka masala, and both were just awesome. In fact, Malai kofta was almost equivalent to the Indian taste.


Lunch buffet:
Everything was good in lunch buffet but I would strongly recommend their Saag Paneer, Goat Biryani (recommendation from friends) & Kheer. Naans were so soft & delicious.
