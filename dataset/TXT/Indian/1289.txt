-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg My boyfriend and I had the privilege to hear about this place while visiting friends in Pittsburgh. They said we HAD to go.

I have had Indian food hundreds of times, but this place....... I would give my cats favorite toy away to have this place closer to me.

We ordered the battered hot peppers as an appetizer, and it came with incredible dipping sauces. They were perfectly fried; not greasy. Super spicy. We knew we were in for the real deal right off the bat.

I ordered a creamy paneer yellow curry dish as my main meal, while the bf got channa masala. It was the BEST Indian food we have ever had.

We dream about this place. The service was incredible, and there were more Indian friends in the restaurant than anyone else. We knew that was also a good sign. Who better to know the food than the friends that have eaten this beautiful food for the majority of their lives?

I seriously can't wait until we go back. We spent around 55 bucks, but we ate like royalty. Way more than we normally would. We just couldn't stop. It was crazy.

Please, if you love Indian food, treat yourself. You have got to go here. Yes, it is kind of out of the way, but you will be really happy that you made the journey there, trust me.
