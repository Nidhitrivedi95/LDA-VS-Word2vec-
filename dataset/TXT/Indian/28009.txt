IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA I have been eating at Tasty Kabob for over 20 years.  It is, without question, my favorite restaurant in the Valley.  Homa and Hossein are wonderful and take great pride in what they do.  Over the past few years, I have invited several friends and co-workers to go with me and they all enjoy it as much as I do. 

As far as the food is concerned, I love the chicken kabob.  You will not find better chicken anywhere.  It is cooked to perfection, tender, and incredibly flavorful.  The lamb and filet are also phenomenal, cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  Their sandwiches are an amazing value and the hummus is amazing.  I have specific "go to" items usually involving chicken and rice (and I always get an extra rice to take home because it is that good).  After 20 years, and probably eating there at least once a week, I still crave Tasty Kabob.  

The restaurant is incredibly clean, well decorated, comfortable, but also classy.  The ambiance is perfect for a date.  They have a very nice patio, which you don't expect if you look at the front of the restaurant.  The staff is attentive and polite.  If you are looking for a unique restaurant, with a great atmosphere, impeccable food, and a good value, look no further.  Tasty Kabob is the place to go!
