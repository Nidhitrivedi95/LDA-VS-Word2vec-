o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I freaking love saffron I go for the chicken tikka masala made with extra love and affection from the forever fabulous owner. I'm gonna get mushy on you now. He puts all he has into making his food delicious and making you crave for more. I swear I wanted tikka masala everyday for two weeks straight. I'm usually served by Taylor which fails to get me my water with LEMON but she is a joy to talk to and knows what she is talking about. I wasn't impressed though. One time I came in and the co owner was there and bossing one of the waitresses around. It looked like she was about to cry. Very upsetting to me.
Over all it's a must eat place. I highly recommend Saffron if you have a hankering for some delicious (made with love) indian food.
