ZqmUmrXkwihgPFjMCYh_Mg Reasonable to mediocre food but extremely slow and inaccurate service. Ordered a dosa along with other non veg items. Butter chicken came with slivers of what tasted like tandoori chicken. Dosa arrived so late - the rest of the food was already consumed by the rest of the party. Sambhar arrived cold. Management needs to hire additional help, and train them better.
