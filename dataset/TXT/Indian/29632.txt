jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg I'm not real experienced in the field of indian food, but wow I left here happy!! I am a vegetarian and was always unsure if I'd really like indian food that much to go out and get it since it can be expensive, but I gave it a try and I'm glad I did.
My mom and I went here for lunch after the Scottsdale arts festival and no one else was there when we got there! As we were eating more people showed up though. They had some lunch specials that were reasonably priced so I decided to do that! I got a vegetarian sampler type thing for $11, my mom got a vegetarian curry and we shared. Our server did great, was attentive and served us well! I don't even know exactly what I got but dang everything was delicious! Was worried I wouldn't like some of it, but everything was excellent, paneer with spinach, lentils, vegetable curry, some kind of yogurt type sauce, rice, and naan. Everything was delicious! The naan was a little crispy and idk if it's supposed to be like that, but I enjoyed it. My mom loved hers too. Mine also came with a dessert and I wasn't too into it, but I just don't really like desserts like that. Was cool to try something new though. Glad I came here!
