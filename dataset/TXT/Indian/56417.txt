XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Garab, the owner of the restaurant is so friendly and kind. His restaurant makes some really yummy food. I recommend the Momos and the Chili chicken which was our favourite. Restaurant is Clean and the food is great. Would definitely return ! Prices are great and portions are big !!
