B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Perhaps I am being overly critical of Dhaba or perhaps their quality has slipped. My mother and I were craving Indian but didn't want to do the Swagat buffet so we decided to check out Dhaba. Of course every Indian restaurant has their 5 star dishes but I can sadly say that what we ordered wasn't 5 star quality. Was it edible for me yes, however, my mother stated multiple times that her beef masala was inedible. In fact, she stated that she had never tasted meat like that which was in the masala and even compared it to organ meat. After being extremely turned off by this I was reluctant to try it. However, I can tell you that my paneer masala was a solid 3 stars. The panner cubes were exactly as one might expect but the sauce to paneer ratio left much to be desired. That being said, the rice was perfect and the sauce was tasty. Was it the best masala that I have ever had? No, but it was far from the worst either.

In addition to having the entrees, the lunches were also served with a small soup or salad. We both opted for the lentil soup and a side order of cheese naan. Both were solid but nothing special. The lentil soup was bland but edible and the naan was a solid waste of calories.

For the $9 or $10 price tag per entree, Dhaba is definitely at the top of the Madison Indian food spectrum for lunch especially since even plain naan is extra. I happen to love Indian food quite a bit and often have to resist licking the bowl clean. However, Dhaba left much to be desired and I can say that I won't be going back with the better options around the Madison area.
