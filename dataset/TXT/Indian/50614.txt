UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I know little to nothing about Indian food.  I once mistook 'rogan josh' for Josh Rogan, someone how I assumed was related to Joe Rogan.  True story.  This being said, whatever type of Indian food Banjara has, authentic or not, I am buying.

The naan is fresh and yum.  It is a nice mixture of chewy, toasty, and deliciousy.  The veggie pakora is well textured and perfectly deep fried.  Butter chicken is a must.  Many others have been consumed, but if you read my first line, you'd realize that I can't remember all these food names. 

Tip: save $1.50 by opting for regular naan over garlic naan.  The taste difference is minimal, especially after submerging it in the butter chicken.   The overly packed (but free) parking lot is a nice touch too.
