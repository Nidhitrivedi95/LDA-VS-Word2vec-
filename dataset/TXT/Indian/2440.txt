02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Sorry guys, you definitely missed the mark on the vegan dishes. Bland, Dry, zero flavor and no sauce. Overcooked and just plain inedible. Vegan naan was a big let down. Wet and chewy. Dang, we really wanted to love this place but I've never had an Indian restaurant experience like this one. You get one star for the rice. Nailed it.
