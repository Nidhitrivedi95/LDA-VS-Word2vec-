7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Came here for lunch with two friends. Was excited to try it because of reviews. We were the only ones in the restaurant. 10 minutes later, a couple showed up for lunch. And that was it for the whole time we were there. Service was incredibly slow. We ordered a soda and it didn't show up until one of us got up to ask for it. Utensils were dirty. It took nearly an hour to get our food. The other table was served before ours. One of my friends ordered a shrimp dish. It came on a hot plate with salad as the base. Who puts fresh salad on a hot plate?? Shrimp with wilted salad...do you know how much it cost? $25! I ordered chickpeas and a veggie dish. Meh. Let me tell you, I adore Indian food and cook it myself. I will not eat here again nor recommend it to anyone.
