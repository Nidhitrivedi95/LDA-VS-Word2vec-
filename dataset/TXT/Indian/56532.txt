xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw Went here for carry out because of great reviews on Yelp. This place is right near Thistledown Racino, so the area is a little sketchy. When I called to order at 5:15, I was told that it would be ready at 6:30 which surprised me. The owner explained that everything is made completely from scratch. He revised the time to 6:15. It was ready at about 6:25. But it was worth the wait. The samosas were perfect- crunchy on the outside, and very tasty inside. Malai Kofta was not what I expected. Everywhere else they are heavy and made of chick peas. Here, they were lighter and made mostly of paneer. Sauce was a bit different as well, with wonderful flavor and very unique spices. Chicken Tikka Masala likewise was unlike any we had ever had before, but perfectly spiced. I was not asked the spice level, but I would call it medium to medium hot. But it was no heat for the sake of heat. Just really tasty. The only thing I didn't care for was the bread. They don't have naan. We got parathi, and I think I just don't care for it. We will definitely be back again. If there were 4.5 stars, I'd go for that but I had to take something off for the bread and the location.
