hp1qK1gOvYRdhhBQsE-zLg This place opened up recently and while it has promise I think this place needs some refinements. We ordered three of the veg mains and although the descriptions indicated that they all had different base sauces, they all tasted exactly the same. I think they just use the same sauce for everything or at least the veg dishes. The dishes tasted ok but were too similar. Very one note and disappointing. I also think canned mushrooms were used in the mushroom dish.
Its more like a 2.5. I will try again and hopefully there will be some improvements.
