bNXjo8axO89Xp5oiwLzbgw Had the Lunch Buffet today.   Food was fresh and tasty.  They brought us fresh tandoori chicken, naan, and rice to the table, on top of a great selection at the hot table. Nice spice. They don't have a proper tandoor oven, but very few in the city do. Only Trimurti, Banjara, and Aroma that I am aware of. So although the butter chicken was delicious, It didn't have that juicy on the in inside, charred on the outside texture/flavour.  You won't be disappointed.
