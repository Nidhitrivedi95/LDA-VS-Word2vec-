yOi6Lrcm9EnbVxMj0lNSnQ This place is pretty good, and their service is great. I've been here a few times, and I feel that the quality of the naan has dropped a bit, but the food is actually quite good, and very flavorful. The can really increase the spice level if you request it!

The quality is not too bad either, however, their meat portions aren't very hearty, however their service is amazing! The servers are very attentive.

It can get a bit pricey, even for a modest outing though (about $20-35 per person), but good place to check out.
