TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I'd say the food was very good and the service was excellent. They had two yelp deals going and we were able to use both of them with no problem. The chicken masala was very good, though a little on the salty side, and the chicken sagwala was also good but could have used a little more flavor. The mango lassi and paratha were both top notch. That said, neither of us were disappointed and I'd definitely come back here.
