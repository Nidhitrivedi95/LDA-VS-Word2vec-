NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Why hasn't Choolaah come to NY yet?! The concept of Indian fast food is genius, and the food here is delicious for both the price and the speed it came out in (my meal came out in just two minutes!).

My boyfriend and I shared a side of samosa chaat and customized our own BBQ bowl, which included large chunks of paneer cheese, brown basmati rice, rich tikka masala sauce and a side of naan. Although Americanized, everything was full of flavor. If you aren't interested in their signature BBQ bowls, you can also order biryani, salads, tandoori wraps, various sides, and desserts. The restaurant also has some classic Indian beverages - I had the "Choolaah Chai" tea, which was good but needed a stronger masala spice flavor in it. My boyfriend had a mango lassi, which he loved but said was very filling.

On top of the food, Choolaah's interior is bright and clean with a great open concept - you can even watch employees baking naan and cooking tandoori through the large glass windows in the front, which is always fun.
