TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA Had the Chicken Tikka Masala. It was good, although I definitely wish it could have been spicier, or that we were given the option to make it more or less spicy. I tried my friend's Tandoori chicken, and that was disappointingly dry, which was weird because my chicken basically fell apart when I poked at it with my fork. 

For some weird reason, the music that was playing seemed like a mix-tape of someone who was tripping pretty hard on acid while doing hot yoga. Not too keen on that, but, you know, don't sweat the small stuff. The rest of the place seemed pretty cool. 

My friend asked about the private rooms upstairs, and the waitress said that it seats 40 people, if anybody is interested in that. 

Portions are pretty decent, but definitely a little expensive for a poor college student like myself. I will most definitely be back during the wednesday night college specials (BOGO w/ student ID).
