tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA 10 dollar dinner buffet. It was a pretty decent buffet and the food tasted really great. There wasn't anything that I didn't like and a few dishes that were binge eating worthy. I like the tandoori and the chicken curry. The staff was friendly too and very Attentive. Never an empty glass of water and every few minutes, someone walks around offering more and more naan!
