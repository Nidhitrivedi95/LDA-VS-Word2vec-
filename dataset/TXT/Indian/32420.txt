LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw My first impression was this store is a mess... finding a halal butcher in Pittsburgh is a pain... seems like this is the only option I've had.. some product are expired (again, watch out the ED!!)  The people working here was not nice.. I don't understand why they are mean.. well, at least one of them, not all of them. the quality of the meats is okay, just a bit pricey compare to what I have back in Houston. I hope I have had better luck next time.. or.. I hope I will find another halal butcher...
