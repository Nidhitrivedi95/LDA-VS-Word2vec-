gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Ruchi is our go-to spot for Indian lunch buffets. There are Indian restaurants closer to our house, but Ruchi is our favorite and worth the trip. It's 100% vegetarian and probably 90% vegan. 

The items on the buffet vary, so it's a great way to try new things. They always have a few staples like channa masala or dal. There's always something great and we come away stuffed.

The heat level ranges from very mild to extra spicy, depending on the dish. The buffet makes it easy to try a sampler first, then go back for the ones that suit you. The buffet also comes with dosa. The ones we had today were a little sub par (potatoes weren't cooked well) but are a nice mild palate cleanser between spicy dishes. 

Another highlight is the wide variety of vegan chutneys. The mint chutney is my favorite. 

They also have an interesting variety of desserts on the buffet. Usually about half of them are vegan, which is a nice change from most places.

The service is always spot on. A regular flow of ice water is required, and they are always on it! Sometimes the A/C needs to be cooler, but that could also be because of the heat in the food.
