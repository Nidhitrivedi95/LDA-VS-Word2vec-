_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Was in the mood for Indian food but wanted to stay close to my hotel (Marriott Eaton Center). 

Ordered: butter chicken, saag paneer, garlic naan and a mango lassi.

Server brought out my entrees before my naan..

 I asked to have my food packed up but then after a while (after I had my to-go bag), I had to explicitly ask to get my check...

Food is good but service could use some improvement for an overall better experience.
