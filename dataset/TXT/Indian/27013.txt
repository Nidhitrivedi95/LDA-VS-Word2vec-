iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA My fiancée and I must easily have spent over 10,000 dollars worth of food throughout all of the many, many, many, times we have been to this place! Marigold Maison is easily my favorite restaurant of all times. We've been coming here actually when they were at a different location with a different name many years ago, and it's been awesome to follow their changes and growth, and they still have us coming back!! The chef is wowwwwwww, he does some magic with his hands! The seasonings, the flavorings, everything is fresh and made right there, you can literally watch them make your food, and it tastes so so so good. My favorite thing to get is the tandoori style salmon with naan bread and I could eat it almost everyday it tastes so freaking good. Their sauces are spectacular, the staff is super cool and friendly, we've gotten quite acquainted with them since we go there so regularly, and they are just good genuine people which makes going there even better. I recommend this place for everyone, even if you feel like it's not your typical style of food, it is definitely worth trying!
