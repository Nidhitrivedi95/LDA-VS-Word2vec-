9EsW_emJj-4IW2Y48Jmb-A I was introduced to dosa a couple of years ago by a really good friend of mine, it was love at first bite (yes, I know that is a cheesy thing to say but seriously, love it!) I started out at the famous Guru Lukshmi, which was great but a little crowded for my taste. Even though we love dosa my friends and I were searching for something a little smaller but equally as good and ta-da! Found it! I usually get the paneer dosa, even though I am lactose intolerant..it's just worth it. It's light, crisp and oh, so good! I have also had idly from here and while it is not as good as the dosa, it is still really flavorful and wonderful. There isn't usually a lot of people inside the actual restaurant, as this place seems more of an order out kind-of deal but I always stay and enjoy the company of my guests. I have brought three different friends and even recommended Yarl Dosa Corner to some American friends who had never even heard of dosa. Everyone always raves about the food afterwards and that makes me really happy! The only complaint I have is that the volume of their television needs to be turned down a bit, it was really deafening the last time I came in.
