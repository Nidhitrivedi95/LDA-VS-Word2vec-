LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Unbelievably fantastic dosas!! These are authentic Mumbai style dosas and the best I've eaten outside of India. 
The chettinad dosa with potato filling and be sure to get any dosa you get here at a 100% spice level unless you can't stand spicy food at all.
The butter plain dosa with potato filling is a solid fail safe choose too as is their rava masala. Those are always a win. 

The condiments that come with the entrees - rasam, sambhar, chutneys are all exceptional.

Lastly, the idli's and vada's are a good choice for appetizers.

I took away one star because the service is sub par on a good day - but who cares when the food is fantastic!
