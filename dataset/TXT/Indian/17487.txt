DrdhxvpwlZGhwF5vTR_QnA This would be passable Indian food for a penguin. It's a tad more flavourful than frozen water. This place is unfortunately quite subpar. I had a vegetarian thali (prix-fixe tasting platter) which included dal (lentils) & sag paneer (spinach with homemade Indian cheese)  & mixed vegetables served with plain nan (flatbread) with rice. Nothing was good at all. You know how black is the absence of colour ... this food is the absence of flavour. The dal was the most flavourful dish out of the whole lot. They put a single clove of garlic in a sixty litre vat with a spitting of some cumin and that's it that's all. The spinach and cheese was bland as bland can be. It wouldn't have surprised me if they'd probably had put some cold British mushy peas on a plate with some curry powder and call it Indian cuisine. Really really really bland. The mixed vegetables were also bland and were probably sprinkled with some yellow (hopefully turmeric and not FD&C Yellow number 5) colour. 

I think this is one of those typical shitty Montréal Indian restos where they dumb down the flavour to cater to a less experienced and less sophisticated and less worldly palate.  " Vive le Québec ennuyeux " This is Indian food for penguins. The most pungent flavours at this place are salt and ketchup. 

For good northern Indian food go to Pushap on Paré and for good southern Indian food go to Thanjai on VanHorne.
