LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA The reservation/seating attendants were not organized. The waiting room was very clustered and so were the workers. The mango lassi is way toooo sweet and taste like purée straight from the can. 

Our waitress didn't come to take our order for a good 20 minutes. Then she never came back until the end to give our bill. The waiters are all running around like crazy people and you can't enjoy your meal properly. One of the waiters hit me in the back of the head with their tray. 

The chaat dosa was great - highly recommend it. 
However, the Rava dosa was not up to par. It took way tooo long to prepare. It was moist and soggy while it should be crispy and thin
