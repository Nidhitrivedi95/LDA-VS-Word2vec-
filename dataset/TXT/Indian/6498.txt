3quopZyL8WuqVFfsCi0z2A I came here with my family for Family day based on yelp reviews. The interior was beautiful, it was like a hidden gem because on the outside it didn't look like much!

We ordered the non-veg mixed appetizer. It came with a samosa, fish, potato and onion cutlet. My most favourite from this platter was the fish! Definetly will be ordering the fish individually as an apetizer next time!

For the main, we wanted to try a bit of everything that looked good. We ordered the chicken bruiyani, butter chicken, chicken vidaloo, butter naan and chicken kabob. The chicken bruiyani and the chicken vidaloo stood out! The chicken bruiyani was very good with the right amount of spice and flavour! The chicken vidaloo had a hint of sour and it was so flavourful. The butter chicken was really good too! Didn't taste too much like tomatoes like in other indisn restaraunts and i loved that! The butter naan was nice and soft and very buttery! Lastly, the chicken kabob was the only item that was a miss today. It was very tough and tasted like sausage, it said it has cottage cheese but I didn't taste it and it was nowhere to be found. The only thing good about it was the presentation. All the portions were plentiful, for the 4 of us we had to take leftovers home for all the dishes!

Lastly for dessert we ordered the pistachio kulfi! This was a nice ending to our heavy fulfilling meal! It had the right amount of sweetness, it was very good! I just don't get why they put so much rose water, not a big fan of rose water! We also had the mango lassie which had a strong flavour of rose watet so it was not a favourite. Overall a great experience with great food and freat customer service as it was packed and there was only on waiter and he did a great job, definitely will be coming back!
