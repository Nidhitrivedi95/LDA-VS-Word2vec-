bumAFxitMRHKAxZMijvUYg I went to a party recently that had their food catered from Cuisine of India.  I can't comment on the prices but the food was amazing.  I liked all the appetizers and mains especially the Chicken Tikka and Butter Chicken.  My sister-in-law had ordered from here and requested that all the main dishes to be mild or non-spicy.  For me it was perfect but my husband who can't handle spicy food was only able to eat the Butter Chicken & Beef Masaladar.  For the first time, my husband actually enjoyed Indian food because there were dishes that was actually not too spicy.  A lot of times at Indian restaurants, when we ask for non spicy it is still too spicy.  We really enjoyed the Butter Chicken which I plan to order soon for a holiday party coming up in December.  There was also an eggplant dish called Baigan Patiala that was also delicious but it was pretty spicy.  I might order it for my party and see if I can get this dish to be non-spicy.  I'll update this review when I get the full experience of ordering the dishes myself but the food was definitely really good.
