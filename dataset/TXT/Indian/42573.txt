r8wqayijZLPd7XPuypLayA It was my first time trying Indian food and wasn't disappointed at all!!  My boyfriend suggested I start with the lentil soup and it was bomb. No complaints. For the main dish we got a thali of curry chicken lentils rice and salad.  The chicken was amazingly tender well cooked the lentils with the naan bread delicious and the bread is amazing great texture not dry and soft.
