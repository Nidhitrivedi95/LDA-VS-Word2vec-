Why have I never been here before! We tried a couple different dishes....chicken tikka.....mixed tandoor....garlic shrimp....but the best dish was the Sea Bass (it had a fancy name I can't remember but is under chef's specialties)....some dishes came with rice and we ordered garlic naan!
We will be back and order from here for take out m!
So good!!!!
