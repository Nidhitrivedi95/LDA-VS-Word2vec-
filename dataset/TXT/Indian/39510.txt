P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag Went to All India with a friend who was in town and staying nearby. Luckily since it was Pitt's spring break, we easily found a spot on one of the side streets. I've since heard that there is a small lot behind the building, so maybe can park there next time.

There was only one other table filled when we showed up on a Monday evening, and after they left, only one other group came and we were there a little over 2 hours. I thought a buffet would be a good place to catch up with my friend since we wouldn't feel like we were keeping waitstaff from a paying table like at a restaurant. I didn't expect it to be that empty though. We were done eating after probably 45 minutes-1 hr, but the waitress kept our water cups filled and let us take our time chatting. We didn't feel rushed at all and she brought our check when we decided we were ready for it.

Not the best Indian restaurant, but the buffet is pretty big with a ton of vegetarian options. We loved the manchurian mushrooms. I liked that there were a bunch of dishes that I've never seen at Indian buffets before.I thought the food was good and didn't taste dried out, or like it had been sitting on the buffet too long. We saw them changing out dishes while we were there.

I've defintiely had better Indian food at other places, but like the choices this buffet offers, and it's close, so really easy for us to get to. I'd defintiely go back.
