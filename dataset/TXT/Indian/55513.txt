x1GM1mzeDx4ARUGKV8n98Q Ate lunch here on our arrival in Cave Creek. Told our friend who lives there we wanted real Mexican food, so he took us here. The taco's were amazing, shells were made fresh for each order, salsa was different then we are use to but very good  Guacamole was great!. It could be easy to pass by this place as it is very unassuming. But you'd miss great food and a very casual atmosphere. A local gem!
