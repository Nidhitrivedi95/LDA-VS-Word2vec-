8-4EI1VyBQsMEvScE4LEJw Food is passable nothing special. However, the service left a lot to be desired. Been there a couple of times but one incident stands out. The host refused to seat our group of 3 (although a larger table was available) and also refused to provide us with any time frame within which a table could be arranged. Will not go there again, or recommend the place. There are better places serving indian food in toronto and any service is better than copper chimney
