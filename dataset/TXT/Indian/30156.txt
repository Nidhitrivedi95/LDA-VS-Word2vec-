JziBbXfW_SRE8hAV9vzq8A So happy to discover a new spot in the area.  There was a good variety of salads, bowls, appetizers, and main dishes to choose from on the menu.  As a picky eater, the restaurant was vegetarian friendly and had several healthier options.  The menu is also sharing-friendly so my friend and I got to try a few dishes!  I definitely recommend the quinoa onion rings :)  They also give you a mini mango shake when you sit down which was a nice touch.
The tip is included which I thought was an interesting approach.
