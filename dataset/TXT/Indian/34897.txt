Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Every time I go to Vegas, I get really excited because I know I'll be shoving delicious food from Tamba into my gullet.  Most people get excited about Vegas because of the debauchery they are about to partake in.....yes, yes, that's all good and well done, but aside from my roulette high, TAMBA is why I sing Viva Las Vegas!

Go for the lunch buffet and you will see what I mean--it's a vegetarian dream!  there's like 10 veggie items on the huge buffet and the naan is soooooooo good!

I will warn you, it gets crazy sometimes on weekends, line out the door, raita and chutney slinging to and fro, elbowing people out of the way for the last scoop of halva, etc.  BUT, it's worth the madness.

P.S. Handy-dandy tip: when you are in your hotel room--look for the coupon that gives you 10% off the buffet, I randomly came across this when I flipped through the Vegas magazine last time I was at Caesar's Palace soaking in the tub.

Also, if you like even more heat, they will hook you up with some extra hot sauce, just ask.
