iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw The lamb taco was so amazing! Juicy meat, topped with delicious sauce and veggies. We also tried the samosa, which did not disappoint, and the paneer chili burrito, yum!  This place was a total surprise, and so good. I just wish I had ordered more chutney, it was good with the samosa and the burrito. I can't wait to go back.
