bXFWLSQptjB5SUMyZxprfg This is like the 4th Indian food review I'm writing in one night...So, I'll make a rubric:

for the buffet:
Naan: indian food staple - 5 star
Tandoori chicken: another indian food staple - 5 star
curry selection: bleh, i'm a little picky, it was a decent selection -3 star
desserts: decent selection, gulab jamun was good, not a fan of the other stuff - 4star
service: good

by the way, i just made the cardinal sin of referring to curry as 'curry'. there is no such thing. qorma, tikka, salan, etc are all your 'curry' dishes, but they are all very different and using those words makes it much more apparent as to what you can expect from the sauce.

decent indian food if you're in AZ. the search continues for some indian food that compares to the stuff you get in cali.
