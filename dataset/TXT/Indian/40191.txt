PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg If you only have £3.50 in your pocket and want a meal that's a) tasty and b) enormous, preferably with a bit of 'character' thrown in, this is where you should head.

By 'character', I mean you sit outside under a gazebo in the backyard of Edinburgh Central Mosque, and you eat out of a polystyrene box with a plastic fork. But the food is that good that you won't care about the pigeon eyeing up our lunch 3 feet away.

I usually go for the veggie option, because the one time I did get the chicken there were quite a lot of fatty chewy bits. In fact, it made me stay away from here for a while, but then a veggie friend convinced me to get the lentil and spinach curry instead, and 3 years later I'm still eating there. It's right by the Uni, but you get a surprsing mix of people thanks to it's word-of-mouth reputation.

If you haven't tried it yet, then you need to. Soon.
