FOOD: I really liked the taste of Mattar Paneer, but my wife thought it was lacking in taste. The naan was bland IMO. I've tried much better naans at other Indian restaurants. It was passable, but not great. I also tried their tandoori chicken tikka. I ordered dark meat as opposed to white meat. It was still dry for some reason. Next time, I'll be getting only veg options. I'd like to try Aloo Gobi and Karahi Paneer.

There are no good Indian restaurants in this part of town, so this is a reasonable option if you're craving Indian. You'd have to venture out to Brampton for some truly good Indian food. My only gripe with them is that their portions are small. I wonder if the takeout containers are just as small. I'd expect more food for the money.

Also, the prices on their website are outdated. They are all $1-$3 lower than what they actually are in the menu once you get there. You can refer to the photos I took of the most recent menu as of July 2017 for more recent pricing.
