nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw Came here with a huge group (20+). We were well accommodated, although water refill was scarce half-way through eating. I was pleased with the lunch buffet (9.95, plus you get 10% off with a student i.d.). The buffet selection wasn't huge, but just enough for me-someone who doesn't have background in Indian cuisines and rely heavily on labels. There were about 12 dishes (I think) to choose from (including salad fixings). I would definitely come back if I were in the area.
