aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q Small little place in mall downtown. Had much better Indian food but it was ok because of location downtown, quantity and to go.  I was staying in hotel nearby and needed something quick. A Shiek and a nice. Woman scoop out your 2 meats and a Vegi over rice. Had to pay .75 for coriander chutney and $1 for naan. No seating assigned but tables spread around mall. 

Quality-2
Fast-3
Price for what you get -3
Taste-2 watered down basmati and tiki. 

I'll go back if I'm back in town and need something fast. I'm sure there are better Indian places elsewhere.
