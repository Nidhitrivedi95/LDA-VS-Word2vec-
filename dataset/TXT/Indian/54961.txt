- Liked the Sharma chaat, mutton rara ghost and mutton seekh kebabs
- Courteous and attentive staff
- big portions of the thalis
- loved the 'bhuga' rice (or pulau as they advertise) 
- conveniently located in the central part of city with ample parking. 

Cons
- The core Sindhi dishes were a bit disappointing. The dal pakwaan which is a signature Sindhi breakfast was a let down. The dal is supposed to be a mix of many daals and not just one. 
- the pakwaan didn't taste great either. Thought it was not as crunchy plus I could see some oil on them. I know it's deep fried but I would have expected it to be well dried.
- some tables have wooden chairs, they were a bit uncomfortable. 


The ambience is alright. The lighting can be brighter.
