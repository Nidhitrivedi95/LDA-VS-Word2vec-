82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA We came in and had a 30 minute wait but it was worth it. Although it's a bit pricey and the portions are small, the food, staff and ambience make up for it. The mutton and chicken biryani are petty good and the servers make it a point to listen to your specific asks. My brother-in-law was with us and he is a chef (and Indian too) and he loved the food. My wife loved the Keema Naan. Overall, a great choice if you are craving for some Indian food!
