RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg In search of Indian cuisine? It's tucked away next to the elevator...we were driving around the parking lot and ended up calling them to figure out where they were. I'm sure that happens often. (I should have paid closer attention to Todd W.'s review.)

Like others, we were seated in the hallway next to the windows. Had to move because it was too chilly especially whenever someone opened the front or side doors. It was no problem to move. 

Great veggie dishes! Delicious rice, flavorful okra dish, and some cheesy dish in red sauce. The garlic naan was a nice touch with the entrees. Definitely order a couple dishes and share because they are very flavorful and may be too much to eat one dish only with the same flavor. 

We used a Restaurant.com certificate, which allowed us to choose a variety of dishes and appetizers to try. However, without a certificate it would be too pricey to eat here often. To help justify the price, I figured we're paying for the location, atmosphere, and service. 

Enjoy your experience!
