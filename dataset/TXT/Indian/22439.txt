gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA As an employee of fashion show mall~ it's awesome that this location offers a mall employee discount on my order!  Also, every time I order lunch from here I always get the best service from Monica!

She takes the time to explain the dishes if I have questions about ingredients, or how they're prepared.  I also saw her give exemplary customer service to a customer who was being less than polite to her in front of me in line. 

The selection of dishes are bountiful and I have yet to try more of the delicious looking menu.  Looking forward to trying them all!   If you're in the mall and looking for something fresh, hot and delicious- give India Masala a try!
