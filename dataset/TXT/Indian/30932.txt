5 stars.

Shrimp Tandoori, the most tender Shrimp Tikka Masala and great vegetarian samosas; the best that I've had in Charlotte, NC.

Inexpensive, fresh, clean, rotating buffet for lunch that my husband was very impressed with.

Friendly staff, well dressed, very attentive, and very reasonably priced. In a really pretty area of Charlotte too. I don't think you can beat Maharani for quality indian food.

If you like spicy food, their medium spice still tastes like a mild to no spice. I'd ask them to make it hot next time, instead of medium, that way you get some sort of burn.
