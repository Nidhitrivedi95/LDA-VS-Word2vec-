x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag I love all types of food, but lately I've been craving and wanting Indo-Chinese food like no other. This Hakka place fulfilled all those cravings. We ordered some Chicken lollipops, Chilly Chicken, Ginger Chicken and Spicy Chicken Fried Rice. Apart from the Ginger Chicken that tasted pretty bland the other dishes were good. Beware portion sizes are really large. The Staff is friendly and service was quick. I also ordered a Sweet lime and soda and it was the worst I've tasted. It was made from Ready lime juice concentrate and lacked flavor. I'd go back for the Chicken lollipops and the chilly chicken alone.
