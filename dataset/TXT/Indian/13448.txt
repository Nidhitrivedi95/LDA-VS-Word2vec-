biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg Horrible experience. Food was stale. Service was annoying slow. When we found an aluminum piece in one of the dishes they offered no apologies and then just proceeded to replace the dish. Don't think they care about the consequences of such an incident. Highly advice ppl to not visit this place.
