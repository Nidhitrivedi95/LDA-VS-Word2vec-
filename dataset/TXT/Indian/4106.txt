171c2z28JaSYQtWimiZ62A I wish there was a lower star rating for this place. Saying this place has piss poor service does a disservice to piss. 

They brought the wrong dish then, after I pointed it out and waited 20 mins, they brought the right one...but charged me for both and refused to adjust the bill accordingly. The server was abusive about the whole ordeal...and when I decided he deserved no tip because of his jerk attitude and lengthy service delays, it nearly led to a physical altercation. 

I would recommend this place to my worst enemies or anyone who enjoys decent food in a fairly run down, dirty dive with staff who shouldn't be in the service industry.
