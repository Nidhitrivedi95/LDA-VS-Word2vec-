o8k9D05WpwgK-8BV7OH-xw Worth the detour! The lunch buffet at $10.95 is excellent with an abundance of vegetarian choices as well as the classic butter chicken! Everything I tasted was simply delicious. I would say that the food is not as "hot" spicy as I would normally take it but there is a flavourful balance of spices. The food was so good, it was hard to stop eating. Small selection for dessert but by then, there was barely any room left in my stomach. I supposed the dinner options are just as tasty, however, the best bang for the buck would be for the buffet. Restaurant is clean, service courteous and easy to park on the street. Highly recommended!
