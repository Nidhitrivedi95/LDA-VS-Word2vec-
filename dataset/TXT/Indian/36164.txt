nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw wonderful lunch spot. the buffet was about 2/3 vegetarian, with some unusual offerings like mushrooms and turnips, along with channa masala, vegetable pakoras, some potato balls, and vegetable biryani. all the entrees were tasty and hot, but i wish there was a little more fruit and salad, because one plate of the delicious but oily foods did me in (and i almost ALWAYS go back for seconds!!). the chutneys - tamarind, mint, and onion - were mostly unremarkable, the onion was a little strong. but this was better than any Indian food i've had in quite awhile, and i appreciated the abundance of vegetarian dishes.
