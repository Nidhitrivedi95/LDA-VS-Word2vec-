My friend and I split the Coriander Special Platter which had a sampling of the best Indian appetizers like paneer with a crispy chick pea batter and samosa. I also got the Non-veg combination dinner. Everything was delicious and they got my perfect spicy level spot on. The prices are perfectly reasonable and it's a lovely environment.  GO!
