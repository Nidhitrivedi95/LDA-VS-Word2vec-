LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I was told to go here by my co-workers and they did not disappoint ! I got the Dosa Masala, take out. It was delicious, and the chutney was very flavourful. I would recommend sitting in for Dosa as you do not want it to get soggy. They were fast for takeout however. I will go back for sure.
