I've never been dissappointed.  Well, that's not true.  I'm on the verge of tears when they run out of naan, which is a frequent occurrence for the lunch buffet.  But, it's one of my favored lunchtime stops.  Plenty of vegeterian options, and they have enough variety that it's rarely same combination of dishes.  They really won me over with their okra dish... Magnificient!  Muah!  That's what sticks out in my head the most, so I guess the rest is good but not necessarily spectactular.  It is in a somewhat seedy strip mall, but heck, some of Vegas' greats share that characteristic, Lotus of Siam anyone?  Interior decor I find quite pleasing.  The lunch buffet will run you around $12.50, so middle of the road pricewise, too.  I think this belong on your list if you're racking up your checklist of Vegas' Indian buffets.
