h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Possibly the worst Indian food I have had in the United States so far and definitely the worst in Pittsburgh. I ordered a Lamb Biryani and it looked like they put lamb chunks in lemon rice. The Aloo Paratha which is one of the easiest things to make did not have aloo stuffing as much as you would like. Very disappointed with their food. I am never ordering from this place again. Just wasted my $20 bucks for nothing.
