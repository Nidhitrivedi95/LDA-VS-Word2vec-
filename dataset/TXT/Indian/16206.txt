De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA Love, Love, Love this Indian restaurant.  Have been going there for the past 5 years and have never had a bad meal.  

We always order the thali because we can never decide what to order and the thali has a little bit of everything.  All their dishes tastes like they just cooked it fresh from the stove.  

You cannot go wrong with any dishes.  Their Tandoori chicken is THE best in Toronto.  And their Masala Dosa has the thinnest and crispiest dosa....it's light.....yummmy....

Just writing this review is making me hungry and it's past midnight so I cannot go right now.  

We always order a lot so that we can take the rest home.  The food tastes even better the next day. 

All their soups are SUPER HOT & SPICY but it's worth the after burn.  I think they simmer their soups all day long to get that cooked through taste.  

Everything on their menu is great....I don't have any favourites because they are all so good.
