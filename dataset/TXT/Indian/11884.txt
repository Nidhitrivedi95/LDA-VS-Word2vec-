aTRnnM41SxIV-u4rUwceOg I would of given this 5 stars but the woman in the front that was taking orders just had a bad attitude, was rude and just overall poor customer service.  

I ordered the shrimp kothu roti and it was amaaaaaazing.  A bit too spicy but next time I will order mild.  The quantity was a little small for $8,  but it might be worth the taste.

The fish patties and samosas and other snacks are not as good as babus, so I wouldn't recommend ordering those from here.  They were not fresh and were dry.
