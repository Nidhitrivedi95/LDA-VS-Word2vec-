CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Great food. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Saag Paneer and Chana Masala within the group.

I tried everything and it tasted great and fresh. The channa was just the right firmness. The naan and the rotis were great too. The lemonade was not the greatest but I was too busy stuffing myself with all the food. Prices are a little bit on the higher end for an Indian restaurant but I guess you have to pay those prices on King Street.
