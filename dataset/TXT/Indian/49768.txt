Tzye9jFKVYpsWXQ64ZjZuw I frequently stay at a hotel close to this restaurant and have walked by without stopping in many times in the past year.  My desire for a quick, easy Indian meal overcame the Yelp review based reticence and I took the plunge last night.  Have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!  The Vindaloo was fresh and appropriately spicy and the lamb curry was executed with a rare sense of balance.  The combos were also an exceptional value.

During my most recent stays I had the opportunity to dine and take out; both options resulted in similar quality experiences. I noticed that a lot of the negative reviews on this place seem to involve third party delivery services and coupon redemptions.  This  place is very reasonable options for high quality Indian in Mid-town Montreal.
