x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag my first and last time there....I came here for lunch and was hoping this would be just as good as Fredricks, but it didn't live up to its expectation.  Though the Chicken/ veggie pakora was good, the chili chicken was quite disappointing.  The service is friendly, the atmosphere is casual/ trendy.  The prices are reasonable, but if you're looking for mid-of-the-road hakka then this would be your place.
