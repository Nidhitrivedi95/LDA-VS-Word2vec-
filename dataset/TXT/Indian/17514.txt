DTjepizTyVg_dWtyLOjGcw Love this place because its open late night and the food is always fresh and hot. I usually order the chicken tikka roll, the chicken pieces, or chicken kabob with naan. My family loves their naan because its always soft and fresh and you can eat it hours later and it still tastes amazing. Portion sizes are good and the taste isn't totally spicy but it is definitely tasty and enjoyable. Great place to pick up a meal on the go and staff is super nice. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a quick bite to eat. They do sell nihari and other dishes but I've never tried them but their meat is good and is always well cooked and doesn't smell.
