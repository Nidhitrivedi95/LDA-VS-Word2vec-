5HAv0eKeid0MIEAr-IqYkw Ordered many times from then on just eat. We always get the butter chicken and I believe the vindaloo. They're both delicious. The butter chicken is creamy but not too creamy and the vindaloo isn't too spicy but just the right amount of savoury. We usually order both along with garlic and cheese naan bread as well. Each curry comes with naan bread but the garlic one with it is yummy. Each curry comes with rice but we prefer to dip curry with naan bread :). I've had their raita yogurt and unfortunately it isn't as good as other places. I found it a bit too watery and not as much flavour.
