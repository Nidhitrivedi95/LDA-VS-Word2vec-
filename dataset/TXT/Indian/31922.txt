kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g First time having Indian food ever.  If it's all like this and better.  I'm on board with Indian food for life.  Almost everything on the menu has 500 calories or less.  There's a vegetarian option to everything on the menu.  The food has no added fats or oil.  Which is a new concept for me because I love oils and butter. The flavors come from cardamom,  cumin, turmeric, tamarind, and etc. Constructed in a way to bring out or enhance the lamb, chicken, lentil, etc. I enjoyed in the food even more in the nice modern decor. They have all the alcoholic selection display in a grid like cubical on the wall with a green back light. Highly recommend Bombay Spice as you intro to Indian food. I'm sure it only gets crazier.
