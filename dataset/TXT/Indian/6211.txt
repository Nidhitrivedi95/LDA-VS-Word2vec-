3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA My foodie fantasy day two, another 5-star success. I couldn't bring myself to go to a casino restaurant after the long day standing at the World Market Gift Show. So, thank you Yelp for another great find. 

I found Las Vegas' Best Indian Food! No, REALLY they won 2015 Best Indian Food by the Las Vegas Review Journal. Delhi is a very large family restaurant and everyone made sure that everything was perfect. Even a little hiccup was corrected immediately. 

I had the Vegetable Thali for dinner. Ample portion and I couldn't resist the Pani Puri to start. The Chai Tea was rich and creamy. Delhi has earned a place on my Vegas Restaurant list.
