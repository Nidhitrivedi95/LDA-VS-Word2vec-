UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Been several times for the lunch buffet. Staff is helpful and friendly in pointing out vegan options. Very tasty, if even a bit greasy and salty. The $4.95 one tea-bag tea is a bit pricey though. I'll stick with the buffet option from now on. 
What's up with the staff asking for my phone # and e addy simply to place me in the que for a table? 
It's quite a nice restaurant though, especially considering the strip-mall it's in is not so hot.
