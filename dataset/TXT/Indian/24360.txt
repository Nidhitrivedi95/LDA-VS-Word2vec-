GYmdm_Vy7sf9tji7WUcohg Amazing! Always tastes fresh and delicious! Great and friendly service and the owner and chef always takes the time to talk to all of the customers and often tells a cute little story! Slower service on the weekends but, you won't care once you taste your food, quality is worth the wait! I can't say enough good things about this place!
