PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw Very solid Indian curries. Themed as Nepalese cuisine, but it has all your standard Indian dishes. Enjoyed our meal and we forgot to ask our waiter to apply the 20% discount available for students. Oops! We were lucky because on a Saturday night at 7pm almost everything else is booked, but were able to walk in here. By the time we finished at 8:30, we felt that we were a bit rushed out because there was a queue of people coming in from the pouring rain, but the staff were very polite and said that if we wanted to stay, they would seat the newcomers at a different table. I felt it was unnecessary to ask us if we were leaving as we were paying (and clearly leaving), but this kind of thing can be overlooked as overly zealous waiting-of-tables. 

Would recommend the food and the place as a good curry. Convenient to George Square and George the IV Bridge area.
