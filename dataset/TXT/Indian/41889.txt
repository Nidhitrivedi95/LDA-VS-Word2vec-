QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg I ordered delivery from Mintt so I can't speak to the service and aesthetics of the restaurant.

I am obsessed with the naan from The Mintt. The curry in my butter chicken was also delicious. The chicken is where I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, The Mintt uses high-quality chicken. It tasted like it was cut up chicken breasts tossed in the curry I ordered rather than chicken left simmering in curry for a few hours to soak up the spices and flavors, though. I was disappointed, especially since this was my first experience ordering Indian food in Pittsburgh.
