f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg This is the WORST restaurant with WORST customer service. I usually dont leave bad reviews and give each business ample opportunity and benefit of the doubt, but after giving this place three opportunities, I have decided to never go here again.

The Buffet was very cold, the dishes were not being refilled, the naan and puri took 20 minutes to be refilled. Worst experience ever.
