OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA This is solid grub for hungry people.  It is inexpensive and does the job.  Plus, a ton of leftovers.  Just don't try to impress anyone by taking them here!

I came because I needed to finally find out in life what Hakka food is.  Now, I know...I think.

The service is efficient and the food came fast, suspiciously fast! lol

What we ordered (chili beef, house shrimp, sweet and sour breaded chicken pieces) had generous portions.  It was tasty, but was over-sauced or over-fried to disguise any day-oldness or reheatedness, which is about right, when I think of all the meals I ate, when I lived in China.

Leftovers were ok for about a day, and then I couldn't take it anymore!
