tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Once upon a time this was a good place to get decent Indian food...alas they have changed chef/management and now it very poor quality.. I ordered Tikka Masala; it was, I am sure a sauce from Sharwoods that I can buy, plus the meat was huge chunks of chook...and the veggie rice I ordered was nothing more that boiled rice with some microwaved veggies thrown in,,,,will never go back...
