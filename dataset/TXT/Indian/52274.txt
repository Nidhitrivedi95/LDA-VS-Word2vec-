UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This place was so good!! The decor was chic and the service staff was very nice and helpful. The menu was huge (sometimes a bad sign) but everything we ordered & every dish that passed our table looked and smelled delicious. We had been craving Indian food, so before we stepped foot in the restaurant, we already knew we were going to order momo and chicken tikka masala. Lucky for us, Wednesday happened to be chicken tikka masala night, which means if we bought one, we'd get the 2nd one half off. (You can choose the level of spiciness you prefer.) Along with the naan, this meal really hit the spot. I'm not from the area, but I will definitely come back here anytime I'm in Vegas again just to try more tasty dishes, especially those on the prix fixe menu!
