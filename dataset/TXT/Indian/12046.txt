auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ My chicken was dry and all they did was argue with me about how it wasn't dry instead of taking care of things. I do not like writing bad reviews but it would have been a simple solution but the server even got the cook who then continued to challenge me how it wasn't dry and they would not replace my meal. Very unhappy and I should expect this from an East Indian restaurant they're very cheap and they don't care, all they care about is losing on food costs.
