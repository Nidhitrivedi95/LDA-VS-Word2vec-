IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA I was super bummed to see that Cheerful House had closed, but Saino quietly opened in their space and their tasty food and attentive service make them a favorable replacement. Lunch is a super-cheap $10/pp for a selection of about 5 vegetarian and 5 carnivorous entree options, two choices of rice, and a fresh bar of vegetables and condiments. 

Selection may be a bit small compared to other spots in town, but these guys do everything well- the goat curry was easily the most meaty version I've found even including a la carte ordering, their raita was uniquely flavorful with fresh herbs, and naan was made fresh for the table. I'm an omnivore, but the palak paneer and gobi aloo are the stuff vegan dreams are made of! I wish they'd add to their appetizer/dessert items- I only found a single samosa and a tiny cup of rice pudding, and was sad not to be able to end my meal with gulab jamun. 

Saino is definitely worth a visit. Signage and decor indicate that they provide Himalayan and Nepalese cuisine but their current offerings seem to be mostly Indian cuisine.
