kTJEf56gjzBSpi9X14X54Q Very tasty food. The onion dosa and biryani were great and the bisibele bath was very good. Each dish was prepared fresh. Owner was very friendly, explained the flavors of the food for people newer to south Indian cuisine, like myself. We ended up ordering 4 different appetizers/dishes and 2 drinks for only $22. 

Cons: It's located in a strip mall off of Mayfield Rd and was a little hard to spot. Also, it's pretty much take out only, though they have one table set up.
