GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g I've had regular dosa, paper dosa, rava dosa, vada, idly and sambar and all have been consistently good. Their chutney is self-serve and they also serve raita and chopped pickles as condiments, which is a nice touch. I first discovered this place around 2013 and try to go there when in the area. Their masala chai is also very nice.
