2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Like other reviewers have noted you can't go wrong with this place. Samosas are fresh and nicely seasoned. I would prefer my filling to be spicier so I add pepper sauce. I will only stop by during off peak hours..usually weekdays just as they open and I've never had more than one or two people ahead of me. Selection of other fried goodies is impressive although I have only tried the samosas.
