irCBE0vRZ9oQZ26qMR-5HA It's not the best indian food ever, by its not the worst. Butter chicken was ketchupy in my opinion and not worst. I wasn't in the mood for other for fast food so I opted here. It's food court food so what's there to expect. It's decent enough for mall food. I'm just glad to see diverse flavours in a food court! But maybe I'd opt for other options, but it satisfies a quick craving.

Wouldnt go out of my way to eat here. But if you're in the mall and craving indian food for any reason, then try it.
