jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q This place is phenomenal! It features some of the best curries and paneer dishes I've ever had. It is definitely a notch above your average Indian restaurant!! They have a gorgeous view of the Vegas skyline and big windows to enjoy the views and watch airplanes take off and land. The restaurant is well appointed with classy, modern fixtures. They also have top notch entertainment on the weekends. I was so impressed with this place, I feel fortunate to live nearby.
