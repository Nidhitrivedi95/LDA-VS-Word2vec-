b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Stopped in on a Friday night and the restaurant was almost one hundred percent full, which I was extremely happy to see because many other Indian restaurants don't seem to have any more than 3 or 4 tables so they must be doing something right. They have a pretty good selection of different bottled beers, a lot of IPAs. They don't serve wine but we brought our own bottle and they presented us with two wine glasses and a wine opener which saves you about $28 right off the bat. Pricing and quantity of food is pretty similar to  other Indian restaurants I've been to, but the food quality was excellent. We ordered a paneer dish, lamb korma, and butter chicken. I'm not much on Paneer, I can take it or leave it, but this was really good, like I would consider ordering it myself. The butter chicken was one of the best we've had, and the lamb korma was fantastic! Service was just a little slow at the end when it came time to box up leftovers and get the check, but otherwise they were very attentive and the food came out quick. All of us agreed that this is probably our new Indian restaurant of choice.
