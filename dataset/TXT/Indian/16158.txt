Dd1w7xR7Xs3bthwusgy33Q Glad we found this place. Generally not fans of Indian food but we tried a few things and it was alright. They have sugar cane juice! Could drink this by the gallon. Unfortunately it's a little expensive. In Hawaii I can buy a gallon for $18. Here it's about $50. In India it's about 20 rupees if I remember correctly. We'll definitely go back for the cane juice often but don't like paying the premium price.
