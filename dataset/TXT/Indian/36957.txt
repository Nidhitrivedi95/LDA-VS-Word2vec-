o_sq_rvTBo59hm6TkDi6tg Tried The Host through Uber Eats and the experience was good but nothing fantastic. The food arrived nice and hot and it was very tasty. There were enough sauces for the different plates. We don't often order or have Indian food but this still seemed comparable to home-made authentic Indian food I've had in the past. Would like to visit the restaurant in person as I'm sure it would add to the experience.
