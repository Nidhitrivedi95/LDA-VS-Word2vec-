9coZa838egYONxSdTe-wUg We ordered steamed chicken momo, chicken chau chau noodles and egg fried rice. 

Chicken momo - I have tried momo's before and I love them. The main reason for me to go to this place was momo's. But  I have to say it looked like they were straight outta freezer and warmed them up in an oven. Not good!!

Chicken Chau Chau - Tried this one after reading yelp reviews. It was not up to the mark. The noodles were so dry and bland. We ordered a spicy level 8 on 10 but it was no where near even 3. Not good!!

Chicken fried rice - this was even drier than chau chau. The rice and chicken was all dried up (may be it was cooked long back and stored in freezer). Not good!!

I was so excited to go this place as I haven't tried momo for a while but it was a complete let down.
