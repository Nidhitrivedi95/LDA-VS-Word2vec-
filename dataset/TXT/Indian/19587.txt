FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg My experience at Bombay Bhel was spectacular. The service was great and we celebrated a family's birthday there not too long ago. We ordered their appetizer dish which had a bit of everything, curry chicken, and the list goes on. They served us ice cream as well. Overall, it was very hearty and delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant to ones who have yet to taste Indian food/dishes!
