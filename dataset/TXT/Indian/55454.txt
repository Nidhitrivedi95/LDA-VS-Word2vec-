x_SK4kvfWdCDDBmA_ErxqA Gosh, I haven't been to Pasand in a couple of years and I am glad that it was just as good as I remembered. I love, love, love me some Indian buffet. We came for lunch today and it was about $8. 

I had a couple plates of fried pakora, naan, chicken mahkani over white rice, tandoori chicken, and chili chicken. The food was delicious although not as spicy as I remembered. I wasn't complaining, though. We also ordered some dosa that was stuffed with potatoes. The service was good with prompt water refills and cleaning up extra plates. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal today!
