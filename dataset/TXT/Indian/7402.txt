Foodies know that the family owner takes more pride in their cooking than the chain store.

I found a great indian lunch spot near work and I just had to try it.

For $8-$10 you can get a Thali plate with 2 meat dishes and several veggies plus Basmati rice and Naan

Watch the husband and wife cooking away on their little stove as they put their heart and soul into what they are doing what they love to do? cooking great food

I really found the chicken to be spicy good and the big chunks of lamb in a rich sauce. I am finding butter chicken to be somewhat heavy lately but i had to try theirs and it was very good as well.

Typical of great restos near office towers it can get filled up quick at lunch and they have seating for i think about 24 people.

So a nice selection of items and i had an awesome chai tea...cardamon seeds were in the cup....thats how mama Maja makes it...authentic
