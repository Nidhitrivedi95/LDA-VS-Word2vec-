LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA We were feeling like having a Dosa and I had bookmarked this place quite a while ago from the fellow Yelp friends postings. After reading some reviews I was very intrigued on the choices of Dosa they provided. 

First of all, as mentioned in many reviews the place gets very packed so make sure you have reservation. The restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a good number of seatings. The service was quick and the lady was friendly. 

Choices...Choices...Foodwise, we went with:

- Jeera Malli Dosa with aloo masala. This Dosa is suppose to be topped with crushed jeera, black pepper, fresh coriander.

- Pav Bhaji Dosa - This Dosa was stuffed with the bhaji (thick mix veg curry), topped with fresh onions, coriander. 

Both Dosa were exceptionally good and the sauces were great with it. We also tried their mango shake and special Madras filter coffee which was great! & strong.

Overall, the experience was quite good.
