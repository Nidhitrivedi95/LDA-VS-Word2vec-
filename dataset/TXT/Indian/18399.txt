eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw We were in Toronto (tourists from NY/NJ area) and stumbled upon this restaurant since we had heard so much about it from our family and friends. We came on a Saturday for lunch and it was around $18 usd which is pricey but considering they have 100 or so different items that to vegetarians we went ahead and tried it. Needless to say the food was okay. Taste was pretty blend and i'm only giving this place 2 stars because they serve warm naan. I was expecting the taste to be much much better since the owners are "punjabis" so we were expecting typical taste. I guess this place is pretty popular around brampton/toronto areas but I've had way better food in the US so if you're a tourist like me from NY/NJ I would highly skip this place.
