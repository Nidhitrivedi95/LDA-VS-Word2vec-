9y2MS2VyXZzFRi2zGV0AFg Britannia Spice is a great Indian restaurant and takeaway. As we live nearby we had previously been given a 15% discount card which is a great incentive to re-visit.

We went for dinner on Saturday night before the cinema and the staff were polite and friendly as ever. Each time a waiter comes to your table it is a different person which can be a bit odd but they are always nice.

On this visit i had the Thai Sesame Chicken which was delicious, so full of flavour. We also shared a garlic naan, chipati and poppadums. All very tasty.

When we asked for our bill i showed our discount card and then a waiter (who appeared to be more senior) came over and offered us a free whisky each as we were local which i thought was a really nice touch. We politely declined and as he held the door open as we were leaving he told us to remind him next time and he will give us free whisky.
