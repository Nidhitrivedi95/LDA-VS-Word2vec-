YFZtDqYdz00E1RlI_Vo89w The best Asian restaurant in Edinburgh, it doesn't look much from the outside but wait until you have tried the food. The Khukuri is a Nepalese restaurant, I'm not a food expert but I just find their food more enjoyable than Indian food, I think its got more flavour. 
When we moved to Edinburgh about 10 years ago we started taking vistors to the Khukuri and everyone of them said it was the best Asian restaurant that they had eat in and on return visits to Edinburgh our friends always requested a return visit to the Khukuri
There is an extensive menu, the food is great, the service is superb, I just can't find any faults in the place, its a little gem. But don't tell to many people or it will be even harder to get a table.
