3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Toronto has a competitive field in the Indian food business and this place stands out!  The main reason is the chef/owner, Anant. He cares. He makes all his own curries, and they are all different and full of flavour. The home style curry chicken and shrimp curry are culinary triumphs. The saag paneer and daals are great. All other dishes are good and distinct. They are what they say they are plus some extra authenticity and magic in the seasoning. The nan bread, pickle and other sides are right on par with anywhere else that's good. Atmosphere and staff are friendly and warm. It's a little informal, but nice and clean. The best quiet place for the buck to eat in the Junction!
