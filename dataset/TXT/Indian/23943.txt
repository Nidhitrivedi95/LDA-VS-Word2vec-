gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Dined alone here on a Saturday evening; four other tables were occupied.  The host and waiter was one of the sons of the Napalese family that owns the restaurant.  I had tomato soup, garlic naan, and lamb tikka mesala (ordered "6.5" spiciness).  I enjoyed all, but I thought the soup was especially good.  $19.97 plus tax, including white tablecloths and cloth napkins.  I expect to return.
