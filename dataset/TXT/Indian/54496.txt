W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg 3 star for food and 0 star for cleanliness. Not consistence with quality of food, not at all a good place to dine in and if you are ordering for take out then please make sure to call 45 minutes before and if you are lucky enough then only your order will be ready on time, if you have catering order then be ready to pick it up because you might get call 10 minutes prior to your scheduled delivery time saying that they can't deliver due to blah...blah issues. Make sure to double check everything before you pick it up, chances of error is only 99%.
