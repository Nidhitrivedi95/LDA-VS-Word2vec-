UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I had been here during Thanks giving holidays. I was told that there are many Indian buffets in Vegas and a lot of varieties when compared to the place where we live SlCC, Utah.

As this was the closest and on the way to Hoover Dam, we decided to stop by here. The food was terrible and I don't remember  any dish worth mentioning here.  It was a buffet and not a single dish was tasty enough for the second serving.  The only manageable one was chicken Tikka masala.

I would never go back to this place ever again !
