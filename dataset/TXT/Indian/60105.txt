zKSKmkBxfrltJau_4s1ZHA Still going to Biryani.  Their quality and taste has stood the test of time.  They still use quality plastic and sturdy styrofoam take out containers as serving dishes. But since the servings are so large, it saves time when you want to take the rest home.  Last ate on Tuesday which is Dosa day, buy one & get one free.  The friendly couple at the next table recommended the cilantro and mint which ended up too spicy for me.  I enjoyed the potato filled one much better.  Both are giant sized and enough for 2-3 to share.  They come with 3 different sides to dip into.  Check on line for the daily item plus lunch combo. specials.
Still love the palak paneer which is a soupy curry of spinach, cream and yogurt cheese. It comes with well cooked, white, jasmine rice on the side.  Greatly enjoy the shrimp dishes because there is so much shrimp in every bite.  
They don't have a tandoori oven, which means no naan or tandoori cooked meats.  For example, they do chicken Tikka Masala using tender and juicy baked chicken tenders instead of tandoori seared pieces with grill marks.
I suggest if you are in the neighborhood, try it - you'll like it.
