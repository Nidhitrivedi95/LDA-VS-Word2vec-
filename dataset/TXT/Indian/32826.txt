The chicken vindaloo was incredibly delicious and did not disappoint on the specification of "extra spicy".  My wife's regular selection of chicken tikka was exactly what she was hoping, and that squeeze of lemon helps to tie the whole dish together.  The garlic naan was a delicious compliment to the entire meal.  

I was greeted at the door with warm smiles and kind words.  On previous visits, we have stopped by for a sit-down dinner or to check out the lunch buffet on a weekend.  I have never had a negative experience at this establishment.  If you are apprehensive about this type of cuisine, Swad is the place to give it a try.  I recommend checking out the lunch buffet for the variety of choices.
