bU6mVZSuO5EpvfUay87e8g I work just around the corner from this place now, and every day when I leave I can smell the A-Ma-Zing aromas that come from the back door. 

My colleuges and I went here for a quick lunch last week and I can honestly say it was delicious. Almost perfect.

The lunchtime menu is limited, but for two courses at just under £7, it was just right. I had some lovely chicken pakora, very moist and crispy, delicious with some spicy pakora sauce and a little (and for me, always unnecessary) salad. 

Main was a butter chicken curry, which I'm pretty sure had about two weeks worth of calories in there. It came with plenty of rice and it was absolutely delicious. It wasn't a full sized portion, but a very comfortable size for lunch. 

We only had soft drinks, but the restaurant has a BYOB policy and the last time I checked, corkage was free! You could have one of their 'Mocktails' though...alcohol free cocktails which sound lovely!

I will definitely be back here, whether its for a lunch or an evening feast, and next time I think I'll try a shisha pipe too!
