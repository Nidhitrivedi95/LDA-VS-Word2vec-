feFckrNF9-QzGrY4T9dAvQ I had a mediocre dining experience as far as the service and the setting but my goodness was the food ever delicious. It is some of the best I have had in the valley. I used to drive from central all the way over there just to have it. Yummy! When the food is good I can get over the other stuff, I must say the TV thing does bug the crap out of me but when I want curry not much else matters!
