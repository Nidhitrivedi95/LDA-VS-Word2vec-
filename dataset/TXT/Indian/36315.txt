nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA I came here with a groupon voucher with a friend. I was excited to try some of the chicken, since I've never had Malabar chicken, but they were celebrating some sort of food festival at the time (for two days). I happened to come by during that festival, and their regular menu was unavailable. 

The food was passable. Maybe it wasn't as good to me because I really wanted to try that chicken. I wouldn't order it again though.

The mango lassi wasn't very good either. The waiter serving us made it sound like a mango smoothie, but it was too sour to be considered that. That was a major let down too, but perhaps that's just what a lassi is (I don't know, I've never had it before that). All I know is I won't be ordering that again, here or at any other restaurant.
