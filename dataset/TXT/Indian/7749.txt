6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A My husband and I came to this restaurant during evening hours and were impressed by the menu options. So many good dishes to choose from. We ended up with the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Rogan Josh. Both were perfectly cooked, spicy, and delicious! And you can never go wrong with a side of Naan. 

We went on a snowy night so there were only a handful of people but It made for very fast and friendly service! We'll definitely be visiting again.
