RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Best Indian food in Pittsburgh. I lived in Dubai for several years, and although it's a middle eastern country, there are more Indians there than anyone else and lots of authentic restaurants. This place is the most authentic place in PGH. I have tried almost every other Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh and none of them come close to this place.
