9cGvOaA1BYw-ByOXjNbu9A The food here is so very good, I  just gave it 5 stars. 

The masala paneer dosa is the most delicious dosa I've ever had. The very large dosa is stuffed with potatoes, paneer, and the perfect blend of spices. It was enough to be a meal but also great for sharing.

The aloo ghobi has a subtle smoky tomato flavor, big chunks of onions, tomatoes, potatoes, peppers and cauliflower. I've had it twice and it is excellent. And oh my goodness, the rice! One would think, "it's just plain rice" but there is something about it that is just so good.

We ordered Saag with chickpeas. Also very very good. A nice blend of spinach, chickpeas, and spices. We loved the garlic naan.

The menu features North and South Indian dishes.  

Great presentation and friendly prompt service.  They easily split our check upon request.

This gem is overlooked in a little strip mall in Parma. You must make the effort to stop here. This may be my new favorite place for Indian food.
