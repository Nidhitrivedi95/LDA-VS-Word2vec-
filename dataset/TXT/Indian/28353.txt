J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I've come to realize that Little India is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. I chose it as the scene of my birthday dinner in October, and just had my farewell dinner there last weekend. The reason? I know I'll never be disappointed. Their service is remarkable and their food is amazing. I could eat an entire serving of chana masala myself, but never will because there's so many other delicious choices! The butter chicken's sauce is to die for and perfect for dipping your naan in. I don't even eat rice with Indian, because I think it's a filler and there's more tasty things to fit in your stomach. 

It's always a good idea to make a reservation if you're going for dinner because the place is small, but they told me they're renovating to hold more people soon. 

I love you, Little India.
