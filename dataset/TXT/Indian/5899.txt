3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Best Indian buffet I've ever had.  10 min drive from the strip near UNLV.  Big lunch buffet selection including meat dishes.  Everything was good and only $11 for lunch. 

My favorites: goat curry and chicken biryani.  Goat curry had lots of sauce was good for dipping the garlic naan.  Naan was fresh from the oven and doughy (a bit too doughy).  Indian buffets usually have little spice to cater to the masses, but not Delhi.  Actually had good flavor and decent spice level. 

Get the mango lassi too.  You won't be disappointed.  5 stars overall.
