FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ Five of six of my family loved the food from Curry in the box.  The sixth (me) liked it enough to agree to get take out from here for them twice within three days. The Sweet Potato Curry and Chicken Satay in particular stood out.  It did seem to me that the portions seemed small for the cost compared with other Thai take out options in Madison area.  

I was completely satisfied with the take out  service (ordering on phone, promptness of order being ready at time committed, quick in and out pick up of food).

If you want Thai OR Indian in Madison there are better options, but if you want both, this is a really great reason to consider Curry in the Box.
