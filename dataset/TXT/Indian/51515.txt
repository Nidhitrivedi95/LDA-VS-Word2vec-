UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I came here for the great lunch buffet we have been hearing about on yelp.  Let me say it is true.  Great service and a great line of food.  

The salads were great, but do not be tricked with the spiciness of some of the peppers.  I was tricked by thinking it was a bell pepper, but after five minutes of crying, I have learned my lesson to chew more no matter how hungry you are.  

The curries were delectable.  The goat was especially wonderful.  The soups were good.  My favorite was the tomato.  The others made me feel like it was lacking something.  The naan was great.  The misses liked the garlic one while I liked the original.  

Although we came early, before they opened, they let us come inside away from the cold and sit while they finished preparing the buffet for us.  The service was wonderful.  I love how their menus have descriptions of everything.  From the ingredients to the drinks to the little anecdotes about how particular drinks were not really Indian.  When I come back to Vegas and I am craving Indian, I am coming back to this place again!
