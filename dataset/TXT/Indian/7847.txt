6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w chicken pakora and tandoori sampler tasted bland. Fish had a very potent taste (not pleasant). Very little chutney and it had too much food colouring. Not authentic

long wait for appetizers. They should serve papaddum during the 15-20 min wait.

the mains were good (lamb vindaloo and butter chicken) but not enough naan was served

overall it was a little pricey for the quality and amount given
