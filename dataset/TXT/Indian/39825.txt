P8Tnt4o-CruzckdhTRYD6w Cute spot for casual Hakka family dining! 

We had the veggie spring rolls, Manchurian Vegetable Pakora in gravy, Szechuan Vegetable Noodles and masala chai (tea). 

The spring rolls were the usual frozen and flavourless kind, served with packet plum sauce. Sad because I'm always on the lookout for a good spring roll! I will skip them next time. The Manchurian pakora dish was solid. The gravy was tangier than I was expecting, came with a plentiful amount of pakoras, and was very much enjoyed that evening and the next day as leftovers. The noodle dish was delicious. I also happen to be a noodle addict so when I find a good one, I'm gleeful! The dish is red but it's all colour, it's not spicy hot. The flavour is primarily a pronounced soy sauce one and it's very tasty. The noodles were cooked to the perfect chewy texture. I usually am a stickler for crispy noodles but I was very pleased with the texture and was very happy we ordered it. I only wished there were more veggies. The dish was 95% noodles. 

Overall, the food was good and not that spicy. Note that the dishes were cooked to what HK called "medium" spicy. Maybe we'll try "hot" next time!  Portions were huge! We will be back to taste their Nepalese and Indian menus.
