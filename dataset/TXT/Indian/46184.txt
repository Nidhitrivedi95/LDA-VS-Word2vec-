sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Yeah...this place wasn't at all what I was thinking it would be. I guess I'm accustomed to Indian restaurants where you sit down and enjoy a full menu. This place on the other hand had about 6 different "rotis" to choose from. The take home copy of the menu consists of a half sheet of paper, one sided. 
I ordered the mild spice, chana roti. Chana being a traditional chick pea dish found in Northern India. The meal was not bad offering a large portion but at a slightly higher price than I think it should cost ($9). It was something I would eat again when I'm in need of something fast and healthy but it's not something I would get excited about. Perhaps this place is more a of hit for meat eaters. 
I had higher expectations with this resto. since it has been on the Yelp.ca top restaurant list for months now, not to mention the individual reviews of "best roti place".
