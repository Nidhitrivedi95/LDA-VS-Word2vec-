OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg I've been to many an Indian restaurant. Many. They've often left me unhappy, and wishing I'd just cooked at home. An exception to this fairly general rule has been Gerrard... and now, Host. The food was prepared quickly, but was steeped in flavour. There were many South Asians there, always a good sign in an Indian restaurant, and the food though a bit pricey, was very savoury. I highly recommend it.
