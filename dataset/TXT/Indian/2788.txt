0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w This is an incredible restaurant for a delicious date.  The vibrant and subtle sauces, spices and flavors take you on a journey beyond the senses.  Especially if you're a student who eats elsewhere normally, the dinner for two special at about $30 is remarkably filling and memorable.  High rating but it is not an expensive place for power suits or celebrities - although you can feel like one if you dress like it.
