Our selections were best quality, from the appetizers, through desert.  Breads impressed us (my wife and I are both bakers), the mango lassi is prepared with housemade yogurt and the entrees (do you still have room?) were wonderful.  This is an oasis in the business district.

Service is excellent, and if the table seems a bit small, it's only because you ordered too much food.  (smile)  Enjoy.
