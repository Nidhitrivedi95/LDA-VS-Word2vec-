Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g Worst restaruant ever.
ok, not worst, but so below average

Kothu- which was ok as my friend said it was not the best Kothu he had. 
Dosa - Dosa was so bad we couldn't eat it..
Chilli Chicken - First time dish came out where onion and chicken was burnt, server took the dish back after our complaint and get us another dish which was over spicy ( We said spicy but not something which you cant even eat), I am Indian by ethnicity so i know i can handle spicy food but it was uneatable and i know how chilly chicken should taste like too.

our server bring rice as complimentary as our bread got cold when they were making the dish again, which is good but he said i just bring you rice may be you want to have. which is worst thing i ever heard to give anything as complimentary for your mistake.

Also, the server didn't refill water and have to go to window to wave to get some water after waiting for a while. 

I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone and i don't think food was fresh even as i had stomach issues next day. 

Its not worth the price and its not that cheap as its standard rate for many downtown restaurants.
