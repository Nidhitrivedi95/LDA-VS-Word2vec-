MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw Maybe I have been spoiled in the past or maybe my expectations were just too high but I really don't see why this place exists; it serves no purpose. Having spent 3 years of my life in Mississauga and blessed to have some of the best Indian eats in and around the area I can confidently say this place was a waste of my time.
Ridiculous prices, painfully slow service and food that is mediocre at best. My butter chicken and naan was around $20 when it's all said and done. While the sauce was alright the chicken tasted like it came out of the dryer. The other curry chicken dishes were similar as well. The lamb was not worthy to be mentioned. The naan was probably the best part of the meal and it tasted okay.
Why is this place still in existence? And why is there a grand opening sign almost 2 years now after my first visit?? - I am perplexed!
