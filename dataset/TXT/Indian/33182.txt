llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g This place is DELICIOUS. The cuisine at the buffet is the same as if you ordered a fresh plate of food. It was seasoned appropriately and full of flaver. I was amazed by the prompt service and the high quality of the food available. That cilantro chutney was to die for! The restaurant itself was very clean and dim which I liked since I was looking to relax somewhere in a corner and enjoy my food. I actually can't wait to get back!
