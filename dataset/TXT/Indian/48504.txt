tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g We were treated very rudely here.  We called ahead to make a reservation and were told that none was needed, to just come in.  We got there about a half hour later.  Although the restaurant was only about half full, the server left us standing in front of the "Wait here" sign for literally ten minutes while he walked around and talked to other tables.  When he finally came to greet us, he told us that the restaurant was too full and they couldn't serve us.  I told him that we had called ahead and were told that we didn't need a reservation.  He responded that maybe they could serve us but that we would have to wait at least twenty minutes.  Are you kidding me?  I was so angry we walked out.  I have never been treated like this at any restaurant I've ever been to.
