RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This place is all about the taste of the food. From gol gappay to kulfi, the food is authentic and tasty. The prices are average except for the gol gappay that, at $1 each ($8 for 8) are ridiculously overpriced. The ambience is that of a small town street-side eatery. Service is better when it's busier as there's more servers. Be aware that the Green P lot is reserved for TDSB before 6:00 PM - at least on weekdays.
