KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Honestly, the food tasted great when we were there eating it. But it totally made me sick to my stomach the next day. I definitely got food poisoning from this place. Real bummer because it was actually tasty, but I won't ever go back there with peace of mind. Just can't do it. Maybe they had a bad day, but I really don't want to find out again, so consider this  your heads up.
