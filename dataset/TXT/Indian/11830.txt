arP20rlnrGuX1Xker6xPzw Tamil (sri lankan) style ice cream. The mango and pistachio flavours are so good. However  the scoops are super small. SUPER STINGY with the serving size and the price isn't cheap. It's been small scoops since forever- i would excuse this if the price was cheaper. However, You'll pay $5-8 depending. However their scoops are way to small for that price tag.

Ice cream -3 /5
Serving size - 1/5
Service -1/5

Unless you want mangoey ice cream with bananas and jello at the bottom and the Tamil style ice cream explore elsewhere for your ice cream fix. 

Surprised it made a blogTO list. The ice cream is good- but the serving size is blah and the service is not with a smile.

It's decent ice cream, if the price was $ 4-5  I'd excuse it. But so not worth the price- I'd pay less for mango gelato at love gelato. At this price I expect good service and good portions regardless of cultural cuisine.
