tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg When we're too tired to go to Iqbal, my family and I come to Pak Centre.

The interior is okay; at least it's clean (which isn't case for all restaurants sadly). Waiters are kind and the food is great (if you can't handle spice, I recommend you buy a Mango Lassi to cool your tongue).

I only have to complain about their meat to rice ratio.
