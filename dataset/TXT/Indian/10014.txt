9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Just finished our lunch buffet at Amber Indian cuisine.The food is very similar to other Indian restaurants in town like swagath/maharani.But if you are a big  fan of hyderabadi chicken biryani , I bet you will be frequenting this place.Please note that this restaurant is started by same guy who started Minerva few years ago...

Taste :

What's good:

1)Hyderabadi dum biryani
2)Ghee pongal
3)Hakka noodles
4)Paneer butter masala
5)Naans
6)dosas
7)upma
8)veg cutlet

What's not so great (average)
Chicken 65
Chilly chicken
Fruit custard dessert

What's very bad:
Tandoori chicken-disappointing 
Chicken lollipops
Gobi manchurian
Fish fry-awful

Ambience and atmosphere :

Very good. Definitely better than most of the other Indian restaurants..

Management :
Could  see 3 / 4 waiting staff .But they seem to be caught up in Sunday afternoon rush hour..Took around 15 -20 mins to get a high-chair for the guests in our next table. 

Cleanliness:
Well , it's better than Minerva but there is scope for improvement with silverware on the table

Final verdict:
Definitely worth a visit if you are a hardcore dum biryani fan or a South Indian crazy about pongal dosas etc..
