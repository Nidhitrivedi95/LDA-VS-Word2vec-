VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw I used to be a regular at this restaurant and I was very happy to see that the restaurant has been doing well these past few months. For unknown reasons the management of the restaurant has changed. I am disappointed with every single dish I ordered. Naan bread was too chewy and lumpy. Appetizer, if it can be called that, was a joke. For $5, all I received were 5 measly pieces of "paneer pakoras". I think it is time to find another Indian restaurant in the valley.
