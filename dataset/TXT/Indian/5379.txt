2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw What can I say ...hands down the best (veg) samosas in Toronto!

I've visited this place for years now whether for catering or to pick-up meals for dinner lunch and snacking. This is a full service restaurant that also specializes in Indian sweets and deserts. 

At $1 for 5 freshly made in store man sized samosas how could you go wrong. Every Tuesday & Friday you can purchase a curry dinner for only $2.50. This includes a generous portion of rice + any three veggie curry.
