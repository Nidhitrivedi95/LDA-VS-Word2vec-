VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Food is top notch. Awesome tika masala, aloo naan, paneer and biryani. Great $2 wine on happy hour. 
Service may not be five star, or even four, but the meals make up for it. 
In my humble opinion, basmati rice should be included when ordering an entree dish with sauce, papadum is also something that should be complimentary, as this is the ONLY Indian food restaurant I've ever been to that doesn't offer it. Being cheap isn't a good quality for a restaurant to have. 
Booths, tables and patio seating available, average noise level, basic ambiance. 
I will return for the food only. Perhaps take out is a good option. Hope they rethink their add ons.
