1S6eB9Ag2VMx3Ab7LHORJw We enjoyed a late lunch here. The food was delicious and filling but be aware that this restaurant focuses on south Indian cuisine, so there is no naan on the menu (we had chapati instead). Although we were there late in the lunch hour we still received prompt and friendly service.
