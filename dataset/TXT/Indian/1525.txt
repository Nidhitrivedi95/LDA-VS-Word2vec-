-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Well I am an Indian Cuisine Virgin no longer . . . and . . . I am now an Indian Cuisine Fan.

A co-worker has been after me for some time to try indian cuisine, but I always had an excuse.  Well, today, she cornered me and said we are going . . . only concession . . . I got to choose the restaurant.  Chutney's Indian Cuisine it is.

I am so glad that this restaurant has a llunch buffet, because I had no idea what I would have ordered.  So I tried a little of everything . . . and . . . I loved it ALL.  The chicken, the goat, the eggplant, the curries, I could not get enough.  All were fresh, hot, and just enough spice to give everything a nice kick.

I think I may have made a mistake tough . . . while I am now willing to go out for indian cuisine . . . I hope the bar was not set to high.  Chutney"s I will be back . . . and for the rest of the Indian Cuisine Restaurants . . . look out, I will be coming your way soon.
