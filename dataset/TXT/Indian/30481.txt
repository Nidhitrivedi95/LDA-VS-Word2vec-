KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ Was in town for work and we were craving for some good Indian food. To our delight we found this gem on Yelp! 

Had to do a review to also make sure I remember this for the next time in town. Some of the most authentic, delicious dishes we've ever had! Coming from Chicago, who would've thought we would find even better Indian food in OH!??

I had a samosa, chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and mango lassi for my drink. All of it ... amazing! To top it off, the owner (I think) brought us a complimentary dessert, gulab jamun.
