-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw A taste of India even the PQ can't hate!!!!
Great quality, great service, even better price point. 
for 9 dollars you get 2 meat choices and a vege choice plus rice and salad and nann bread.  Also they have great vegetarian only selections.

The choices i like are butter chicken, chicken curry, chana masala (aka awesome chick peas) 

If your looking for a great treat on a cold winter day and don't want to break the bank,
Thali is for you!
