BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ I've looked forward to trying the Mt Everest restaurant for quite a while.  It was recommended to me by several friends.

I went and had some Nepalese fair.   They server Nepalese and Himalayan food.They also server some of the more familiar Indian dishes.

I ordered goat, and some dahl.

I found the goat was cooked to the right texture, but the sauce was missing something.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't inspired either.  It was just there.

I found the Dahl was bland. I've had the yellow dahl before at several restaurants.  It need a little something.  I found it very mild and needing something.

I will go back again, and give them another try.  My friends seem to enjoy going there, so maybe I need to find out what they ordered so I can enjoy it too.
