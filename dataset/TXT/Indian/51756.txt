UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This was my first time having Indian food. It was an amazing experience. Quality of food and flavor is exceptional. Great environment as well. Customer service could be a bit better. I felt they just wanted you to eat and leave. It could definitely be a bit better. Overall great restaurant and great food.

4 out of 5 stars due to average-poor customer service.
