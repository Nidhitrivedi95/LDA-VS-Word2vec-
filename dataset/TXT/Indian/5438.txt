2ZmZbmsTRHogSZR-nJY_Fw Went for the buffet today and was amazed again at how awesome the food is.  The butter chicken is addictive and you can't just have one serving.  The goat curry was great and I don't even like goat!  We came here for the Valentine's Day special menu last month and liked the creative dishes.  On top of all that, the staff is friendly and attentive.
