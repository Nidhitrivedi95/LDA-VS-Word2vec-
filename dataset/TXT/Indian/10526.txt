9x3RMAdpuB7nM9QbwHNPDA This is A-OK Indian food in Verdun. They have quick delivery and the food is ok. Of course I have tasted better, but that would mean that I would need to go to Parc Extension or Downtown to get better stuff. If you live in Verdun, this is a good place to order your take out or delivery from.

I have not actually sat in the restaurant, but I have walked by it, and it seems ok.
