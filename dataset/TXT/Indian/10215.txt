9MpWhQOYziJ38EB7MctxcA I love going to this hole in the wall Indian cuisine. The service is always wonderful, and the atmosphere is so calm and serene. I enjoy that it is a "phone free zone", it truly allows my fiancée and I to appreciate the moment without distraction. We've ordered something different every time we go to tandoor -- and the food is always incredible. It is made and prepared exactly as you order. The wait time here is longer than most places as a result of each dish being custom prepared, but is worth it and the time flies when in conversation with your date. I cannot say enough good things about this place -- it is our favorite place to go on a date and "unplug".
