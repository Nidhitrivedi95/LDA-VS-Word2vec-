1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw Worst food. You have to dispose your plate after eating in disposal area. Everything is self service including getting food and drinks to your table and throwing plates after eating. I have never seen this type of atmosphere anywhere in North America. Since this place is next to Cleveland state university mostly students and university faculty who want to try something unlimited might go there. Customers belonging to the community of owner typically go there to fill tables in the evening hours and they eat a couple of items since we do not know we try according to our taste. Weekends esp. during days it is empty. They might even ask you to clean your table. Staff is very unfriendly. Good they didn't ask you to clean plates. Food is below average. Owner and staff attitude is very bad. Once I ate Pav Bhaji during evening hours and found that is probably the worst food I ever ate. I got loose motions and was sick for 3 days with body aches and diarrhoea Avoid this place it is not Hygienic. Most of the positive reviews on this site are placed by the staff or owner;s family members or friends.
