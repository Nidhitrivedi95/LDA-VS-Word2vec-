5Ua5a941Wf5pTmUNz_MSsQ I'm upping my opinion of this place.  Management, it would appear, has listened to the masses and (at the moment) they're trying to open this location on-time or before 11:30.  Novel concept, and I welcome the change.  I'm glad to see they are taking their customers more seriously, and I've added this spot back into my work-lunch rotation.  Nice job, now if only they could figure out the soggy naan conundrum....
