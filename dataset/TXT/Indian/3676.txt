If I had known that it was that busy,  we would have called in to order first and then pick up the food when it was ready.  We ordered the chilli chicken with gravy,  Hakka chow mein and the szchauan eggplant.   The chilli chicken was on point and was delicious.  Next time I would order it without the gravy.   They Hakka chow mein was not oily and tasted great.  I found the eggplant a little too saucy though. The taste was fine but just too much sauce.  I'm going to try the gobi next time. Overall the food was great.  The restaurant is small so don't expect a seat if you go late.  I would just get takeout.
