UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Avoid the team who works here at 5 on Mondays! Shockingly bad service. We showed up at 4:59, the time at which you would expect them to be opening for dinner, and asked if they were open. One employee was sitting in a booth with his feet up, shoes off (on the table), and listening to music while the other simply sat in darkness. Our table was wordlessly cleared as the hostess glared at us. We felt uncomfortable. Then, our menus were practically tossed at us, again wordlessly, as she retreated to the kitchen. When she returned, we asked if we had come too early, and, after glaring at us for roughly three seconds, she snapped that, no, we were actually right on time.

I've never felt so unwelcome. Our party was large and the tip would have been sizable, but we couldn't bring ourselves to accept that attitude. We left and will never eat there again.
