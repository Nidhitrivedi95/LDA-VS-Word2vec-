yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This was my first Indian food experience so I don't have anything to compare their food to, however, what we ordered was delicious!  I had the Chicken Marsala and my friend had a lamb dish.  We also ordered garlic naan.  Everything was excellent!!  The restaurant is smaller than I expected, but it seems well managed and service was quick.  If you check in you get a free desert offer.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice it on my phone until after we left.  I'll have to go back!
