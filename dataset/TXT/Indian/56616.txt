xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg Once again Yelp! saves lunch. Some days I just want to try something new. I'll jump on and look for something close. Today I found Paradise India and so happy I did!

The space is large and open, it was actually almost empty when I walked in though it filled up shortly after. They have a weekday lunch buffet that was very reasonable at $10.99. I love this as it allowed me to try many dishes for a first shot. Everything was excellent!

Now I don't know all the names of the dishes and I don't feel like standing over the sneeze guard to take notes but I tried it all and literally everything was good. The Tikka Masala was great as was a chickpea and spinach dish. I'm coming back with more appetite and putting a hurt in these people next time lol.

Come check this place out, I sent out 3 texts while I was eating.
