TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Went there for dinner at 6pm. Got crowded at about 8pm. Full house.  

Building was nice on the outside, but did not expect the dumpy location around it. Thinking Diamond in the rough? Not quite. 

Service was good until it got busy then it was Ok. I had to go up to the bar to cash the check cause I didn't see waiter for a while.  

Food was neutral.  Not really bad but not great. Garlic Naan was really the best thing.  I was expecting more flavors but it was ok. They got my order wrong (chicken instead of shrimp) & shrimp came out rubbery (they take tail off). Small shrimp. Chicken tica tamdoori was good but they brought that out like it was an appetizer?  It was my husband's main entrée. I'm not sure what happened with that,  but we weren't going to complain in front of friends. Plus the onions & such were not cooked all the way. I don't eat raw onions (they barely cooked them). 

Small portions for price.  

Don't know we would go back unless friends  absolutely wanted to go there.  Too bad because I thought we found the best Indian place in town :(
