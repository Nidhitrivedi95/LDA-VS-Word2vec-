YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ love their dosa, chat papri, thalis. Its all very good. The madras chicken or lamb is one of my favs. Very good service and a clean place. Very good prices too. 
their food is not spicy at all, you have to specify that you want it spicy.

I've been a regular since they first opened, 7 or 8 years ago.

Ohh and thank god this place doesnt have a big screen tv playing hindi songs. I cant stand those restaurants.
