J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Very good Indian place on Queen West. Came here two weeks ago for delicious dinner. We had the share platter for two which included popadums, curries carrots, pakoras, butter chicken and tandoori chicken and naan. What a feast! I'm getting hugry again just describing what I ate. I think it is $45 for this meal. Compared to what other yelper are describing as the regular prices, this deal really seems like the way to go.
