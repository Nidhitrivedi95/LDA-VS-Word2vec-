Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I was very much pissed off with the restaurant today... After a long drive and not had enough food since morning found an indian restaurant nearby and my bad luck was sticked at Tamba.. Came at around 8.20 pm and order was taken at 8.35 and immediately served a soda that we ordered to have it with food and we thought that was so quick and eagerly waiting for the order and enquired about it with few waiters and they told will get it in few minutes and finally nothing happened and we left the restaurant without eating anything at 9.50pm .. They concluded that its a machine problem and order was not taken at all... That was strange.. I never faced such type of delays anywhere.. I am writing this review because my kid was feeling so hungry and she was very unhappy and she didn't get her favorite biryani that time and slept without eating anything..
