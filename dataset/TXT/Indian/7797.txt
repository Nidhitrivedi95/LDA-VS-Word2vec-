6lpBxSRXScCHnOsOvLWS9A The chicken tikka here is great, pungent and noisy and strong. We also had the mattar paneer, which, while soupier than many on the strip, has great flavour. They didn't puree all the spices so you get individual tastes and textures on the tongue and I kinda like that. 
Also had the chana masala which had more masala than chana but maybe there's a shortage of peas from the chick heritage, who knows. The flavour was good. 

One truly exciting thing about this joint is that they are applying for a liquor license. Wouldn't it be nice to have a beer with your meal? Or just go out for a beer and some snacks? (The snacks here apparently are great but this is hearsay.) The only other choice for beer around here is the kick'n'stab, and I value my life too much.

Update: I hadn't been back here for a while but the other night we got a mess of takeout and I was blown away. First, I have to recommend the dish called Dhaba. Yes, it's spicy, but it has these superb fried coriander seeds swimming all around, and it's fragrant, nutty, floral, and delivers a lot of bang for the buck. Also we had the lamb korma, which was amazing, and some kind of fish which I can't recall, and of course the tikka masala.

This place really delivers when it comes to massive flavour and (here's what matters) different flavour. Some places just change the chilis and call it a changed dish; this place has subtlety, variety and of course, chilis. Well done and I hope this place sticks around for several years.

Oh and yes, they have beer.
