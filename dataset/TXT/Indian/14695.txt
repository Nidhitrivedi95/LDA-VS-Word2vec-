CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A I am relatively inexperienced with Indian food, and as someone who is very picky with food I am unfamiliar with, my experience here was pleasant. Service was quick and we were seated promptly. My SO and I came on a quiet afternoon after he stated he was craving some Indian food. There were only about 3 other people in the restaurant so it was pretty quiet. I had no clue what the chutney was for, and I didn't like the aftertaste of papadum (just in general), so I just waited for my order for the tikka masala and mango lassi. The naan and my mango lassi came first, the latter being very delicious. I don't like the taste of naan, but their tikka masala and the rice were excellent. The chicken was tender and I couldn't get enough. So as far as service and the quality of the food I ordered, I was very satisfied!
