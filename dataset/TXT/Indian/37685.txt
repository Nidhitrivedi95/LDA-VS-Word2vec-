OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg Love this place! No wonder it's been here so long. Good portions, great service, location and ambiance. The food is great. The tandoori chicken murgh was great and served on a bed of vegetables with which it was cooked on a sizzling hot iron. The garlic naan is delicious. They have salty lassi which I love, don't like the sweet mango version which is often the only choice some places. The shrimp biryani was also great.
