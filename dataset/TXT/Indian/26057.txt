i6N0e1zVhkQvof_acn85Og Love this place! Cheap north-Indian thali. No need to venture out to Parc Ex. You can get it fresh right here in the Plateau! There are a few meat options (butter chicken, lamb, etc.), and a few veggie options (dhal, mix veg, palak paneer, channa masala, etc.) and it's all delicious. It comes with rice, chapatti, and samosa. They have loyalty cards - so stamp away! They used to have students discount, but that was discontinued for some reason :(. I usually pick up the food myself, so I can't speak for the delivery option. There's limited sitting there. The staff is friendly and the fragrances are sensational!
They now accept credit cards - not only debit / cash. 
This is my go-to Indian take-out place.
