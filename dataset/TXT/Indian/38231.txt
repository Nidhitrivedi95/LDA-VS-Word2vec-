OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ We saw the tulips iftaar buffet on tulips Facebook page and went to the restaurant . 15$ was the buffet cost . Bit high for a restaurant in Charlotte . Checked the non veg appetizer- chilly chicken . It was hard to eat , tasteless . Chicken biryani taste was missing. Naan wasn't available . Finally paid the bill and came home and drank sprite to fill up my belly . I wouldn't go here after . Please improve the food.
