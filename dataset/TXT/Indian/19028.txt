F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Tried this place last night, it's a new hakka joint in the Oceans plaza next to the Swiss Chalet. If anyone knows me, they know I love a good hakka feast - and Hakka Ren absolutely delivered! 

The Goods: the interior is well lit and spacious, the staff were friendly and attentive, and the restaurant is easily accessible in a good location. 

The Food: Very tasty! We ordered chicken pakoras, chili chicken (saucy), hakka roasted chicken w/house special sauce, manchurian rice, Hakka chow mein noodles, & crispy beef (my fave). Every dish we ordered was a pleasant surprise, since most Hakka restaurants seem to skimp out on the spiciness - but not this place!

I'd definitely recommend this place for those who enjoy authentic Hakka cuisine, and who like their dishes to have a kick of spice. I only wish the east end had hakka restos like this!
