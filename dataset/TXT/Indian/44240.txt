RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Lahore Tikka House. I have a love/hate relationship with this place. The food is mostly good, but I cant stand the curry smell that persistently invades my clothes if i have been here for more than 5 minutes.
What makes reeking like curry afterwards, and using up half a bottle of Febreze worth it occasionally:
- The Biryani here, its greasy, filling, and all the rice is evenly flavoured, just as it should be. my favourite is lamb or beef. 
- The naans are super fresh, the butter till naan is soft and fresh and great to accompany the kebabs and curries. Love.
- The Karhai Gosht (morsels of lamb cooked with a not very saucy, tomato and onion based curry) is good as well. Also try the fried fish. The chicken tikka is mild and decent. 
- Kashmiri Chai, I can go to this place for this chai alone.. I sometimes run inside get them to give me this chai to go and i often buy more than one for myself, as it only comes in a small serving. Its made by boiling green tea leaves with milk, and adding saffron, cardamom and pistachios and almonds. Supposed to be sweet and piping hot. This is the best place in India Bazar that sells it. 
- Kulfi, denser than icecream (it isnt whipped), comes in many flavours, i recommend the cardamom or pistachio flavour. Perfect end to a spicy meal in the summer.

The not-so-authentic and stuff that can be improved:
- The kebabs are decent, not the best i have had, but i like the fish, and boti kebab. The Sizzlers some with chunks of green peppers and onions, more of a filler for the plate than a complimentary flavour. Its never traditionally served this way, and i think that's for a reason. 
- Rice Sizzlers, just don't do it. You'll be eating plain rice for the most part, because the sizzler doesn't have enough gravy to flavour the rice. Another concept invented by Lahore tikka house. If you do end up stuck with one of these, make sure you order plenty of raita to douse your rice in.

Overall, if you really crave Indian food, stick to the more authentic stuff and you wont be dissapointed. Buy a bottle of febreze beforehand and be prepared, or get takeout if you can. Try to avoid the grimey bathrooms.
Lahore Tikka House is currently under renovations, although still operating. They are finally moving into a ACTUAL building, as opposed to the corrugated metal shack they were operating from. I hope they will have better ventilation and facilities, so i can stand going here much more often.
