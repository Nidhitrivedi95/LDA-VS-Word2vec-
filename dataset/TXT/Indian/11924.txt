auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ It really is fit for Royalty! I had their buffet couple of times and there are very delicious. The flavor of the curries is on the lighter side not as strong as other places.

I love their ALOO MATAR-Green peas [matar] cooked with potatoes [aloo] & spices,
ZEERA ALOO-Potatoes cooked with cumin and herbs
ALOO GOBHI-Cauliflower and potatoes cooked with spices and herbs
GOAT CURRY-Goat meat cooked with a fine blend of Indian spices
TANDOORI CHICKENHALF - you can get half for $11 or full for $20
This marinated chicken is cooked in its own juices in the tandoor, and is the fire and spice of India.

I like everything so far. You can buffet to go as well, they will give you a box, naan and a small cup for soup to go.
