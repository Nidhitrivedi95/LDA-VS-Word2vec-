3S8nDh3gK2BmG-_HjDjh6w Went with a group of friends for Sunday lunch.  We all ordered the $7.99 lunch special.  Tasty but everyone left still a bit hungry.  FYI, we thought the  bowl of rice that was brought to the table was kinda large for one person but, once we discovered it was meant for all four of us to share, we freaked!
