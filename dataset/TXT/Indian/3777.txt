0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw We used to be regulars here but we have second thoughts on returning due to poor customer service. We were not greeted upon entering. Not once during the entire visit did anyone offer us a drink, take our dirty plates, or refill our naan and water. I was very disappointed and surprised that we were treated like this, especially after giving this place so much business. We are not usually ignored like this. What has gone wrong?? 

It was difficult to enjoy my meal piles of dirty plates and no water in any of our glasses. I was so thirsty that I got up and served myself water. We had 3 people at our table, and I had to take all of our plates up to the cart myself each time because we were ignored the whole visit. No one would do anything. 
Also my favorite items, the paneer tikka masala and butter chicken were missing from the buffet. These items are the reason I come to kohinoor. Usually scarce items are refilled. But these items didn't even exist at all the past two times I have visited! What happened? We have been trying out other Indian buffets. I think it is time to look for a new favorite.
