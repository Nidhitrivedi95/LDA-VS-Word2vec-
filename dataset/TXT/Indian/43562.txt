rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ I don't rate Indian food highly easily having eaten authentic all the time. That said, my spouse (the chef in the family) and I are both big fans of the food here! Egg Curry, Bhindi, Dahi Poori, Mushroom Masala and salty lassi are all to die for! They even make a couple things as good as her (gasp!!). Cannot speak for the meats but the way they make everything, I'd imagine it to be super tasty as well! 

The ONLY thing I would improve would be the speed of service. They get backed up usually from ~7:15 to 9:00 so set aside an hour+ if you go during that window. I have been there 4 times already, which for me is a lot for any single establishment, much less one I'm picky about.
