I3YOFwPRQB_bSY3NDUyJNw Tried this place for the first time yesterday and liked what I saw and had. We tried coriander dosa, paper masala doesa, Patiala idly (was ok as it had more of butter chicken flavor, not a personal choice) and vagar idly (loved it). All were really good. 
I must add that food is little on a spicy side and is a bit of a fusion of north and south spices.

I look forward to trying other items on the menu and bring my friends and family.

Ambiance: 3 stars. The location has a lot of potential to trendy and vibrant.
Service: 4 stars
