U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw Friendly wait staff. Not a fancy place using Corning ware for dishes. Prices were a little high but ok. Had the lentil soup which I though was excellent with the right amount of spice. Had the shrimp Madras - medium heat. It could have been a bit spicer . The Madras had a sweet undertone, which I though was unusual.
Overall, give them a try
