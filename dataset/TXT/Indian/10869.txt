A2aeHV_EsLIxEqRthPoujQ I'd been eyeing this place since before they opened, and I finally got to try it out! My mother and aunt had been here for their lunch buffet when the price was still $9.99 on weekdays, and my mother said it was good, so I knew it was on my to-try list.

We got there at about 12pm, and there were no other customers in the restaurant. That sent up warning signals everywhere. However, service was attentive and friendly, so we stayed and we went to get food from the buffet. I'm glad we did. The food is fresh and hot and delicious. 

Highlights:

Saag paneer - spinach and cheese curry. I'm a sucker for a good saag paneer. This one was mildly spicy, and may have been my favorite dish at Mayur.

Butter chicken - I appreciate it when a buffet still takes the time to use tandoori chicken in their butter chicken. I could definitely taste the BBQ flavor of the chicken. Something seemed a tad off about the butter chicken sauce though. It was a tad too...bright? It lacked a flavor depth I was looking for. This is my opinion though. My friend loved it.

Goat curry - so flavorful. So tender. So good. Not too spicy.

Yogurt - Cuz yogurt takes the edge off of spicy food. One of my friends was worried about the spice, and one of the waitresses was nice enough to recommend that she have the yogurt with her food, and then even walked her to where the yogurt was so she could get some. It worked!

Naan - Served in a basket. Hot from the kitchen. Bottom is thin and crispy. Top has lovely air pockets and is soft and fluffy. I used more naan to scoop up all the sauce on my plate than I probably should have eaten in one serving.

There are a bunch of chutneys and sauces I didn't try, but they all looked good too.

Very good for the price. Can't wait to come again!
