iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I love the food and used to frequent this place quite often. This all changed last Friday when I ran into the manager Steven. He turned us away due to the fact that we didn't have reservations. When I suggested that we could sit outside his response was that it was too hot. Upon telling him that we don't mind he replied that he only had one bus boy. I will never understand why Steven was so adamant about turning us away but Marigold Maison has lost a loyal customer. Steven should not deal with customers as he does not have a single customer service bone in his body.
