He had the tikka masala and I had the chicken tandoori, sharing  basmati rice and naan bread. My meal was utter perfection. The service was adequate, we were not in any sort of hurry. My only complaint is that I wished the buffet option was available for dinner. I will definitely go there the next time I am in Vegas.
