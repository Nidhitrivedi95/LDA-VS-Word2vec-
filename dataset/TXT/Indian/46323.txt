A word of caution...when they say hot, they mean HOT! I am Indian and I ordered the chicken tikka masala roti as very spicy and I was on fire! the saag aalo roti was medium spicy and that was perfect for me.  Also, the portions are huge and I ate mine for 2 meals...:-) Overall, I loved the Rotis and crave it in Los Angeles now!
