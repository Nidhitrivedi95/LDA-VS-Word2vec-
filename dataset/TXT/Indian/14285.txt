c_ZDTkfDlfzLm0a3osk1ow Indian Paradise is my favorite buffet in Phoenix. I was thrilled to find Indian Paradise 2 just opened down the street from my office.  Located right at the NE corner of I-17 and bell, just next to the Shell Station. I don't remember what the restaurant was before, it's a nice newer building with rustic decor facing south on Bell. 

Only open a month, I found the food on the lunch buffet as delicious as I remembered from Indian Paradise. I had the Palek Paneer, Chicken Curry, and Chicken Tika Masala.  All great. We ordered some Dosai and everyone loved it.
I'm not an authority on Indian food, but I love it. This is much better than any Indian Buffet on the Avenues.

I'm excited to have such a great place for lunch closer to where I live and work.

The service was great and very attentive. 

I'll be back many times.
