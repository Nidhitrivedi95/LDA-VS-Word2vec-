Great atmosphere. Friendly Service. Food is simply amazing.

This is NOT your typical Toronto Indian fare. This is Indian fine dining. The food is light and airy with aromatics that will knock you off your feet.

The Dungeness Crab Biryani is perfectly balanced and just lovely.

Can't wait to go back!
