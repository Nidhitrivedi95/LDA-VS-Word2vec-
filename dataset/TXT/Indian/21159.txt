GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA My boyfriend and I LOVED Curry Corner. The servers were awesome and the food was amazing. We got:

Tiki Masala Fries - 11 out of 10 recommend
Cheesy naan - warm, delicious, and perfectly cheesy
beef hummus - yummy as well
platter with different curries and meats - everything was very flavor and delicious
