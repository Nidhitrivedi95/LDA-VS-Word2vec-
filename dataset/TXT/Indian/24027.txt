GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg Great place to dine. The shop closes at 2:30 p.m. and I showed up at 2:30 p.m. not only did he leave his doors open for me he asked if I wanted to dine in. My food was made to order and it was delicious I had the lentil soup. I will definitely come back great customer service
