XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw I want to give three stars because the place looks like it could use a deep clean and a little updating but I have to give four because the food was so good! 

Our waiter brought us water right away. No ice in the water, what's up with that? He also didn't ask if we wanted anything other than water to drink. 

We ordered the mixed naan plate. It came with eight half piece of naan. Some were plain with herbs and garlic. Some were stuffed with potatoes and peas and herbs. They were all yummy. 

For my entree, I forget what it's called but it's chicken in a cashew sauce with golden raisins and spices. It was so good! I loved it! Honestly, I could care less about the chicken part. The sauce was just wonderful! I put it over the rice and scooped it up with pieces of naan and it was so delicious. You know when you're a kid and your mom makes some kind of meat in some kind of sauce and ladles it over rice and it's warm and comforting? It was just like that. It's like a hug for your stomach.

Overall, pretty good experience. I'm not sure the prices match the quality of the food. My bill alone came to $17 before tip.
