ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg My wife and I came here with our almost 2 year old daughter for the lunch buffet around 1pm on a Saturday. We walked in and we were the only diners, which i thought was odd. We were immediately greeted by a host and sat down at a comfy booth. The host took our naan order (garlic) and we got waters and one manjo lassi drink to share.  The magno lassi was delicious. The selection of food is nice and the plates aren't too big so it really helps to limit the amount of food each diner can take so people don't waste food. I tried the samosas, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and vegetable pakora. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. Even my daughter tried almost everything on our plates. The taste was great. It could've been hotter, but the food was not cold. The samosas are so amazing and the naan was also great as it was not too doughy or thick. It was flakey and light with a nice amount of garlic. Overall we were very happy and will be coming back soon. Our alternative would be Delhi indian buffet, but it's way further from us and this place has all of my favorite items. They serve fish pakora too, but i didn't try it. Best of all they serve hot gulab jamon in syrup, which is my favorite dessert. Check this place out! They are doing it right! I hope they get busier and stay for awhile. I'm happy to say that several more people came in after us that also seemed to be first timers.
