a8o8OMGhWg4JwbuMMnVOHQ This is my first review so I'll try to be kind...went with a group of 8 for my birthday...Place was really busy so that was a good sign...service didn't go so well. We did have have to wait a very long time for the food and had to talk to the manager twice...who by the way did come to our table afterwards to apologize as well as the waiter who offered to pay for dessert, which in my eye did show ownership of the issue. All our food was served except mine...and had to be asked what my order was...:(

Food was good but it could also be the fact that I was hungry after waiting.  

I do love the fact that they have a variety of items however this could be the reason for delays in service. Simplicity in the menu might be food for thought.

Restaurant decor was nice and clean. I do however think they should get rid of there ordering system which is by tablet since I believe that also caused some delays with the server taking our order and my food. Also when someone orders water please I would hope in the future they ask bottled or from tap since some people have preferences and don't prefer and over charge on there bill.

All in all I would give the night a 3 star. I would go back and give them a second chance on there service only because of the food quality.

I hope my first review will help them improve and stay tuned for the next great review...)
