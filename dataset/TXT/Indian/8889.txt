7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg What a wonderful place this lovely and cozy Indian Restaurant is. Had Mumbai Martini which was good although a bit sweet to my taste buds. They do have ton of wines/beers/hard liquor on the menu. Had their spicy Gobi for appetizer, it was delicious. Nice kick to it. Had the Goat Chettinad with Onion Kulcha, yumm. So so good. For dessert had the pistachio kulfi, which was okay. Hence 4 stars. But the main course and appetizer were finger licking good. One of the best Indian food I had in USA. I will for sure visit again.
