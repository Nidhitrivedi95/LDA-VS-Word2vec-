DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Delightfully surprised by this place!  Wasn't sure what to expect since the description is Nepali/Indian... but from my somewhat limited Indian food expertise- it seemed very authentic, but most of all delicious. Service was very friendly and attentive. Started the meal with two King Fisher beers. We shared the samosa appetizer, which was unique compared to others I have had, the little dough pocket was chopped open and topped with onions cilantro, chick peas and yogurt. Very complex flavors, earthy, with just enough heat (I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy!). I ordered a mild/medium chicken Tikka Masala and my husband had the chicken curry, medium/hot.  They even have popcorn chicken and fries on the kids menu!  Definitely will be our new go to Indian spot. They deliver, have a full bar, and a buffet during the week for lunch.
