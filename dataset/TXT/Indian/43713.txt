RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Love this place. We always have a good meal here. The food is always really hot and fresh. We always order samosas, mutter paneer, korma, chicken tikka masala, Chana masala. Like I said never disappoints. We also really like the chutneys they serve. The staff is always very friendly and never makes us feel awkward about being there during the last hour they are open if we grab a late dinner. They are also so good about keeping your water filled.

Definitely order off of the menu for the best food. Buffet can be hit or miss.
