PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Great little spot.  No frills, just awesome food.  Superb flavors and spices.  I would highly recommend this spot for a great meal.  I had the Chicken Special Byrani and the Aoloo Gobi with garlic naan bread!  Fantastic, I was in food heaven,  This is my spot from now on.  The service was excellent as well.  Must put on your food list.
