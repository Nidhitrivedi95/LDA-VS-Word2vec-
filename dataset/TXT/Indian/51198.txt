utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw Drove to Madison to meet up with my brother and his wife to catch a movie on a Saturday night.  Got into town early so that we could grab a bite to eat.  As I don't get it often, I chose Indian food, and picked this place based on the reviews I found on Yelp.  Glad we chose it.  Very friendly staff and the food was excellent.  We had Samosas, the Lamb Madras Curry and the Butter Chicken (my wife's favorite), and a couple orders of Naan.  Both my wife and I ordered our food medium spicy-usually I like mine spicier but knowing I would be sitting through a long movie I thought that discretion was the better part of valor this time around.  At the medium level, there was just a bit of heat to it.  Would have liked it a bit hotter, as it felt more like mild, but again I love hot foods.  Definitely worth checking it out if you find yourself over on the east side of Madison over by I-94.
