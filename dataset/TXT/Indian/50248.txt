We went after hitting the Botanical Garden hard for most of the day and needing an unfussy meal to eat, Big Bang Theory-style, around the hotel sofa while we put our feet up. (My sister-in-law bagged Sheldon's spot.) 

The chicken and vegetarian dishes were both excellent, and the naan bread especially so. Welcoming, counter-style service, no wifi (talking to each other when eating in the restaurant is, instead, encouraged) and no credit/debit cards.
