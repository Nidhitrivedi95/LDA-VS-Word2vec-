8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ We drove by and wanted to give it a try with it's intriguing name.  Ordered take it-butter chicken and two pieces of naan.   The butter chicken was tasty BUT for $14 in a small take out container I would expect more than four small bite size pieces of chicken.  The naan was very good and not burnt.  My rating is based on value for dinner.  I will try it next time for lunch where it looks like many yelpers gave it better reviews.
