KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Amazing spot and I can't wait to go back. Western comfort food meets exotic Indian flavours. We had the butter chicken mac and cheese plus the T-Bolt sandwich. The mac and cheese was a perfect combo and the ultimate comfort food (would love to see a fully loaded version with maybe some cilantro and tandoori bacon). The T-Bolt perfectly crispy naan and gooey in the middle. Plus TANDOORI BACON! Amazing, just wow. The samosas were equally mind-blowing. Also the staff was really friendly and nice. Definitely need to go back. This place is a must try!
