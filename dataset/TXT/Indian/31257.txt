KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw OMG is all I can say! There aren't enough adjectives to describe how good the food was. My husband and I tried the butter chicken fries, TBolt and Punjabi Cheeseburger. It was all excellent! Perfectly spiced and seasoned, came out in great time and hot! My husband is Italian and I'm Punjabi, and it perfectly met both our tastes. 

Service was great and friendly, Rick and his wife specifically take their time to say hello, make recommendations and say thanks and goodbye. We will definitely be back again! 

Being a Canadian born Indian, my many thanks to Rick for actualizing all my food fantasies.

The only complaint my husband and I have, we wish we could eat more! The Punjabi Fried Chicken feature looked delicious, we regret not trying it
