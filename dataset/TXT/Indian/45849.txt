SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg if i could rate this purely on taste, they would have gotten 4 or 5. 

i ordered the tandori and samosa. taste was good but it was very expensive and didnt come with anything but the entree. IT HAD NO RICE OR NAN ORANYTHING! whatkind indian restaurant serves food without damn rice. a small side order of rice is 4.50. WTF?! 

i came in with a friend and we were the only 2 people inside the ''diner." 

truthfully honestly, the 2 owners watched us every second we were in there. they watched when we ate watched when we paid, watched every single fukn minute we were in there. very uncomfortable. stupid place. great taste
