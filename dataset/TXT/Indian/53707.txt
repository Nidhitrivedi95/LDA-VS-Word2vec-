ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA Wasn't excellent. Indian fare buffets always appeal to me - and being in Vegas I guess my standards were too high. Dry, chewy chicken. Tandoori tasted like freezer burn. The butter chicken was actually hardboil eggs in sauce. Rice was incredibly dry and hard. Wasn't busy at all, myself and another table. Two tables sat dirty the entire course of my meal. At one point the server refilled my water while having a conversation on her cellphone. My naan arrived at the end of my rough meal. Will pass.
