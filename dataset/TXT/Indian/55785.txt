x8iQ_8ugXbNlNqWqaG33Iw A friend of a friend recommended this place. We went there with friends and guests. Was disappointed with the food. 
The samosas didn't have any flavor and had big chunks of potato which still needed to be mashed. They hadn't been deep fried to the level they should either - looked like heated out of a microwave or maybe in an oven. 
We ordered biryani, garlic naan, usual naan and roti. These were ok. 
The chicken vindaloo, palak paneer, dal makhni, bhuna meat, mixed raita were not good. The sauces were all too thick. 
I was amazed to find out that the cooks are from Chandigarh and Delhi - even average people from Chandigarh and Delhi (ie non cooks) know what consistency curry sauces should be. The flavor was lacking as well. Usually vindaloo is the hottest thing on the menu but here you couldn't tell it was even meant to be spicy. 
So disappointed :-(
