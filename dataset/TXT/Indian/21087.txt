Almost everything I have eaten here  (4 or so visits), has been really good.  I really liked their samosas, chicken tikka, lamb biryani, dal, and saag paneer.  I didn't care too much for the channa masala or the murgh achari. Also, their naan is awesome, they are hands down the best I've had in the valley! 

The staff members are polite and many of them take care to ensure their customers are having an enjoyable experience.  The service is typically quick, but when its busy the service does lag.  Its not unusual to see people awkwardly standing by the door waiting to be seated.  But once a staff member comes to seat you, you're set since they are very accommodating in making room to seat waiting patrons.

If you want to eat South Asian food in Tempe this is the place to go, they have quality food and reasonable prices.
