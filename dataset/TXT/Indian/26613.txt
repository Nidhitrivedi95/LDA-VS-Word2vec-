ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg The food here was amazing. They even got us in for dinner with no wait at 7pm on a Saturday. So you ask why the 2 stars? We had a male Indian waiter, who took 20 minutes to come ask us what we wanted to drink. This is the only time we saw him. The busgirl and busboy brought us our drink refills and food. So when the meal was over my wife, who is Indian, asked the busgirl if the waiters split the tip with them since they (the table busser) do all the work. The girl said no. So my wife gave the busgirl a cash tip. My wife also decided not to tip the male Indian waiter since he basically did nothing. On the way home my wife checks her bank account and notices the male waiter added for himself a 20% tip. Needless to say we were pissed! We will NEVER, and I mean NEVER dine at this establishment again. Food is great, sketchy waiters.
