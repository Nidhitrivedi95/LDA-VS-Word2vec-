NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Hands down my go to fast food in the Cleveland suburb area. I would hesitate to call it fast food - since it's fast but the quality is insane. Slow roasted chicken that I've never gotten cartilage or fatty bits in. And that's saying a lot because I get it every time and it's never disappointed. My go to is the chicken BBQ with regular naan and either the lentil soup, chickpea masala or tikka masala. I also get mango sauce on the side and maybe a samosa if I have someone to split them with. So I go here when I'm exhausted and I just don't want to cook but need great food. Very healthy, very sanitary, very good quality especially for such a great price I'd pay every night if I didn't think I'd get tired of eating Indian food every night. I love their hand washer by the way.
