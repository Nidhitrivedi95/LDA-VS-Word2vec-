Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw My boyfriend and I had been excited to try this place.  The food was good, but the service was not great.

I had ordered the garlic naan bread and had been excited to eat it with my chicken tikka masala.  It did not come until after we were done with our food.  We had ordered it 40 minutes prior to the time it came out.  

We ended up being charged twice for the bread even though it was 40 minutes late.  When we explained that there was an extra charge on our bill, nothing was done to fix the situation.  We ended up just paying double for the 40-minute late naan and heading out.  

Nobody ever checked on us to see if we wanted more water and my boyfriend did not get any coffee or tea with his plate and this was supposed to have been included.

I am willing to try this again since we may have a different server since the food was okay.
