XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I love their back patio.  So quiet for being on Queen street.  So I'd go there just to sit there, but fortunately, the food is good too!  I haven't been their for lunch specials during the week and unfortunately, they don't have them on the weekends.
I've had their beef momos and their andmo beef momos (did I get that spelling right?).  The chow mein noodles are good.  And I had a veggie dish.  Everything was good.  So a good place for supper...but eating there at lunch is more pricey than I'd like.  
Owner is very nice and accommodating.  A good option if you're looking for a patio.
