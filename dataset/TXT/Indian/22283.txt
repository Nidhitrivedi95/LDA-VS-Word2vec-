GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Had the buffet lunch at the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers.  I really enjoyed my lunch.  The food was flavorful and the service was very nice.  I ordered a glass of wine and the charge was very reasonable at $6.00 for a glass of chardonnay.  I will return to the restaurant.  My favorites on the buffet were the chicken curry and the spinach dish.  Good value and a good lunch on the strip.
