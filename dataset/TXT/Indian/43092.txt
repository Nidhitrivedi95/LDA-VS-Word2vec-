RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg I've traveled to Madison quite often over the past few years from CA but I've always stayed near the capitol. This time I needed to stay closer to the airport so I picked a hotel close by to Om Fusion Cuisine. Being from CA and being Indian myself, I was exceedingly impressed with the quality of the food from Om Fusion. I ordered delivery because I just didn't have the energy to leave my hotel room and not only was the service and delivery time perfect, the food was amazing. I cannot believe how big the portions are. Maybe it's because I live in the Bay Area, but I was astounded at the massive amount of rice provided for me for just one entree!! I ordered the Paneer Tikka and the Malabar Fish Curry. Both were excellent, not oily or greasy or overly salty like at other Indian restaurants. It's a shame that it was only me because the meal lasted for over 3 days for me!  The Paneer Tikka came with a choice of Dal Tadka or Chole and I opted for the Dal Tadka. Absolutely fantastic and tasted like something my mom would have made. Thank you Om Fusion for the delicious meal and I hope to stop by next time I'm in Madison to sample more of your delicious cuisine!
