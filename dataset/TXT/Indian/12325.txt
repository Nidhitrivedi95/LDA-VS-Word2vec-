auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ After a 3 day hectic trip we were back to Vegas and decided to pick our dinner from this restaurant. Some parathas, a gravy and a biryani. We reach home drop dead tired and sit for dinner. Here is what I find, all d breads had such a foul smell and were burnt. It was like the dough had gone bad but the chef still decided to go ahead and made the breads from that. We could have ignored the burn on the breads but the smell. So at 10 in the night even after spending more than 60 bucks for two, we had nothing to eat. (Gravy n biryani were not too great) I was really upset,  the breads went into the dustbin but I preserved one of them in the fridge to show them the next day. Nobody has the time to do that but I decided to as I was reallly upset. So when I took the bread to the restaurant and they were like do u need anymore food. I asked them to refund and the waiter Raj brings $3 for the one bread I had brought to them. I was really taken aback by his audacity to say that. Sorry that I didnt pick them from the dustbin and brought all of it. 
I guess mistakes happen but how you handle them shows your character.
