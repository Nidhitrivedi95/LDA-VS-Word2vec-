Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ My friend and I decided to embark on a food adventure to eat all the restaurants featured on Toronto Life article of the best new restaurants in 2016! Tich was one of the restaurants featured plus it was on "You gotta eat here." We had high expectations.

We were set on the Malabar Lobster and Prawn Curry, butter chicken and Bengali Fish curry. Surprisingly, the lobster and prawn curry fell flat. I was not impressed with it. The curry wasn't as flavourful. The lobster wasn't fresh. The butter chicken was easily my favourite. I used every piece of that naan bread to get all the sauce off the bowl. On the other hand, the fish curry was ok. It wasn't memorable at all. 

I love the naan bread and the butter chicken but everything else sorta disappointed me. Perhaps my expectations were very high. I had better Indian food in downtown Toronto.
