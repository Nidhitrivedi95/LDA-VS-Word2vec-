h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA oh lord what a good place to get some yummy, authentic indian food. I went there with a friend. Upon entering, I was instantly transported back to some of my indian friends parent's restaurants from my chidlhood. The ambiance is from another time which can be good or bad depending on your perspective. The owners serve the food and are very kind and attentive.

We ordered some samosas which were delicious. We then had chicken tikka masala, my favorite. It was so creamy with tender chicken pieces just melting in my mouth. We had rice with it and both garlic and plain naan. So tasty. Very good quality food. An older woman who reminded me of mom came out and asked if we wanted rice. It was very sweet.

At the end of the meal, we were blessed with "sweet balls" ( :) i can't remember what they are called). these were on the house and were absolutely wonderful as well. I have to say that I really don't have any complaints. I also didn't find the neighbor hood to be all that bad. We went there around 6p. 

If you are in the area and looking for some great indian food, this is definately the place. Actually i would probably drive a good distance to go here.
