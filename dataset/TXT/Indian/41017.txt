PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q YUM! We were introduced to this place by native Pittsburghers, who took us there for the all-you-can-eat buffet on a Sunday. And if you're like me, you can eat alot when it's good. And this is good. HUGE veggie selection, and tandoori that isn't oddly pink. More condiments than usual, buttery naan, and decent price make it better than most.
