TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Good cooking here, for a hole in the wall place.
Service was poor, one person for the whole dining
room, cashier and hostess, 1 person doing it all.
I arrived at 1pm, sadly they do not refresh their buffet!!!
it was dried up. It still tasted fine, but not very apetizing.
So get there early. And enjoy the super oily naan!
