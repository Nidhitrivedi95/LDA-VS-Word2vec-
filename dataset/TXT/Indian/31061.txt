kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w Yesterday I brought my boyfriend for the first time. I've been 4 times. Twice for the buffet. And twice for dinner. I LOVE this place and their food! So we went to peacock on university cause it was close awhile back and we were the only people in there. The manager cooked and brought us the food, it was burnt and disgusting. My boyfriend was so disgusted by the food he never wanted Indian again until I got him to agree for a buffet, I knew if I ever wanted Indian food dates again I needed to bring him over here for redemption. He loved all the food, especially the butter chicken and spicy rice. He's also big on water refills and can down maybe 6-7 cups and they were on top of keeping our drinks refilled. I can't wait to come back. Thank you for consistent amazing service.
