wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Fantastic new spot in South Scottsdale. Yelp did not disappoint yet again with this find. Went there with a couple of friends tonight and ordered everything family style. Everything we got was amazing! 

Garlic Naan
Lamb Saab
Ginger chicken kabobs
Chicken Bhuna
Side of briyanis

...I really don't think you could go wrong here. All of the dishes we had were seriously delicious. The lamb saab was my favorite, though. 
And not only was the food great, but the service was on point. The owner came and talked to us for a bit. Apparently he has a successful restaurant in Prescott and decided to open this place up in Scottsdale about 4 months ago. He was so sweet and funny, and he gave really great recommendations and explanations. Best of all, he gave us coupons for our next visit, which will definitely be happening soon!
