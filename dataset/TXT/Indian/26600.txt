ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg The 2 stars is for the nice bartender, and the hostess was nice.  Visiting from out of town.

The rest-- well, hum... 2 food items were good- the Cauliflower was really good- The Dhal was good.

They don't have a tandoori oven, so their breads are not authentic tasting.  I tasted flour in a couple, but a couple definitely tasted like freezer naan from Trader Joes.

I doubt their chutneys were home made- definitely the sweet one tasted out of a jar.

Service was weird.  They were not packed.  While the server was friendly- he never checked with us, he never offered anything.  

Prob not go back here.
