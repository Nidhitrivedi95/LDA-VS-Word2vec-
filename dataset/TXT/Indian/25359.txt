Before Saffron, I wasn't really into Indian cuisine, nor have I been exposed to it more than once or twice in my life. I've had this place mentally bookmarked for a long time as something new and daring to try, and after putting it off several times to try other, "safer" restaurants, I finally forced myself to go. All it made me do is wonder why I waited so long.

I went for the Sunday lunch buffet. The decor was very welcoming with clean tables, burgundy walls, and very large windows letting the sun light up the dining area. They let us sit wherever we wanted, and we were immediately given the green light to head to the buffet table.  The next hour or so was pure bliss. I had so many reservations about an Indian buffet (Is it clean? Fresh? Is it going to be meaty enough? Is there enough variety?), and after my first plate, they were all answered with a resounding "YES." I wish I could remember all of the dishes, but the ones that stood out to me were the chicken curry, another chicken dish (karahi?), alu vindaloo, malai kofta, and the samosas with red sauce. I have no idea if the sauce was intended for the samosa, but I tried it after seeing a regular do it, and it improved tenfold. The green chutney was also good--it tasted just like pico de gallo.

I wasn't as impressed with the tandoori chicken or saffron rice, both of which were dry and tough. I opted for the endless naan in place of the rice, and they were cooked to warm, doughy perfection. Last thing to note is that everything was mild, spice-wise, which can be good or bad depending on personal preference. I would have liked a little more of a kick, but nothing to make me break a sweat.

Since Sunday, I've been craving and yearning to go back every single day this week. 4.5 stars rounded up for Saffron Patch.
