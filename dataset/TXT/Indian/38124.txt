That being said, it's a bit overpriced and pretentious. The menu looked like upscale Indian, and lacked some basics. When the food arrived it wasn't any better than your average mom & pop Indian formulaic shop. I admit the bread basket was heavenly.
We were introducing some friends to the world of Indian cuisine and would have been happier elsewhere.
