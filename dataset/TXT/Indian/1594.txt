-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Two years ago, I had the pleasure of eating out at this restaurant several times. There were plenty of vegetables and meat selections for a Paleo-oriented eater like myself. But then the management changed hands.

The buffet changed. Everything consisted of (cheaper) carbs and heavy sugared sauces that aren't even Indian based, but which are horrid knockoff versions of adulterated Chinese.

I gave this newly managed restaurant two tries, and then gave up. Awful food, at least for the buffet. If you want healthy Indian, skip the buffet (I don't know what the a la carte menu is like) and try somewhere else.
