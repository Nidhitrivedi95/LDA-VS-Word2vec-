TWmfrj9DjmG_B28j6cU6Zg I go here for takeout about once a week for rice and two/three "items," which are basically stews or dips. 

Like another reviewer mentioned, it's a cafeteria-style place, and you never actually know what you're ordering because the different options available are not labeled. There must be about eight or ten. 

The staff have always been super friendly, and I've never had to wait more than a minute or two for my order to be ready.

Don't go here for the atmosphere, because you won't find it. It's a takeout joint, in essence. The food is better than I've had at a couple of other Indian/fusion sit-down restaurants in the area, and it's much cheaper.
