Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Ordered shrimp pakora, paneer biryani, and chilli fish. Took an hour and a half to get everything and it wasn't even packed. Portions were pretty small compared to most hakka places I've been too and food wasn't that great tasting; it was more greasy than spicy. I'll stick with Danforth Dragon any day.
