3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ This is my favorite Indian buffet in Phoenix and this is coming from a real Indian! The selection is excellent with an unreal amount of desserts and drinks (classy touch adding chai to drink) plus you get fresh naan and dosa....yummy!

What I really Love about this restaurant is the excellent prompt service you receive. The owner always ask his everything is and always makes sure you leave happy.
