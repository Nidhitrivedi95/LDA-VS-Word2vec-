epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg This is a very basic restaurant that only has a few tables and nothing fancy in décor. But they don't need too because they make delicious Roti. My dad and I stopped there after visiting nearby tourist attractions and I was in the mood for Indian and consulted yelp to find out what's near by. My dad got Moli kopha (sorry for the misspellings) and I got butter chicken. Both were very good although my dad didn't know what to expect since he never had Roti before.  Very good, and if you're in the neighborhood, I recommend you check it out.
