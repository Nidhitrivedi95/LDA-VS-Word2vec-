llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g When the smiley hostess comes to you and asks "Do you want bread?" Your answer should always be "yes please!" About the food, it's all delicious! Great flavors, hot, fresh, and really good! I have not had much Indian food but this is definitely on top of the list. The selection could absolutely be better but what they got to offer is made with great quality, specially the lamb... And here's where the bread comes handy. The sauce is right on point, and the bread makes it all the perfect bite. I don't know if I was just hungry, or if today was just a good cook day... But I hope they keep it up, and be ready for a repeat when I come back.
