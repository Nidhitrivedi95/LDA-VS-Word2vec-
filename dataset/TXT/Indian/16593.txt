DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Every time we drive by Udupi Cafe, we think about stopping in & finally we got the chance to! We were really hoping for the buffet, but they only have that in the morning (11am-3pm daily).

After browsing the menu, we opted for the vegetable manchurian & the South Indian Thali. The Vegetable Manchurian was really tasty & was a very large portion (it was definitely priced well considering the quantity); the manchurian was a not very spicy, which I appreciated as I'm not a huge fan of spicy food (silly, I know, considering South Indian food is always really spicy). The South Indian Thali was very large as well & contained really spicy items ... It was also worth the money.

The service was good - it wasn't very busy on the week night that we went on & they had a new waitress - she asked us a couple of times if she could get anything out of the way when there was clearly still food remaining on all the plates - we didn't mind as she did note it was her first day. We'd definitely recommend this restaurant & will be back!
