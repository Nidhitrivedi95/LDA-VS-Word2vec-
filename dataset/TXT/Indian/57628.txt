yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw i really liked the food here. i would be kidding myself if i wrote that i remembered what i ordered, but it was vegan. 
the menu is enormous and it took us about 10 minutes to get through it. however, the staff never rushed us. in fact, they offered assistance in deciphering what we might best be suited for. 
and you know what else is great? they actually play indian music in the background...and have an indian hostess! 
for 2 entrees, a mango lassi, an app, a garlic naan....50 bucks. with a coupon...20 bucks. had plenty of leftovers for another meal.

check out the store next door. it has those microwave indian stews that you add rice. these packets are so delicious and quick.
