YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA I ordered delivery from here.

I specifically asked for no cilantro. No cilantro. I even said "please", because I'm polite like that. Not only did every dish have cilantro in it, but it did not seem to be just cilantro that was cooked in; cilantro was added in top. Generously. Like, tonnes of it. On the soup, on the vegetarian dish, and on the chicken dish.

Very disappointing.

(I get that they can't make certain dishes to order without cilantro. I do. If I ran a restaurant and someone mentioned a food intolerance, I'd either accommodate it, OR tell the customer that the intolerance couldn't be accommodated and suggest alternative dishes.)
