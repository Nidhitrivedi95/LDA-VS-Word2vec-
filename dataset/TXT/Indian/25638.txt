hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw This is the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas by far!  We have tried most of their menu items and everything is prepared well - the lamb is tender as is the chicken.  They are able to prepare dishes with great flavors that are not nearly as spicy as most Indian food.  The Lamb Mantra & Chicken Sag are favorites as are the Onion Kulcha & Garlic Naan.  Prices are very reasonable - we always bring home enough for a 2nd meal.
