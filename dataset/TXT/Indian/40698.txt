PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw First visit.
Take out.
Staff was very friendly.
Place was clean.
Food was delicious.
Tried my go to dish - Chicken Tikka Masala and one I never had before Achari Murgh... and some garlic naan.
Tikka was excellent!
Achari Murgh was new to me but I really liked it! 
This place is more cost effective than the other Indian cuisine spots in the area and IMHO taste better as well.
I will be back.
