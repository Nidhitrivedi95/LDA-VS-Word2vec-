Although this is a strictly vegetarian restaurant and we are non vegetarian we don't miss meat here. There is a huge assortment of delicious unique curries.  No two taste the same and there's always a great selection.  The service is fast and friendly.   They always let you know that soft drinks are included in the buffet and keep the waters full and make sure the  plates are bussed.  This is just simply good food, and must be tried if you're near Pearson International Airport. An easy 5 star recommendation.
