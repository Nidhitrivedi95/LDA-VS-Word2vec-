qef9g4duOwjA_eKm-tISAQ I have walked past this place so many times and dismissed it as an odd Indian takeaway at best. However it appears to have had a make over. Up stairs only a few tables and mainly set up for take away, down stairs has seating for 50. We went on a Wednesday night about 8pm so we were the only table in. We were however given a warm welcome. The service was great, the food very tasty and very reasonably priced and to top it off its BYOB. I will definitely try here again either sitting in it take away.
