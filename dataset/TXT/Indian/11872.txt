AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ Located in downtown core, and it's completely empty during lunch on a workday. Upon arrival, we noticed that there was only one guy working. Super nice, and super friendly. 

Four funny/interesting/weird things happened:
1. This is an Indian restaurant. For one of the beef dishes, it stated that it's their best and you have to try it.
2. They ran out of beef.
3. I ordered lamb, they ran out of lamb too.
4. Couple typos in the menu.

Lots of things were on the house and we got to sample some chips and a dessert. I got the chicken biyriani and it was pretty good. Decent price, decent portion.
