LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA My mother brought home takeout from this place. I have read the raves on Yelp and was eager to try this spot! I don't know exactly what I ordered but it was delicious. Simple vegetarian food, chutneys were so good. One was a white coconut, mint, and a spicy sauce. All delicious on the rice too. I will dine in next time to have fresh dosas.
