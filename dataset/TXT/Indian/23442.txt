gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Being an ex-pat Brit, I've searched for many years for the best Indian restaurant in my adopted home. A couple of years ago I discovered this wonderful restaurant almost on my doorstep. At last I found my "go to" place for a curry away from "home". I come here nearly every week and of course it's nice to be warmly welcomed by the owner Prakash, and his staff and then to be treated so well. I and other members of my family have probably had everything on the menu but being a creature of habit, my favorites are: lamb saag, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, mushroom mutter masala, keema naan. These dishes are consistently fabulous. Other notables include the tandoori mix grill, kadai chicken and chicken pakora. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. Between the outstanding food and wonderful service I believe it is the very best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.
