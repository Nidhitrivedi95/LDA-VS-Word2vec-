9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g I had to give Amber a try because my friend had been talking about how great their Hyderabadi chicken briyani is. Usually, when one has high expectations, it is easy to be disappointed. But, Amber's Hyderabadi chicken briyani definitely didn't let me down, so I'm giving Amber 5 stars just for this dish. It is a huge yummy serving, beautifully presented with onions and half a hard boiled egg. The chicken (with bone) was so tender and flavorful. I had the medium (spicy-level) and it was just right. It was served with the refreshing yogurt sauce (raita), which made the dish even more delicious. And, as a bonus- the leftovers were so good the next day and the day after (huge portions!!).

Another friend tried the lamb briyani and he like it too. We also asked for some spicy sauce, and our server brought out a mild, coconut based sauce and it was delicious! 

One of the things I look forward to is the papadams, unfortunately there was a basket of papadams already on the table when we got there, and it was rather soggy :(

Service wise, we had a very pleasant, relaxing, and happy dining experience. I'll be very happy to dine at Amber again.
