PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g What happened?   I've been coming here on and off for years and always loved the food here, in particular the  Prawns Pakora.  Where I  came here in the spring, I was not disappointed.  I came again last week and did not see the Prawns Pakora on the menu any more.  Instead they had some new and different items like Brie Pakora which seems like an odd addition.  Our server was lovely and very attentive, and when I asked about the Prawns Pakora, she said they had them despite the fact that it was nowhere to be found on the menu.  We ordered them along with some other items.  Unfortunately, something has changed dramatically:  they were nothing like they used to be.  The butter chicken was also disappointing in that the sauce was pretty sweet and tomato-ey.
Overall, I felt like the food had lost its authenticity and I'm wondering why that is.  Not sure if I want to come back any more and am heartbroken that one of my favourite Indian restaurants has descended to such levels.
