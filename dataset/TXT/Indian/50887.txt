uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w I don't know why it took me so long to try this place, but I am in love with their tikka masala! And vegi korma. And their pakoras are great! The buffet is also a decent deal, though I'm always too full after one plate to go back for another one.

The only critique I really have is that I wish they had their own delivery service, since Mr. Delivery's fees are ridiculous, but I get that it's probably not financially viable to have drivers. Ah well, I can just call in orders for pick up. :)
