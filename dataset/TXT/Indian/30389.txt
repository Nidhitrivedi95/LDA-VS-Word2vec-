K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Bar none, this is the best Indian food in the WORLD.  I've tried acclaimed Indian restaurants in New Delhi, Agra, Lucknow, Mumbai, Brick Lane and Southall in London, 10th Arrondissement in Paris, Murray Hill aka Curry Hill in Manhattan etc and nothing comes close to Indian Kitchen - no exaggeration.  Prince Charles' favorite curry house Aladin on Brick Lane is like eating at McDonalds compared to this place.  They have absolutely the best curries on earth, and I dare you to challenge me with a better spot, because I've been all over the world searching for it and I've yet to find it.
