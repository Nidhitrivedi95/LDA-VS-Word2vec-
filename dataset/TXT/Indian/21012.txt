GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA The food is delicious here & is one of my favorites. We were in today & my husband ordered the tandoori wings & they were not cooked. The owner even came out & we showed her. I believe that if you can't eat the food you should not have to pay for it. That is not good business! The chicken was not cooked through!! They still made us pay for it. Very unfortunate as we are regular customers. I am giving it 3 stars for this reason & not 5.
