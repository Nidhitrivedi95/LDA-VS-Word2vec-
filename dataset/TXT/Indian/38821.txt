OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I recently went there with a bunch of people and we had a meal of a lifetime!! The most amazing Pav Bhaji I have had in a while, great Vada Pav, strictly ok Manchow Soup and hakka noodles was the appetizer bit. This was followed by their super concept of bottomless curries, where we ordered Chana and Paneer Tikka. The naans were super soft and the curry was great too. Last, we had the dal tadka and steamed rice; perfect comfort food made in a very homely way.  A great dinner with spacious seating and friendly staff. Really enjoyed ourselves.

P.S.: They are good at the Mumbai stuff as mentioned above, but stay away from their Indo-Chinese. Not the best :(
