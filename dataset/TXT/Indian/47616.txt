TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Food was ok. Never expect amazing food from any of the India Palaces and Taj Mahals. There was a private party going on and the kids were running around, yelling and misbehaving. The restaurant should have closed admission to general public or have asked the private party for courtesy.

Service was good, food was mediocre. We went because this was the closest place and everything else had waiting. Rightfully so.
