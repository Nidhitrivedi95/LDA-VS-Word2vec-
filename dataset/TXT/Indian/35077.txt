mOsKIonnlHllP9gfbXdgnQ I've really tried to like this place but it disappoints me more and more each time I visit. 

At first, the portions were generous and the food was delicious. Today was the last time I'll be visiting, though. It was the third time I was given three small bits of butter chicken in a combo when previous visits I was given two heaping scoops. When my husband and I pointed it out to the server and asked for an actual serving, she spooned three more pieces in but then disappeared into the back with the container. She reemerged a minute or so later and told us she had to check if it was ok. I get it if we were asking for a huge amount but we were not. Just the same amount given to us when asking for the vegetable curry. The thing that bugs me the most is that I have no clue what actually happened to my container when it was taken out of my sight. 

Won't be returning.
