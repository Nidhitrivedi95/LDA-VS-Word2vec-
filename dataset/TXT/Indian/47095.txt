Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Been here twice and loved it both times . I am a vegetarian and had the buffet the first time . The food was super tasty and the gulab jamun tasted as if made of Khoa . The only drawback was that there were no paneer dishes in the buffet . 

I went there again today and ordered the paneer pakora , malai kofta , garlic naan and onion kulcha and everything was flavourful. I asked our server to make malai kofta spicy and it was on point . The naan and kulcha were crunchy as the same time so light , the best I have had in a while . Our server was very helpful and I ended up thanking the cook for the food .

This is by far one of the more authentic Indian restaurants in Cleveland.
