MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ For appetizer, instead of samosas they have horrible vegetable spring rolls. The naan is a little too thick.  The goat or lamb curry is way too salty.  The eggplant dish has way too much ginger in it.  The daal makhni has too much masala and not enough cream.  The rice pudding tastes like overcooked raw porridge.

The mango ice cream and the custard were the only memorable items.
