-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g This place is great! They feature a large array of menu selections to choose from on the buffet line. The restaurant has a nice contemporary theme, and is clean. I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to indulge in some good Indian food. You know a restaurant is good when the people of the culture are eating at it.
