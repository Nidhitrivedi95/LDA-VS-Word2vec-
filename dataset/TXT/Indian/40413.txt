PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA Another delicious buffet....the menu changes enough to get several different dishes each time, but the tandori chicken, and chicken tikka masala are main stays (both very tender and tasty). At least 2 kinds of rices and 6+ main selections daily...today there was a carrot (warm) desert along with the cold rice pudding....unique, just enough sweetness (likely from the carrots), and so good....the rice pudding is one of the best we have eaten....this restaurant is very consistent in flavor and heat.
