uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Eaten here a few times, the food is great especially the naan it's real and huge so if like me you normally order more than one there is really no need. 
The paneer is great, 
I've only eaten the vegetarian options but they are all amazing. 
The service is quite good and the restaurant is beautiful.
