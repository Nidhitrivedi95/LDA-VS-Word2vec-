GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw EXTREMELY trans-phobic.  I cannot remember the last time I was treated as rudely (by anyone!) as I was treated by the server last time I was at this restaurant.  In downtown Toronto, no less...

I asked the server to stop calling me (together with my friend) as "gentlemen" and he told me to stop telling him what to do and he will call me whatever the hell he feels like.  When I told him that he was being ridiculously sexist he said that if I don't like it I am welcome not to come back.  My jaw almost hit the floor.

Needless to say, I won't be back.
