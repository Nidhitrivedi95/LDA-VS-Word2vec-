MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ Full disclosure: I was born and raised in the sub-continent so my expectations are quite different from the average Joe who's view of authentic Mexican food isTaco Bell or of authentic Italian pizza is Pizza Hut. I provide these qualifications because my comments may be from a very different perspective. For American Indian food it's okay. For the real old country food it deserves no more than a 1 star. S that's the story.
