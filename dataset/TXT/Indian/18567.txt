eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Not very good, this was probably some of the worst indian food I've had.  (I've been pretty spoiled)  At one point there was something that was hard in my food and I cringed when I bit down.  I'm not sure what it was.  I'm used to very well flavored Indian food, and the curry was bland.
The service was good, and it was inexpensive, but I think I'll try some other local places first before returning.
