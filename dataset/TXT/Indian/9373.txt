8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Friendly attentive service, serving tasty Indian cuisine. I've had their biryani and lamb vindaloo. Both dishes were beautifully prepared and came piping hot from the kitchen. The naan is very good here as well. I've had the garlic and cheese varieties (so far).

I like my food spicy and they had no problem making my order spicier than usual. The Bollywood shows they have on the TVs provided good entertainment during the meal as well.

Overall I'd say this place is deserving of the good ratings it has received so far.
