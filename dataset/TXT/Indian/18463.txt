Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ Let's start off on a positive note. The decor is beautiful and modern - clean! The service was really bad and the food was sub-par. Way too spicy and I am Indian. 
The apps were decent but the mains were not good. I didn't like the breads either. Unfortunately will not return.
