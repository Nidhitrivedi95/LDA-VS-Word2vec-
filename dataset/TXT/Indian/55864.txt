xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w It's time for an update on this review, as I have returned to Tamarind a number of times since writing my last one, and the food has improved. It's not always great, but sometimes the food here is excellent. I have noticed some off days, where the food fails to thrill me, and the prevalence of cayenne pepper has me sweating it out, but overall things here have gotten much better. We enjoyed the buffet on Mother's Day, when they really pulled out all the stops. The vegetarian options were impressive and everything tasted delicious. If they ever go back to offering the lunch buffet daily, as they used to, I will consider giving them another star.
