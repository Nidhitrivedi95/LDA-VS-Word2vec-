Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg Indian with a twist! One of the coolest spots on st Laurent. As soon as you walk in there's a gorgeous long bar where you can wait for a drink before you're seated or actually just grab a seat there to eat if it's packed. They have a little relaxation seat in the widow where it's rocks kinda sad type to give a relaxing feel.

Service was great and food was excellent. The samosa was our favourite part it wasn't your average fried 2 piece samosa with a sweet sauce instead it was open faces and was all mashed up with a great sauce. The tandoori shrimp were packed with flavour and spice, if you don't like spicy then I suggest you let them know or pick something else. Butter chicken was great not to sweet and not to tomatoey just right.

Great owner and great servers. If you're looking for a large group area they have a cool seating area all the way at the top of the restaurant where you take off your shoes and walk in and relax in comfort.
