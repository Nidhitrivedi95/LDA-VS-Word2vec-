bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Why are people so crazy about this place? The service is so poor that just based on that, I wouldn't go back. They are blatantly rude to their customers and truly do not value your business. Also, they don't care about what you order. I was very clear in explaining that I have an allergy to MSG and did not want any used in my food. Sure enough, I had a reaction so they clearly didn't listen. As for the taste of the food, I've had better quality food at Hakka Legend down the street. This place is over rated.
