O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Best South Asian food I have ever had outside the time I ate homemade at a Sikh temple. We had the Himalayan meal with three courses and beer for $19. Tip: one is enough for two.  The Nepalese fried potatoes are buttery-tasting, spicy, and slightly sweet. We knee from there we were in for a great ride, but were astonished by the variety and delicacy of the currie vegetables and salad that came our way in the second course, served with buttery naan. The sautéed greens (chard?) were my favorite. Capped off with a sweet carrot pudding-type dessert and creamy rice pudding. And after all that we still got chai. The wait staff were friendly and knowledgeable as well. This would easily be a five-plus star review if I could have ha a beer other than Bud lite with the dinner.
