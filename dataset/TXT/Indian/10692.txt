A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA One of my best friends from my old life in California was visiting me in Toronto a couple of years ago and we went here on the first night since he is vegetarian, loves Indian food and the restaurant is a manageable walk from my apartment.

I had been wanting to try it for years and am glad I did.

I can't remember what I had but the menu was extensive and I was very satisfied with my choice.  So was he.  I think perhaps the only thing missing might have been more explanation for us white boys (and girls) that don't always know what things are in Indian cuisine.

It was certainly a good value.  The restaurant was quite clean and service was fine.  

I am unsure if I would make a major commute out for this place but if you are in the area, this is fine place for one of those Friday night, casual dinners with your S.O. or friends.  Highly recommended.
