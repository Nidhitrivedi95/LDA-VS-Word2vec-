ZqmUmrXkwihgPFjMCYh_Mg I would have give a 5 rating for just the chicken biriyani. But giving only 4 after having their bed biriyani.  
If you love biriyani, this is the best place in Tempe chandler area. 
But I Was a little disappointed that their veg is not as great as their chicken biriyani. They have only one type of veg biriyani too.
