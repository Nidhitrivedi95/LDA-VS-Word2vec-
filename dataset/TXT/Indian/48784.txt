TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA The restaurant is really cool, it's a old house converted into a restaurant. The area inside is small but sufficient. We didn't know Sunday lunch time was only buffet, we saw the dosa pics and went in for dosa and had the buffet. Luckily plain dosa is included in the buffet. For 10 dollar there isn't much to complain. The food was good but the options weren't traditional, they didn't have a single paneer dish on the buffet that day. Taste wise I would give the food a 6.5/10. Service for the dosa could have been quicker. The naan was too chewy but a decent place to grab a meal.
