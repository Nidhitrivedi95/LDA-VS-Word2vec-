GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw We came here after craving some Indian food and yelping for some restaurants nearby. The place is cute and quaint, down some steps right off Bay and Elm. Even though it was a Friday evening, it wasn't too busy, and we easily got a table. 

We ordered a delicious mango lassii to share, the garlic naan, which comes in a good portion (unlike some other places I've been to), some rice, the butter chicken and the lamb rogan josh. The lamb was okay, but not a favourite - just spicy with not too much interesting flavour. The butter chicken, however, was splendid. We did not try any of the Thai dishes. 

Would definitely recommend trying this little place - it might just hit the spot if you're craving some quick and not too pricey Indian food.
