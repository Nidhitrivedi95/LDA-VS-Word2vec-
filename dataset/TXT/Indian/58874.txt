YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA Went to Gautama a couple months ago with the gal pals for a catch up. It's so hard to choose a place in Little India when there are so many delicious smells wafting at you from any number of places. But Gautama impressed us and i've been back several times with my SO. 
Firstly, the price is right. We go for the dinner buffet and it's $14 each if I remember correctly. 
Also, the service is always wonderful. It's a serve-yourself buffet, which leaves the wait staff available to be very attentive for drink orders. My water glass is never less than half full and they take away your dirty plates as soon as you get up for your next course.
The food is delicious! With a vegetarian best friend, and an boyfriend who doesn't eat pork, this is the perfect place to go and have everyone be happy! Most of the dishes are vegetables (chick peas, veggie samosas, saag paneer, veggie pakoras, potato and cauliflower etc.), and the meat ones are mostly chicken (butter, curry and tandoori), as well as the one curry goat option. I love the papadum but it's kind of hidden. You'll find it in a serving dish on top of the cold food options and fruit. 
Don't forget to have the honey ball or ice cream for dessert! 
They also have a great side patio in the warmer months.
