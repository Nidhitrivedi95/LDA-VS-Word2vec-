TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Since it was my first time eating Indian food, I had to ask a few questions about the menu to make sure that I ordered something I would like. The wait staff at the India Palace didn't seem to mind at all! Service was a little slow, but now unbearably tedious. I ended up ordering the chicken masala, and it was not delicious at all, but my BF got the lamb tikka masala and thoroughly enjoyed it, we have different tastes. LOL))) We also ordered the garlic naan but had to take that home as we were full. Wish I had room for dessert!
