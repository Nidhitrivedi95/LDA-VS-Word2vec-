cJLx99fsYPM0SlNfWLb4Ug Yum. Great Indian food on Monroe st.

My pick up experience was quick and easy. I called in my order outside and my food was ready in about ten minutes. Being somewhat of a rice freak, I asked for an extra portion after I realized they only provided a small togo package of rice. They were nice and gracious enough to provide extra rice at no additional charge.

My roasted eggplant dish was delicious with the right amount of heat. The naan was very soft and tasty. I had enough for dinner and saved leftovers for lunch the next day. I suspect that I might be picking up dinner here more than once, while I am in Madison.

Most definitely a fan!
