-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Great South Indian vegetarian food at good prices.

Today I enjoyed a spicy Rasam (soup) followed by a Mysore dosa.

The dosa was crisp and hot filled with spiced potato.   The dosa cane with sambar and coconut chutney.

Low key surroundings with pleasant staff.  Seems a great place for families with children.
