9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw Tonight's dining experience was a bit disorganized. You could hear servers correcting each other aloud right next to tables, "They're ready for their dessert, not to go boxes." We were sent soup that wasn't ours and there seemed to be miscommunication among servers and food runners.

The worst part for me and my family was 4 staff members rearranging the whole seating area to prepare for lunch the next day, they carelessly drag chairs and made it so difficult to enjoy dinner. At this time it was still an hour before their closing. 

Besides that, I enjoy the food here a lot. I tried the Andhra curry tonight and loved it.
