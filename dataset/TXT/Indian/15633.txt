cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w I frequent a lot of restaurants. The 2-star review is for the food we ordered. The ambiance is 3.5 star and the service is 3 star. There is a flood of people trying to eat here. From what I'm told lunch is relatively quiet but during dinner when I was there groups of people were lined up waiting for the next table to open up. Sadly, the menu itself doesn't live up to the name. I let all that go hoping that the food we ordered would be really tasty. It wasn't. 2 of the 3 dishes we ordered were mediocre at best and serving Pav Bhaji fondue style doesn't work if your goal is to actually eat the dish. I may or may not return and try other things on the menu.
