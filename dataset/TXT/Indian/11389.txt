afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w I've only tried the snacks from the take out counter here, and they are all very good  - patties, rolls, vadas are all good quality, hot and fresh. Very nice! I have yet to try any of the meal items, but judging by the volume of take-out they are doing, it seems popular.

My only critique is that it can sometimes seem a bit disorganized. People cut in line, and its not always clear who is being served next. 

But, the people behind the counter are very friendly and are clearly doing their best. 

Nice place!
