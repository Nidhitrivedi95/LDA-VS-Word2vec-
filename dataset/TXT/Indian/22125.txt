GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw The food was bland. The service was kind, but very slow. The naan tasted like Wonder Bread. I have been to many Indian restaurants, some good, and many just okay. In almost all of them, the food was better than in this place. Also, there were more Indian people in all of those restaurants than in this place. That should have been an early hint.
