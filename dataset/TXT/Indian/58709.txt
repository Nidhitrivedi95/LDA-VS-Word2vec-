Yoc9_4sv6AT1AIohPPiGbA Never had food from India before. Not knowing what I was getting myself into, I was eagerly helped and though the food took some time too prepare (not too long) it was worth waiting for thanks to the friendly service.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I have nothing to compare it too.
