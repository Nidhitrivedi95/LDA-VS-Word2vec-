NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw I often refer to The Beaches as "the land of food mediocrity" so I was surprised at how much I liked my dinner at Cinamon. Everything I tried was super tasty. A standout was the aloo tikkies with chole: two soft potato patties served over spicy and sweet chana. I rarely get that excited about chickpeas but these were spicy and sweet and just really really good!  We ate in but it seems like this place does a lot of take-out business as well.
