For my Indian brothers and sisters:  They have a few good choices in addition to the standard Punjabi menu.  If you are into Indian Chinese and can't make it out to Independence, try their Manchurian, not bad at all.  I also tried the eggplant and northern daal, chicken curry and Korma.  Everyone in the party, including a very picky Ba, enjoyed their meal.  They also have the ability to accommodate Jains if needed.  

Might be a little expensive for take-out, but nice if you live around the corner, its an easy way to avoid cooking.
