RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg My wife and I were very happy with this place.

Every time we walked by this restaurant it seemed empty, I always think people are missing out when they don't get into the local Indian restaurants because Indian food is awesome.

We had the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken with the garlic naan-bread.
The service is quick and attentive, the food was great and the prices were reasonable, I recommend.
