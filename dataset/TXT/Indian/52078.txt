UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA About the most Authentic and Consistent Indian food u r going to find in Vegas. This place is always busy hence the customer service issues.  Curries here are fantastic. Buffet is best value in town but A la Carte Diner is way better. If u r going on week end make a reservation  otherwise u could be waiting long however the food will be worth the wait
