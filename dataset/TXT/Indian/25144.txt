HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. I ve never written a review<U+200B> but today I decided that my fellow yelpers deserved this so they wouldn't go through the same experience that I did. I ordered a chilli chicken which is something I usually get at hakka restaurants with no fail. However today as I was eating the chicken it was hard and tasted like old chicken. Cutting into the chicken I had, I knew for sure it had to be microwaved old chicken. I would have left with a mediocre review at worst  but the bad experience continued. They then brought out my partners meal, something that on the menu was named Thai spicy chicken. When it came out, it looked terrible. It was smothered in red sauce. Sauce that was so thick and so much on the plate that it started to leak off of the plate. It was so thick that it hit the edge and hung off of the plate for about 15 mins as we ate, slowly dripping it never actually touched the table but instead hung there. It was as if they had dumped a box of cornstarch into the meal. Our waiter never came back. We suspected it was because he saw the meal was completely untouched and didn't want to deal with it. At the end of the meal after we had sat there for a while with no attention the waiter finally approached us with lukewarm water. We asked for the bill and a waiter came to us and asked if we wanted to take the food home. We said no and that we didn't enjoy the meal. She replied with well that's what you ordered you will pay. She next said she would speak with her manager. Which followed up with her dropping off the bill with said meal on the order without a word. We walked to cash and asked for the manager who apparently replied with there is no manager here. Don't eat here. You won't enjoy it.
