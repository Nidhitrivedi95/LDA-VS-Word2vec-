ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I really wish I didnt give up white rice and flour, because everything I ate at Angara's lunch was so flavorful and delicious. Oh garlic Naan how I've missed you.

The ambiance is very nice and the gentleman working the dining room was extremely pleasant.

I can't remember the names of the dishes I had besides the tandoori and curry chickens, but they were all prepared well with unique flavors and spices. The cold bar items were fresh. I especially enjoyed the yogurt and mint chutney. 

I would recommend Angara to any fan of Indian cuisine or diners with ambitious tastebuds.
