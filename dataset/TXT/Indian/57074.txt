xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Loved the read chili combination taco, full of flavor and is not spicy at all. The bread was flaky, and crunchy, yet beautifully made. I Also got the frybread sweets with just honey, it was absolutely delicious. Will definitely be coming to this cute little spot in the future. The staff was friendly and had a good sense of humor.
