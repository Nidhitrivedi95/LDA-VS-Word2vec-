gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A The best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Period. The highlight is the delicious garlic naan bread and the host's friendly and quick service. The food is well-prepared especially the Palak Paneer and Tandoori Chicken with just the right amount of spices and seasoning to bring out the heartiness and flavor of the food. Mt. Everest is buffet style which also means you can't beat the value it provides in terms of variety and price for the amount of dishes they offer. We loved the garlic naan so much we ordered it to-go, but our awesome host gave it to us gratis for being first-time diners. We'll definitely come back and let our friends and family know about this hidden gem in Las Vegas
