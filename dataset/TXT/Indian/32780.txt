LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA 1) The horrible reservation experience when there is no communication between man outside and the person actually provides table at any order. 

2) Food is good and served fast but its not something you must try category not for costly 

3) Waiters have no common sense of saying hi/hello or thank you/have a nice day (even after providing 15% tip!) 

When you get sense that there is no point in doing reservation for rude service it too late.
