cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg Yesterday night was the first time I came here and had a very pleasant experience. The restaurant was nice and warm so we felt real cozy after coming inside from the Toronto cold.

The host who seated us was very nice. Same goes for the waitress and guest appearance from one of the chefs who brought out a dish for us. The employees who work there have such a nice aura about them.

The food was good but it is a bit mild compared to some Indian restaurants. My friends and I ordered the chicken biryani, butter curry paneer, butter chicken, goat vindaloo, and the tandoori naan. It came with complimentary yogurt as well. We were very big fans of the goat vindaloo and the tandoori naan which was baked to perfection (very soft and fluffy). The other dishes were okay, they weren't tasteless but lacked the quintessential spice kick that we were used to. Their butter chicken is made sweeter than conventional butter chickens but it is nice. Wasn't a huge fan of it but that's definitely a preference bias; some may love it.

Worth noting was how accommodating the staff were. I requested for some additional peppers to add to my dish and they were very cool about it. Brought me some very delicious hot peppers right away. 

My friends and I ate for 25 bucks each and I believe it was a pretty good amount of food for that price. Also, the service was flawless so that was also a plus. 

The restaurant does cater to a more diverse crowd, which is good as I know not everyone can handle a lot of spice. Personally the lack of spice was my own little qualm with it but the restaurant is a really good place to check out.

If you're like me, just order some additional hot peppers and you'll be good to go :).
