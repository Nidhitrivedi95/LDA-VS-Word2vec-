FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw Good place but i feel this place has gone down over the last year or two.  The quality of the food is good but dishes like he butter chicken almost taste as if ketchup is used.   Used to be far more fragrant and fresh tasting.  I have been going here for about 10 years and I would have given a 4 star rating a couple of years back but not any more.  

I don't know if I will go back or try finding a new go to for Indian somewhere else.
