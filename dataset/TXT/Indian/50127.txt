uAAA3_Q4sIaABM9AuScLcA Shamoli was a quick - and late - dinner for us. Having just arrived in Edinburgh and checked into out hotel down the street, it was well after 2100 when we walked in with our two kids.

One of three tables being occupied, service was efficient albeit not the most warm and friendly in the world, and the food hit the spot. We opted for the Indian half of the menu and we're pleased with out choices.

All told, out of there in about 45 minutes .. mission accomplished!
