OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ I had ordered a soup and this was the first restaurant that I had visited where the pepper had already been added as it came out of the kitchen; rather seemed like they put in a spoonful over the soup, rather than having the customer take care of that. The soup had too much of pepper.
