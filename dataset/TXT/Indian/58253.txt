yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg This small, dark restaurant is in the Ahwatukee area, in a shopping center with a Trader Joe's, Safeway, and other stores.  It is in the corner, on the same side of the shopping center as the Trader Joe's.

We go here periodically because they have decent food, and I like the staff - very friendly.  It's nice to get some saag paneer (great texture, fluffy & creamy - try it) for take-out.  They use canola oil, which saddens me, as I like ghee (I like my saturated fats & olive oil more than certain vegetable oils).  You can get decently spicy food here (that's "extremely HOT" to some of you) or skip the heat entirely.  They use good spices and make good sauces.  They don't make the most awesome Indian food I have ever had, but it is good, hearty, and comforting.

It's a good place for children, if there is something on the menu yours like (and who doesn't like ras malai or rice pudding?).  It can be good for groups, but I would call ahead or make reservations (not sure if they take them).

I appreciate how they gave me decaf tea & warm water (not just "no ice" water, but room temperature water) when I asked.

Recommended: any of their tandoori dishes; a vegetable curry that may not be on the menu but comes as a side in one of the special dinners; saag paneer; mango lassi; their relishes.  I'm good with anything on the menu.  Try the lunch buffet.
