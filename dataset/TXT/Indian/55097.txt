Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw A pathetic dining experience. Was here for lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon. The food was bland ordinary, felt stale and uninspired. The thing more pathetic thing was the service, the particular server, was snotty and arrogant. He was curt and had a irritated expression every time we asked for small things like, to clear the plate or refill the water ! Came out disappointed and angry. Needless to say I'm never coming back here! And some of friends have had similar experiences!!
