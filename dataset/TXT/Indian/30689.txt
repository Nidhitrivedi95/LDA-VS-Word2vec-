kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A We had these guys cater a party for us on November 3.  It was very cold out but they set up their stuff(table, chafing dishes, large griddle with gas tank) in the back yard and cooked up a storm for our guests.
We started with vadas, which were amazing!  Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with excellent coconut chutney and the orange chutney, as well as sambar.
The idlis (steamed rice cakes) were good....nice and soft......but some were cold maybe due to the weather?? 
The dosas were excellent. These were made fresh to order for each guest.  They had a variety of pastes (chili garlic, and 2 others) that were lathered onto the dosa while it cooked and then each person got to choose whatever toppings they wanted: potato mixture, onions, tomatoes, green chilis, cilantro, cheese, etc. They cooked 4 at a time and it took mere minutes to cook the dosas so people were not waiting long for their turn.  Plus they had the idlis and vadas to keep them busy until their turn for dosa.
They ended the meal with a very nice sweet dish.  It was like a halwa...with pineapple? in it.
Our guests enjoyed the food and we will definitely do another outdoor dosa party in the spring or summer so our guests don't have to go in and out of the house to get their food.
