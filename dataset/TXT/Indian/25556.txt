Folks were friendly and the atmosphere very comfortable. It was quiet when I came by but later it was filled with people watching soccer I believe.

Haven't a single complaint other than I really wanted to try the fried bread which is only available on the weekend. I'll have to come back.

It's a pub menu you'll find with classic fish and chips and shepard's pie, of course. Went with breakfast and was absolutely happy with my choice.

Crispy, slighted salted potatoes, fluffy scrambled eggs, two generous slices of bacon, grilled tomato, beans and toast. Served with a really good in house made HP sauce.  Washed down with some water and a cup of coffee. 

Highly recommend. No pretentiousness here. Just good vibes and fine tasting pub food.

Cheerio!
