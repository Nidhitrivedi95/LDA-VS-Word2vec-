Don't sit here and read my review, do yourself the favor of jumping in the car and going over there to see what it's all about.

The people that run the store (sorry I forgot the guys name) and the mom/grandmom esk Indian woman in the back cooking Samosas just totally embody what we are all looking for when we walk into a place for the first time. Try this, taste that, have a cup of tea dear.

Bring your friends, bring your family, grab a cart and go on an excursion. Take your time, this place is sweet and so are the people running it.
