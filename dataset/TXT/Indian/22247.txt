GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Girls weekend in Vegas definitely required some recovery time at our resort and I found this restaurant through Bite Squad food delivery service.  My roomie is vegetarian and the food was delicious and beautifully seasoned.  This was our first time having Indian food.  The vegetable fritters and garlic naan were our favorites!  The  vegetable Manchurian was delicious, too.  I'm not vegetarian but I had it that way for my friend and the food was very filling and satisfying.  The option of heat level when ordering is a good thing, too.
