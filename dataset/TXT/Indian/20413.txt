FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ Despite sporting a name befitting a West Towne food court stand, Curry in the Box is rapidly becoming my favorite South Madison lunch haunt.  With clean flavors, a lunch menu loaded with affordable options and an efficient kitchen that churns out my meal in less than 10 minutes, there a lot to love about this strip mall outpost on Fish Hatchery Road.

I dined in during my first visit to Curry in the Box.  The menu is posted on the wall as you enter the restaurant.  A floor display lists a set of nine lunch specials, affordably priced from $6.29 to $7.49. I ordered the Chicken Kapow (Chicken breast, bamboo shoots, onion, mushroom, and basil stir fried in fresh chili sauce) for $6.29, paid the cashier, picked my number and found a table in the surprisingly large, well-lit dining area.

Five minutes later, a smiling server delivered by meal, served in a large white bowl.  While Chicken Kapow is a standard Thai dish, the kitchen showed a great deal of skill in preparing this dish, stir-frying the vegetables to coax a mouthful of flavor in every bite.  The cooks applied the chili sauce with gentle hand, using the sauce to complement the other ingredients, not overwhelm them.  My only gripe was with the rice, far too gummy for my preferences.

The following day, I ordered the Japanese Pan Curry (crispy chicken breast with diced potato in a yellow curry sauce) as takeout.  While the double starch combo of cubed potatoes and rice seemed redundant, the dish delivered clean flavors and just enough heat to warm my bones on a frigid early January afternoon.  I felt the serving size provided great value for the $7.49 I paid for this meal.

Though not my overall favorite Asian restaurant, Curry in the Box will be a frequent lunchtime destination where I can procure great a well-prepared meal in less than 30 minutes.
