Their "signature" item is the big paper dosa which is a large rice paper pancake rolled into a cone so big you could use it like a megaphone.  

The place is entirely vegetarian and there is lots on the menu for any intrepid person to sample and taste.

I ended up getting their south Indian thali meal which consisted of two vegetable dishes and an assortment of different types of curries (dal, rasam, etc) along with rice and a chapati.  It was so filling that I had trouble finishing everything.  To me, it was a sampler and had dishes that were sweet, savory, and spicy.

Service is kinda hit or miss at this place, there isn't any real system but I mean you can just try to flag someone down.  

I think next time I would either get one of the dosas (rice crepe) or uthapam (Indian style pancake) as they seemed to be popular and my tablemates' uthapam smelled quite tasty.

These items seem great to share across the table too especially the paper dosa.

Until next time Udupi Palace.
