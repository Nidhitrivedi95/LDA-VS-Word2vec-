tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I can't say enough about this place. I've only been three times but I can confidently say this place 1ups ALL of the Indian restaurants in Vegas. It is quality cooked Punjabi food. It is as good as my Mom's cooking (and that says a lot haha). The Aunty and Uncle that own this restaurant are so humble and accommodating, they always make me feel as though I'm at home (even though I only know them through the restaurant). I would really recommend to go for the brunch/lunch buffet. There are soo many selections, vegetarian and non-veg. The food is fresh, the pakoras and samosas are always hot and crunchy! Additionally, they have complimentary mango lassi, along with at least two Indian dessert options, and fresh fruit! [I'm getting hungry writing about this place, haa.] When family comes to visit and they are want to go out to eat, this restaurant is going to be the go-to spot! :D
