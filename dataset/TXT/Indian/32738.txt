LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Food was good! Service was terrible! Kept giving us wrong food and took so long to give us food. Also we had a kid and she was hungry and we had a reservation and they said we can't sit till everyone came. Bathroom was clean and so was restaurant! Would go there again but not anytime soon.
