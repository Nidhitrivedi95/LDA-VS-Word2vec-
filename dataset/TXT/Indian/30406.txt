K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Got take-out from here based on positive reviews and proximity to where I live.  The naan was good, and the food was certainly edible, but the flavors and textures were all off.  The chicken in the tikka masala was moist and tender, but the sauce was terrible.  There was barely any paneer in the mutter paneer and the sauce was flavorless.  I didn't tray the saag, but my husband was all around unimpressed.  We will not be going here again.
