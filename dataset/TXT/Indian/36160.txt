nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw Not crazy about the lunch buffet, as the (spice) heat is turned waaaay down on the dishes, including the Vindaloo...that said, if you order off the menu and request your food spicy, they'll gladly do it, and then you're at an Indian restaurant!!! I would suggest that they make at least one spicy dish available per buffet -- some of us can take it!
