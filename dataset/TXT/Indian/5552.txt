They have classic meat dishes- tandoori chicken, butter chicken, curry goat and wide variety of veggie dishes plus garlic and plain naan, basmati rice and veggie biryani. Prawn masala was excellent and all the meat dishes were very tender. 
Service is great and attentive. 
Food has been consistent the last 10+ years.
