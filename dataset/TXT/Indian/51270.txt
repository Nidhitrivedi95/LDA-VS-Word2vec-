Coming from an Indian - I tried food from this place two times and both the times my experience was below average. The food was ok tasting, didn't blow me away. I had the spicy chicken biryani, i opted for the extra spicy version of this hoping the kind of spice I always have when I myself cook or when I eat at other restaurants. But I was wrong, the spice was so harsh and felt almost like raw uncooked spice harshness which burns your neck when you swallow. Now here by spice I am not talking about the hot chili, I am talking about the other Indian spices used in the dish. After having a bad experience first time I thought I'll give them another chance, I had chicken korma and naan, korma was so bland and didn't taste like korma curry at all. The naan was ok too, had thick doughy taste to it. I am going to wait for few more months to be able to convince myself to try this place again. I still am hopeful about this place and maybe i will be able to find something I love!! Will update my review when that happens!!!!
