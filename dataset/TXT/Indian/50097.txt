U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw Have eaten here 5 to 6 times a year for the last 10 or 12 years and I have never been disappointed. This is some of the best Indian food in Montreal. Rarely is Indian food prepared with such a fine touch...not heavy, over seasoned but rather light and fragrant. This small family run restaurant is all about the food and making you feel welcome. 

Expect to wait...but if you are in a rush, go to one of the many crappy buffets littered about town. The service is what one expects in a resto such as this....friendly and ordered. 

The kids love the mango lassy and I am found of the British and or Indian beer they have on tap. No samosas( thankfully) but a nan that is heavenly...try the pain puri or some of the other specialities...just ask.

The vegetarian thali is excellent....and I am a huge carnivore! This has become a family favourite. One word of caution...they close a couple of times a year to go to India, usually around Christmas so it is worth calling ahead.
