zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw Erm.... This place is amazing. 

I've heard about the Kebab Mahal on the Edinburgh grapevine for years. But for some reason I never felt the need to go there. But now I always feel the need to go there. Because the food is fantastic. And oh, so cheap. 

This is not a posh restaurant. Oh no. It's formica tables and stools and weird items stuffed up the back of the room. There's even two parts to the place, separated by a proper wall and accessible only by going outside and entering another main door. This is what I like to call personality. 

Me and my other half had an incredible meal here, in the completely separate restaurant from everyone else. We ordered a starter of onion bhajis (three arrived the size of steering wheels) followed by a veritable feast of Indian main courses. I opted for two sides and a naan to keep me filled and the bloke opted for a main course, rice, naan and a side. 

We couldn't finish it all and took the rest home. All that wonderful food only came to £26. And the service was good too - our waiter was pleasant and we even helped him shift some tables to accommodate us. 

It felt like a mad family meal - will absolutely, definitely, totally be back for more. Long live Kebab Mahal!
