W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg Incredibly diverse menu and one of the few places in Madison that serves Dosa.  We had the Ghee Dosa which was absolutely delicious - it stretched across the width of the table and we devoured every last bit.

We were with friends who had just been in India and suggested we try the "Fish Moilee" from the Malabar Cuisine section.  The fish was tender and the sauce it came in, a tomato and coconut based curry was aromatic and perfect with a bit of paratha or on rice.

We also had the "Malai Kofta" which tied with the fish as my favorite dish of the night.  We were all using our last pieces of garlic naan to sop up every last bit of the sauce.  

Finally, we also had the Pongal which was fragrant, spiced perfectly (we asked for mild to be safe and it had just a bit of spice) and a great accompaniment to everything else.

The menu is huge so be ready for that, but also be open to trying new items.  I had only ever had a different kofta dish before and a different dosa so I was so happy that we branched out from our usual tikka masala ordering.
