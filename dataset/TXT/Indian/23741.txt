gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A It seems like I spend most of my life in this place and for good reason. The food is amazing, I've tried almost all Indian restaurants in Las Vegas and have been eating Indian food for over 30 years. This place is the best in town. Highly recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala and Kadai Chicken. That said all dishes are great, even veggies dishes are delicious. They also have a lunch buffet 7days per week, which is also dangerously delicious! A real festival for the taste buds! ;)
