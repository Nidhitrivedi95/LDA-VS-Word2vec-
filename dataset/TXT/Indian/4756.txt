2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg I have been to this place a few times. In the beginning it was okay, but seems like its going down hill. The owner is rude. I came in a party of two twice and he didn't even greet us once but was taking orders personally from another party of 6. Wouldn't hurt to say hi or ask how the food is if you're walking by and making eye contact with us.

Anyways, as per food, I have had malai kofta, Matar paneer and saag paneer here. Never get the saag paneer here, have a feeling they use frozen spinach. Of the three veggie dishes, I'd say malai kofta is your best bet. It used to be really good and have a nutty flavor but now they put more cream to give it a rich gravy texture but it takes away from the flavor and honestly makes me feel gross after I'm done eating 3/4 of my meal. If you really like the intense flavor of garlic, then get the garlic naan (I don't). I went for plain naan instead.

Place is clean and spacious with plenty parking. Service is fast so I will give them a star for that. Hopefully the owner is nicer to you :)
