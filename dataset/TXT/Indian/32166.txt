LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg A very, very average restaurant.   Based on the reviews here for the lunch buffet, I gave dinner a try.   Of many Indian restaurants I've tried throughout the world, this was at the bottom 10%.   So don't expect much.   (And do not order the Pakoras.   The worst!)

But, this being Scottsdale, it seems that folks will settle for just about anything.
