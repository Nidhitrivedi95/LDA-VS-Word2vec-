1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA Confusing SCAM restaurant!!!

We usually order take outs from them. Minus the fact they sometimes 'accidently' sold our order to someone who got there quicker (you did not read wrong,it happened more than once), one person would charge us tax one day but not the other, sometimes we'd show up for an order to find out they didn't make it since the order was 'too small to start things up'...we grudgedly go back there for lunch because it's Brampton. There's no food option within the 5 km radius. This town makes me cry.

Today was last straw. Their take out menu for vegetarian dishes start at $3, and rice for $2.99. Their thali (3 tapas,rice, salad, yogurt, naan, desert deal) is $6.99. But when we sit down instead of ordering take out, they did not tell us prices start at $8.99 + tax. We walked out rightfully assuming our bill to be $10 or less, but it ended up being $29.50!!!!! How on earth did they design this menu?!?

I say, regardless of the quality of their food, these people should not be in business because service and business model this inept and scammy don't belong in Canada. Back to canned soup lunches for me!!!
