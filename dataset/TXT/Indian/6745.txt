4A4kP972gXDxBQTU4nmyEw It was a Sunday and we were actually on our way to another vegetarian buffet restaurant called,  when we drove past this place with a big sign in their window that said "vegetarian buffet $4.99"!!  Wow, we couldn't pass this price up, as the other place we were heading to was $12.99.  
Apparently this cute little place, located at the end of a shopping centre, had just opened up the week before, and I am so glad, as it was wonderful!  So much choice and all very delicious.  We will definitely be going back.
