S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Liked the ratings so made the trek to New India Gate.  The staff were the most welcoming people.  They took the time to explain about the papadum and the tamarind sauce and the green chutney.  I didn't have the heart to tell him that we are veteran indian food lovers. 
 
We tried the beef samosas as an appetizer.  We got two of them that had a nice size to them and they were almost greaseless.  They were also full of meat.  I just wished that they had more aromatic herbs in them.  Maybe a touch more of cardamon.  
Ordered the New India Gate biryani which has both lamb and chicken.  It was not greasy but the flavors were not as good as we expected.  We have had much better.  The portion was big for the price.  The texture of the rice was fine.  
We also ordered chicken vindaloo which was delicious by my standards.  Had that nice vinegary taste that traditional vindaloo is supposed to have and had plenty of potato chunks to soak up that wonderful sauce.  I was super pleased with my selection.
For dessert, I had Kheer and though the raisins and nuts were missing, I enjoyed it nonetheless.  
The customer service is excellent.  Reason enough to go and be served good indian food.  They give a Yelp discount of which we took advantage.  I hear they have a buffet 7 days a week at a reasonable price.  
Thanks for the great meal.
