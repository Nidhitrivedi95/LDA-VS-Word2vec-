0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w Everest is probably my favorite restaurant in Toronto.  The service is great, the decor is contemporary and the food is superb.

I highly recommend the Aloo Tama Bodi, Chicken Momos, the Lamb Vindaloo, Panir Tikka and the Chicken Tikka Masala.

Some of the best dining service I've had and the food is unique and of high quality.
