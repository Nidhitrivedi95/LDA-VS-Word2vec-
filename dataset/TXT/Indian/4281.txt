1TRoTVHIJVRSMtlSn4605w Even though this place looks so run down, I love their cheap jerk chicken kids meal. My Buddy and I love to get two of these meals just only 6$ better than the 5$ medium meal where you get the same amount of chicken as the kids meal. SO WORTH IT. If youre on a budget really cheap and satisfying lunch!! Love the Keele location more though not a big fan of the Jane and Finch location where they switched names.
