UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA BEWARE, bread they offer is not free (we got tricked into that so dont make the same mistake) 
Service : 4 stars 
Food : 5 stars !!!
Best indian food we've had.  Aahran curry was amazing, & get it with lamb, its so tender ((: 

Anyways I would have given the place a 5 star other than the fact that the guy tricked us into paying for the bread we didn't eat. Made it sound like it came with the meal..
