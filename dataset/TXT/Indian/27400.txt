I've been searching for an Indian restaurant in the Yonge/Finch/Steeles area for awhile, and stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  I came here for AYCE lunch ($12.99) on a Sunday afternoon. They serve lunch from 11am-3pm, and then dinner buffet/a la carte at 5pm for $14.99. The service was great, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere is cozy, small, and very similar to most other Indian buffet restaurants out there. 

The lunch included a variety of dishes, including chicken vindaloo, tandoori chicken, channa masala, saag paneer, butter chicken, goat curry, some eggplant dish, pakoras, basmati rice, dessert, ice cream, and a few other dishes. They also serve plain or garlic naan with the meal. All that for $12.99 was pretty good to me! I also ordered a mango lassi which was very creamy and delicious ($3.99 I believe).

All in all, a good place with a great variety of dishes to try. The butter chicken was a bit more on the tomatoey side, but it was still okay. However, for the price, the food was pretty decent. I'd come here again whenever i'm in the mood for Indian buffet! Another good thing is that they have a buffet at dinner time too, which not all places have.
