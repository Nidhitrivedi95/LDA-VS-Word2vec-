yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Not overly impressed. Large selection of entree dishes, no Saag Paneer though?!?! Everthing was good, just not extraordinary. Seems like they go for quantity over quality. I will say the custard with fruit was some of the best ive had. Service was friendly and attentive. Overall decent but Mint a mile west on Flamingo has much better food, though a smaller selection.
