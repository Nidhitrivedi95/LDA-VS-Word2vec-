DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Owned and operated by the dedicated Chef Ritesh Patel, this establishment hits home runs on all 3 major fronts. Quality, Service & Ambiance. Must mention that the presentation of the dishes was appetizing as well. This is a well run restaurant with knowledgeable and engaging staff. 
Melica, it was a delight having ongoing food related discussions with you. You are a lot of fun and that helped make our visit very comfortable. 
Lamb Seekh Kebabs - Had this dish as an appetizer and, at first bite, we knew that the chef had the control over the Tandoor oven and preparation of its dishes. Kebabs were spiced to our liking and paired really well with the Merlot. 
Roghan Josh - Prepared and spiced just right. It's creamy texture balanced with succulent cubes of lamb was overwhelmingly delicious. Portion was generous and we fought to share at the table. It made the Merlot's day. 
Chicken Tandoori - This dish at one time, used to be the pride of the Indian Cuisine. The advent of Buffets and the dish's inclusion in it by unskilled chefs has diluted its value over time. This is my all time favorite Indian dish and CURRY LEAF absolutely delighted me with its flavors and tenderness. This dish was finger licking good. The Merlot saw its last drops vanish. 
Gulab Jamun w/ Vanilla Ice Cream - Nice combination. Perfectly satisfied the sweet tooth in me. A dessert item that closes the entire experience very well. 
NOTE: Curry Leaf Flavors of India is away from the Las Vegas Strip. It's approximately 13 miles or 20 minutes in the Spring Valley area of Las Vegas. Uber/Lyft can get you there for about $20 one-way from the Las Vegas Strip. It is worth the trip. Now, if you live in the Spring Valley / Summerlin area then you are already near this gem.
