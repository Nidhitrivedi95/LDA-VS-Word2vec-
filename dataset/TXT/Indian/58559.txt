YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q So I had called for delivery! They're so rude and took forever to make the food! I recommend to not order from here! They're so rude and even had the nerve to call back and tell me to never order from there anymore, due to the fact I canceled it because it took more than 2 hours to get here! I was so mad and felt very disrespected from the call! If anything they should've apology and try to work something out with a customer, but they're too ignorant to acknowledge about customer service!
