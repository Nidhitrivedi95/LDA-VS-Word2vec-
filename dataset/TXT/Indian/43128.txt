RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Although the food was reasonably adequate, I felt the staff needs to slow down a little when taking and preparing orders. We ordered an appetizer that never ended up on our table despite the fact the appetizer plates were delivered for it. At the end, we were billed for the appetizer which we didn't get...even after alerting the staff to this fact. We also had to ask for more water after our cups were empty for 15 minutes.  As this is my first visit to this place, I would give them the benefit of the doubt, but I would recommend that customers keep an open eye on their orders and make sure that the staff and the chef are on the same page in terms of what has been ordered. We came during a holiday weekend with 4 other tables so maybe they didn't have enough coverage, but I was dissapointed.
