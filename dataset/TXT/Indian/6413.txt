Naan, the simple humble plain flat bread, was elevated into a heady experience. I closed my eyes and breathed in deeply the aromatic waft of herbs and spice that promised an exotic epicurean adventure.

I ordered the lamb madras, which was beautifully cooked. The lamb was soft and tender. They used great pieces of meat that was without much fat and gristle. The spicy curry sauce was wonderful. I heartily dug into my meal. The only thing that disappointed me at Curry Twist was the rice, which I found too plain and bland, which was at odds with the delectable flavor and odor of the other dishes. 

The mango lasso was cool and sweet. A little too thick to be completely refreshing, as I felt that I really needed a water chaser in order to get the drink down. 

The prices are reasonable. The service is good. Our food came out quickly and tasted great. It's a good place to come for a casual dinner with family and friends.
