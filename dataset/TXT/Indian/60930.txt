zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA The food is good but the flavors are a bit too "americanized" for me. Everything I've had here tasted under-spiced and the chicken has been tough. The mango lassi is good, but that's pretty hard to mess up... The prices are kind of steep considering the amount of food you get, too.
The restaurant decor is cute and clean but it feels very open and empty during off-hours since the dining area is just a single open room. They close between lunch and dinner so plan accordingly.

If you're craving indian food I suggest skipping this place and going up the street to Tamarind instead.
