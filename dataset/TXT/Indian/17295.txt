dNZbJdDWWKULd_KoG4lnkQ Really my meat lover Yelp friend taking me to a vegetarian restaurant for lunch buffet ($9.99)! And we both having a great time at Gagan Sweets!

I usually not into eating buffet or food that are under a heated lamp but what they serves here are fresh and tasty. We have 

Shaahi Paneer
Palak Paneer 
Malai Kofta 
Dall Makhni
Matar Paneer
Aloo Gobhi
Channa Masala
and more... and of course freshly made naan bread.. (the nice lady even got me some spicy garlic version!)

Usually I am not into Indian dessert but Gagan Sweets here are just so good.. not overwhelming sweet as I can really taste the ingredients they used

Gulab jamun
Chikki
Payas
and more....

Really warm and family vibe here! I feel like I am eating at someone home as our waitress (thought not the young/new one) treated like we are one of the family guests and make sure we are happy and well fed!

I definitely would be back when I am in the area, I would even go out of my way if my Yelp friend need some lunch companion to chill out and stuff our face with food!
