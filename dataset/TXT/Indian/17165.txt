DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Wow the food is amazing and being Indian makes me more critical and they've succeeded so well that every 2 days I go get the chicken dum biryani with a side of the garlic Naan and am never dissapointed! Ive shared a family meal as well with the goat curry and chicken tika and the amazing biryani of course which is sealed with a piece of naan to keep all the favors inside. So glad to have such a gem of a restaurant finally on this side of town.
