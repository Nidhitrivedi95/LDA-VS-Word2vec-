ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ I think this is one of best south-indian restraurant in Toronto (GTA). I find the food very authentic. They have great options for dosa's. I tried the Rava Onion plain dosa and idli-vada sambar combo and loved it. They serve 3 different kinds of chutney's. All of them are great but I love the red spicy one. There potion size is good. Could not finish the dosa after having idli and varda (even though I was sharing it with the table). The ambience is ok..it's simple but clean. The prices are good. Would highly recommend it for somebody wanting to have true south-indian food!!
