zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I really wanted to love this place, since I love Indian food and it's so close to where I work. I had a discount coupon from Restaurant.com for $15 off a minimum purchase of $22.50, so my friend and I came for lunch. 

I eat vegan, so I was happy to see clear markings for anyone vegan, gluten-free, or vegetarian. The best option for me was the Vegetarian Lunch, which offers salad, rice, a side of Tarka Daal,  and a side of Chana Masala, which for some reason isn't vegan here. I asked if I could have two Daals instead, but was not allowed, unless I changed to the more expensive "Pick any two sides and one naan" special, but naan is not vegan either. So my friend ordered the Yuva Lunch, I ordered the Vegetarian Lunch anyway (I gave the chana to my friend), and we ordered masala fries to share, to spend the minimum for the coupon, which I presented to our server at that time.

My friend's meal seemed good, my meal was kinda just okay. The salad and rice were okay, the daal was not great (very soupy and bland), and the portions were smaller than I expected. The fries were good but pretty silly: basically a small order of McDonald's fries with a little spice rubbed on, and a big side of ketchup. I thought that I would have felt ripped off, if I was paying full-price.

After our meal we handed our coupon over, our waiter disappeared, and then brought it back, saying it was only good for use at dinner. I was confused since I had read the coupon over and checked with our waiter beforehand, so I asked to see where on the coupon it mentioned this, but he insisted it was no good. I didn't want to trouble them anymore, so we just paid the full amount. 

Good thing Restaurant.com allows you to exchange unused coupons for credit elsewhere, because it was not really worth it that time or to go back.
