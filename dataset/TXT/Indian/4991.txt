2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Went in a group of 10. The appetizers were amazing.. but the main course was average or slightly below average at best. Service was poor. We ordered a paneer tikka masala and they brought out a totally different paneer.. we asked them what happened and they said "oh this is how our paneer tikka is.. all our customers ask us the same thing". They pointed out another item on their menu and said "this is more like paneer tikka".. umm then why are the items mis named? The waitress saw we were not happy and didn't even offer to bring out the right dish nor did she apologize. They were cold. Moreover, a waiter behind us dropped a curry which splashed onto my friend's jacket. They didn't even apologize let alone offer to wipe it clean.

Overall disappointed with this place and the service and will definitely not go back again.
