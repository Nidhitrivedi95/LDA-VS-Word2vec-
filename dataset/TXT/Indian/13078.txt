b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q I've been to quite a few Indian buffets around the world in my lifetime.  I am being a little generous when I am giving this "palace" three stars.

The selection is quite basic: saag, tandoori chicken, a dal curry, chicken masala, and some other options which probably aren't worth mentioning.  The Naan came a bit late and a choice between butter and garlic wasn't offered.

The table settings were basic, with an attempt to be on the formal side but with napkins with shredded edges, a darkish interior, and diner-style booths.

Overall, it was decent and the price was reasonable (I want to say that it was about $8/ person), but I'd only return if I were in the mood for Indian and in the immediate area.
