vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Very small location and the place was packed from beginning to end. They had a wide variety of vegetarian plates to pick from and the prices were very affordable. I did not expect to walk out with a full stomach for what I had ordered.

The only negative aspect was the service, although the waiter was very nice and polite, it took 15 minutes to get a menu and another 30 before he took my order.  It probably didn't help that he was the only working waiter to serve a house full of clients.

4.5/5 Would go back
