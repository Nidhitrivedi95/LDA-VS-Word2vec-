m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw We happened in there on Valentine's day which also was their official Grand-Opening/Ribbon cutting day.  

There was a smaller fixed menu which is totally an expected thing on a busy holiday for eating out.  We both got food off the non-vegetarian menu side and it was all very good.

The service was also very good even on a busy night.  

We were lucky to get in with no reservation but we were there early so didn't wait long.

Definitely want to go back and try the full menu and bring some friends along
