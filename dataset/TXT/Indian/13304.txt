bfR-vJvrjdOJaWsXGJgzPA Dont go here.  The food is the worst indian I've ever had, and it's not even healthy.  If you are broke, it might seem like a good deal, but honestly it's pretty revolting and not even worth $6.  And even though they tout themselves as "healthy" simply extracting the oil from indian food does NOT make it healthy!  There is sooo much filler in their sauces I had difficulty swallowing.  I got their butter chicken which had maybe 4 tiny tiny chunks of chicken in it.  It was 80% sauce, which was probably mostly flour and had a bad texture.  Their saag paneer was also a lot of filler, and spiced wrong.  I could tell they went way overboard on the tumeric, because it was much more bitter than it shouldve been.  And oil is not unhealthy if you use good oils!  Sure, Ghee is a bit fattening, but if they substituted it for a lighter unsaturated fat, and used better ingredients they would be WAY healther than they are now.  Their food reminds me of yogurt, they are the cheap no-fat yogurt full of filler and no flavour, vs the whole milk good quality stuff.  Frankly, I'd pick the latter any day.
