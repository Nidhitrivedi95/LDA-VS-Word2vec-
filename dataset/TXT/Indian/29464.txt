Jq60uSolPAPJKXulKzyP4Q Without question one of the best places in North America to get South Asian Sweets (Mithai). 

As in good enough to go to toronto just for these sweets good.  As in good enough to replace the kamasutra as a repository of pleasure good. As in so good that everything, even the best sweet shops in NYC don't stand a chance good. 
As in whenever I bring sweets from NYC (or frankly anywhere), my pops will make comparisons to brar. because in his 25 plus years in the states, nothing quite does it like brar. and i'll have to concur.
