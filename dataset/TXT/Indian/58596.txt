yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ Checked this place out for the first time today. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I entered with few expectations. And was more than pleased with what I found. 

As others have noted, the decor was nicer than expected and mos def on the high end for campus. Not spacious, but big enough. Also, the man taking orders was plenty friendly. My friend had lots of questions and he was happy to answer them.

Now to the grub. I ordered the Beef Kabob roll. It was wrapped in a beautiful sheet of naan. Yummy yummy bread. The beef was well seasoned and tender. Also, this meal included fries which were unique but quite tasty. Not super cheap at $7.99, but I would say you get your money's worth here.

All in all, this is a great addition to the campus restaurant lineup. I'll be back!
