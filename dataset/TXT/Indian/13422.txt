bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Went during lunch hours, though it was not busy, most of the waitress was cleaning other tables, did not bother to greet us  ! Once we sat down, did not get the menu for five minutes. We ordered for Chill chicken dry and fried rice, but we got the wrong order. then had to wait another 10 minutes for the chicken to come, but by that time egg fried became cool. Chill chicken  tasted awful. my Chili chicken had an essence of garlic taste. Egg fried rice was too "fried" had no taste ! the food did not look very appealing. Worst Experience ! Not to order chilli chicken from here !
