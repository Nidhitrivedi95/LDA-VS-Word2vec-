9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Went to the lunch buffet after all the great reviews. Will not go back as there are many fine Indian Restaurants around, some close by.
We were seated by a man who continued to  talk on his cellphone. No one asked if we wanted anything to drink. We were almost ready to go when my water glass was finally refilled.  The window sill needs cleaning, the place was looking rundown ( tears on the booth seats).
The food was okay, just okay. A bit greasy. Something labeled chicken turned out to be fish. Large selection, but again, if I'm craving Indian I'll be elsewhere.
