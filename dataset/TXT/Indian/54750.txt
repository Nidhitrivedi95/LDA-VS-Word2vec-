wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Contrary to other reviews, this is by far the WORST service I have experienced dining out and that too from the actual OWNER of the restaurant.  Although the food was quite decent with the exception of the over salty pakoras, our waiter was loud and abnoxious from the minute we got there, took forever to get anything including utensils and water not to mention the food. To top all that off we got our bill handwritten on a piece of paper!!!! Yup you read right!!!! And to top that off we were way over charged!!! Absolutely absurd!!!! If u are even thinking of trying it out walk, no RUN in the opposite direction!!!!!
