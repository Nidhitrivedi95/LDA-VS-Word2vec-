OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w Ambiance- hmmm....how can I explain. Imagine a wedding banquet hall. The glamour - the lights and clean and massiveness. Buuuut- you don't have to wear a blazer and pants and  instead go shorts and flip flops. Yes- that pretty sums up the ambiance. Good lighting- Great decor - furniture and spacing.

Service-It was pretty dead and there was only one server. He was pretty diligent. We got seated at a booth and the guy making the naans can be seen thru a glass wall and he was kind of staring at us. I dont blame him tho- as we are in his field of view...so I guess it isn't creepy because we are in his line of sight. 

Food- The naans are humongous.  I would order 1 per person as they slice in 4 pieces. Ordered the aloo paratha as well. $4 a little steep but tasted  amazing. It was 2 of us so we got ambitious and ordered 2 curries. Did not need that much as we ended up taking most of it home. We ordered the chicken dum pukth, my snapchat friends loved it. When the waiter slices the bread seal that it is cooked in and folds the bread. I actually ate the bread like me own indian naan taco. The chicken was flavorful and tasty- and more then enough for 2 people. Also got the lamb vindaloo- a little too sour for my liking even though the meat was tender and very well prepared. The chicken easily takes the win for flavor.

Price- $15 an item- this place is one of the more expensive indian restaurants in the area. Compared to Taste of India down the street which offers AYCE for the same price. However- for the right mood, privacy and experience it is perfect.

It was worth it!!
