eF0AwlWlTp16XneCF50QRA A lot of interesting nuances about THIS Indian restaurant. Stopped in for their lunch buffet - on Saturday! Most others don't do buffet on weekends. Dishes were a little different than mainstream Indian restaurants. Their flavors were deeper and more diverse. They brought fresh naan to the table. They also brought their signature rice dessert to the table as well. This place's food and service is really 5-star.
