X-sqtBx78QDbX8kVbqF-dg Chand Palace is by far one of the most affordable Indian food experiences in Montréal. While it certainly isn't the best I've ever had (hint hint Darbar), you will definitely get what you pay for.

The atmosphere isn't really anything to write home about, since it seems like your stereotypical clean dining room setting, so if you care about that sort of thing, then perhaps it wouldn't be ideal for you. But I believe restaurant reviews, as I have stated before, should focus on the food at heart. I ordered the mango lassi and the butter chicken thali, of which I have heard many good things. The mango lassi was cold, fruity, and creamy perfection that left me wanting more. The flavors provided a nice contrast to the contents of the thali, which included salad, a vegetable dish, tandoori chicken, butter chicken (obviously), and rice and naan. The vegetable dish was definitely the standout of the meal, as it was spiced quite nicely and complemented the naan quite nicely. In addition, I liked how the naan wasn't too thick, yet it was still chewy enough to soak up all of the flavors. The butter chicken melded sweet and savory together in a seamless fashion, and it was definitely one of the better chicken curry-like dishes I've had in my lifetime. The only thing I wish was better would have to be the tandoori chicken, for I felt it could have used some more flavoring, but it still tasted juicy and was well-cooked overall.

Come here if you want a satisfying Indian meal on a budget, and, if you're like me, willing to voluntarily take the metro to explore different areas culinary-wise. You won't regret it by any means.
