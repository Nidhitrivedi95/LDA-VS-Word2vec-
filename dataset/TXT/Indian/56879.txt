xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw The green curry stew, $5.75, is nicely spiced with hatch chillies, bursting with heat.  With every bite, you will enjoy the lean chopped beef.  The Indian Fried Bread with Butter and Powdered sugar is very fulfilling, $6.49.  I love it.  If you want to spend less, just get the stew and add on the plain fry bread for $7.99, it is called the "Joedd Special", and sprinkle your own powdered sugar on it.  I did that previously.  This time, I didn't have any sugar in the vicinity, so I ordered it separately off the menu, and spent $5.00 more.  It was worth it, though.  I definitely will be back to the Fry Bread House. I always visit when I'm in Phoenix.
