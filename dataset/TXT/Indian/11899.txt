auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Hidden in the back of restaurant row at richmar and eastern is the best Indian food in las Vegas.  I have been to several but this place is always consistent, with food and service.  The vindaloo is my personal favorite you can get it chicken lamb, , or goat.  The man, is so delicious and warm. Great selection of Indian beers,  if you are new to Indian food try the lunch buffet same food quality and you many dishes without worrying if you'll like them or not.  I have been coming here 2 years now and I've never had a bad experience.
