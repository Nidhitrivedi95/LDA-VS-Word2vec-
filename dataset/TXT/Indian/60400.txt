ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Great meal.  I ordered lamb rogan josh rather than my usual korma.  Great flavor, and the heat matched my "extra spicy" order.  Service was prompt and polite.  Gulab jamun for dessert was pretty good too.

The only reason I didn't give five stars was that there were two flies buzzing around when I was first seated.  Not sure what happened to them after that, but they did disappear before my meal arrived.
