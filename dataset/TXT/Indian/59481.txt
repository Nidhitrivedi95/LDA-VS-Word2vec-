Usually vindaloo comes with dark meat and they did white here which was awesome. We prefer that and some places won't even substitute. Was really good. My tiki was great as well, very creamy and decent portion. Add in the naan and overall we enjoyed our meals. Service was a little slow for a week night but would come again.
