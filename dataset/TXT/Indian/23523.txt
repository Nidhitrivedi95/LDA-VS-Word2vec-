gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Wonderful service and even better food! We went with a few friends that had been several times and they recommended the tali plate. I suggest this for anyone trying Indian food for the first time, as it gives you a wonderful assortment of what they have to offer! This plate is perfect to share between two people and a level 7 was just the right amount of spice. The NAN bread was also wonderful! We tried the garlic, cheese and plain, all were deliciously perfect. Amazing staff at Mount Everest as well, never had an empty glass and they were very attentive to all of our needs. Will definitely be going back.
