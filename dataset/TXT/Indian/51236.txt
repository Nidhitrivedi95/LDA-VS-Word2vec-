uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg I don't know why Ms. Athonia gave this restaurant 5 stars. I'll have to get with her since we were there together. 

The "lightly" spicy vegetable noodle dish was ON FIRE. I do like spicy, but this one was Hydrant worthy. And this was after the owner had described it as "mild!"  Also, the okra masala was bland  and also way too spicy to handle, even with cooling yogurt sauce poured on top of it. The dish was visually unappealing (it looked like a bowl of mud!) and the okra was soggy/mush. The whole thing needed salt, Tajin (which I travel with), CARDBOARD...ANYTHING, really, to up the flavor.  The only saving grace about this restaurant is the fact that it's the only vegetarian non-chain restaurant in this particular area of the city. Every other choice is either bbq, fast food, or Hooters!  My advice: make the drive into downtown Madison's State Street and find something tasty from a local restaurateur.
