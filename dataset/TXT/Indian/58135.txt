yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg The flavors here are truly great, if you like garlic and spices this is your place.

So if you have a 2pm business meeting you may want to find something else, but if you want to make your tast buds hit the international disco floor give the lunch buffet a try. There were the usuals, pakoa, aloo tiki, raita, and then mostly common food but well executed.

For me the winners were the saag, a green spinach based concoction packed with garlic and exotic flavors which may even be healthy. The korma was my other favorite with clunks of veggies paneer and a creamy curry sauce.

The meal also inclues garlic naan (nice touch), chai tea and desert.  For desert may I recommend the rasmali. a sweet creamy milk sauce with balls of cheese that have the texture and taste of cake.
