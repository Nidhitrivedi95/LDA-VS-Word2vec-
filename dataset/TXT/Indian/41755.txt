Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw Went there last Friday, every dish we ordered except the biriyani was sweet. Think the chef got his/her salt and sugar mixed up. It was overly sweet and completely put us off the food. Nothing great...especially for that price. If that quality came with a more reasonable price tag it would have got a more favourable rating. Didnt enjoy it..will likely avoid it again if i can
