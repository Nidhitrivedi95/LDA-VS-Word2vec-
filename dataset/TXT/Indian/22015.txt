GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw This has to be one of the best indian restaurants I've been to internationally. They've nailed a lot of dishes down perfectly to that "Restaurant Style Indian Food for America" type of cuisine.

I've been here 3 times now and the food has consistently been good, which is a good sign. And I'm referring to the location near 50th-something street and Bell (there is another one I've heard is NOT as good as this place with the same name). I've tried the tandoor chicken, lamb tikka masala, karahi chicken and chicken makhani. The naan is really good too. The free chai is the icing on the cake.

Their meat is really always juicy and tender, barely EVER dry like it is at so many other indian restaurants. I'm very apprehensive about eating at 95% of indian restaurants anyway...as most re-use other people's food, over/undercook things, or grossly underflavor things.

We've had the same waitress all 3 times...I'll agree, the service from her end could really use some major improvement. BUT, Indian restaurants in general are FAR from perfect, and some leeway is required.

Would definitely eat here again, even if I were disappointed at least once.
