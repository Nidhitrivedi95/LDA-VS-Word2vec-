ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA The food tastes fine. The problem is that I ordered Mutter Paneer, which is peas and cheese in sauce... and there were hardly any peas. There were exactly 5 peas in a serving. For comparison, this is like ordering a pepperoni pizza, and there only being 1/2 of a pepperoni on your slice. It might be a great slice of pizza, but if it's missing the critical ingredient then it's not what you ordered. I called and Andy said he'd tell the cook next time to be sure to have peas in it and prepared to get off of the phone (what?? This is like telling the cook to make sure a pepperoni pizza has pepperonis next time and offering nothing to the customer) When I gently pressed, I was offered 25% off my next meal. Kind of expecting more recompense there. Probably won't be back. See photo if you would like to hunt for my peas.
