GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I have been going to this place frequently for the last 1 and half years and the food was great until recently.  The last few times I ordered take out food and I always find the curries highly diluted with water, samosas fried in old oil and their signature biriyani not flavorful at all.  The last time I ordered take out food from there, I even found a piece of meat in my veggie curry!! 

Like others have mentioned, the service is poor, the place is highly understaffed and not so friendly staff either.

The place used to be known for its flavorful, cheap food but sadly the quality has degraded over the last few months...
