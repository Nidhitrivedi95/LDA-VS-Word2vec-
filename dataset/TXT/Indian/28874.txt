jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q The BEST decision we've made while on our vacation in Las Vegas!! 

The food here is absolutely amazing!! Very delicious! Everything we tried was excellent. Chicken Tika Masala is what I ordered, my fiancé had the paneer spinach with chicken Bryani. 

The garlic naan was fresh and tasty. We also has spinach and cheese naan (bread stuffed with spinach and melting cheese! 

Wow, we were very impressed! The staff was very accommodating, friendly and respectful! Mani was our server and he was excellent! He has great communication skills and very friendly! 

We sat in the hookah lounge and ordered a Starbuzz Hookah and enjoyed the view of Vegas strip from afar! 

I would recommend my friends and family and anyone to here while in Vegas, the staff is great the food is out of this world good and the atmosphere is romantic and family friendly too as they have two dinning areas!
