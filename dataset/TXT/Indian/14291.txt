c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg I come here very often because of  the delicious Butter Chicken and Fresh Naan, and the normally great service. 

Recently the dinner service here is a bit slow and disorganized. Seems a bit understaffed on the floor, but a couple newer servers are disorganized and perhaps better suited in non customer facing jobs. At least not the service field. 

I came for dinner with a friend...twice... Praising this place on great food and service. But was disappointed he didn't get to witness that.  Our entrées were brought to the table 20 mins apart - so he ate cold food once mine finally arrived. Both times lol (not funny tho)
An item we ordered never arrived at all, but wasn't billed so we didn't bother mentioning when we paid. 

New server squirted water on our food while spraying an empty table beside ours. And each time we inquired on our missing food items - she would ask "oh did you order it".   Ummm NO, we sent telepathic messages to the food and hoped it would come on its own!!! REALLY? But she never offered TO CHECK ON THE ITEM FOR US  ...hellloooooo geeez

Finally mentioned to a manager (owner?) who was going to check, until the cashier said she would...but then she never did. [Scratches head!]

I still love this place and hope they work out the training issues with floor staff. They do have a couple really terrific servers - who work their butts off, try to spot them and sit in their area if u eat here in the near future 
Hope mgt reads this and improves the weak areas. 
Because I love the food.  

Update: Went for lunch buffet today with colleagues and the service was so much faster. I wish it were as quick for dinner, and that the buffet were available evenings. 
Our group of 10+ colleagues vote for buffet at dinner service too
