t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg First timer, and now we will be back as often as we can! I never had Indian food ever and the server was very nice and helped me figure out what may like, she did great! The heat index was perfect and I love the flavors with the all the dishes we had. The bar was nice, the tables nicely laid out and the staff was very pleasant.
