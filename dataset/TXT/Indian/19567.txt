FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg Update: I've changed my review from a 4-star to a 3-star. The food remains as it was (delish) but the service was just terrible. Two of us were there on a Thursday evening for dinner and were completely turned off by the waiter's rude, inattentive service. We waited 30 minutes for our bill after asking for it twice, and he seemed really put out by the ask. A VERY different experience compared to the waiter we had last time. Total bummer.

Ooooooh so tasty! 

We went to Bombay Bhel to satisfy my craving for Indian food. They definitely did that! 

At first I was a bit concerned as the restaurant wasn't very busy and ambiance is a bit dated, but we were pretty early for dinner and were seated comfortably in a booth before a number of other tables arrived. By the time we got our dinner, the restaurant was 2/3 full.

If you go, you MUST try the beef samosas. I didn't think they would be good since I'd never had beef in my samosas before, but OMG!!! They knocked my socks off. The pastry was light and flaky and the filling was DELISH. I am still thinking about them...

We tried both vegetarian and meat curries and they were both delicious. They came with huge naan and ample rice that was so soft and fluffy I ate the whole thing, and I don't even like rice.

The service was lovely. The guy who greeted and served us was really nice, attentive and made useful recommendations. 

The only reason why it's not a 5-star is the decor and wine selection, but hey...who really cares about wine with Indian food, right?

We will definitely be back. 

Seriously...try the beef samosas!!!
