Oq4frcNpND8e_SGdidzzbQ I went to the Bengali and Indian restaurant Voujon for the first time a few weeks ago and since then I have been back twice.  They serve traditional and authentic Indian dishes which are full of flavour. I have had a few of their curry dishes and my favourite is the King Prawn Bhuna which is very tasty and quite spicy but not too much that it ruins your meal. 

The dishes at Voujon are all very well presented and the foo is reasonably priced, with main meals around £9 and there is an extensive veggie menu available as well. They offer several different types of rice and there is plenty of variety of side dishes to accompany your meal. The decor inside is very authentic and modern whilst the staff have always been very attentive and warm.  Voujon also do takeaways and is available for private functions.
