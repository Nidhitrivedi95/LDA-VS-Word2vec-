P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag North Oakland's All India is excellent! I've been here several times so far - with many more to come - and it never fails to please me. I've never had the pleasure of traveling to India - but my travels, as both a tourist and resident, have found me to be a huge fan of the cuisine of the sub-continent. With incredible dining experiences in DC, New York, Reykjavik and London, I was wary of finding a spot to sate my appetites since my recent return to my very own hometown.

I am absolutely pleased and completely contented. All India's fare well represents the regional differences of both northern and southern styles. I'd be confident to recommend this fine establishment to all - from cosmopolitan to local, from Yank to Yinzer to Indian national, as well... I know all wound have a fabulous affair.

Indeed, I am not in the habit of writing reviews - but on the occasion of a celebration of our friend's book publication (The End Of You And Me, by Wendi M. Lee - find it on Amazon!), the staff was so outstanding and everything was so awesome I decided I'd have to tell the world and get the Yelp on.

Additionally, this is a must-do destination for the vegan/vegetarians in your life. I am a proud one myself (as of recent years). Vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free items are plentiful on the menu - and clearly noted on their buffet (Sundays and Thursdays, I believe). And, it's ridiculously cost-effective. Writing about it makes me want to go back right now! 



And now, a haiku review of All India:

Alert Pakistan.
All India is da bomb!
Bollywood flavah!

This has been your haiku review.

Thanks, All India!
