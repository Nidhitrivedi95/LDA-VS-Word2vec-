-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g We had a very good time at The Mint.  The food was very good.  The dessert was delicious.  Our waiter Chandrashekhar was very friendly and quick.  My little boy loved the mango lassi.  The manager came by to ask how we liked everything.  I highly recommend this place to everyone.
