wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw This is one of the best Indian restaurants across valley. 
I am a vegetarian and they don't carry many veggie options. But whatever they have tastes soooo good that I drive 1.5 hours just go eat food here. 
Mango lassi, mutter mushroom, saag, daal makhani all are delicious. Their Garlic Naans are the best ( and soft too).
