JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Eating here was a really amazing experience. The ambiance was quiet and relaxing. The staff were also very frienly. They usually ask you what level of spice you would like in your food. The food was fantastic. Make sure you order Beryani here. They use a good brand of Basmati rice I believe. We paid about $37 for three meals which is fair. They also have buffet for lunch. They serve beer and wine in case you would like to have some bioze with your spicy meal! I will definitely visit here again.
