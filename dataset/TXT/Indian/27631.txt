Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Truly great Indian food. Best in charlotte no doubt. I have been several times and always been impressed. The owners is kind and knowledgeable about his cuisine. And for the americans out there who dont enjoy "melt your face" hot this place knows how to do MILD but flavorful the rice is fantastic and the portion sizes are perfect. My fiance and i usually get the samosas starter and 2 curries and there's curry left to take home. Don't miss out on the different types of naan either garlic and apricot ones are my fav.
