uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA Really disappointed lately. I am finding that the food and portion size is not consistent. 

Decided to try them again this week. I ordered a chicken dosa which is usually stuffed with potatoes and grilled chicken pieces. However, when I took it home, it was stuffed with raw onions, some chicken pieces and BONE. I had to keep spitting out my food cause I would bite into a small bone. Unfortunately, it was too far for me to go back to the store. Really disappointed and felt completely ripped off as I had to throw everything away.
