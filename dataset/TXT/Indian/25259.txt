hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q I am new to Cuyahoga Falls and have lived in a lot of different cities. I would say the Indian food here is by far in the top 10% of Indian restaurants I've been to. Bombay Grill offers a wide range of tasty dishes. The owners are very nice!!! I will definitely be going back. The naan was amazing and so was the paneer!!! Spread the word, this place is a gem!
