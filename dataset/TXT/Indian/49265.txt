tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I have been here many many times.  They know me and my usual order so I thought I better give them some love on yelp.  

The buffet is excellent, but if you want it spicy you have to order off the menu.  

My favorites are goat curry extra spicy and lamb masala.  Both are mouth watering good stuff.
