QT4Ub4DlaDX52vdnKutD0A Visited for lunch buffet. Food selection was good, but the food was lukewarm. Specially ordered onion kulcha which was really good.
Much of the food was spicy but especially the spinach paneer!
Dessert selection was small (2 items)and not of good quality.
Interior was open with plenty of seating, but sparse on decorations.
Service was okay.
