Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q Hankering for some Indian, we of course checked Yelp for some local recommendations and found Indian Grill. We weren't disappointed! Everything was delicious. Ordered the lamb madras (three stars spicy) and the tandoori chicken. Pleasantly surprised at how moist the chicken was. We thought the lamb would be more spicy, so we may try four stars spicy (the max) next time. Definitely will come back and try more dishes.
