Gtw-SpnhyNa0TwNETlysyw The food is delicious. I tried three types of bread/naan and they were all very good. The Malai Kofta was awesome. Paneer Tikka Masala was very good too. And finally, I found a place in Phoenix that serves real (Dum) Biryani.
Having said that, the reason I did not give a full five stars is because the staff (including the manager) seem very inexperienced. The service is very slow too.
