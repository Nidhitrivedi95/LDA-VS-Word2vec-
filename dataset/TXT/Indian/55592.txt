I happened to hit on the Miss today! Ordered noodles with vegetable recommended by the gentleman at the counter. The noodles were dry void of the usual sheen one gets when it's fresh and the sauce is done right. The vegetables were soft and overdone. The broccoli was stale 50% somewhat green and 50 yellow! Hence, tasted bitter. Second order was Hakka fish. Disappointing and dry. I think they do not get the batter right! The other two orders were ok. Are we going to go there again? I really don't know. But will give it another time to dine in.
