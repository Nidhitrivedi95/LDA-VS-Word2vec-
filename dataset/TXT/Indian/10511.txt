9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw Well I love Indian food and eat it quite often, so Im used to the spices and have no problem digesting. Most of the time.... Last night I was in the area and needed to eat something quick. I saw this place, it looked clean, and new and 'hip' as the cool kids say, so I gave it a whirl. I got the Lamb Korma medium spice roti. 
Call me picky, but I have worked in the service industry for years, and its really not that difficult to smile is it? My god, i felt like I was interrupting this dudes evening by asking him a couple questions about the rotis. Sorry guy, ill take my roti and leave. Anyways, I ate half my roti  and packed it up and met up with some friends down the street. 30 min later my stomach was KILLING me. Like stabbing pains, and like someone was taking my stomach in both hands and squeezing it like a stress ball. I got some pepto, chugged and went to sleep. I woke up and it still hurts. Now i dont know if it was just a bad reaction or if it was the food in that place, but something didnt agree with me.  And the least they could do is smile and be friendly before handing me over something that is going to make me feel like I have a demon in my stomach.
