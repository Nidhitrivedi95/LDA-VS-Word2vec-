F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Honestly the food here is great.  This is actually my favourite Hakka Restaurant.  I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE their Sweet Caramelized Noodles with Chicken.

Was here for my birthday and had made reservations.  My family and I were starving and couldn't wait to eat.  Once we placed our order we expected our food to come out within 10-15 min..........NOPE we waited 30-40min for our FIRST dish to arrive.  Seriously?  My family and I were so hungry we devoured that dish like vultures.  Once that dish was done we waited another half hour for the next dish to arrive....Do they do this on purpose?  I feel like they do this so when the food arrives we won't have time/patience to critique it because we're dying of hunger and not even caring how civilized we should be as we're too busy trying not to eat each other's hands when the food arrives.

Totally kidding... their food IS great.  They really just need to work on their sloth-like service.

By the time my family and I were done eating, we realized we were in there for like 3 hours from all the waiting.

HAKKA REN PLEASE FIX THIS!
