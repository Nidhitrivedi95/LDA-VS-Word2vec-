JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Butter chicken is the best.  The chicken is so moist and tender.  I often eat butter chicken off of the buffets because it seems to be a staple everywhere, but here I ordered it as an entree and it was so much better.  I like it mild, they really made it mild.

This is the first Indian restaurant that truly respects mild.  Hubby was a bit sad that his medium was a little less than medium.

On the downside they charge for buttered naan, it is only .49 more but that is an unusual upcharge.

The proprietor is extremely friendly and worth a good chat.

The portions were of average size, plenty of meat in the chicken dish, but not true of the goat dish.

The korma here is a little less nut and rich but still has plenty of flavor.

If you want more rice they will bring it without hesitation.

has the best ambience, no tv, and no blaring loud Indian music.  The polar opposite of Persis.
