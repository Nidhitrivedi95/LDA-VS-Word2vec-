li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ This place is hip!  How do I know?  They followed the Code of M.C. Hammer.  

Too Legit to Quit?  Boooohhhh-ring.

2Legit2Quit?  Whoa!  Hip and innovative!  

I for one love integers, so imagine my enthusiasm when they decided not to open a Hurry For Curry and instead opened a Hurry4Curry!

There's all sorts of reasons 2 feel lukewarm about Hurry4Curry.

1) The self-serve touchscreens.  Are people really that excited about this?  Have they never touched an iPod?  I don't understand the thrill of being your own check-out person (a la the grocery store).  Isn't that what the people behind the counter are being paid to do?  And I get to do it for free?

2) A rotating menu.  Look, I can't tell vindaloo from biryani from Benny Agbayani (that's a baseball zing).   So I don't have Indian food favorites.  But IF I did, I think I'd find it really frustrating if I went in and my favorite thing was unavailable just because the owner/cooks are bored.  

3)  Maybe the prices are good.  Maybe they're not.  My meal, drink and naan was 481.11 rupees.  Err, excuse me.  Ten dollars and fifty cents.  It doesn't feel like a good deal for fast food.

The postiives?  Naan bread was warm and delicious.  Some added variety to an Arizona Center devoid of culinary inspiration.  (People: please stop going to Hooters.  Two worst meals of my life.)  Also, did I mention this already?  They have an integer in their name.

It's not destination dining but a good break from Chain Hell.
