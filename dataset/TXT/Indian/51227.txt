Came in for dinner and there are two other tables at 8:00 on a Thursday night.  I wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular.

Coconut soup was weird .  A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   

Lamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite, though the lamb was tender and cooked well.  The overall dish was very very salty with no special taste.  Just a little spicy, a little Indian, and a little lamb.  They are probably using curry paste from a jar, or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor (besides salt).  A whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge, which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite.

Rice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits.  I just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant.  Rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there.  If the rice has been sitting for too long, throw it out and make more.  

I tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb Saag rehydrated the rice somewhat, and the rice's absorption of the Saag took away some of its saltiness.

Three sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all. 

Had to ask to have my water glass filled every single time I finished it. (this is a major pet peeve)
