Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Waited 10 mins but none of the servers acknowledged us. Had to ask a server to be seated. The food was ok at best. Half the dishes were mislabeled. No one came by to ask us for drinks. Waited 10 mins for the check. There again had to get up and ask for it. Same for the card to be taken and charged. 

I've been to Tamba 5 times now and food and service quality has gotten worse every time. Never coming here again.
