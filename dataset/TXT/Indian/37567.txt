OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I really like this place. My favourite here is the tandoori dishes (esp. chicken). Why? Darbar has a license to cook with coal in their kitchen - few other restos have this in town. The primary benefit? The ability to cook tandoor stuff "a la minute". Consequently, the dish leaves the kitchen sizzling, full of aroma, and still moist. Think about the last thing... how often do you get moist tandoori chicken? It's usually quite dry because it's cooked in advance and left at low heat to be given "faux a la minute" to customers - thus drained of its moisture and juices. Darbar has the luxury of avoiding that culinary travesty. That alone makes the place worth. Their other dishes are quite good as well and the owners are fabulous people.
