TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw The management seems to know the formula for a good dining experience here if you're looking for a decent priced, tasty Indian buffet 

Lunch buffet: Good food particularly liked the goat curry and lentils. The naan was good too. The desert section is missing those delicious popular Indian sweet meats, but their rice pudding was decent. 

They told us their meats are HALAL, which is a huge plus for us. 

Our experience: We arrived at 2:30 p.m. and the buffet would close at 3 pm, but the server was friendly and quick. They were able to refill a few of the dishes for us. Shortly after, about six more people came for the buffet so the staff refilled more buffet items. If you come late, please check out the buffet first and request your favorites to be replenished. 


Tip: I used a check-in coupon from Yelp and promptly received a delicious, cold mango lassi. Don't miss out.
