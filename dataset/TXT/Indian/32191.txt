LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg This is my favorite place to eat. If you're looking for something new to try or you're an Indian food fanatic, this is the place for you. 

The "mom and pop" atmosphere is relaxing and wonderful. 

Come on the days the have the buffet to get an amazing bargain! Tuesday-Friday 11-2:30 ($9.95), and Sat/Sunday 12-3 ($11.95). 

Fill your belly with delicious spice and flavor :)
