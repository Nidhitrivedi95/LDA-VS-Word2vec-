o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Food is good so I can give one star. Always went there to get food but last time we picked up food they missed one dish and it was late so called them to tell them. They said sorry about the mistake and they will give the dish next time we order for free. Went today and they had too many questions and took off $10 while dish was $13. It's not about money or the $3 but more about principal. They made a mistake and acted like we are some kind of scammers. This was last time we come to this place. When you eat out you want food service which it seems like this please does not have.
