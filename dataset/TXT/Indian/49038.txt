TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Namaste is good--the food is better than other Indian restaurants nearby.  There is one male waiter who works here, though, who is a total jerk.  Like, seriously.  We walked in for the lunch buffet and he was *clearly* unhappy to be helping us.  He was condescending and downright rude.  

The food is always good, both at dinner and at lunch.  Some of the dishes are amazing, and I have never had anything that I didn't want to eat, which is not true for other Indian places in town.

Like others have said, the owner likes to belt out tunes occasionally.  It's...horrible.  She has an irritating voice and she always turns the sound up way too loud.  She's so friendly, though, that it would be impossible to actually tell her how bad it is.  I would enjoy dining here more if she stopped with the karaoke.
