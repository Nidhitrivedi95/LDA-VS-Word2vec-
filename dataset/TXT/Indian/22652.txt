gqiBy1X5n1KHq21D2dawEw Amazing food, but after walking in for the second time in my first day, I was treated like a lower than worthy guest, seemingly for embarassing the owner in front of the better guests. I apologize for accidentally turning off one light, for one second, but if it's a repeated thing perhaps your advisory shouting across the restaurant could Begin with 'the light is inside!' VS (don't turn off the light...). 
Was looking forward to coming back many times for the quality eats, but can't be drawn toward terrible treats. Did I not tip to standard? Change the options? 

That was pure humiliation!! I'd have brought 10 guests back, but should they be white so you can return a pearly ^ smile like when we walked in this morning with delight, I'd hope you'd might. Second time in a day guests returning alone might get second to best in way of  lighter skinned folks at rest. 

POINTE sur cette place, à parts des dosas:Tournes tes mots sur leur dos:améliorez vos traitements des gens, peu importe nos races, même si FRANGINS. Peut être je ne vais plus sentir attaqué pour la semblance de mon sac à-dos..? so'dat I can feel comfortable to come back... White, blue, or black or brown in this supposedly diverse town...!
