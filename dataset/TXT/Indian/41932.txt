qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA The sign makes it a bit hard to find at night but the amazingly cheap food and drinks plus ALL DAY BRUNCH makes it a win in my book. I got a stuffed french toast with ham and cheese (came with a big side salad & a serving of fries) for $6.00! The portion was so big my friend and I couldn't finish it together. $4 shots also make this place great for a night of celebration. Even all their salads are under $5 - definitely a big inclination to eat healthy for a change :)
Only reason it doesn't get a 5* is that the service wasn't great, the waiters were very nice and everything but they were very understaffed and it took ages to find a waiter to place an order, there were only 2 working on the night I went and the place was pretty busy!
