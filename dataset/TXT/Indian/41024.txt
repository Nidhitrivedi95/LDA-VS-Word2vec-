PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q Just went here with a friend for their dinner buffet (Sundays and Tuesdays end at 9pm) 
The food selection wasn't bad, pretty extensive actually (I recommend going). it wasn't expensive either, around 10 dollars. The only hangup was the food was a bit salty and there a surprising amount of meat dishes. So I guess if you like meat - then there are no complaints! 

Other than their buffet, I've been here for their half off quite a bit and say that the portions are pretty big and the prices aren't bad after their half off. Great for a poor college student like myself.
