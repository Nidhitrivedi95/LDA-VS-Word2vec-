tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g Terrible experience! Ordered a take out- came 40 minutes later and my food was not ready- the waitstaff was on their phones and would not come to greet us. I had to physically go up to someone who was sweeping the floor to tell them that I would like my order. 
Rude.  Sat there for 20 minutes ( this is now 50 minutes after they said my order would be ready) never again. I will take my business to tadka
