Zcd2yYA5ck-38duDOg6dww Okay so this is the second  best Indian food I have ever had - first was in New Delhi... so yea I highly recommend it.  I ordered the lunch special tiffin .. which came in an actual tiffin.. and it came with paneer, rice, daal, and salad, and garlic naan. My husband ordered chole bhatura and it was also quite epic . I think I may have been Indian in my past life because this meal brought me back to a childhood I don't even remember
