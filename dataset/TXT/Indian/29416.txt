JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ We had a good experience the first time we can here for dinner. The Chana batura was awesome and the dosas are huge! They had rushed us out a little since stayed past closing but I still would have given them 3.5 stars. I had to dock a star for the overpriced but good indian food and a half a star for the rush. 

But we came here for the weekend buffet yesterday and they no longer offer the buffet option!!! I was so bummed. But we stayed for the regular menu. We started out with gobi Manchurian, good flavor but not enough spice or crunch like we expected. I ordered a Chana batura ($13) and my boyfriend got the North Indian thali with malai kofta (it was ok, Paradise Biriyani makes waaaay better kofta) and palak paneer ($17). Super pricy for indian food btw. After the appetizer, my boyfriend asked to make our entrees spicy. Instead of cooking to request, the waiter brought our food with a side plate of chilis. How was I supposed to incorporate this into my meal?!? Take a bite of chili?! The terrible service was more aggravating. There were two servers in the restaurant, the male was nice and checked up from time to time while the female back server was just terrible. We sat without a refill of water for more than 10 minutes and when I asked her for a refill, she only refilled my boyfriends glass and not mine. I had to call her back to get some water. She was either new or high, either scenario is viable since not refilling the entire table's glasses is just laughable. 

The food was good but way overpriced, $17 for a smaller thali, no thanks! The service just sucked, kitchen and servers. I will stick to Cholas and Aroma in Concord.
