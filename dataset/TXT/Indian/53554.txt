vFnzV9uy9nEXFQgkSuv_AQ I used to really like this restaurant, however, I doubt we will go back again anytime soon. 
The service was fine aside from the fact That there seemed to be only two people working there. The woman was friendly and checked in on us a lot. 
The price was high considering the food was only ok.
This used to be one of three Indian food places I enjoyed in AZ  5 years ago. I Recently moved back and wanted to revisit the delicious cheese pakora and samosas I loved. 
The food, well papadam was great, cheese pakora was good but I felt like it was lacking in flavor. The samosa and aloo ghobi had far too much onion for my taste, which I cannot stand, but it was the least onion-y thing on the menu. The rice and the naan were perfect and the cheese naan was great as well. My iced tea was flavorful and had a nice cinnamon aftertaste. I didn't have any, but my date said the chicken tikka misala was amazing.
The music was nice, and there was a cool looking Bollywood movie playing by the bar. It was not too loud and was not busy at all. 
Overall, it would have been wonderful if the place was kept up a bit more, less onions, and the prices more reasonable.
