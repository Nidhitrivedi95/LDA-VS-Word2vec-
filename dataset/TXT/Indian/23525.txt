gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Aug 4th update... still the one to beat. Fresh, tasty, attention to detail, but it's the food. The food is varied and fresh and quite flavorful. It looks like a hole-in-the-wall from the outside, but it's all about the food and value for me. This is one place I almost ALWAYS sample when I'm in town. Worth a short trip from the Strip.
