YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw The Applebee's of Indian food.  It's nothing special...but...it's not horrible.  It just is.

I've only been here for lunch and while I do get that they have to prepare for the buffet style eating of the lunch crowd, I'm still going to judge the food for what it was..."Buffet food."

The naan was nothing special and I can typically tell if I'm going to like an Indian place based on the naan alone.  What I love:  Pillowy, soft, chewy naan.  What I received: flat bread.

The rest of the food:

The chicken tikka masala (which I've been told isn't really an Indian dish...but who cares...it tastes good) was what I expected to be in a buffet tray.  It was okay...but I'm not exactly directing people here to get it.

The Aloo Gobi type dish however, was pretty tasty.  Great job Persis!

The rest of the dishes were good.  I would prefer trying this place again without the buffet style eating.

I love Indian food and Persis is convenient to get to from my office.  I'll come back and give an update.
