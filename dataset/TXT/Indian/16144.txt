Dd1w7xR7Xs3bthwusgy33Q First off, very affordable Indian food. And waiting times are like 15 mins at max. However, I do not agree with the health standards of this place. We ordered poori sabji and the sabji was down right bad and stale. The poori was like raw and half done. What baffles me how can they serve stale food to kids??! I am Indian and it puts me to shame when my fellow country folks do sub par actions like these!
