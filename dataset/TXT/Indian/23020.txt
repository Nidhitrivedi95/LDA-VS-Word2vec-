gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Stumbled upon this place when looking for a new place to eat here in Las Vegas , I've been here about six times in the past month , and the food is still just as amazing as day one , food stays very consistent ,  extremely authentic and fresh. 

The atmosphere is very relaxing, music isn't too loud, and just beautiful colorful decorations! 

The costumer service was at beyond par, it was lively Prakash was who took care of us and every time we do come here he always takes great care of us ! 

By far one of my favorite places in Las Vegas !
