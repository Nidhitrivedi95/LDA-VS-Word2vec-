But they happen to do very good cream based curries.  Perhaps in the top 3 I've had anywhere in the world.  If you like cream based curries, try this place (butter chicken, the mcdonald's burger for 'westerners'  of curries, in particular)

Personally, I think better butter chicken than a lot of the restaurants in Little India (in Toronto) even (the restaurants Regency, Gautama for example).  The korma is good too.  Not healthy stuff, but delicious.  If you get naan bread, you're better to get the garlic naan for a little more, because their much less likely to make a crappy naan (The regular naan bread they do is hit and miss on being very dry or over burnt).  The garlic naan is a little extra, but you know garlic is very good for your body ...
