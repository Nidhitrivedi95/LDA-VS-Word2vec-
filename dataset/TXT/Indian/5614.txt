I ordered a coconut shrimp dish and the shrimp was way overcooked.  I managed to cut it with my knife but it was difficult, it really needed a steak knife.  The dish was bland and totally boring.  Did I eat it, yes, because we otherwise would have been late for the concert had I sent it back.  My GF's dish saag lamb tasted a little better to me, but she wouldn't finish it.  We were with two other people but I didn't taste their dishes and can not comment on them.
Service was very slow, at 6:15 pm on a Saturday night (no major events in town).
I was generous, it's really only worth 1.5 stars.
We will NOT be going back.
