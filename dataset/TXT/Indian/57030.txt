xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw OK. Food was good, couldn't help but stare at all the awkward seating arrangements. Seating area needs a little TLC. I also feel it necessary to say if a customer asks for water, I suggest bringing each table a pitcher as opposed to little itty bitty styrofoam cups that I\they have to get up to refill every 2 minutes.. . Makes me feel little tacky. If they're worried about people filling the cups up with soda instead of water they should change the area of the soda. Lemons are 1.29 for a half a lemon cut up in thirds..(could resist)  Lmbo #detailsmatter 
There is a native table next door if you want to purchase jewelry or dream catchers. Enjoy the food try not to stare at all the damaged seats\ booths\ statues\ Tables. Staff was friendly and maintain customers as they came in well.
