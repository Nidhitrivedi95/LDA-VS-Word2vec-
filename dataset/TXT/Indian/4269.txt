1S6eB9Ag2VMx3Ab7LHORJw I was delighted to find out how delicious this restaurant is.  The menu is full of really good items, like dosa, butter chicken, vadao , uthappam, paneer butter masala and vindaloo. Best Indian food in town, althought i wish it were more centrally located. It is a bit of a drive for me. the service is excellent and the staff very nice.
