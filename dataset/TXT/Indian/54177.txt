vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw I had a great time here for Winterlicious.  The service was incredible and being slightly new to Indian cuisine, I was very pleased to see how the menu had some great "intro" dishes.  I didn't feel intimidated at all.  

I totally recommend this restaurant for a date or a group of friends.
