KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Just like the food I had here, I am only lukewarm about King's Palace.

Met a friend for lunch and we both grabbed a combo.  I had the mattar paneer on rice.  It came with a small side salad and pop ($10).  My friend chose the mango chicken, saag paneer on rice combo ($12.50).

As soon as I took my first bite, I though 'damn, should have ordered the naan instead of rice'.  The rice was cold, hard and clumpy.  I've eaten at King's Palace before and was blown away by their warm and toasty naans. 

The paneer on this day was blah...no flavor, kinda greasy and only a few measly cubes of cheese.  I ate about 1/4 of the food on my plate and had no desire to eat more or take the rest with me.  I'm sure my meal could have used a few extra minutes in the nuker.  My friend, on the other hand, gobbled up her entire meal so she really loved her food or was just really hungry.

Next time, I will avoid getting the rice combo and stick with naan instead.
