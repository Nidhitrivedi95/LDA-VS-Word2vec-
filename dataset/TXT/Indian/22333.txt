GmMZG6dsDqGVC275ZwD-cw Really enjoyed my lunch here...the thali plate (is that redundant to say?) for $5.99 was an amazing value. I joked with my lunch companion that "sana" in Kiswahili means "very much", and there was indeed very much food on my plate.

My vegetarian thali came with chana (chickpea curry), mixed vegetables, a tiny bit of salad, a huge mountain of basmati rice, and an entire naan bread all for me. My mixed veggie curry wasn't all that exciting, but the butter chicken I mooched from my friend was delicious, as were the chickpeas. Also, my lime juice drink was lovely and sour and tasted like real limes, not like limeade.

Very friendly and prompt service. I especially appreciated the jug of water that immediately appeared at our table on a very hot, sticky Montreal day.

I'll be back!
