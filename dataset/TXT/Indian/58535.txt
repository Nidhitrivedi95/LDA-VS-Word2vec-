YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q Took over 2 1/2 hours for our delivery & it still never came, we were starving. The owner also called to tell us that he didn't have the ingredients for both of the orders we placed so we had to select new menu items.
Driver called to tell us it would be another 20-30 minutes & admitted our food was in the car for over an hour. We called to cancel because we no longer wanted to eat the rotten food that had been sitting for who knows how long. Rude owner called back to tell us he refunded our money as a favor to us & that we should never to order from him again... no problem buddy. Worst customer service, delivery & restaurant in Madison I have ever had an experience with.
