A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Do not order meals here. Rice was not cooked thru. Rasam was too spicy - dessert was loaded with sugar - Overall it felt like they cab ride to eat Indian food in Canada was wasted - they claim heir dosa is their speciality/ need to try that next time to validate their claim to fame !! My first experience here was bad.
