VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg I went to dinner here with some family and it was super delicious. I loved all the food here. It was really spicy though. I believe we said level 8 so it is our fault, but just so you know it is Indian spicy!!!! As long as you order mild or medium the food is scrumptious. 

We got paneer tikka, navratna korma, baingan bharta (eggplant), saag paneer, garlic and chilli naan and paneer naan with rice. Food did take a long time to come out which was a little weird to me since there were only two other tables filled. There is private parking lot. Would recommend eating here :)
