Fantastic food!!! To be fair anywhere that char grills stuff is a winner I my book but the curries and the flame grilled things are equally tasty. Very unusual and varied menu too. 
The butter handi is amazing as is the bhuna and Palak. 

I have used them for takeaway many times and twice to  sit in ( byo) I wouldn't recommend sitting in for dinner as the service was pretty much non existent (45 mins between poppadoms and starters) and very cold due to the door being wide open during December. It was also cold when I popped in  for lunch. 
The food is excellent though and please do order takeaway!
