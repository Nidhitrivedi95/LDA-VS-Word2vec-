yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Indian spices are the bomb(bay) in exotic cooking and the food prepared at this Dhaba delivers climatic ecstasy in every bite. Maybe that's why we are taught to place a napkin on our lap. (Just kidding). But seriously folks, this is a hidden gem of a restaurant and the atmosphere, once we were seated, was warm and inviting. For some reason, the hostess pushes reservations and if you don't have one, you will be told to take a seat and could wait up to 20 minutes, even when tables are open. But don't worry, you'll be seated soon enough and it will have been worth the wait. Service was excellent. Ambiance felt authentic (Never been to a roadside restaurant in India). Try their version of lemonade, delicious. Take your time to peruse the menu and savor every bite. Enjoy.
