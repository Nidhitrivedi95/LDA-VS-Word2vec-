scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Came here for lunch with some co-workers. Didn't know anything about this place because a friend suggested it. I love Indian food, I'll put that out there right now. This place is great. During lunch they have the buffet for $10. If you pay cash they take 10% off. So basically you pay $9 if you have cash. 

I was surprised that they had as many options that they did. I was also surprised that the food was as fresh as it was. I'm not a fan of buffets. I'd rather go to a restaurant and eat because the food is more fresh. Was not disappointed at all. They have all the favorites. Samosas, naan, chicken tikka masala etc. They also have vegetarian and vegan curries as well. All dishes were delicious and flavorful. The Naan and samosas were soft and warm. I thought they would be dry from the heat but they were perfect. I put down 4 full plates of food and had enough room for mango ice cream. 

Service was good and the restaurant was clean. If I lived closer to this place I would go here more often and would try their dinner menu. Based on the lunch buffet I assume that their dinners are great as well.
