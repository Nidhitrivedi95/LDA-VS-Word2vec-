NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ Hot or Mild has been a part of our rotation for the last year or so. I have recommended this place to so many people. It is super convenient to order, pay online and then pick up on your way home from work. 

We typically always order naan, samosas, and then two of the following with rice: chicken 65 (spicy), gobe manchurian (spicy cauliflower), baingan bharta (mashed eggplant). We like spicy and these dishes used to hit the mark! 
 
The last two times we ordered, the eggplant was not flavorful or they were out, after we had ordered online. The cauliflower was not spicy/as flavorful and tonight it was burnt, resulting in bad flavor and texture. The naan was also burnt and not as flavorful. It's been very disappointing and I write in hopes that they can fix whatever is going on. I really miss it!
