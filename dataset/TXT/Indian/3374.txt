Their flavors are spot on, not too spicy but enough heat to keep things authentic. Their naan was light and fluffy, butter chicken - very creamy ( a bit too much for my liking but my partner liked it) and their chicken biriyani delicious. We had enough for lunch the next day. If you are around the neighborhood and looking for some take out, this place is great!
