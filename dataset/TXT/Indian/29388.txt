JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ My husband is picky when it comes to Indian Food & I trust his judgement. We both enjoy this restaurant! We've tried several different things &  each item never disappoints. 

My husband went for some take out the other day & the owner struck up a convo with him. They also have him some free tea while he waited on his food:). 

The only complaint is the decor is a bit outdated.
