VdyTesw5gfEOlMPs7pcH0g Alright, y'all. This place is UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT as of three days ago. That means, new menu, new food preparation, new prices.

Soggy rice (that was JUST put out), poor execution of tradition dishes, and the price. Wow. $12 for a lunch buffet with only ten poorly executed options (although I can't speak for the two meat dishes).

I try not to be super negative when writing reviews but, it seems like a good warning to those who look up where in University City to eat and see almost four stars across the board for a place that doesn't have the same menu any more.
