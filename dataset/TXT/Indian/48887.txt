tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA I like this place and have bought veg samosas and pakoras many times. They stuff is quite fresh but it could be cold some times. The samosas are decent but pakoras are too dry not much in them. 

I have also bought some methi (sweets) although its not the best but does the job on an average level. They have a lot of other things and I like to try some more thing.
