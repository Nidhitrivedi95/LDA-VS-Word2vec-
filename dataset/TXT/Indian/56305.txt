xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA We've visited this spot a few times, and overall, each experience has been pretty average (if that). Located just west of Mavis Road and Rathburn Road, in the same plaza as Long & McQuade, we've visited whenever the cravings for 'doubles' hits us (for those unfamiliar, doubles are a Caribbean street food similar to a sandwich, stuffed with chick peas and spices). To be honest, I've had infinitely better doubles out in Scarborough and while the the doubles at Charlie's (another Caribbean joint in Mississauga at Hurontario and Dundas) were also pretty basic to me, I liked the Charlie's version vs. Leela's version.

On a recent visit, we purchased three (3) doubles and a potato pie (aloo pie). The doubles were so soaked in oil that it was so flimsy and difficult to pick up. It lacked the slight crispiness the flatbread should have, and was to the point of soggy. The aloo pie was okay but lacked the flavour I'm used to. 

Overall, pretty mediocre. There are many other spots in the GTA (and Mississauga) that do these items better.
