JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw One of the worst experience happened to us last month. Me and my family are pure vegetarians and we ordered Paneer Butter Masala for main course. When the dish came, we noticed that it wasn't paneer for sure but something else as it was very hard to cut by spoon. When we asked one of the attendants there he said "YES. It's a paneer!!". We still insisted on getting it verified from the chef, and he took the dish and went inside the kitchen. When he came back, he said "We are so sorry, it wasn't paneer but SOMETHING ELSE", and said "Give us few minutes and we will bring the dish you had ordered". We told him to hold on to the dish, but first tell us what was that which was served to us. To our shock and surprise he said, "IT WAS SOME NON-VEG DISH", without naming it. We complained about this to the manager whose name was MUTHU and he started apologizing for the mess up.

At least me and my family are never ever going to this restaurant any more, and I would personally recommend all my vegetarian food lover friends to avoid this one as they are in a real messed up state. You will never get a clue as to who is doing what.Every attendant seems to be very confused there and probably that's the reason they did mess up our order.

There are much better options in and around Charlotte, so I would recommend everyone to stay away from this restaurant. Thanks!!
