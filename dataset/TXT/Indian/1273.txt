-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg This is my favorite S. Indian restaurant around here. Of course that doesn't say much if the other restaurants aren't so good. However, the other restaurants aren't so bad, just Udipi is so much better. 

Prices are excellent. Everything is so yummy. It's hard not to overeat. Of course you don't go to this place for the decor. It's convenient for those who are going to temple. The service is also very friendly and helpful. If you aren't Indian, they will scale down how spicy hot is. 

It is well worth the drive. Honestly if I could have Udipi every day, I could actually become a vegetarian.
