C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw Their kothu roti is one of the best I have had in the GTA. I have tried at least 5 other places this year.

I had the butter chicken kothu roti, which is not a typical flavour for this dish, but was delicious all the same. 

This is more of a take out joint, with limited seating.

I wish there had been more meat in the dish.
