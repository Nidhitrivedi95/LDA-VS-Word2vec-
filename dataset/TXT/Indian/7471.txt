5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA Oh man. Don't miss out on this place.  I went for lunch they have a very small lunch type Buffett with several choices and separate menu with entree selection.  The folks are friendly and know how to take care of you.  The food is prepared fresh and they care about the ingedients, as you can see and taste this in the each different entree.  The food is described as Pakistani Mediterranean and  Indian in style and menu and they also serve many vegetarian items.  This is one of the best I've ever eaten.   The tastes are unique.   Help support this great place to eat.  Get your butts out here.
