W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg I am going to come right out and admit that I'm not an expert on Indian food.  I infrequently visit Indian restaurants and the totality of my Indian cooking experience is baking a couple batches of naan bread and cobbling together a presentable chicken tikka marsla.  So if you are looking for the definitive review on the authenticity of the cuisine served at Minerva, this is not that review.

With that said, I felt my lunch buffet experience was A-OK.  I thought the quality of the food was above average by buffet standards.  The staff members were hard working and extremely cordial.

Things I liked:
* The $9.95 lunch buffet offers an abundance of options.  It took three trips to the buffet to sample everything (including the desserts).  The lamb curry, the chicken tikka marsala and Aloo Gobi were standouts for me.
* The staff was constantly replenishing the buffet trays, so the food in the buffet stayed fresh.  (It helped that the restaurant was at capacity for lunch service.)
* LOVED the caramel custard dessert - that dish alone has me jonesing for a return visit
* There always was a staff member near to the buffet to answer questions and to offer suggestions for dishes to try.  The servers were extremely diligent about keeping beverage glasses filled and clearing dirty dishes.

Things I didn't:
* The naan bread was a let down - it was too dry for my liking.  I also did not care for the watered down coconut soup.
* The Spartan interior of the restaurant is nothing to write home about.  As Corey D mentioned in his review, it definitely will not transport you across the ocean to India.  In addition, the buffet is wedged into an alcove and it was difficult to maneuver through the other diners.  
* Sitting near the front door during polar vortex season subjects you a cold breeze every time someone walks through the front door.
* For a cuisine known for its extensive use of spices, I thought the buffet food was timidly seasoned.  
* It can be hard to understand the servers

Other observations and ramblings:
* There was a line to get a table by 12:15, so come early to hit up the buffet.
* Why is an Indian restaurant named after the Roman goddess of wisdom?  Is it just me that wonders about things like that?
