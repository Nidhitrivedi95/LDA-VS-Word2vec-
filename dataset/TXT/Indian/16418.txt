diXqpz9WOr4WLQq6uvARkg This is a hard one. I normally rate things more positively, but I had such a strange experience at Firangi! First, let me say one thing: the food is fantastic. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Food alone would be four or five stars. But the service was schizophrenic! It was never one particular server, which is OK, but they didn't seem to communicate with each other. One guy was coming by every other bite of food, another would say she'd get us something then disappear, another guy was overheard saying that it wasn't his job to get someone some water. 

Then, when it was time to pay, we said we needed a moment to discuss the cheque, and -- no exaggeration--she came back 20 seconds later. I said again that we needed a few minutes and said she could check back in about five minutes. Less than a minute later, she was back. I was a bit short this time when I said we needed time to talk and we would be faster if we could just figure it out without interruption. She then sent someone else over. About 30 seconds later. I was so annoyed! Even if you're trying to turn the table, let someone THINK for goodness sake! Especially after being asked. 

Firangi has the food down. Great job on that. But get the service aspect together, please, owners. You have a good thing. Don't let poor service be your downfall.
