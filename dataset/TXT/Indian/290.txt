-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g WOW! This place is amazing!! When I came in there was only one guy working. But that guy was busting his ass off! He was working hard and served 3 familys, 1 women, and a couple, us. And our food arrived at our table at a reasonable time! Enough about the hard working guy though and on with the food.

We ordered 
-Chicken tikki masala (spicy)
-lamb vindaloo(spicy)
-basmati rice
-plain nann
-garlic nann
-water

Everything we ordered was great, besides the water, that was a little plain.

But really the food was soooooo freakin good. The first bite I took sent me into an orgasmic state and my toes started to curl. The second bite made my eyes roll back and my back arch. By the fourth bite my wife was starting to question if some other woman was giving me a bj under the table! Well, unfortunately there wasn't any women under the table but the food sure was great!!!
