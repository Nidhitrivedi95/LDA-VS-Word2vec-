llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I grew up in Phoenix, and my family has been coming to India Palace for years. I love this place--GREAT food and friendly, attentive service. I now live in San Diego, and I haven't found an Indian restaurant that compares. Every time that I visit the Phoenix area, I have to eat here--it's a must! 

First of all, India Palace has lunch buffets on the weekends and throughout the week. At other Indian restaurants, buffets can be hit or miss, but the food is always spot on at India Palace--great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, tandoori chicken, complimentary hot tea, naan (flat bread) and dessert! I especially love the mushroom curry and the minced lamb. Everything is fresh and spiced to perfection! It's also an excellent value. 

The service has always been great at India Palace. This is a family owned restaurant, and they make you feel like family. You will never want for warm naan (plain or with garlic seasoning), fresh from the oven. 

I can't say enough good things about this place. It's certainly a 'hole-in-the-wall' by Phoenix standards, as the strip mall where it's located can be a bit off-putting, but pay no attention! Park your car and follow the scent of curry!! Don't miss this place!
