Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw I went there for an event. The downsides:
1) Extremely rude waitress. She asked us to move tables without cross-checking that we were actually a part of the event. Later, she actually yelled at our group to move as we lined up to pay the bill.

2) Food was luke-warm/cold. The palak paneer was really bad and had a funny taste to it. When we mentioned it to the staff, we were told that nobody had else had complained about it!

The upside:
1) Had a variety of dishes. That's about it!

Go there if you have no other option to eat. There are lots of other Indian places in Toronto that have much better food and service.
