Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I am in Las Vegas, NV for a conference. As I had visited Tamba few years back and was impressed at that time, I decided to return today for dinner. But this time the experience was extremely bad. I ordered Vegeterian Thali (Buddha Feast) that came with Dal Makhani, Kofta and Sag Paneer (Spinach and Cheese). As I was eating the people in the next booth tried to order Saag Paneer as an Entree and the waiter told them that it has gone bad so he cannot serve them. I called the  waiter and asked him if Sag Paneer was bad then why did he serve me. He did not have a clear answer and tried to wiggle out of the situation. Then I asked to speak with the manager and brought the same issue to his attention. The Manager (guy with beard) started yelling at me - if it was bad then why did I eat it. Shameful answer (blame the customer). 

I asked him for the check, paid the bill and left. Not going there ever again. I am stressed right now and feeling I will get sick eating bad food. Do not want to get sick while traveling for work.

Update on 01/25/2017: I suffered from food poisioning for one week.
