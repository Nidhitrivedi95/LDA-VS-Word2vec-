kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A First off, this is only my 2nd time having South Indian food. The last time I had it was like three years ago and to this day, I still don't know what I ate.  It was "okay".  

However, this place, the food was awesome!  I didn't know what I ordered, so I had to take pictures of the menu to see what it was called.  

Soup: Rasam - it had pineapples, onions and some other spices that I don't know.  Nice kick to it.  Really enjoyed it.  It tastes like a broth with a bit of tomato flavour, pineapples, onions and some hot peppers to it.   Served in a tin container. Kind of cool. 

Entree: Udupi special spring dosa: Thin crepe stuffed with spring onions, cabbage, bell pepper and with Hakka sauce. The crepe is so delicious.   Very fresh.  Oh, and it came with some dip or something...I dunno....but the think orange-ish one was absolutely amazing.  

As you can tell by my review, I had no idea what I was eating, but figured I would try it since it's a 2 minute walk from my house.  No regrets.

The one thing they could improve upon is service.  When we walked in (two Asians), they brought us water and the menu but never asked if we needed any help.  I had to wave them down and tell them "we've never had this type of food before, so any recommendations?" After we asked that, service was fine.  

I think the waiters/waitresses need to be more proactive here.

Otherwise, very new, interesting and good experience.
