HF-fLG3QaNepY151QKDNLA I don't like kabobs much but the chicken kabobs at king tandoori are very, very good. Butter naan with the kabobs taste amazing together. I also had their palak paneer with dahi and I must say that I've never been so satisfied with every single dish at an Indian restaurant. The service was really tentative as well. I would definitely come back here again soon!
