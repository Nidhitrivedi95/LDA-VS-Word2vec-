0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I entered the mouth of the dragon full of anticipation but exited very disappointed. Granted I only ordered the Chilli Chicken, but that's the cornerstone of Hakka cuisine. The Chilli Chicken tasted like deep fried chicken in  tasteless brown sauce with some cut green chillies tossed in. It was pretty flavorless except for the spicy chillies. Bah humbug!

Chilli chicken should be a tad garlicky, a tad cumin-y, pepper-y, vinegar-y, onion-y and ergo easily delicious. It's very, very easy to make. Can't believe DD messed this up. 

DD if you can't add 1+1, I shudder to think how you are doing multiplication and long division!
