GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw Three of us today for Summerlicious.    We all ordered different appetizers. Veggie, chicken samosas with mild spicy tamarind sauce and spring rolls were delicious.    I couldn't decide but finally ordered the Goa Pawns which were good but not as yummy as my favourite Butter Chicken!    I also ordered a side of naan.      My buddies enjoyed their meals of Butter Chicken and Madras Curry Fish with naan.   I love the Thai salad that is included with the meals.   
Lastly we all ordered Rasmalai which balanced out the meal.   We were all satisfied with bellies full.    Awesome visit again !
