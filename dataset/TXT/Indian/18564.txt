eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg I've never been a fan of Indian food, but I am a fan of Flavors of India Restaurant. When you are met at the door, they make you feel welcome and offer great , friendly service. The atmosphere is peaceful and the wonderful scent of spices is in the air. They make the food to order, so one can have the dishes mild to hot. We go often and it is worth the trip!
