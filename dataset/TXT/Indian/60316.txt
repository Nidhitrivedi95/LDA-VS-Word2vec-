I don't know what it is about the University area and great Indian food, but this is definitely the best around. The malai kofta is always my favorite. Chicken tikka masala, paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh naan, and there's always something new to try. Fresh gulab jamun too for dessert which is delicious. We usually go to the lunch buffett on Saturday which is always slamming. It can be very crowded at times, just be patient, everyone is very friendly and just wants to get down with some good food, especially hungry college students!
