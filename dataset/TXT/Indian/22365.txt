gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA Service is very slow and food is not that great. But its an oasis for the people looking for indian food in the strip. We have tried masala dosa and its decent and better than many places I have tried in US but biryani is awful. I think it may please americans who like non spicy food but definitely not Indians. Biryani has that typical taste where they cook everything separately and just mix it for the customers when ordered. Its quite expensive too!
