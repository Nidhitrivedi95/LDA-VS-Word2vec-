g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Best Samosa's I've ever had... Including my travels in India!  They came out piping hot and crispy with both traditional sauces.  I cannot wait to try the many Biriyani's, Chaat, and the Paneer Tikka Pizza!!! Oh my goodness I can't believe I've never been here. A hidden gem behind Jack-in-the-Box?!???? Thank you!!
