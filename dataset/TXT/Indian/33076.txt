llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g We decided on a whim to dine here after ordering take-out the other week. My husband chatted with the owners and found they were from England, which they both had in common, and they seemed keen to have our repeat business. Translate: they know the English penchant for a weekly curry and they wanted us to become regulars. And I sooo wanted to, I really did. But Alas. Compared to other Indian restaurants we have been to, in England in particular, the flavors were just ok. The decor was better than your average strip mall location and was very clean inside. The servers tonight lacked quite a bit in the attentiveness department. On the one hand, they were quick to bring pappadams and an assortment of the usual dipping sauces, and the main entrees we ordered were delivered quickly, however waters were left empty and we had to remind the servers of a couple things we had requested such as eh-hem our Taj Majal. My advice, never stand between a man (my husband) and his beer, particularly when you are offering up some spicy dishes. All in all it was a good meal but certainly not my best nor most memorable Indian meal.
