PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ On the prowl for awesome Indian buffets. Found this place. 
What's so great about it: clean, good service, incredible variety/selection
Not that great: you can find better quality elsewhere
Not to say that it's bad by any-means- it was great! It's just that this is the place where their variety is what carries them above other biffets. I highly recommend.
