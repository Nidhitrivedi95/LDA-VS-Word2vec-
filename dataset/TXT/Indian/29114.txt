JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw For me, this place does the best when it comes to Southern Indian flavor! I feel that their location doesn't help them but it's so worth is to drive a little out of your way if you're craving flavorful cuisine! The service is attentive and fast without compromising the food's freshness. I especially loved the dosa we shared. Come on in and give it a try!
