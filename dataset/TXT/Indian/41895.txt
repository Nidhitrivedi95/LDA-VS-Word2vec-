QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg My son, husband and I ate at Mintt last night and it was a wonderful experience. The naan was cooked to perfection and the samosas were literally the best samosas I've ever had in my life. We also had a house specialty appetizer of a delightful medley of some kind of fried fruits and vegetables in a sauce with nuts (sorry, don't know the name) and it too was very yummy. All of our main dishes were great, just the right size for a satisfying dinner. There wasn't a single thing we ate that we didn't love. We had dined at Mintt once before about two months ago and while the food was great, the service needed improvement, but last night was perfect. Our waiter (who might have been the owner) was extremely attentive and helpful and the table bussers were pleasant and unobtrusive. From start to finish it was a lovely, delicious dining experience and I look forward to my next visit.
