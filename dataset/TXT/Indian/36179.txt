NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ if I could give more stars I would ! If you are in Edinburgh and enjoy Indian food, you need to eat here! Fabulous friendly staff, beautiful decor, and the food is top notch. The dumplings are a must to start, the nan - steaming hot and fresh. Tandoori chicken - moist, juicy and super tasty. The lamb dish also was melt in your mouth delicious ...... sorry to be leaving Edinburgh tomorrow - I would be a regular customer here if I could !
