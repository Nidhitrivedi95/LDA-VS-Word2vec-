ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ Stopped in to support a local restaurant and was blown away by the quality and the value. Hit the afternoon lunch buffet...only $10.99! Really well prepared selections with deep, complex flavor profiles.  Get in your car and drive past the fast food joints on every corner where you'll spend way more for less. The food is 5 stars!!
