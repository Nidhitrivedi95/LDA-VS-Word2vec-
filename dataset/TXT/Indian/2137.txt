_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg I have driven by this place for years, and never would have stopped here if my friend Salavador hadn't offered me a taste of his chicken tikka masala one day.  The ambiance isn't much to speak of--you eat at some tables at one side of a grocery store or you can take your food to go--but when the food is this good, who cares?!  The prices are incredibly cheap, and you get rice and naan with every meal.  I took reviewer Trudeau's suggestion and added a chaat to my meal, and I didn't regret it.  Super yummy.  I also got chicken saag and aloo gobi, both of which were excellent.  The only thing I would change for my next order is to ask for the food to be mild.  I should have taken the other reviewers' comments about the spiciness of the food to heart.  "Medium" here is "hot" elsewhere in town.  My nose was runny for about an hour after finishing dinner because it was just too spicy for me.  As a bonus, you can shop in the grocery for all kinds of exotic (at least to me) items while you wait for your food.  I will definitely be returning here in the future.  It's my new go-to for Indian food in downtown Phoenix.
