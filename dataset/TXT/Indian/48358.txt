ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Coming through town on my way to a wedding, Saffron was a good choice for a lunch with two good friends. Their lunch buffet, which I've had before, was pretty great. The dishes change fairly regularly from what I've been told, but everything is pretty tasty save for the samosas, which are really greasy and pretty bland. I'm horrible with the names of Indian food - but the chicken masala was great, the "chef's special" rice, the spinach and potatoes dish plus a few others I couldn't hope to remember the names of. The naan is good too. 

For $9, this is a great lunch buffet.
