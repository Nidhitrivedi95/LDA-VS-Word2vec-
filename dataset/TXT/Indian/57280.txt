Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ Ate there for lunch several weeks ago with a (Indian) friend from work.  The lunch buffet was really good - excellent variety.  It was all tasty, but I think their cooks' specialties must be the vegetarian stuff.  There were also several Indians there for lunch - always a good sign when an ethnic restaurant attracts its respective community.  (Double points if they're recent immigrants who weren't raised on Burger King and Red Lobster like me and all of my friends.)
