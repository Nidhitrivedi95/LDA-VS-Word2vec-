UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ As an Indian food aficionado, Kabob Express is amongst my top 3 favorite Indian restaurants in the Phx metro area. It's a small, family run business that is absolutely killing the Indian food game in south Phoenix/Laveen! The owners are so sweet and make you feel welcome in their restaurant! 

I have ordered the chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani and naan several times. All items were a 10/10! The chicken is tender and the sauce is SO flavorful. You can tell they infuse love into their cooking. 

RUN, don't walk, to Kabob Express!
