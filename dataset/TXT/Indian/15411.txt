CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ The worst place ever !!!!

Redefining the food per the local taste is fine, however serving just about anything and calling it authentic cusine makes a big room for reviews !!!!

Any average non-cooking indian can say the difference between a tamarind paste and podi that goes on podi dosaai !!!

When a person mentiones am a vegan, i will order a veg biryani, the food server is sooo engrosed to fake a accent to a married gentleman, imagine what is delivered - chicken biryani with chicken curry !!!!!
