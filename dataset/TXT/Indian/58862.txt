YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA I have eaten here twice. 

The first time we decided to fill up a styrofoam container from the buffet and take it home to eat. We packed a number of dishes -- bhaigan aloo (eggplant and potatoes), saag paneer (spinach and cheese), naan, channa masala (spiced chick peas), daal, rice and pakoras. All were tasty, each dish had its own distinct flavour and none were too oily. We were excited to go back again. 

Good thing I didn't write my Yelp review then because I went back today for their lunch buffet and I was very disappointed. 

We arrived at lunch time (noon) and the buffet food was lukewarm! I would have expected piping hot fresh food at noon! The saag paneer and some veggie korma-type dish were so sweet all you could taste was sugar. The eggplant was passable. There was no channel masala in the buffet offering despite there being a label for it. The daal was bland. Ultimately, every dish from the buffet was muted in flavour or was sweet. We ordered a few poori (fried bread) from the menu and they were oily and floppy, not light and crispy.  

The chocolate ice cream and the plain sweet lassi were my only two enjoyments.  

What happened Gautama? This is NOT what authentic Indian food tastes like. This is Indian food for non-Indians.
