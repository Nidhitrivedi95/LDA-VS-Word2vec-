cu1CvIzOyf-R91pT92NShw I was looking for a good Indian buffet for lunch close to my appointment while visiting town.  I'm glad I found this place.  I have rarely eaten south Indian food, so this was a little different from what I am used to, but I liked it.  Certainly a bit hotter (spicier) than northern Indian.
My favorite surprise was the fish curry.  I was a little wary of fish from a buffet but there were no off tastes and the curry complemented the fish nicely w/o overwhelming it.  The kormas were good as was the potato masala, the dosas,  and the prawn pakoras (never had those before).  I was a little disappointed that there was no rice desert available but they had a variety of different ice creams (including mango) and they had gulab jamun balls (which I have always found to be far too sweet for my tastes).
Nothing fancy here, just good Indian food fast and easy.
