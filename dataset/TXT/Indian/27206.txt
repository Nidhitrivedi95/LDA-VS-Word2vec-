iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ I love all manner of fusion restaurant, and the "Hakka" Indo-Chinese styles really stand out for me. I've been going to the Hakka Garden since it opened a very long time ago and after a management transition a few years ago I had to write this review.

Firstly, this is one of those places that is completely packed after school/work hours and I rarely have the opportunity to even sit down anymore. The atmosphere is a little dim, but clean, and I suppose that goes with the length of time they've gone without redecorating. This place is very kid friendly, but everyone knows that's one of those good/bad things, considering the last thing I need is to hear some kid screaming while I'm trying to have a good time with some friends.

The food really is the star at this place, and in most cases if you ask for mild they'll take it easy on some things though it will be a bit spicy still. I've routinely found that a takeout order does take longer than some of the other places (roughly around 20 minutes) and sometimes service quality by the wait staff/cashiers is sorely lacking. Personally I think it's because they're overworked, but it could just be the transition of management styles over the last few years. 

Recommendations:

-Manchurian Beef
-Chicken Pakoras
