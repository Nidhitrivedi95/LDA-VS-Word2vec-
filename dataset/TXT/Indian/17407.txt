DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Always incredible!! Lunch is a must..you have the opportunity to taste so many of their tasty entrées. Outstanding service! Quick seating..food is always extremely fresh.   If you love Indian cuisine this place is a must!  If you are newer to Indian cuisine then get by at lunch time and you can try such a variety!  Thank you!!
