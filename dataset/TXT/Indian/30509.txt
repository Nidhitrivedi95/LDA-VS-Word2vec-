KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ Had an expensive and mediocre take out lunch.  Chicken vindaloo was okay, biryani better, but chicken was dry in both.  Naan so so tasty. Mango lassi was undrinkable with bits of crusty dry yogurt.  Unlikely to return.  A shame, because this is the only Indian spot in our area.
