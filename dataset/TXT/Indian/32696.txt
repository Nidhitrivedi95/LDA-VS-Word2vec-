LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA After finding this jewel on my first business trip to Mississauga, I have returned on each of my subsequent trips.  The dosas are outstanding.  They have just about every type of dosa you would want, and they will adapt the spice level to your tastes (though they tend to be less spicy than you think, so if you like your food spicy hot, err on the side of asking for your dosa to be more spicy).  

The restaurant can be crowded. The last time I was there, it was a Tuesday night at 7:30pm and we had to wait for a table.  But the wait was only 15 minutes or so.
