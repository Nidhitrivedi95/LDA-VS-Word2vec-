rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ I was here for dinner with my friends. We placed order for papadi chat, chicken drumsticks, dahi puri( not sure if the name is completey correct, it is panipuri with dahi in it) and salt lassi. 

Both papdi chat and panipuri are good. My friends enjoyed it. However, I was disappointed both with the lassi and chicken drumsticks taste. Lassi had too much of masala flavor. I wish I had gone for mango lassi instead. Chicken drumsticks which is my favorite item on the menu was a disappointment for the first time. It was over fried, oily (I could see oil dripping off the piece) and bland.
