jps_9H1RrxC4O0Ia-SfZyA Came in for a late lunch, was seated, and ignored for 5 minutes.  Only one server waiting on 4-5 tables.  I rarely lay down a 1star, but here I sit at Swiss Chalet across the parking lot. (I walked out)  I was looking forward to a curry but will have to find somewhere else -- where the employees head is not firmly planted in his a**.   LOL.   Oh well......
