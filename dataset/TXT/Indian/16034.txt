DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA I went to King of spicy twice, once using a groupon and the second time for their buffet. Their food is good, but I don't recommend the buffet. If you wanna give this place a try, do a la carte. Their dishes are about the same price as the buffet per dish and they have better options on their menu.
