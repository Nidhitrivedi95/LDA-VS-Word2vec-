We tried to put in a reservation ahead of time for a party of seven, but there was confusion over the phone.  When we arrived, it was not busy.  Our food came out at different times - first person served was done eating before the last person got their food.  All meat in the dishes was overcooked, and possibly even re-heated.  Curried vegetables on the side had been frozen - the flavor was good, but the veg had obviously been microwaved as there were icy cold spots, and, it's impossible to miss the texture of potatoes that have been frozen.  Some of the sauces were pretty good (Nepali), others bland (Mongolian chicken, biryani, lo mein).  The momos and their curried dipping sauce were very good.  We'd like to see any restaurant succeed in our neighborhood.  We may try this place again in the future after they've had time to work out the kinks and find a way to provide consistent fresh food.
