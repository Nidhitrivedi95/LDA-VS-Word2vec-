Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA I really like the décor here and our server was friendly, it was nice to hear a Glaswegian accent. We enjoyed the beer and cider on tap. 

We ordered the fish and chips and the vegetarian Shepard's pie. The food came out a little too fast. The fish and fries looked very dark which didn't look too appealing but taste wise were fine. The pie was well seasoned even if I wished veggie options everywhere would stop just throwing beans into things! 

We had heard good reviews on food so perhaps will give that another shot since it didn't bowl us over, but definitely worth a tipple here.
