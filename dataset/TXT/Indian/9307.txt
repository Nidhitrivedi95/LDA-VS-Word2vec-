8GtI_5mG3V1e9vDODgWC1A Imans takeaway offer a delightful range of foods that I at least have not tried before.  The food on offer is reasonably priced, yet even if this were not the case you would still treat yourself to food from here every now and then.  As it is you can regularly treat yourself to the culinary delights on offer here.

The location of this shop enhances your likelihood of a visit as although the area offers many opportunities for bacon rolls, this is one of a kind for the area.

My main recommendation would be to try something new every time you come as there is a great range on offer here all at good prices.
