YI-79PxZcX6X009ynWRLoQ This was my first time visiting Cleveland and decided to give Mirch Masala a try.  I had read other reviews, so was a little skeptical, but in the end, I'm glad I tried it out.  Did not go for the buffet, but ordered take out instead.  I got their Chicken Tikka and Saag Panner.  Both were very tasty and the chicken was cooked to perfection. It was still very moist without being undercooked.  The naan could have been a bit larger, as they were small compared to other Indian restaurants.  

I did not place the order ahead of time, therefore it took about 30 minutes for them to prepare the food (Good to know they were actually making it fresh and not rewarming it). As I waited they brought out an appetizer portion of papadam for me to try. Although it was cold and seemed as if it had been sitting out for a while, it still hit the spot. Not many places will bring you out an appetizer while you are waiting for your food to be cooked.  

I would definitely try Mirch Masala again.  If you're ordering take out, I recommend placing the order ahead of time as it does take a little bit for them to prepare the food.
