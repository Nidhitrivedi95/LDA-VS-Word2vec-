The atmosphere, consistent quality, low prices, and delicious options make this my go-to place when friends come to visit or when I'm just not in the mood to cook. You really can't beat £3-4 for excellent curry in a cozy restaurant. And it's great for students, as it's a 4 minute walk from the main campus.
