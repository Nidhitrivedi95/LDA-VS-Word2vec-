RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg First off I love indian food. My girlfriend n I we're in charlotte visiting from.california. and I wanted her to try indian food. The environment was upbeat with the decor and lighting. And the waiyets were top notch very friendly and helpful. We ordered the.chai tea and some curry dishes. Gotta order spicy tho. She orders mild and I felt.like it. Would be so much better hot. Price is good for the quality an taste.of.our.meal. 4.5/5 definitely go back and try the whole menu
