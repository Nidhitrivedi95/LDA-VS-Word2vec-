epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg Tried the butter chicken roti. It's alright. But I prefer the restaurant on College called "Butter Chicken Roti". It's much better.

Also, service was super slow. I called in a take-out order (2 butter chicken rotis) and was told it would take 15-20 minutes. I arrived 20 minutes later and it still wasn't ready. Nearly 40 minutes after my call, I finally received the order.

And, as I said, it was alright....but there are better rotis out there.
