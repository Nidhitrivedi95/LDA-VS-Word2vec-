82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Excellent Indian with something for everyone. Halal meat for one colleague. Vegetarian options for another, and a fantastic meatfest for another my third colleague and me. 

Great and attentive service. Particularly as one cleague needed to leave for a late-night call and the kitchen hurried his order through allowing him to enjoy while remaining on time.  

When my Indian colleague told me that this was the best Indian food he'd had outside of India, I knew that my enjoyment of it wasn't due to not knowing the cuisine well.  I will definitely be back.
