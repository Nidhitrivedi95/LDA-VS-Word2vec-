jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have been to in the valley.
It has great reviews from critics and some famous clientle that frequent the restaurant.
The location is great for an artsy-evening since it is right by the performing arts center and the modern art museum.
It is quiet and intimate, a great menu and food.
Each experience has been wonderful, both the food and the service.
