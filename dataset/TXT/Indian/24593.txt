H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw Thought the tikka masala was one of the better ones I've had in the city, save for the fact the chicken pieces were so huge that they must have been for a dinosaur.  The kuchuran curry was also solid, nice oniony flavour though it could have been a spicier.  The curry veggies in spicy tomato sauce was a let down, however - too much coconut milk, not enough tomato, and the ration of scallions to other veg was maybe 6:1.  But awful naan.  Another meh Indian resto.
