sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ There is a reason you don't see any photos of my lamb roti (spiced between mild and medium)! I got it to go and I ate it. I pigged out on one delicious roti. Fresh made roti to order and stuffed with sticky sweet spicy savoury tangy goodness with tender lamb pieces. The person at the desk was even nice enough to throw in a sampling of mango garlic chutney. The roti here is thin and plain and compliments the filling so well. 
I am SO going back. 
Service was excellent - polite and welcoming. 
Food was great!
