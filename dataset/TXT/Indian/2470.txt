02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Food is still good, but their service is pretty bad.  Our waiter kept on making bad faces at us ever since my friend ordered something to go and the waiter thought she wanted it in addition to her buffet ( weird right?) Then the manager and waiter tried to hurry us out and made us pay when we were still eating and when the place wasn't full. It was very rude!  I don't know if they changed managers, but you can tell it was no longer a happy and friendly place at this restaurant based on all the worker's faces.
