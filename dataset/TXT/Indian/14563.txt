C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw Decided to order from this place tonight. Placed my order online then called them and asked them to  add two naans to my order which they said no problem. 

On the email confirmation it said the order would take 50 minutes. I receive an email after 50 minutes saying that my order is on its way. It's been now more than 2 hours since I ordered and no delivery showed up and they didn't contact me. Tried to call them more than 5 times only to find out that they are closed for the day.

So I have no idea what happened to my order. There is no way I'm ordering from them again. 1 star is way too high of a rating for a business like that.
