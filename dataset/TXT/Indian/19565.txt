FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg I have been here a few times and the food is always excellent, and more importantly very consistent. The potion size, taste, and quality has been the same every time. 
Their samosas are delicious! Even many item that I have gotten has never disappointed. 
The only downsides I have encountered is that parking is horrible. The restaurant is in a plaza that is always busy. It is not always easy finding a parking spot. The other is that service can sometimes be a little slow. Takeout has always been very quick, while dining in has sometimes taken a little longer then expected.
