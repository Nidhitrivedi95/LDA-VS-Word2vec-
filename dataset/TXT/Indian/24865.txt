h2cPIifmtPD029q4sthRSQ just had lunch here today. delicious, very cheap! $12 lunch buffet. you do not help yourself, instead they serve you a platter with 3 veggie dishes and 3 meat. It may seem like you don't fill up your plate as much as a standard serve yourself buffet, but it is very filling, and the quality is way better than a serve yourself buffet.

Not greasy at all..this was superb! Delicious!

I recommend it if you're in the mood for indian,, and don't like the idea of traditional buffets. This is cleaner, and the food is sent to you perfectly, not dry or mixed all together like in normal buffets.
