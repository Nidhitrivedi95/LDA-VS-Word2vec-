llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg My husband and I were in Madison visiting a friend and were deciding on what to do for dinner. He was looking up restaurants and saw Swad was highly reviewed and recommended. When he suggested it I was hesitant at first because it had been awhile since we had good Indian food. I'm glad we went. 

When we arrived it was later on a Friday night so there was no wait, which was nice. We got our waters right away, but had to wait a little bit to place our order. We decided on the Non-vegetarian dinner for two which came with: Chicken 65, lamb curry, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, rice, Nan, and choice of dessert. 

Chicken 65- delicious pieces of fried chicken

Lamb curry- I would highly suggest if you like lamb, I'm not a huge lamb person so I only ate a little bit. 

Chicken Tikka Masala- This is my go to Indian dish so I have high expectations and they met them. We even ordered extra Nan so I could dip it in the sauce. 

Tandoori chicken- Flavorful, but a little dry for me it tasted delicious with the chicken tikka masala sauce. 

Nan- They serve it warm and it just really enhances the food. We also ordered the garlic Nan, which was worth it to finish the Tikka Masala sauce. 

This place is also on top of their water game, we never had to ask for refills on water and we're very thankful that we came to the restaurant. Hands down I will definitely be going again the next time I'm in the Madison area.
