x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ We will never return. We called in a pickup order on Monday night. They quoted us 15 minutes and we got to the restaurant around 20 min later. Upon arrival the waitress looked up our order then called over the manager, they whispered to each other then disappeared for about five more minutes. When the manager came back to the front we asked where our food was and he said he thought they had told us, but they had given our order to someone else but not to worry because the called the previous customer and asked him to drive back to the restaurant to return our order. As a customer I would not welcome a call like this and drive back because they made a mistake, they should have simply remade the order. Another 10 minutes goes by and the other customer returns with our food. The manager tells us that the food will be on the house and they will also throw in a soup as well. Through all the wait and lack of communication we would have chalked it up to a bad experience and possibly try it again, but upon arriving home they had given us the completely wrong order anyways. Instead of chicken entrees we had dumplings with "kung pao chicken" written on the box. Worst experience we have had at a Chinese restaurant and the food was not even very good.
