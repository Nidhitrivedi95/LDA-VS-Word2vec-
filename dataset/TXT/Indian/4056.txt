16-gsPZnaBJgFi9Le-i27w My wife took me here over the holiday break as a redo of my birthday. 
The food here is fantastic. The prix fix menu for 2 (at $60) is a huge steal. We were eating the food for two days, so at $30 a person the value is great.

The special came with a 4 item chef's sample platter. Each item was flavourful; A good indication of the meal to come. For mains we had the Butter Chicken, Mutter Paneer and a shrimp curry. The Butter Chicken was the best of the three, which isn't to say the others weren't tasty in their own way.

I forget what I had for dessert, but it was good. Some mild flavoured cottage cheese thing. My wife had the roasted marsh mellow ice cream which is definitely one of the top 3 ice creams I've had.

The service was also great. Our waiter was courteous and very helpful. Definitely give this place a visit.
