We got a chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, and garlic naans. The ticken tikka and aloo gobi were quite good and the portion sizes were impressive. On the other hand the garlic naan and the papadum was hugely dissapointing....

The complimentary papadum was SOGGY, like the texture of chips left out with the bag open during humid summee rain. The garlic naan had barely any garlic taste to it and it was very thin. 

The service was very nice and the ambiance is great. The interior is pretty fancy and is comfortable to sit and have a nice dinner. They also serve a buffett lunch.
