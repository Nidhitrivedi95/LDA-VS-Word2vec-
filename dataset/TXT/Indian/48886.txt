tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA I've been going to this place for years, I've always loved their samosas and still do, one of the best I've ever had. 

I also had some tikka masala chicken and naan. The naan was delicious and so fresh, but the tikka masala chicken had more vegetables then meat, and the chicken was hard and dry. Could have been a bad batch, but who knows. 

They have a small dine in section but it is more of a grab and go kind of place. 

Would have given more stars if the chicken wasn't so disappointing, because the samosas are excellent.
