ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because I've only had one meal here. And as I write this review I am devouring my food. I began with the vegetable samosa, this  was well made and everything you expect a samosa to be pure and simple. For my entree I ordered the Chicken Malabar with naan, the portions are large and the flavor is delicious. It's a small place and I have passed this restaurant many times, but this visit was well worth it. In a sea burger joints and pizza places its good to have someone to get a decent meal.
