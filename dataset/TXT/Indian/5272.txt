2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw It's apparent that somehow my experience here differs drastically from others. I don't now where I or the King went wrong but somehow things just didn't work out. Perhaps I was a little late to the game or maybe my expectations were way too high or maybe we just didn't understand each other.

The samosa's are fresh! And....that's about it. The crust tastes great but the filling definitely needs some work (or maybe just a bit more of it). To plainly put it, I've had much better and I've definitely had much worst. As of the rest of the other stuff I am not sure why anyone would want to eat. The biryani is wrong(I know, I know it's an Indian joint but I was craving it that night!), chicken tika is strange and curry chicken is....just confusing. The paneer marsala is paneer-less. Ironically, the only saving grace is something that's not even inheritantly Indian -- butter chicken and even that was subpar. One thing they do have in common though is that they are all salty like the ocean. I can't comment on the sweets as I didn't try them (and neither was anyone which is confusing as they had tons of them).

If you are starving and really can't think of anything to eat AND you are too poor for McDonald's then you will absolutely enjoy saving a few bucks here.
