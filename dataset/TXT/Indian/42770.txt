RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Awesome awesome AWESOME.  I've never had Indian food before and I have to admit - I was a bit *gulp* scared.  All I could think of was me having an Along Came Polly moment later on in the evening.  BUT.  I am a believer of you must trying something (especially food) at least ONCE if you've never had it before.

So...I tried it.  And I liked it.

Our waiter had me and my friends giggling all night long.  He recommended my appetizer and my and a friends' dishes and he nailed it.  I think he could tell that I was the "virgin" when it came to Indian food.  I looked up at him with a "please help" look.

My food was awesome.  I had a seafood curry dish that was awesome.  I could have jumped in the bowl and ate my way out.  So good.  Patio area was nice and soothing.  A tad too dark when dining at night.  The waiters and the staff were all pleasant and so welcoming.  I will def be back ma'ams.  (inside joke)
