3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA I've eaten at most of Toronto's historical Indian Hot spots and had a chance to eat at Curry Twist last night.  It's a small operation -there were 2 cooks in the kitchen and a single server for the whole restaurant.  Has a quaint feel and everyone is VERY friendly (how often do you go into a restaurants and have the cooks greet you while they are cooking?).  Service was top notch but the food was what really stood out.  In short, everything felt "gourmet", as if it had that extra little bit of care and thought put into it to make it taste just right.  Had the butter chicken and my girllfriend (vegetarian) had the butter paneer -basically the vegetarian equivalent of Butter Chicken. We both thought it was fantastic and would rate it among the top spots in and around the city for Indian food.  We also had the pilau (rice) and of course Naan -both of which were top notch.  The price was very reasonable to boot -around $40 for the pair of us to eat well, including tax and tip.  We were impressed and will  be going back.
