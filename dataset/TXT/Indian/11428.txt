AgnnYOtOmSr3W_vUmSIeaw Came to know about this new restaurant in Chandler and tried their lunch buffet today.

Here is my overview

Thumbs up 

Decent selection of Veg and Non-Veg Options.
More flavor than Spice.
Awesome naan. 
Nice ambience.

Thumbs Down 

Location 

Finally, I would recommend trying this place if you don't mind driving a little off from main cross streets.
