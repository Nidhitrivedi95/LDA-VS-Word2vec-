But truth be told their food leaves a lot of room for improvement. I ordered their non veg thali with butter chicken,veg avial ,methi paneer with rice. And my girlfriend had a dosa with curry chicken. Now I can say that their south Indian dishes like the avial and dosa were good however the other food was quite sub par in terms of taste and flavour. But the most worrying aspect was that all the chicken in both dishes had the texture of processed meat,like the kind in chicken nuggets. It's important to note that the tiffin  box is cheap but I think it's a raw deal to be served curried chicken nuggets. If I could rate the people it would be a solid 5 star but the taste of the food forces my hand to give the tiffin box a 3.
