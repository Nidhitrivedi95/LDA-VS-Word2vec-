Food - We ordered the Gobi Mancurian for appetizers. Presentation was nice and it tasted great. We ordered the Masala Dosa and the Spicy Masala Dosa. The flavors were good. The chutnies were very tasty, the sambar needed a little more flavor and they could have added a little more potato filling in the dosas. The dosas were a little too crispy for our taste.
All in all a great experience. We are planning to go back when we are in the area.
