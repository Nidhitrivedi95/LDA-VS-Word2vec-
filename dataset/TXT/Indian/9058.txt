82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Went on a Monday night and the place was busy. Nice room. The currys were bland by Irish/UK standards. Veggie starter platter - bahji was dry, aloo tiki was too salty, samosa was standard. I had the beef curry - beef quality was good, however the sauce was tasteless. Service was fine.
