vZu3xxlMQSqFngDgdFLfXg I went to Tamarind hoping to eat some good Indian food. The place is in the food court and seemed to be one of the less busier spots when i went. I ordered a vegetarian biryani, a veggie side (aloo jalfrezi) and a samosa. After taxes, it costed me $11.94. That was the WORST Indian food I have eaten in quite sometime. Save yourself the effort, even if you're craving Indian food and go to some of the nicer spots around. The taste and the cost probably explain why its not that busy compared to the other joints in the food court.
