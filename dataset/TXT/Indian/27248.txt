iJfS02AOptwkaWD-vOVRew Love it!!!
First of all the food is wonderful. Every time we go we try something different and have yet to be disappointed. I recommend the Lamb Masala ( spicy of course) and my husband loves the Chicken Vindaloo.
Dinner is great here with nice sized portions. Lunch has a great buffet available, which offers different options each time, giving us the chance to try new dishes. 
I would have to say the best part is the service! India grill is clearly run by a very kind family who knows how to take care of their customers. We once went to the lunch buffet a bit close to the end lunch service, they were serving one of my very favorites, Lamb Tekka Masala, but they were pretty much out. When I asked the server ( a young guy who always serves us and is awesome) if they would be replenishing this dish, he said he would see what he could do, and promptly returned with my own mini serving of the dish!! If he had come back and said they were not replenishing I would have totally understood, but as always the staff went above and beyond!!!
With all the Indian food options in the valley, we continue to return over and over knowing we will always receive amazing service!
Go there.... Now!!! You won't regret it!
