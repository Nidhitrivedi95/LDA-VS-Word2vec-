nAnpTnodDchSl9H0f6R2pw Went for a quick lunch and the food was outstanding! Had vegetable pakoras and chicken vindaloo and Dahl. Everything was great. 
The service was very good and the chef came out at the end to see how we liked it and we told him it was amazing!
Can't wait to go back! Best Indian food that I have had in a long time !!
