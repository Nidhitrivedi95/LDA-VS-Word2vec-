RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w If "The Host" is the pinnacle of fine dining in Toronto, Lahore Tikka House is at the other end of the spectrum - while they won't win any awards for their decor (still under construction after many months), their Ukrainian summer camp/beer garden outdoor dining area or plastic cutlery and styrofoam plates, they most certainly win accolades for dishing up spicy, tangy and toothsome South Asian cuisine. 

By the time you've finished butchering your pronunciation of the dishes on the menu, the super friendly server has already communicated your order (via telekinesis or ESP, I don't know) to the kitchen staff and the ball is rolling. No joke, food for our group of ten people was in front of our snouts within five minutes. There were a lot of vegetarian options and while the food was good, it wasn't fabulous. I have had better Indian food in this city - although perhaps I just didn't like the style of the sauce. It wasn't wet enough for me. I like my sauce wet, people. Got it?

Fantastic for groups. I daresay you could bring a party of 100 here and the staff wouldn't even flinch. 

Delicious kolfi for dessert (signature flavour made in-house, the rest made by Kolfi King) was a welcome break from all the hot, flavourful food. But I'm still in a funk because the Kolfi King himself still hasn't replied to any of my emails.
