ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA I'm not an expert on Indian cuisine, with that said the lunch buffet was a great way to sample some different items without being too overwhelmed. The staff was nice and answered my questions (basically the same question over and over "What's in this?"). 

I thought the Chicken Tikka Masala was really good and worth checking out.
