RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Located in the heart of Ballantyne is the Blue Taj Indian restaurant.  I've been here several times and each time has been a great experience from the service to the food. If you've never been to an Indian restaurant, it can feel somewhat daunting but here everything is explained in a clear to understand manner on the menu so you know exactly what to expect. You also have the choice of which spice level you're looking for from none to the real deal, I personally prefer the spiciest level and it's delicious. 

I'm still learning the menu, so I can't make a good recommendation but the Chicken Methi Curry seems to be my go to choice thus far. The prices are slightly higher than you'd expect but the food is worth it. Definitely, a must go to spot in Ballantyne. The location can be a little hard to find since it located inside of the common shopping area but when you smell the alluring aroma of the curry then you've arrived. Also, the noise level is higher than I expected on the occasions I've gone, so wouldn't recommend this a quiet romantic venue for dinner. However, by far one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte.
