DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg My wife and I have been here three or four times during Lent, when we've been desperate for something tasty and vegetarian/vegan to eat. It's really hit the spot every time, so much so that it's a contender for our favorite Indian buffet in the Valley. They don't have the biggest spread, and the offerings have varied a bit each time we've been (I wish they'd give out a calendar listing Gobi Manchurian days in advance), but I've yet to try anything I don't like there.

Something I like about Udupi, but others might dislike, is that it's a little bit different every time. It's seemed to me like the spice level and flavor profiles have varied subtly each time I've eaten here - just enough to keep it interesting, and always within the bounds of "really good". 

As a meat-lover who's dabbled in vegetarianism and veganism, I've never thought, "I wish this meal had some meat," while eating at Udupi Café. And that's certainly enough to keep me coming back from time to time.
