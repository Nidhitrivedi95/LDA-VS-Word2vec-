cNAyzZO_vX2Ib_sfkZdrLg First of all, please don't be put off by the construction outside! Shri Bheemas is up a flight of stairs, but the restaurant is spacious and the decor is lovely. I can't fault the food at all - I was there with my parents and sister for dinner, and we each chose a starter. The Punjabi samosas were excellent, stuffed full and the pastry wasn't greasy, and all of the starters were presented beautifully on their plates. We also ordered some drinks, and they happily provided an ice bucket for the bottle of white wine we shared.

The food can be ordered as a side or a main. I couldn't decide, so ordered the Bombay aloo and the channa masala as two sides and both were delicious, amazing flavour. I was very satisfied with my dinner, as was my family. We also ordered two of the garlic naan and two rice bowls. The naan in particular was amazing, and there was more than enough for the four of us, though we maybe could have done with ordering slightly more rice between us. The mains were presented as nicely as the starters, with the food brought out in pretty dishes that were great for sharing.

I really can't find fault with Shri Bheemas, the service was wonderful and the staff friendly, a lovely interior, and amazing food. Would definitely like to visit again
