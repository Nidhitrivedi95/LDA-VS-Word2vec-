UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg We love this place and always come back to it as our favourite Indian restaurant. It's clean, the service is professional and the food is delicious. 

I also wanted to say that one time I left my purse on the back of the chair, and got downtown, realized I didn't have it, and called them. They told me not to worry, they'd kept it behind the counter for me. I picked it up late that night, even got there after closing. I appreciate that!!

The only thing that keeps it from five starts for me are: It's so close to traffic and the parking lot. Would be so nice to have a better view from the terrace. Also, we often have to wait... but that's also a good thing because so many people love it! 

Good food, great place!
