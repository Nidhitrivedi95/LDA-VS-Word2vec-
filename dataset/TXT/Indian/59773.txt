ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg It was 3rd time I visited this Indian restaurant 
Lunch buffet was just okay . Great food but not many selections to choose 
And tonight I tried for dinner 
Food was good almost same like lunch 
My husband asked its come with rice or not . Server said yes so we order garlic naan and rice so we can share 
The end ...they changed 2 rice and 1 naan
2 rice for $8???? What??? 
I'm sorry I'm not gonna go back. I better go curry leaf.
