kTJEf56gjzBSpi9X14X54Q Very good South Indian vegetarian food with a good variety of dishes. I go to this place regularly and they have some new dishes in the menu every now and then and some seasonal Indian snacks in addition. It is an inexpensive place with freshly made food and a single table with few chairs but mostly food to take away. The single table is a self clean area and they don't charge like restaurant . Family run business, nice friendly people.
