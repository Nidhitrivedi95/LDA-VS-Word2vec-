9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A Terrible food! Unprofessional servers!

If I could give negative I would have. The restaurant servers are aged, rude and unprofessional bangladeshi men. We were asked to sit on table with soiled plates from the previous customers, on repeated requests (precisely 5 times) it was removed. 
While waiting for the clean up and the menu we turned sckeptical about the food( and we were so right..DRY and TASTELESS) seeing the dishes served around and ordered really minimal. They served us after 45mins and on our repeated inquiries about the food the server said that he thought we are not hungry hence he has not served us. 
Lastly to make our experience from terrible to worse he forced us to tip him. When my husband refused stating that we are neither happy with the food or the service. He said that since you have finished whatever you have ordered ( we just ordered 2 naan n dalh for 2 of us) its mandatory to tip in montreal. Really!!! I think thats they way the try to fool tourists like us. We left without tipping them and he started cursing us in french( of whatever little we know we could get few words).
They spoiled our last meal in montreal!!
