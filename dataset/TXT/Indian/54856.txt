WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA Purely based on service.. We were rushed into ordering, in others finishing our dinner quickly and get out.. Waiters were arrogant.. They question you for not tipping on horrible service.. If you serve right is when you tip.. Isn't that normal? Is it not a customers right to tip.. Food was average.. Quality seems to be dropping over time.. Looks like the kitchen has changed hands too.. Not the one I've been going to anymore.. Check the new place Bombay BBQ around the corner.. They're better on food, price and service.. Wish I could rate you no stars.. Don't deserve one either..
