DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Excellent flavors, nice presentation of food when dining in. Clearly labeled vegan options on the menu. They serve yogurt dipping sauce with vegan meals, though. The buffet was not clearly labeled, but it was easy to see what was vegan or ask the staff. Good for take-out too.
