xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Fry Bread house, what a treat! I went there on a Friday evening and ordered the veggie taco. The fry bread is absolutley delicious and you can get away with spending less than $8 and be completely stuffed.

After the veggie taco, a friend and i shared the honey fry bread desert. Get it, you'll be pissed if you don't. The place isn't much to look at but the food more than makes up for the lack of decoration or ambiance.
