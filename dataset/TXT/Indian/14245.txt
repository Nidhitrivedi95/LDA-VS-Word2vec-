c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Went here last night and it was busy at 6PM with people waiting to order and some waiting for pick up. 

I ordered:
Whole Tandoori Chicken (comes with 2 naans)
"Highlight" Special - Bihari Kabob with one naan 
Chicken Biryani ($6.50!!!!)


When we ordered, the cashier let us know that it would be a 30 minute wait. We said ok and left. Came back about 20 minutes later and it was ready! Came home and the naan was piping hot! The tandoori chicken was so good. Bihari kabob was also great - spicy too. 

Chicken biryani tasted well seasoned (maybe boxed spices, not too sure). I would definitely order again! It was our first time going here. 

When we went back, it was just as busy. The total bill came to $40 with taxes!! Woohoo!
