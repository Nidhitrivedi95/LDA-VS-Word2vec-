ajMgo23H5Qcn7Ma-xtiCqQ I love Indian food and having just come from Hong Kong (which has GREAT indian), I wasn't expecting much. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my visit to High Park Spicy House. I got the Matar Paneer Masala with Naan and a Lassi. All were up to my high standards. The lassi was a bit sweet for my taste but, I've had it like that in many different, authentic places. The waiter (owner?) was also very sweet and attentive. You can tell that he really cares about the restaurant and wants it to succeed. I would definitely recommend
