0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg Being new to Charlotte, I've been trying out a bunch of restaurants. Found my new Indian go-to. On a shared ride home from work, a friend and I decided to stop here for a well deserved end-of-week dinner. The place is easy, low key and casual--exactly needed after a long week. We ordered at the counter and then found a table to sit at. The people there are incredibly nice and helpful and the tables are clean and orderly. They're happy to help if it's your first time there or having Indian food. We got an order of naan, chicken tiki masala, lamb biryani and mango lassi. They did suggest we go lightly spicy on our food but found it a little too light. Light is about a 3 on a scale of 1-10. All the food was delicious - incredibly aromatic and flavorful. There was no skimping on meat in our dishes and the serving sizes were generous. We had enough to each take home leftovers. The lassi was delicious. Can't wait to try their lamb rogan josh.
