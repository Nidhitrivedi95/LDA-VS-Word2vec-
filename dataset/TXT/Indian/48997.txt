TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Well I'm a vegetarian, and to be honest it's ok. I usually eat only eat super healthy food, and the food was really oily and waaay to many spices. I could barely taste the potatoes. But it wasn't bad. It just depends on what you like. Komol across it is actually amazing, so if you don't like it... go there!
