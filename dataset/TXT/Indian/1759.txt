-XNodvHlq9oDu-kQBwGFkg W dined on a Saturday night. Appetizer took long to arrive. It was cooked fresh. Taste was okay. Nothing spectacular. The main course was okay too. We had ordered mutton biryani which was was terrible. The meat was dry and over cooked and felt like we were eating cardboard.!

It was our first try.  Not coming back .
