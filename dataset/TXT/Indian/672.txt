-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ I got a new job in Mississauga so I have been food ranging. I've been somewhat disappointed in the food selection in Sauga. But CDK stands out as a gem. 

It's quite similar to Indian food. Lots of spices, comes with naan, and can be quite saucy. I've tried a variety of dishes here. The lunch specials are great deals. But at regular prices I would think the food is a bit pricey. 

The food is absolutely delicious. Lunch specials come with rice, naan, butter chicken, kebobs, and some kind of bean sauce. 

This is among my top choices for lunch due to reasonable lunch special prices and great taste.
