7LNuQqjcjAn0bBlGHIiQzQ This place is close and has buffet which is what we like, variety. Came for Sunday lunch. 

They have a variety of curry: chicken, beef, lamb, shrimp. They also have butter chicken and many vegetarian dishes. All the curry was good but seemed like it was from yesterday. The tandoori chicken was flavorful and not too dry. The naan was fresh and not too oily, which I liked. The rice had cilantro and other herbs in it which I didn't like. I wish they had plain rice.

I feel like they had more variety before, not much in terms of salad/fruits/dessert. I had the usual Indian "timbit" which is always good. I thought they had samosas before which was the main reason I came but they didn't this time. The service was okay pretty standard. Decor was dark and a bit dated. Didn't seem especially clean. Overall everything was A-OK. Unless I find a better one in the area this place will satisfy my craving for Indian curries and naan.
