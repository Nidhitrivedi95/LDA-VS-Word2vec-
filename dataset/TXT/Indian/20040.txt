FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I like ordering take out from Maharani only because it's convenient and you can order through Yelp, so that's pretty neat. They're usually pretty quick about pick up and they're open until 10pm. 

The food is very average. It's really nothing special. I always get the Chicken Tikka Masala. Sadly, the last time I got it, it was just a very soupy tomato sauce. Honestly, it could have passed for tomato soup with large pieces of boiled chicken.

I've had the Mango Lassi here too. Again, nothing special. I suspect they use frozen mangos. It's still pretty good though, but it's hard to mess up a mango lassi!
