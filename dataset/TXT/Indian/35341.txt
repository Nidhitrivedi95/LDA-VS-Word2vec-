muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw We were craving exotic eats and have been dying to try Tahoora for a while now. We went on a Sunday night and lucky us, they have a buffet on Sundays!! This meant that we got to try everything! The buffet had multiple Afghan + Indian chicken specialties, naan, sauces, veggies, rice, beans, beef, goat's feet {I wasn't daring enough for this}, a few desserts, and it was the perfect way to explore other options, rather than just order your go-to dishes. I've never had Afghan food before, so it was cool trying that twist to traditional Indian food. I didn't take any photos because well, let's be honest, a bunch of saucy items thrown on a plate isn't very photogenic BUT the flavors are insanely delicious! If you come here, I recommend coming on a Sunday so that you can try a little bit of everything! It is on the pricey side at $13.99 per person but it is all-you-can-eat and that includes a fountain drink as well. :) Enjoy!
