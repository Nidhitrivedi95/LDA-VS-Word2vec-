ToU2fHhYJ6_7AVc_MojMRg Indian food is one of my hangover remedies and I always go with Bombay to Go.  They're friendly on the phone and the food usually arrives withing 30-45 minutes.  The delivery guys, who I sadly know quite well as I am always hungover, are very personable.  I'm not going to say the food is the best I've ever had but damn it's good when you're on the couch recuperating.  I recommend the palak paneer and the chicken/lamb vindaloo.
