UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ Kebob Express is an unsuspecting gem! From the moment we entered, we were welcomed with kindness and the gentleman explained all the dishes since it was our first time dining there. We ordered the chicken tikka and chicken sheeh kebob and they were the most flavorful chicken dishes we've ever had!! The chicken and naan were so fresh and delicious! We will be back!
