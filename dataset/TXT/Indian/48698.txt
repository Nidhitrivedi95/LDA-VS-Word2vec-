The basmati rice was beautifully cooked to a nice fluffiness. The chicken tikka masala was very tender and lean. The chicken biryani had a bit of a kick to it, as the chicken was spicy. Naan was phenomenal. Overall, delicious.

Service was extremely hospitable. Restaurant was first floor of a house, which was quaint.
