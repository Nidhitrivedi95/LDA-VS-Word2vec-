vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg Enjoyed a quiet dinner for two at Waterfalls last night. At 19:00 we were the only ones in the place, so the service was probably more attentive than is typical. Has the look and feel of a high end Indian restaurant, but with surprisingly reasonable prices. Started with vegetable pakoras which were fantastic. Our entrees were lamb vindaloo, eggplant curry (bartha), and a shrimp dish. Not spicy enough for my tastes, but decent. What they lack in flavour Waterfalls makes up for in presentation.  

Obligatory Title Pun: FALL in love with this classy option in Kensington.

Menu Readability: Divided cleanly into apps, entrees and desserts.  

Need to mention: Next time I'll probably stick with the apps/tapas. Good way to get some variety and it was the highlight of the meal.

What this place teaches me about myself: Choosing a table is actually tough when there's no one else in the place.
