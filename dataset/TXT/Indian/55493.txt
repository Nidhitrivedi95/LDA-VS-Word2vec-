x1GM1mzeDx4ARUGKV8n98Q After moving out of the southwest, I would have cravings from Indian frybread. Thank you Indian Village for filling a 4-year old craving!!! The frybread was delicious and crispy with minimal oil (considering that it is fried in oil). It was served nicely hot and fresh with powered sugar and honey. Delish!!!
