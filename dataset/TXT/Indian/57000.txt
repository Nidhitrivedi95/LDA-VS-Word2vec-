xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I see a lot of folks come here for the fry bread tacos - well......I had to be different and have their red chili beef tamale.  The BEST tamale I have had in a LONNNNNNNG time.  I also got the fry bread with honey because in another life I swear I was a bear - I can't turn down honey ever.  My hubby had their pozole soup.......very flavorful and the meat in it was ridiculous!  This will be a visit of MANY more to come.  I LOVE the Fry Bread House.
