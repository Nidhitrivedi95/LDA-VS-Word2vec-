82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Being indian with a mother who cooked curries at least 3 times a week my bar is pretty high. With that being said this is my all time favourite Indian restaurant and lives up to my high standards. The restaurant is modern, clean but with Indian ornate decoration. The food is presented in traditional indian style metal bowls which is great for family style sharing.  We started with popadoms that came with four sauces/dips; tangy tamarind, cooling yoghurt, spicy mint and another that was unidentifiable to me.
The restaurant had a very authentic style of cooking and the curries tasted as if they were home cooked by my mom, using very minimal amounts of oil/ghee and with perfect seasoning. 
We ordered the tandoori chicken, lamb saag and dhal. The chicken and lamb were both succulent.  The dhal had perfect consistency!
As sides we ordered rice, roti and keema naan. In my mind the only thing that wasn't on point was the keema naan, the flavors just weren't what I was expecting and lacked depth and the decadence I normally associate with this type of bread.
However, the desserts were on point! The warm gulab jaman was just sweet enough without being sickly, the freshly made rasmalai tasted creamy and milky. The perfect end to a gorgeous meal.
The waiter was attentive without being overbearing, he answered questions and added suggestions.
The whole experience was pleasant and reinforced that the positive experience we had the time before wasn't just an anomaly.
