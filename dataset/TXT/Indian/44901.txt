S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Way too expensive buffet for very less items and were tasting very bad. It was $25 per person and there were no special items like biryani. Sambar was tasting like it was made ages ago. Very disappointed. I would not recommend this. And all the labels to the dishes were placed wrong.
