J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I dined here two times with different crowd of friends. The first time, I had a meal combo with lamb and also a butter chicken meal. The lamb tasted old, dry and hard to bite, I was very disappointed in what i got when i wanted to spend extra $$ on my meal for celebration. 
The second time, I was invited by a friend for a surprise. I ordered butter chicken was so so... still...disappointed. We didn't finish every dishes that came to our table. Well, no complains for their food quality and cleanliness of the restaurant. The service was just okay~.....
