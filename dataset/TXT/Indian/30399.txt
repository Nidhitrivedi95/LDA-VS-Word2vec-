K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Had the lunch buffet for 10.99 today, excellent value. Restaurant is in a strip plaza with ample parking. Variety was not bad, I particularly enjoyed the pakora, butter chicken, cauliflower, naan bread and sliced papaya for dessert. I didn't find any of the food spicy at all which was too bad. I will definitely be back.
