KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Terrible food. I asked the guy to give me his recommendation. The pieces of chicken were not good ones. Neither was the food fresh. I could tell it was cooked several hours, maybe even days ago. The best thing served was fresh naan bread. Service was ok. Maybe they had an off day. But I can't even think about the food.
