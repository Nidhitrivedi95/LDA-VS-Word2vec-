MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g The sorriest looking and tasting Dosa's in town. We ordered the Mysore masala and Mysore plain Dosas  on our visit last week. The dosas were so thin that you can't even taste the flavor and the the red paste that makes a Mysore dosa a Mysore dosa was virtually non existent! They skimp on the batter so much no wonder the dosa was so thin.
We have tried their Punjabi food which is not bad, but the dosas were a big disappointment!
On top of that we decided to have their ice cream which was another disappointment, clearly stale looking and dry.

Ambience = good combined with styrofoam cups
Price= over priced
Food= below average
