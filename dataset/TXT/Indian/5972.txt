3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Great place for a first date; nice ambiance... the music is half Indian/half American and the decor is modern and subdued. There are white tablecloths with white paper tops, and lots of booths. The menu is varied with lots of choices for vegetarians and those looking for healthy food. My fish curry had some serious capsaicin authority, and I had ordered it as a 3 spiciness on a scale of 1-10. So if you don't appreciate spicy food, order it mild, mild, mild. My vegetable samosas were spiced perfectly, but my son would have complained that they were too spicy. I really liked the buckwheat roti (like a pancake).
