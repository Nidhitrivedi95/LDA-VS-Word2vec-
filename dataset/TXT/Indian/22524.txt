gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I had always wanted to try Indian food, and really wanted to try a buffet so I could sample a lot of different dishes, but most restaurants that have a buffet are not vegetarian so most of the dishes would have been off limits for me.  Not the case with Ruchi!  An entire buffet of vegetarian food!  It was like a dream.  I tried almost everything...and everything was really good!  The young guy that served us, was so nice and helpful, and after telling him it was my first time eating Indian food, he explained what things were, what chutneys go with what, and how things are generally eaten.  I really can't wait to go back!
