xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg Finally a proper Indian place. The chicken biryani with mid lvl spice is meant for people from India. If you are not accustomed to eating indian food please do ask for low spice. This place is legit! 

There was very less chicken in the biryani. Hence the 4 out of five. 

I also had the buffet which was just like any other place, decent options for both veg and non veg. Good real indian food with real spices. I guess its new so they have not americanized it. Hopefully they wont but it almost always seems to happen.
