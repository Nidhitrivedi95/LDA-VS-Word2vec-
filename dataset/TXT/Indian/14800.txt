cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw The best Bihari kabab I have ever had. We randomly ended up going to this place without having any expectations and boy, were we pleasantly surprised. The lamb and chicken biryani are also really good. However the Bihari kabab trumps everything. So well done and melts in your mouth. If anyone is looking to try good Pakistani cuisine I would definitely recommend this place. Service could be a little better but it's not horrible.
