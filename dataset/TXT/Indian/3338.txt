We visited this place twice already and both times we were not disappointed. They have daily specials that run you only $5. Our favourite thing to get so far is the chicken biriyani. At $5 you get huge chunks of chicken with a side of flavour explosion. You will not be disappointed. 
This is definitely a place we will be going back to for our Indian food craves.
