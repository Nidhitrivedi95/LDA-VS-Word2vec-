RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Been here few times for dinner and once for buffet, nice place for a date, food taste and portion is good, clean, noticed friendly and attentive service during all my visits... Sunday buffets($30 for 2) are awesome and I am a fan of there pani puri and pav baji...  on the flip side few tables have poor ambiance lighting and hard to even read the menu during dinner ( noticed people on neighboring and our table using mobile torch lights to read the menu)..
