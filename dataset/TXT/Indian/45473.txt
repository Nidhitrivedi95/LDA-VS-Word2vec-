ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Maybe we were spoiled by some excellent Indian restaurants in Cincinnati but Indian Garden did not live up to the reviews on here. Compared to other buffets we have been to, the offering is very limited. The chicken in the masala and curry was not breast meat as advertised. My girlfriend is picky about only liking white meat so this was an issue for her. I'm not very picky and even I found the meat to be lower in quality. The flavors were average if not a bit bland. I am rating the restaurant a 2 purely based off of good service. The naan was the highlight of the meal.
