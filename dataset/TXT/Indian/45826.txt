SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ The sign outside of the restaurant says fine Indian cuisine. But there's nothing  that reads 'fine' in this restaurant. The interior is very dated with dark carpeted floors. The bench style seating also has formica table tops. I received my silverware wrapped in a white paper napkin. And I received my water in an amber colored plastic cup, the likes of what you'd see in a cafeteria. You get the drift, it's not a fine dining kind of place.

I was on the fence about trying it, but decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, the food was good. Not stellar, but definitely tasty. The portion sizes were also more than average. The staff was pleasant. They gave me a to-go cup for my mango lassi. I'd try it again if I have another craving for Indian food when I'm downtown.
