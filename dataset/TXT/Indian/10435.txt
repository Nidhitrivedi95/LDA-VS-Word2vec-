9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g We enjoy Indian food. We frequent a number of strip mall restaurants. Artisan cooking is fun to eat. Then last week we had lunch at Khazana. No more strip malls. There is a difference between cooks and chefs. We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered. I am no pretentious foodie, I love good food and expect value (quality not quantity). The spicing was layered and fantastic. The food was prepared well and came to the table hot. There were chunks of chicken that were juicy. The naan was plentiful and very well made (another pet peeve of mine at some places). Initially the server started off a little stand-offish, but became really pleasant and attentive once the food arrived and we started eating. It's a bit of a drive from home, but we will be back to work our way methodically through the menu.
