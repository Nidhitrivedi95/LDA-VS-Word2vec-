Food 5/5

I'm not a big Indian food guy, but dang!  I didn't care how spicy everything was but everything from the tiffin shiffin (palak paneer) to the Naan was done just perfectly. The food made me salivate from the presentation, but the food also tasted amazing! 

As an Asian couple, we recommend lot pot ki chaat, crispy Cauliflower, and the paneer bhujuri. We also had a birthday cake for our friend, and they added some extra decorations on the plate and a candle which was A+ attention to detail and device!
