I was with a party of 5 and we all got something different and spent the evening swapping tastes of each others dishes. I myself had "Palak Paneer" and "Yellow Rice". The paneer was excellent and generous portions of tofu. The rice was nearly perfect but just a tad undercooked/dry but worked well as a mix with the paneer wrapped up in fresh nan.

The dishes and the restaurant are well presented with authentic palettes and decor. The music was subtle an unobtrusive and the waiter was superb.

While this restaurant is in Vegas, the prices were a little high than I'd normally expect but are a pretty good deal considering the location. Good deals can be had if you check the normal coupon books. There are specific ones for Tamba that could have saved us a bit.

With all that said, while the food was excellent, the staff was superb, and the atmosphere was inviting, the restrooms were atrocious. I was pretty shocked considering the dining experience to find the bathrooms somewhat trashed and unkept which worried me a little.

Overall I still give Tamba 4/5, but please folks, take care of those frightening bathrooms and you'd easily be a 5.
