RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Great sauces, wonderful meats!!  The meat is always tender.  The prices are a little below average, which is nice.  I never get the buffet so nothing to say on that.  The nan was perfectly cooked.  The only problem is that they don't deliver.  Great!!  One of my favorite Indian places in Pittsburgh!
