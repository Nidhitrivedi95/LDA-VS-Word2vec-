qc764RiIDhpPB_fHROMjZw I visit the grange when I want some cheap but filling food.

I just saw that the Curry Kitchen had recently opened (it used to be an extremely overpriced Greek place), so I decided to try their spiciest curry, which they said was the beef curry for $6.99.

It came in one of the usual take-out boxes, half filled with salad and half with rice + curry.

It was not what I expected, tasting like Chinese style curry (mild & non-spicy) as opposed to Indian style curry (rich, thick, spicy curry).  I did not taste any spiciness at all.  It wasn't bad by any means, but I can't say it was good.

Overall, I would say 2 Stars because the price point is high for the amount of food.

Compared to the other Curry places close by:
- Yueh Tung (2 blocks away) has a beef or chicken curry for $6.50, with 3x the amount of meat/rice.
- Quality is the same as Indian Biriyani House, at a slightly higher price point.
- Amaya Express (Urban Eatery @ Eaton Centre) is also much better, but slightly pricier at around $10.
- For authentic spicy Indian curry, go to Matagali Restaurant (but be aware price is essentially doubled at the $12 price point)
