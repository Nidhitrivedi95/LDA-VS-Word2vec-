0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg Maybe it's a new year, new good mood thing, but I can't help give this place 5 stars, simply because they deserve it. I come here about once a week with at least two of my coworkers, one from Northern India, one from Southern India, and they both are more than satisfied - in fact, they think this is one of the best Indian restaurants they've ever eaten at. I have to wholeheartedly agree, as the only time I've had better briyani was when it was homemade. We've tried a number of dishes, including chicken tikka (think of boneless chicken, red because of the marinade, and tender as if it's been slow cooked for days on end) and lamb and chicken briyani. We've also tried about 10 more dishes, the names of which I can't currently recall, and I can honestly say I've yet to have a single dish I wouldn't reorder. Also, the mango lassis are wonderful!

Overall, a great Indian place, a great dinner choice, and must-try if you like Indian or just want to branch out. Also, there are plenty of seats and the staff are all super nice!
