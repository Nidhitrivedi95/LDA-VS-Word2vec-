S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA My friend and I are total foodies, and are always looking for new culinary experiences.  Indian food is definitely one of our favorites, and this place stand above the rest.  We overheard some of the other patrons who were of Indian descent, say it was like eating their mother's cooking.  The place is managed by two brothers who were incredibly gracious and attentive.  The best part of our experience other than the amazing food, was they let us take our leftovers home...that is unheard of for a buffet!  We will certainly make this a regular stop for us, especially since you can also take the buffet to go!
