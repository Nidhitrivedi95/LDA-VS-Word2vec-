b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw AMAZING food!
SO helpful!
We had aloo bondas and Poori Curry. 
We are vegan and they were very accommodating!
Lots of meat entrees as well for the meat lovers. Spacious dining room and brightly painted colors. Definitely making this our go to Indian restaurant!
Staff was so kind!


Update:
We have since visited weekly, and still get the Poori Curry and Aloo Bondas. They are amazing, but we will soon try other items. The owner, Sunny and the General Manager, Ryan are both amazing and will accommodate to your needs, level of heat in the food, and whatever else you may need! Parking can be found on Detroit Road or on the side streets nearby! South Indian food blows the North Indian out of the park!
