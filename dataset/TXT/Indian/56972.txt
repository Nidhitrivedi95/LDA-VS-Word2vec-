We visited there and their sparsely-furnished dining hall was in transition. We overheard they're moving so I can understand. But let's be honest: you're not here for the decor or for a fully-paved parking lot. You want el sabor supremo.

I got the ground beef taco, hubby got the chorizo. Oh wow. So much punch. So salty. So delicious. This is the kind of meal you are sad that bits of cheese and meat are still stuck to the serving paper under the taco and you want to eat them but are afraid of also consuming paper fibers. But you do it anyways because YOLO.
