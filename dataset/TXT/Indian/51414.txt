UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Was here over a great weekend where we saw Peter Gabriel at Planet Hollywood and The Beatles LOVE show by Cirque du Soleil. We could have eaten anywhere on the strip, but chose Mint based upon their menu and reviews. We came in late, after LOVE and were seated. The gentleman who came over to our table was a joy, asking us what we might like, the level of spice we may want in our food, etc. He is the owner. The menu is extensive: Northern, Southern Indian with Himalayan foods offered, as well. I asked for his help in navigating the menu and he guided us brilliantly. The food, service and experience was one that I WILL repeat - EVERY time I am in Vegas. It was THAT good.
