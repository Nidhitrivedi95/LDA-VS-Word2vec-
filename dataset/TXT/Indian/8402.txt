Service: 1

This place has very good food but the service is terrible. The lunch buffet is never ready when they open at 11:30. You have to sit and wait 10 to 15 minutes for them to put everything out. If you are going to open at 11:30, be ready at 11:30! If you order any drink other than water you are lucky to get it before you are finished with your meal.
