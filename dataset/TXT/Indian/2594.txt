02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Another Indian reviewer here. This place is a complete disappointment and I *never* eat there. A friend and I went for lunch once and became so aggravated at sitting and waiting at our table with no service that we were cussing under our breath by the time the waiter came, giving new meaning to the word "waiter". 

The food is mediocre. I didn't like (or trust) the quality of the chicken in my chicken tikka masala. There is far better Indian food to be had throughout the Valley.
