7U5-h997PyWX4B8uMk4Tcw We went to their branch on finch ave in Etobicoke. They are scamming ppl. They told us things were on sale (its even advertised on the front of the shop) but when we paid they had charged us regular price for everything.  When we pointed out to the "manager" he tried to tell me that the price has gone up. Very unethical....its no different than stealing.
