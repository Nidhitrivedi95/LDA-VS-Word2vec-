The cocktail menu had a lot of variety.  There weren't many people in there, but it took a really long time to get our drinks.  When we got them, the person that brought then was confused about what he had, but they turned out to be right.  They were pretty good...I had an Aviation and it tasted right.  We ordered a second round and by that time it was just us and it still took forever to get our drinks.  The atmosphere was kind of plain.  I guess I was just expecting more from a place that has such a unique concept.  The food menu looked really good, but we didn't eat.  I would definitely like to come back and eat and see what this place is like after they get a little more experience, so take this review with a grain of salt, I may change my rating after trying thus place again.
