UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Mint is located a few blocks from the strip and practically across from the University. This attracts both visitors and local students to their restaurant.

The lunch buffet is what I usually go here for. With the UNLV discount, it is an affordable and tasty option.

During the daytime, the interior looks bright and airy. At night it has a moody romantic atmosphere. The servers are always friendly and I'm so glad they are very accommodating for people with food allergies. The menu is clearly labeled with icons indicating Veg/GF/Nuts/Etc.

Onto the food! Goat curry and any paneer dish are the things I make a beeline for. The goat is tender and full of flavor every time I come here.

For dinner, I usually get takeout on my way home. I've tried the Rebel Curry, Saag, Rogan Josh, and a few others. There's lots to try here.

Dinner or lunch, Mint does not disappoint.
