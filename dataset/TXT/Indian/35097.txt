The dim lighting, the extensive wine lists, the glass-enclosed front kitchen, and the dark furniture and accents would be perfect for the suits-and-blazers crowd.  Surprisingly,  it's actually spot on Highway 7 just past Leslie.  

I recommend that you check out Google Maps before trying to get here though: while you can physically see the restaurant right on Highway 7, you can't actually reach the place without turning into a side street. 

Now, the important stuff: the food.  So good.  One of the standouts for me was the lamb biryani (dum-biryani).  A clay bowl contains bites of lamb mixed in rice with chopped mint, covered with a sheet of dough on top, then baked in an oven.  Yogurt (raita) is served on the side as an accompaniment to the lamb.  It's not overly "lamby" or gamey, and even my mom (who hates lamb) found it edible. 

Vegetables in the paneer and the okra with onions were fresh.  Beyond the plain naan, there are also options of naan layered (kulchas) with fillings (like cheese or onions) or folded (pranthas) in between (like meats). 

Super friendly service, very comfortable and ample seating (ask for the enclave or separated booth/room for a bit of extra privacy and quieter chats).  The prices are a bit higher than most Indian food restaurants by roughly $3 per dish, but I think it's worth the extra dollars for the quality and care put into the food and the surroundings. 

I look forward to coming back again soon!
