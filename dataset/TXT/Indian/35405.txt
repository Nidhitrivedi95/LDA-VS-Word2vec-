muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw The favors were absolutely outstanding! We had a curry as well as eggplant dish and both were just what we were looking for. My boyfriend and I agreed that the eggplant was the best prepared eggplant dish that either of us had ever had. The service was very friendly and prompt. We'll be back!
