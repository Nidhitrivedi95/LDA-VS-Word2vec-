FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw My fiance and I always drove by this place and always said we wanted to try it but we are both not familiar with Indian cuisine so i think we were worried we may not like it.  WOW were we wrong!  It's delicious.   Great food, great service.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming but just ask one of the servers and they are happy to recommend anything based on things you like.  They ask the right questions!  We have been twice for dinner and keep telling ourselves we need to go back for their lunch buffet.  We were walking by the lunch buffet set up last time we were there and one of the staff came over and asked us if we had ever been to the lunch.  He then proceeded to tell us what all they serve and what's in it and that on the weekends they offer a lot more choices.  So helpful! We can't wait to go back for the lunch buffet!
