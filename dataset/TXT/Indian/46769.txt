t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg If you love Indian Food you will love this place.  Its a brand new restaurant that everyone should try.  Its in a beautiful building with an amazing menu.

I had the Tandoor Chicken Wings, Reshmi Kabob, and some cheese naan.  It was all amazing.  It was spicy but not over powering.  It was like my taste buds went to disneyland and didnt want to come back

My friend from india was also with me and she was glad to finally find an authentic Indian food restaurant in the north west part of town.

So if you want to take you taste buds to disneyland too give Saffron a try
