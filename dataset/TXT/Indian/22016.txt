GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I decided to take my family to this location after 2 misses at the scottsdale location. Hoping for better food and service we went early hoping for a clean environment, fresh food, and good service. We were disappointed on all fronts. The staff was incompetent and a glass of water was simply to 'hard'. The floor was sticky, tables and chairs were dirty. The food was old and stale despite ordering al a carte. They even changed their naan bread so now it tastes like a pizza crust. Yuck. Im done with this restaurant and their incompetence. Please shut down and let someone take your location.
