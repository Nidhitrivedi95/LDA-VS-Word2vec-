Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q A very gorgeous restaurant located in the Gainey Ranch neighborhood. The owner, chef, and staff were super courteous and friendly. I highly recommend the Kofta wontons with minced chicken, marsala spice, topped with mango salsa. The combination of savory from the chicken and the sour sweet taste from the mango salsa were a perfect marriage for a starter dish. The presentation is too beautiful to eat. For the main dish, I LOVED the Blackened Indian seasoning shrimps over grits, I'm not sure if this is the exact name on the menu, but this is what I'm calling it. The shrimps were seasoned with combination spices from India, and the grits, ahhhh, the oh so wonderful grits. It tasted like heaven in my mouth. So creamy and rich with India spices. The deserts were delicious, but they were more traditional American then India inspired. Both the brownie topped with ice cream, and the deconstructed strawberry shortcake were amazingly delicious, I would like to have tried something that were more, how should I say it, Inde Fusion (pun intended). Overall, I give this place a 4.5 stars They will get the last 0.5 from me when I see more out of my comfort zone desserts. Keep it up guys. You are definitely on the right track. Thank you for the fantastic dinner.
