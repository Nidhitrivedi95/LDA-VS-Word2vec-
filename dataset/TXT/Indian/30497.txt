KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ Have eaten here 4-5 times, both buffet and from the menu.  Food and service have been outstanding.  I like my food spicy, my wife prefers mild -- no problem with that here.  And the portions are sufficient that i'll have 1 or 2 lunches from leftovers.  Compared to many other Indian restaurants that we've visited, prices are about average.  And they now have additional space, for overflow or large parties.   Will definitely be recommending this place to anyone interested in good food.
