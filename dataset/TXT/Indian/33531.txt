LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw This is our new take-out Indian food place.  The dine-in facilities are lacking in atmosphere, but the food was tasty and packaged well.  Price was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food.  I can place an order from home, hop in the car and it's ready shortly after I arrive.  PERFECT!    EDIT:  I've been back for takeout 4-5 times and they continue to impress.  Consistent, high-quality food.
