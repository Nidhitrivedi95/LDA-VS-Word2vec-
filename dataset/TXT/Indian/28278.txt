J5go9hqKOmPy3Y14LizGYQ Very clean restaurant with friendly service. Love the chicken biriyani and the beef shami dinner. My only complaint is the front door full of hand and finger print smudges.
The food here is made when ordered so expect to wait a little, its definitely worth the wait.
The beef samosas are also very filling and tasty. 
Service is always friendly.
