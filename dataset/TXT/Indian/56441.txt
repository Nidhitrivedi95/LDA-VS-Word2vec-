XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I am visiting Toronto from NYC and my first stop was Tibet Kitchen. Heard that it is one of the most famous Tibetan Restaurant in the town. I had the Gyuma which was really good. The chicken pakora was even better. Momo's was delicious. As heard the food was really good. 
The owner was the one serving food and he was very good. My experience in Tibet Kitchen was really good.
