kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w Heard from a source I trusted that this was the best Indian food in Charlotte so we checked it out. I'd still recommend Woodlands as my top choice. I went with the standard chana masala with medium spice. Sadly, it didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. I know it's a pretty simple order, but it tasted really plain. The wife ordered the vegetable jalfrezi and it was a better choice, plus it had veggies whereas the chana masala is just chickpeas. The carnivores seemed to enjoy their meals, so all in all it was a good meal. Just not my favorite.

Fun little game....I challenge you to try to get your water glass more than half empty before they refill it. It's not going to happen.
