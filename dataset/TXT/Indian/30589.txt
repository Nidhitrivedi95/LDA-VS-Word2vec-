kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I like this place and have been a handful of times.  The curry is ok, which is what you need to know.  It is a quick, over the counter joint and the curry is ok.  Not showing off and not falling behind....the meaty part of the curve if you will.  

Parking can be a bit of an issue.  They share a lot with Starbucks and it looks like there is a crowd chilling in SB while I am looking for a space in the lot to pick up my curry!  Not good.  

Finally I like the diversity of the menu.  You can venture through Asia and India on their menu pretty quickly.  Sometimes I smile looking at my plate in the diversity.  Go, it isn't gourmet but for a late night dinner, I'm there.
