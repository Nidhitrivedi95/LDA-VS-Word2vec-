hMh9XOwNQcu31NAOCqhAEw Ordered off of grub hub and was on the phone with both the restaurant and grub to confirm they did not have the desert we ordered, which was fine, they did offer an alternative. When 40 minutes past our estimated delivery time had past, we called the restaurant. They seemed to have no idea why our food was not there and said they would check into it.  10 minutes later with no response, I called back, there was no answer the next three times. I was on the phone with grub hub, now an hour past delivery time , when the delivery showed up. I was informed they were confused because they've never delivered here before. We paid and collected our food. The food arrived luke warm and mediocre. I specified in the instructions that we would like the dishes extra spicy. They were actually really bland which is disappointing considering how much my husband and I love Indian food. The portions were small and the rice that I paid extra for was almost non existent and flavorless. First time I've ever received disappointing  white rice. I'm extremely upset , and considering the cost, which is expected when ordering Indian cuisine, not worth it. Will never order again.
