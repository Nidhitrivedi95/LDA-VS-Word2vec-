9N7VAcNFqjHptX3vRWqgnw Amazing Indian food north York.  We order often and get the palak paneer , dal makhani, and chicken tikka masala.  My husband is from the South Africa and love every inch of this food. I'm Canadian born and adore all of the food.  Meets comfort food needs for the two of us. Will not go anywhere else for Indian in Toronto.oh and the Goan fish curry is amazing!!!!
