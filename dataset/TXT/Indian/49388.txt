tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Living in the West Valley, I've been missing my Indian Food fix.  Finally moving to Gilbert, I now am near a few good Indian restaurants with buffets.  Of those I've tried, Indian Oven is one that I really like the most.  I have only gone to the lunch buffet.  The price is great for all you can eat of this delicious food.  I like the unlimited Mango Lassi and the hot garlicky Naan brought around as much as you like.  

There is a good selection of the vegetarian and non-veg dishes.  I find the veg ones most tasty and interesting. One I really liked for texture and taste is Kadhi Pakora, which are fried veg pakoras (kinda crunchy) in a yellow curry.  Yummm!  They also have different saag dishes, chopped spicy salad.  The condiments taste homemade, unlike some other places.  They have fresh fried potato slices covered in a batter...very flavorful.  That apparently was popular because it wasn't there the whole time.

Also a nice choice of 4 different types of warm and cold desserts.  

The staff is very pleasant and took my plates and refilled my water as needed.  

I found everything quite flavorful....one reviewer complained it was not spicy, but I like Indian food for the flavors, not needing hot spice.  

Only one issue for me...the lunch buffet is only open till about 2, which isn't always convenient for me.  Some other places are open later.

There are a couple of TVs, but they were on mute while I was there so didn't bother me, and also weren't in my line of vision.

Great place to eat, I'll be back again!
