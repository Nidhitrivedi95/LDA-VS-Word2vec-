GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA We went with the family ordered their mix grill sizzler, this is the 3rd time disappointment  that it was just a chicken tikka and one kabab. There wasn't any other stuff such as behari boti or seekh boti. So better just order a chicken tikka rather their sizzler its waste of money.
