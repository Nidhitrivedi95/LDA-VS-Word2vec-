OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Michael, Norm and I came here to try out this new Indian restaurant to see if its as good or better than other Indian joints in town (i.e. Mint, Saffron, Mt. Everest, etc.). Las Vegas restaurant scene is very competitive, particularly when you are located next to many good choices.

I am sad to say that Urban Turban didn't live up to my expectations. It's a really good concept to do a pseudo Indian fusion, but on many of the items we tried, it frankly falls flat on some of the dishes. Here are some of the things that we tried.

Appetizers

- Dry Fruit Bread - Hardly any raisins, but i'm not sure if sweet naan works with curries. 
-  Samosa Chaat - Big Samosas, they're flakey, but the filling was ok, it needs more spices.
- Lamb Bhaji Pav - Its minced lamb meat with peas and other species, probably the best appetizer I've had here.
- Paneer Tikka - I'm not the paneer fan, but the tandoori sauce really brought out the flavors in the paneer pieces. Another must try if you like Paneer.
- Bhaji Pav - Needs a lot of work. It was tasted like something that Gerber scientists cooked up. Plain, no flavor and overpriced.

Main Entree

- Butter Chicken - The sauce was little too sweet, but it was packed with flavors. The biggest issue here was that there were hardly any meat in the curry. 
- Bombay masala lamb - curry lacked flavor, spice, and meat. 
- Five Herb noodles - my dinner partners loved it but I really wasn't a fan. It was hard to get the herb flavor and it just doesn't go well with Indian curries (Noodles are not Indian, Indo-Asian Fusion may be). 
- Butter Naan - same as any place
- Basmati Rice - Fragrant and delicious, but nothing new (its hard to mess up rice, unless if I'm cooking). 

Dessert

- Paan Shot - Must try dessert, cheap and full of flavor. 
- Chocolate Samosas - It's unique, but nothing new. It's also very messy item to eat if you are sharing with others. 

Service
- It was good, the servers were very attentive, but they did mess up our naan and  other condiment orders. I think having some Indian servers can help the business since they can explain the variety of indian food they offer here. 

Parking
- Lot is was pretty empty, I think since Firefly (AKA - LV Salmonella Factory) got closed. If you have a car that's been lowered be careful and drive slow there is a steep gradient where you can do serious damage if you are driving too fast (Look for the sudden dip sign). 

Overall, its an interesting place, but the food quality needs to improve to even consider this place with good Indian restaurant. 

Also, I read through lot of the reviews for this location, but I find the review by John L. to be very suspicious. He opened his Yelp account in December 2014, wrote the first review on 12/30/2014 and gave it 5/5. Also, the review looks like a PR(or a manager) guy wrote it from a customer perspective.

Overall 2/5.
