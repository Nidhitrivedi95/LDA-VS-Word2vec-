cu1CvIzOyf-R91pT92NShw Anjappar is a gem of a joint that's much underrated much like Chettinad cuisine itself. It's a relatively moderate sized space and has an endearing,  polite and attentive staff. Most of the staff itself is from South India and that adds to the ambience and authenticity of the restaurant.  

Anjappar, hands down, serves the best non-vegetarian south Indian Cuisine. Period! Even their vegetarian cuisine is a thing of art,  and make sure you try their Tomato soup. It's creamy, it's thick and it's a perfect blend of tang and sweetness.

I also love their garlic Naan which goes well with the 'Chettinad chicken' or 'Sukka Mutton' (Dry goat curry). If wheat isn't your thing then go for a Podi Dosa as your carb option to eat the meat dishes with.

Their Biryanis aren't all that great, personally, but they're decent nuff.  

Also they serve a pretty decadent falooda which is an ice cream float essentially with rose water milk, the semolina balls you find in bubble tea and vermicelli and other goodies. It is an opulent way to end a meal.

All in all its one of my fav places to eat and the dishes pack a punch because of their pepper-y roots. Go try it out!
