rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg Went back and ordered a bunch of different things for take out. Everything was very good, but even though I asked for the dishes to be not spicy, they were extremely spicy; too spicy in fact. If you don't like even a little spice in your food, I'd say you may not want to risk it.
