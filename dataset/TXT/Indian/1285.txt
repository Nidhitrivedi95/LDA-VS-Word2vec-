The thalis, however, leave something to desire for -- not a fan of the lazy daals, adding red beans does not make for a variation on lentils, especially when there are so many different types of lentils to choose from in the Indian culinary repertoire! My grandmother and mother (tough critics of Subcontinent cuisine, to be sure) thought the various curries were "meh," the rice too was bland ("could have used some ghee," said my grandmother) but we loved the fresh dosas and the huge puris!
