kkNWzhSpAjxm0zIxol3IzQ Stopped in one Sunday evening and the place was pretty busy, they even had several people come in for to-go orders too. Staff seemed a little frazzled but still friendly. 

*Chicken Tikka Masala $10.99 - Standard amount of tastiness. I enjoyed this dish, but I thought there was too much rice so I only used half of it. 
*Garlic Naan $2.49 - Pretty good, and excellent for scooping up your masala with.
*Chicken Puff $2.99 - Terrible. Super dry with no flavor. I threw it away. 
*Gobi 65 $7.99 - I think this was good, all I can remember is that my mouth was on fire and they did not include any sort of cool yogurt dipping sauce to balance out the heat. 
*Samosa $3.49 - Standard taste, but smaller than I am used to seeing. 
*Rasmalai $3.49 - Unique spongy milky slightly sweet dessert. Not bad, but one experience was good enough for me. 

All in all I would say this place was A-Okay. No major complaints, but I do think I've had better at Namaste and India Garden in Lakewood. If Lakewood is too far for you then I think Biryani Hut is perfectly okay to dine at. I would rate them 3.5 stars and I will probably give them another try.

Side note: They accidentally charged me tax on my to-go order so just double check before you pay.
