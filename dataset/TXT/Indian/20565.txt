My husband and I came here for their lunch buffet, which they offer daily for $9.99. Their buffet doesn't have a huge selection, but it was enough for us. We wanted to get a taste of varying dishes since we're not entirely too familiar with Indian cuisine. The selections had chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani, tandoori chicken, fish curry, mixed vegetables, of course naan and rice, and possibly a few other dishes I might be missing. I was very pleased with the taste of all the dishes. The chicken and fish dishes were not at all dry like we expected of buffet food. They were perfectly moist and the spice was mild. With an affordable price tag and good quality buffet food, we will definitely be back for our next Indian fix!
