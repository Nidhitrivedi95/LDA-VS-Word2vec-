Coupled with the fact that this is a tremendous community venture providing a focal point for some excellent endeavours, I can't recommend it highly enough.

Overall, we said: "Open from Wednesday to Saturday, the Punjabi Women's Kitchen is understated, bright, full of welcoming aromas. It's one of those places you want to make sure everyone knows about, yet still retains its winning charm, and always has a free table with your name on it."
