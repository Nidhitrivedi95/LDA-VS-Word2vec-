eF0AwlWlTp16XneCF50QRA Stay away!! We were so excited about new Indian place nearby, but it was a full disappointment.
Fake reviews written by family & friends here & also on Google. Very unorganized, salty food. Only few items on the menu were available. In non-veg only chicken tikka & butter chicken. 
We were sitting forever for food, then they brought curries...shahi paneer had no paneer inside just gravy... when asked they said the paneer was crushed.... chicken tikka was way too salty...oh yes...nan showed up 15mins after curries. When we were done halfway through the food... they brought in rice.
They were only open for a week and look at the reviews on google all of them written before.
