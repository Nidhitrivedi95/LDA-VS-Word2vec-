ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ The dosas here are fine but the Mississauga Indian joints are much better on average. The filing is not as savoury and the edges of the dosa crumble apart a bit too easily. Ambience is also a bit drab. I guess if you live in Toronto, you don't have too many good choices hence the 3 stars. If this place was located in Mississauga, it wouldn't survive the competition.
