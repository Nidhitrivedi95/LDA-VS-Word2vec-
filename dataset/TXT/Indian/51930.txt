UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA My husband and I wanted some good Indian food, and found this place on Yelp. Such a good find!! We were between this place and another highly rated one on Yelp, but ultimately decided to eat here because of the modern decor and fun atmosphere. We decided to get the Meal for Two that included the Tikka Masala and vegetable curry. The Tikka masala was to die for and some of the best we ever had. The meal for two was perfect! It came with two apps, and assortment of entrees and dessert. We will definitely eat here again!!! It didn't disappoint. You know you've found a great one when you are surrounded by locals.
