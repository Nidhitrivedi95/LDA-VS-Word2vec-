YJ8Ehqq4Jr2_xmtRe5aXLQ On our way from Iowa to Indianapolis, we decided to stop and have lunch. Much to my dismay, the restaurant has a sign that says they aren't serving food despite their website not reflecting that. So I proceeded to go into the store to tell them that they should update the website but the store is closed too, albeit a half hour after the posted opening time! Poor business!
