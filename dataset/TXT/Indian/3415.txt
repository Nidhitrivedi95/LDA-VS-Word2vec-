0nJgoF9hAi6f2K7XInr1hQ Prepaid everything with my creditcard and included a tip for delivery. When i got my food and reciept someone had circled the 3 dollar service fee for using justeat.com and wrote in blue pen that the fee goes to the restaurant and then also circled my amount that i left for tip indicating that portion goes to driver. I felt super insulted like they were basically saying my tip wasn't good enough and next time they wanted more money. The restaurant isn't that far from my house either! I could've easily went and picked up the food and avoided the service fee and the delivery tip but i didn't.  I'm just really upset that someone had the nerve to do that to my family- i just had a baby and I'm on maternity leave so i don't have a surplus of extra tip money laying around but atleast i made an effort. Where's my thank you for buisness? Unreal!
