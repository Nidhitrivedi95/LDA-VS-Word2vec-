yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug What a great find in Vegas! Discovered this place through restaurant.com.

Good food, clean and spacious facility, reasonably priced, very short ride from the strip, pleasing decor. I enjoyed my meal thoroughly.

I live in in LA and visit Vegas at least 3-4 times a year. I am glad I found a good India restaurant there. Don't hesitate to try!
