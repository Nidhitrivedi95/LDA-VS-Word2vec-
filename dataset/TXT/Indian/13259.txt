baRd6otoSKiLKexfoyKWbg The young fella with turban gave me a puzzled look thinking I went into the wrong place when I stepped inside Manpasand. 

I was drawn in when I saw the signs on the windows saying Espresso Indian style and Marsala Tea. I am not BRAVE enough to try their Indian version Espresso but Marsala tea ($1.50) does sounded good! 

Manpasand is a takeout, dine in and buffet restaurant. The smell here is so rich with spice and meat.... staying here a couple of minute waiting for my drink made me smell like Indian food! :) 

My chai was prepared freshly to order... sweet, milky, rich and with a hint of cardamom and cinnamon. 

There are also tons of Indian sweets displaying in the glass cabinets...it was not easy to resist them while I waiting for my tea to be ready! 

BTW, no sighting of Roma either!
