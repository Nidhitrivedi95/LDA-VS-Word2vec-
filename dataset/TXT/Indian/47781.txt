TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Great food and service. Nothing disappointed. Chicken soup came with the Mixed Curry Dinner. Meh, I thought. It was a surprise, being in a masala curry base. I ate the whole bowl it was so good. I would go for that alone. I ordered Ghoa Fish Curry which the waiter tried to steer me from to the house's most popular fish dish, being a first time customer. I really wanted Ghoa though and was a little worried, but it was excellent. I will definitely be returning.
