UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w I sort of wandered in the other night.  Wife was out of town and I felt too lazy to cook.  I talked with the a fore-mentioned "Grumpy Guy" and explained that I knew nothing about Indian food.  Although he appeared grumpy at first, I sensed a glimmer in his eye as he directed me through the menu making suggestions.  By the time I left we made a connection.  He's not a handsome 25 year old millennial waiting for his next 'Bollywood" role, but I got a kick out of him.  The ladies in the kitchen were all very polite, and I really enjoyed the food.  I much prefer a small, family-run operation such as this and will go back again.
