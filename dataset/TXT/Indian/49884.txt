U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg After two weeks of staring at mouthwatering pictures of butter chicken roti, me and my friend decided to visit. We wanted to go to mother india, but this location was closer and we discovered that they were the same owners. It's not the fanciest place ever, so if you're expecting a nice fancy date, nah b. It is however very comfy with an at-home feel for me. We ordered two mango lassis and one butter chicken roti (mild). There were two other customers who came after us and they got their orders first, which left me sort of sad. The mango lassis were sour, because of the yogurt, but I gulped mine down and my friend didn't like it. The roti however, me oh my, it was wonderful in my mouth. It was literally heaven, I'm telling you. We both shared halves and were completely full after it. We went to a concert afterwards and it kept us going all night long. Being Indian, and not being able to take spice sucks, but the mild was very mild for me. I will consider getting a medium next time. The servers were kind of creepy, but other than that I really enjoyed my visit. My friend even talked about movies with the servers, which gave me another outlook on them, so I have to say they were very kind. In conclusion, I will be back for more heaven in my mouth.
