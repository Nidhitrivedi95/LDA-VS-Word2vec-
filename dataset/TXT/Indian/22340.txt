gNarmA5DHMPmlXI5xKNpkA Wow! My boyfriend was working in the neighbourhood and brought us a delicious meal from Curry + Roti. We'd been meaning to try their food since seeing them on TV -the family seemed so nice, decent and hardworking that we wanted to support them, and I am glad we did!! I wasn't there in person, but was told that the service was kind and genuine when he ordered.

I had the chicken curry over rice. Even in a Styrofoam clamshell, there was clear effort put into  plating: fresh herbs sprinkled over the curry and a small salad of raw veg in the corner. The sauce was heady with decent heat, but well balanced. The meat was so tender and juicy: It fell apart in my mouth! Coupled with the sweet scorch of the scotch bonnet sauce that came with it, it was definitely a home run.

My partner's goat roti fared less well. He said the goat was a little dry, which was disappointing. I think he's jealous cos my chicken was a lot nicer. Despite that, we'll be going back next time we're in the area and try some other dishes.
