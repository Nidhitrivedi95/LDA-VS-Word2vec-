XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I went here with a group having never been before to this restaurant nor have tried Tibetan food.

It's a small restaurant with a good size patio out back (some portions are covered).

The owner is a delight!  Super friendly and makes jokes with his customers:)  Too bad more people don't have his disposition- truly a gem in the service industry.

We got a mixed order of the momos (similar to dumplings or pierogis is the best way to describe them  ) that were both boiled and fried 

I ordered the chili chicken and it was spicy and good (I've had better but it was still good) it's one of their more popular dishes.  Side of rice comes with it.  

Honestly the hospitality here is amazing- if I lived closer I'd definitely try a few other menu items like their thalis (only available at lunch time unfortunately)
