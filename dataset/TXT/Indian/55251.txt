WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA Prices a tad high, however customer service and quality of food quite excellent.

Been going to this venue for many years now, and it's the kind of place I go every once in a while due to the price.

The quality of the roti served at this location is quite excellent however, which keeps me coming back for me.

One of the last times I went to this venue, I realized that they were closing earlier than I anticipated, and there wasn't much time left until they closed. I called them to see if they'd be able to take my order, and they told me that as long as I were to arrive before closing, they'd be able to serve me. I hurried along and drove there (was initially going to walk, but wouldn't be able to make it in time), and I made it a few minutes before they closed. I was served with a smile, and nothing be good gestures.

All-in-all, I'm quite happy with Bacchus, and would definitely return there again.
