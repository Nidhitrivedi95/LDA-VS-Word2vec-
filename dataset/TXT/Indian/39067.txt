oRRcTN6bgID4Z0UMeGXN0Q We went here on Christmas Eve and we were grateful to be seated for an early (4:30 pm) dinner despite the restaurant not being open yet for dinner hours. Restaurant was warm and tastefully decorated. They have a large Indian centered menu in French and English. We ordered the tandoori chicken, beef, chicken, and eggplant curries, and a few orders of naan. Tandoori chicken was tasty and The garlic naan was particularly delicious. The curries did not have too much flavor. One other suggestion would be to have some Indian style music playing softly in the background to reduce kitchen noice and moments of silence (although this may have been due to us being seated early)
