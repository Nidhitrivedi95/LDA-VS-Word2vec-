After 2 visits--once for their lunch buffet and once for dinner, I feel like I can finally review this location adequately.

The dining area is far more spacious and the lunch buffet here seems to have a much more extensive selection than the one on the east side. However, the service during their lunch buffet is not as efficient. We finished 2 plates of food and our naan still hadn't come vs. the east side location where they typically bring the naan to your table before you sit down with your first plate of food.

For dinner, I tried to pick things not typically available for the buffet:
1) Inferno naan ($5.99) to see what the hype was about and while it wasn't so bad going in I can't say the same about the aftermath. Glad I tried it but probably would not try it again. 4/5 flavor but 0/5 aftermath

2) Mysore Dosa stuffed with spiced potato ($11.99) - generous portion and flavorful! Came with the usual sambar and chutney as well as 2 other sauces. Would definitely get this again! 5/5

3) Khadai with paneer ($13.99) - good but not particularly flavorful or memorable. Probably should have tried the vindaloo which was my other choice 3/5 

4) Also tried the chili garlic hakka noodle ($10.99) that was on the standing menu on their table. Small portion, not particularly flavorful, super oily, and not spicy like it should have been 1/5 one of those things that just seems like a waste of calories and tummy space!

Also got a side of Raita ($2.49) for the inferno naan and a mango lassi ($4)

$53.53 after tax, before tip. $62 after tip. Bit pricey for dinner so probably wouldn't go back for that but their lunch buffet is definitely worth checking out!
