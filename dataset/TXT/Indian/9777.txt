9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw I finally decided to try this place right down the street from me...so glad I did.  The staff was helpful in helping this newbie to the cuisine order some great items.  My favorite was the chicken tikka masala...OMG...the rich and creamy sauce was heaven! I am definitely going to have to try some more items.  Beautiful interior and friendly staff.  AAA+++
