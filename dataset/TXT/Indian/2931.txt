Nice restaurant option next to Sprouts in Avondale.  Place is clean, food is good, and you can wrap up a lunch in less than an hour.  I'm a fan of naan, and theirs is straightforward tasty.

Service staff are par for the course-- good at getting you started, so-so on keeping drinks filled, and take care of the check quickly.  Minimal personal interaction, but that's cool if you're looking to enjoy the company of your companions.  The little TV was something of a distraction.

Would rank it a star up if they had more meat options in the buffet.  Most of it is vegetable oriented.  Nominal dessert options, as well.
