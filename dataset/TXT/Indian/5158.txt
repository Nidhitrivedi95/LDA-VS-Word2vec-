2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Best Indian food in downtown. Spoke with the chef. Vegetarian food cooked separately from meat. Separate pans, ladles and oil for vegetarian items. So my dear vegetarian friends, you can eat here without guilt. Tasty food, new concept of gravies and curries inside a roti to eat just like burritos. May be called as indianized burrito rotis. Spice level can be adjusted according to your preference.
