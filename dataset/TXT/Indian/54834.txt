WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA The current rating says it all. I've always maintained that Indian fine dining doesn't mean insipid food. Still, 3 stars for service and ambiance.

While their vegetarian food tastes quite fine, the chicken & lamb dishes leave a lot to be desired.

We particularly enjoy their creamy veg Kofta Dilbahar and veg platter. The non veg platter is pretty forgettable. Fish fry is a better option for appetizers.

Mostly I end up here when everywhere else is shut down or going to. The ambiance is spot on and drinks are made to perfection. And they are very accommodating. Guess you got the idea!
