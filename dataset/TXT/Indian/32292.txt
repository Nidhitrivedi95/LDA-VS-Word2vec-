LgqGDQsUurUh6qUocPeSsQ Some people said the staff weren't friendly. I found them very nice and fast. All appetizers were very good. The goat curry is a must! I love butter chicken but this one was just ok. Many reviews mention that the chicken is dry and it's very true. They need to switch from breast to dark meat. 
Basmati rice & nan bread were excellent. While eating cuisine, try the Indian beer it's quite good. I will return but skip the butter chicken. As for my favorite Indian restaurant, I'm still searching...
