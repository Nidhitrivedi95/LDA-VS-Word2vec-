Ok, fine, maybe one shouldn`t expect much from a $4 breakfast special.  It`s certainly cheap, but I did think that the ham I`d ordered with my over-medium eggs might be something other than a few warmed slices of ham coldcut meat.  Call me crazy.

On weekdays, Tom`s menu offers at least five different lunch specials per day, including tasty-sounding meals like variations on the meat-and-curry theme or something pan-Asian, pseudo-Jamaican, quasi-Greek, or semi-Italian.  On the paper, the variety looks good, but after my dirtcheep-but-blah breakfast, Tuesday`s pineapple chicken with shortgrain rice just added to the shoulder-shrugging whatevers.  Large chunks of sweet pepper, sure, but greasy and the chicken had enough textural semblance to liver that I actually wondered if it really was chicken at all.  Not a good thing.  

But it`s in the middle of just-north-of-Toronto-amid-industrial-plaza nowhere, so if you`re willing to not expect much, Tom`s can be ok.  You know:  edible.  The sort of place where you really want something fast while you stare at CP24 for the few moments you have there, and just before you do whatever the hell you`re in this area for in the first place. Beyond that, you may as well drive on.
