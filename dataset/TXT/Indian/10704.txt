A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA I have been going to Udupi for over 15 years. Its by far the best Dosa I have found in Toronto. 

I tend to generally get the same things when I go; The masala dosa and the veggie thali. If there are more than two of us i'll add in a second dosa and the mixed appetizers or even an extra main veg dish. The thali varies depending on the day and you can ask what is in it that day in case there are things you don't like you may be able to swap it out. the soup that comes is amazing always. The spice level varies depending on who is the main cook. Sometimes its very hot but generally its spicy but not super hot.

I have gone with someone gluten free and the dosa was certainly not as good. but gluten free is specific and when the main part of something is the dosa best to try some other options as well.

They have some special stuff for kids and are vegan friendly. I would highly recommend the food here.

The decor is a bit unusual. Its a kind of cafeteria style dining experience in that its one big sparsely decorated mostly white room with tile floors and an abundance of tables and chairs. They do serve you though so not cafeteria in that way. They have many wall murals that are interesting to say the least. The noise level can get intense when its full as the sound echo's and reverberates. and often there are kids running around.

the staff is generally quite friendly and when you ask questions they are always ready to help. You could have a very big group here as well as they will put a bunch of tables together for you.

I have once gone on Christmas day and had a wonderful experience. They even have a Christmas Dosa done up like a decorated tree in a case. what more can I say??? this place is really a very special vegetarian landmark.
