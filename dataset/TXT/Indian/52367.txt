uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA We went to Babu and there was a huge line up. When our turn came the server was very helpful and explained all the dishes patiently and also suggested combinations to save $$$. He in fact sugested the we do not take the Pakistani Biryani as it was not as fresh as the other Biryani rice!!WE got a feast for 3 people and paid only $27!Food was all right not so much flavour more spice. Will I go again? Maybe to get a great deal!!
