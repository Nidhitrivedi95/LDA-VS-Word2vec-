The employers are nice, and they let you pay at the counter and bring the food to your table when it's ready so you don't have to hover around the counter.

Nice spicy Indian food in wraps made of bread similar to naan bread, but thinner,
You can get lunch for $8 and not be hungry after.

The place has seats for probably 30 people, but the gem is going to be the patio. It may be a long wait, though, as currently there is no side wall until the adjacent lot becomes a building. Not so fun to sit out there with the construction workers and debris. Maybe next summer!
