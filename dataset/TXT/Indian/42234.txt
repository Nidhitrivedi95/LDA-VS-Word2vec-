QL7FeE8Izak6xi0GG-SnJg The place has got a dark dungeon like facelift recently compared to the spacious welcoming atmosphere it had before. The effort to make it a dim-lighted fine dining atmosphere had horribly gone wrong. Today (Sep 2, 2017), my wife and I had the most 'rudest owner of a restaurant' experience. I cancelled the order and just walked out. Yep, never going here again and "Taza Taste" down Hunontario (Hunontario/Dundas) is better in customer care, great tasting food and cheaper.

When we walked in to BG, there was no one to greet. Had to wait a couple of minutes until someone noticed and came out. The person who was clearly not the host, took our take out order and dashed back in. Not knowing where to wait, we sat at a table waiting for our order. A few minutes later, a man comes from out side (pretty much acted as the owner) and asked us whether we were taking a table for two. When we said we ordered take out, in a very rude tone said "then go sit there" and pointed to a table at a corner. Next, he proceeded to meddle with his phone. My wife felt embarrassed and looked at me with such great discomfort to be there. We simply canceled the order and walked out.

Once upon a time, this restaurant did serve great food and the hostess named Jessie was consistently exemplary with her care for guests.

This message is to the owner of the restaurant: Service Excellence is not only about the service you are selling. It is also about the care you extend. You can mess up an order and that can be corrected but, hurt your patrons feelings and you can be rest assured that it is going to hurt your business. See, service is about the emotional connection you make with your customers, guests, passengers, or clients, however you may categorize them.
