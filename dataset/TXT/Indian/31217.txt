kPjXA9lm7nQrn6UuPb5L-Q We opted for takeout, as it was really busy. We ordered samosas, naan and mixed vegetables. Was a bit confusing about where to order, but there's ample friendly staff to help. We didn't wait longer than 10 min. for our food. Was delicious! Samosas were not too spicy, naans were soft and mix vegetables were excellent:) want to try their chaat station next time!
