cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w Very disappointed especially after reading all the reviews on this page and on their facebook page.  It is very obvious that the reviewers are not familiar with good Indian food.  Yes, the ambiance is very good.  But the food was not at all what I expected it to be.  The fried eggplant was very delicious because it was freshly made.  The rest of our meal was not so.  It was obviously reheated (possibly taken out of the freezer, heated and served).  The portions were very small compared to the pricing.  Ridicules prices which, I wish was available on their website.  I would have not taken my family there.  They say no tipping is allowed but conveniently add it to your bill under Admin Fee!!!!  What is ADMIN FEE????  I will NOT be recommending this place nor will I be returning at any time.
