hq10TdILrwtTcAESKY251Q I was in Nirvana. . . 

. . . while eating at Nirvana. 

This place was great. It makes a really good impression as soon as you walk in, the inside décor is amazing. You feel like you are eating at an Indian palace or something.  And as a bonus the seats are well cushioned. I came here for lunch with a few of my co-workers and we ordered the executive lunch "buffet". It's sort of a different style buffet where they bring the food to you, and if you want more of anything, they bring more afterwards. It's actually a very smart strategy because it helps prevent a lot of waste, and the food is always fresh when it comes to you. To be honest, I had no idea what we were eating but it was delicious (and I don't use that word lightly). The food was very flavourful! The chicken was well cooked and not too dry or chewy. 

My only complaint is that it was difficult to get the waiter's attention to refill our water glasses and for the bill afterwards but I didn't mind staying there a bit longer since I was so full afterwards. Oh, some of the food is spicy, so I guess watch out for those of you who can't handle the heat lol. They also offer vegetarian options. 

Overall great experience, I would definitely come back here again. 

Warning: the food will make you want to take a nap afterwards.
