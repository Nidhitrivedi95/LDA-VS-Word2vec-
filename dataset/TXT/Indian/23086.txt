gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My favorite Indian restaurant (Gaylord) is now out of business and other Indian restaurants I've been to have been mediocre which is why I'm so glad I gave Mount Everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy.  The quality of the food is comparable to Gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less.  The people that work here are very nice and friendly.  They have Bollywood videos on at all times.

They give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).

Mango Lasi:
Creamy mango shake. 5/5

Veggie Samosa:
You get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5

Aloo Tikki:
You get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5

Palak Paneer:
I was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5

Garlic Naan:
I love this stuff.  We had 2 orders. Hot, garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with. 5/5

Chicken Tikka Masala:
My favorite Indian dish.  We ordered mild but it was still quite spicy...but it burned so good. 5/5

Kulfi:
A mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits. 4/5

Gulab Jamun:
My favorite Indian dessert. They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5

I honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good.  This is my new favorite in Vegas!  They also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11.  I'd come back here for that!
