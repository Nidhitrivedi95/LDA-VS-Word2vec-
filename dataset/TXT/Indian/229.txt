-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Picked up an order to go.

Early evening, inside was very quiet and clean. The aroma of wonderful Indian food filled the air as I walked in and instantly greeted. Went to the bar to pay, also immediately greeted and the gentleman who helped me was very nice. After paying, the food was promptly brought out to me from the kitchen.

Portions were appropriate and the food was excellent. Food was nicely packed and still very hot after the 10 minute drive home. We ordered the chicken masala, vindaloo and naan. Both entrees were some of the best we've had in the SE valley. Cannot wait to go back.
