RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This placed honestly USED to be amazing, hence my return last night.  I ordered chicken karahi, butter chicken and chicken kabobs.  

The CHICKEN karahi had LAMB pieces in it...must I say more? The butter chicken was sooooo watered down that there was no taste to it. 

This place has really gone downhill.
