LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Decent value and quick service. The selections were limited to chicken and vegetarian (no lamb or beef) but everything was flavorful. The naan was hot and served perfectly fried. The only complaints are the server pans don't keep the buffet items hot enough and the seating is getting pretty worn in many of the booths.  The dessert items didn't include some of the standards but I am not a dessert person after a filling buffet.
