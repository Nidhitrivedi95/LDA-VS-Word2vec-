gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA Very good Indian. Bad decor and service. Also should clean the place better. But probably the best south Indian in Cleveland area.  I would have given it a 5 start had the service been good at all.

However, if you want authentic south Indian food, this place will hit the spot.
