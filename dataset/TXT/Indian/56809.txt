xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Before we vacationed to the Phoenix area I did some research on where and what to eat. I was looking for good eats and hidden gems that locals love. And then.... I found FRY BREAD!!! Why are they not making this everywhere in the US. It's like an elephant ear as the bread used for a sandwich, with many option as stuffers for the insides. We ordered the beef and green taco, whoa are these things huge!! I was expecting the same as the Mexican restaurants that they have in Chicago where you order two or 3 small tacos. 

So be warned that 1 fry bread taco = 3 Chicago Mexican Joint tacos

Now that I'm back home, this food is probably the most thought of during my summer, every time I'm at a fair or carnival I'm wishing they had a Fry Bread cart.
