3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Came here recently for the lunch buffet. Had a nice experience. The food was pretty good and the selection was decent. Wish they had more ice creams rather than just vanilla. They should have chocolate and strawberry, they had space for them but none present. The service was excellent and atomsphere was very nice and cozy. Buffet is priced higher than others around the area at $14.50 vs. $12.99 at Dhaba and Aroma. Worth checking out if you are in the area.
