h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Had catering from here last week, and loved it! I've never been in person.  Indian food is always veg friendly, so I should really be eating more of it.

The items we had:

Matar Paneer: cheese cubes in an incredible tomato-cream sauce with grean peas. I'm not even a fan of peas and I loved this! It was just the right mix of spicy and rich.
Chana Masala: stewed chickpeas that were spicier than I was expecting, but also really good.
Palak Aloo: It's usually hit or miss with me with Indian spinach dishes - this was the weakest of the three, as it was the least flavorful.

The naan is the perfect level of chewiness, even after time in transit - that made me so happy! All in all very good, will probably hit up the buffet sometime in the near future.
