gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A By far some of the best customer service I have ever had. We got the mix grill plate and the chicken was a little on the spicy side for my son, so the owner brought him some Chicken Tika Masala just for him and it was a hit. My son usually hates anything with sauce, but this was a winner. Food was awesome.
