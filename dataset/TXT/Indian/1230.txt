-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Been coming here for years for quality South Indian food. The best dish in my opinion is the chana batura. It is a large batura that is crispy, warm, and bigger than your face with a side of chana. The chana is nothing too special, but the batura makes it worth it. It is something that I cannot recreate at home. If I don't get that, I will get a dosa. Their dosas are very fresh and long. My friends had gotten the thali and enjoyed the variety of it. Don't expect great service, but come for the food.
