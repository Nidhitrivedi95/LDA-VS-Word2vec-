7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg It's so great to see an Indian restaurant close to the downtown Cleveland area! The food here is phenomenal, and you can tell that they really take time to prepare the food, and don't load it up with cream like many other Indian restaurants I've been to. For the beer connoisseurs out there, their list is pretty amazing for an Indian restaurant. The local tavern-like atmosphere is pretty cool as well. The only complaint I would have is that sometimes service is a bit un-coordinated and tables are mixed up, however they get it right in the end and definitely make up for it if they do mess up.
