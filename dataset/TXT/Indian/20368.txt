FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA The problems with being a small town is that it doesn't really have a lot of competing indian food. And this is exactly what happened with Madras Cafe. Same is the case with Baton Rouge having only a couple of Indian restaurants. 

Their dosa - South Indian crepes - are okayish but they don't have that freshness which makes this one of the best anytime Meals. But you should still give this a try. It's better than their buffet. 

Their buffet doesn't have deserts and if you get a chance to have gulab jamuns (wiki this delicacy-- and get tempted) try that. 

They have a couple of rice options but the main lentil which makes a south Indian cuisine is the sambar. It's sautéed veggies cooked with lentil in tamarind sauce. That's not exactly a delight. 

They do have quite a good service though. They have a check in fresh juice - which has added sugars to make it not tangy. But if you like fresh, try asking them without sugar. 

The place is small, accommodates about 25. 

They are experimenting with their menu, so can just give them the benefit of the doubt and hence 3 starts.
