GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg Tried this place today for a late lunch. It wasn't very busy, so there was no wait and the food came out pretty quickly. It's a bit of a dive, which doesn't usually put me off, but the lack of A/C was a bit more problematic for me. I mean, it's Arizona. You need a decent A/C system. They do have a fan, which is okay, but I imagine in summer it would be torture. 

On to the food: I don't know if it's because it's more Pakistani than Indian food, but it just wasn't quite what I expected (in fairness to them, their menu does say it won't be like what you've experienced before). But that aside, the flavor should still be there, and it wasn't for me. The garlic naan didn't have any garlic flavor and wasn't the traditional naan I'm used to. For a flat bread, it was okay, just kind of bland. The rice, I will say, was very good. The chicken tandoori was also good, but the chicken tikka masala was only so-so. It just lacked flavor. 

It seems the restaurant recently changed ownership and they are apparently trying to drum up more business with customers who come in. And while they were very friendly and nice, and the service was good, I found the sales pitch a little long and intrusive. On the whole, it was an all right place, but not amazing enough to bring me back.
