zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw I absolutely love Kebab Mahal - the food is fantastic, it's cheap and the staff are friendly. I even enjoy the low key decor and diner style. It's a well known must-eat in Edinburgh for students, tourists and professionals alike. The only reason it misses out a star is because of the lack of seating and sometimes late service. However, it all adds to it's charm. Situated in Edinburgh's south side, on Nicholson square, well known for it's Desi and Middle Eastern food joints as well as the Mosque Kitchen, 'closed for prayer on Friday', Kebab Mahal is one of Edinburgh's best.
