CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Very tasty fresh authentic late pm dining experience overlooking King St TIFF action. We had all vegetarian options that were all delicious.  Dal, sag paneer, a few others.  I wasn't keen on Indian, but my visiting friend was, and I was soon happily converted.  Very affordable with lots to take home for the next day.  Very competent server.  Lovely location and white table cloth dining.  Highly recommended.
