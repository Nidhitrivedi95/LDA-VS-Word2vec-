I had the brunch here on a Saturday and wow, delicious. The Indian style eggs benedict amazing, the eggs with coconut curry sauce also amazing. The vegan ceaser and masala fries were also a hit.  The service is great and staff are very friendly and attentive.
I'm sure dinner here would be just as good. Will definitely be back.
