tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I come here for the buffet and it is always on point. The service is great and they never leave you needing anything. The price is about $10 per person which is not a bad deal. The mango lassi comes with the buffet so I usually drink some of that and water. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Indian or to anyone who wants to try it for the first time.
