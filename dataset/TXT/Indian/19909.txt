FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw My husband and I just ordered for take out - very impressed! The quality of food and flavours truly resembles the taste of India. Perfect amount of spice with each dish. The one and only reason why this place isn't a 5 star is because I found their prices to be a bit pricey, however, I would most definitely order from here again!
