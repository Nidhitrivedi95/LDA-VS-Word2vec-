rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I really missed the Indian Rice Factory when it closed but it has been dethroned as my favourite Indian food restaurant not just in the city but anywhere really.  We enjoyed everything we had immensely.  For me, the stars of the show were the garlic naan which was amazingly light and crispy, the gunpowder shrimp, spiced duck breast and believe it or not the kale salad.  I'm also a huge butter chicken fan and this one certainly didn't disappoint.  Highly recommend trying this place.  Nice decor inside as well so good for a night out.
