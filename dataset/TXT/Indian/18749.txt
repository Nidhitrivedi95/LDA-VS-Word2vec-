eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg This restaurant is near our home so we have visited it on quite a few occasions - always for dinner. The food has always been pretty good, though in recent months, we've noticed that the recipes have been substantially improved. We find that we are more frequent diners nowadays.

Today, flavors are more distinct and better balanced. The Vindaloo has has an appropriate tartness against the spice. The tomato-based curries are richer, with a good balance of salt and sweet. We like hot dishes, but usually order them "medium" for our friends - and that has worked very well, with everyone enjoying the dishes. 

Their location in a strip mall off 16th street doesn't look like much in the evenings, with all the other businesses closed and standard LED open signs flashing, but inside the restaurant is clean and nicely appointed, though admittedly it can be a little too dim for some folks. We could live without the endless Bollywood clips on the TV screen in the dining room (just the bar would be okay), but they do make for comical dinner conversation on occasion.

Service is always genuine, efficient and friendly. Big, cold Indian premium beers are always welcome on a hot Phoenix night and they are served with tall, cold glasses.

Take it from a long-time Phoenix resident that loves Thai, Indian, Cuban and Mexican food -  if you're looking for good Indian food in the Central corridor, try this restaurant for dinner. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but there's always parking and it's very good.
