8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg the food here is quite good.  came by with water frequently.  take out takes them awhile...expect 40 minutes.  my only complaint is that they either never have the Indian pickles, or forget to bring them out to me.  the ambience is nice inside, but sit near the front for better AC.  I sat in the back once and it was really hot.
