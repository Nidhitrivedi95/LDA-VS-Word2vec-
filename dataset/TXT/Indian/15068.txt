Ambiance is really great for a romantic night out. Very cozy tables. Unfortunately I came with my boss, so it was not an ideal place for me to bust out my laptop and work on reports. Ha. But that's besides the fact. 

I played it safe and got saag paneer.  He got something with prawns, which was alright. My paneer was good, but the saag had an overwhelming amount of pepper in it. I just ate the paneer out of the curry and left the rest. Garlic naan would've been better if I had something to dip it into. Sadness. I drank four waters to wash everything down. 

For the price they're charging here, you may as well go someplace where you can finish your meal with a smile.
