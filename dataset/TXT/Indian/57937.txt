yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I love the look of the place, the food was tasty but way to spicy for me. I ordered very little spice and it was so spicy that I could barely eat any of it. Gonna try it again in the future and ask for no spice and see what happens. The chicken was nice and juicy instead of dried out like a lot of places tend to be. Oh and it was a little too warm inside, but that coulda just been the day we went.
