KtNPcK6x9Dxj3aYGis5wgg Indian Kiss is hands down the freshest, most flavorful Indian restaurant in the Junction. I moved into a nearby condo about 14 months ago and popped my head in once to check the prices...they seemed a tad higher than what I was used to but I finally caved a few weeks later and was NOT disappointed. Have ordered from them over a dozen times, often for guests who've loved it too. 
Yummy stuff.
