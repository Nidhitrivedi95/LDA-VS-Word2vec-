cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw The Chicken Boti or Butter Chicken w/ their Garlic Naan are must try dishes for anyone stopping by. Would have given 5 stars if it was only the food, but their service is average. Not bad, but nothing special. 
Their coal oven adds a distinct taste, which I like, that I haven't had anywhere else. Anybody that's interested in or wanting to try Indian/Pakistani food need to come here.
