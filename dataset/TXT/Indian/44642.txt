S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Gandhi was recently shut down for a multi-generational cockroach infestation. 

If you feed them, they will come. And these roaches had a feast. 

Inspectors called the infestation "excessively active" and found the roaches housed inside an excessively greasy burner where food was actively cooking. Roaches were also in the prep area, near the sink and on the hot line. 

Gandhi's own pest control reports showed the restaurant requires a complete clean-out to eliminate the roach problem. 

We went by to see if any cleaning was going on.Their van was parked outside, but the restaurant's doors were locked. 

The sign on the door says they're closed for remodeling, indicating someone should be doing something.

In addition to the roach infestation, inspectors also saw a food handler using expired, 11-day old tomato sauce to cook with.
