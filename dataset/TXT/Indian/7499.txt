5v_nv9JgJtWHLPw8grPn-w The absolute best Jamaican food in town! The oxtail is slow cooked to perfection. Jerk chicken is done perfectly and the curry goat is delicious. Don't let the looks inside fool you this a diamond in the rough. Keep in mind that everyday the menu has it changes and the food is cooked fresh daily!
