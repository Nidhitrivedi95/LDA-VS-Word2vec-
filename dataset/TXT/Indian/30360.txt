The service is OK at best and the food is what brings you back. 

The Naan is fresh and delicious. They offer a lot of different types of food and different types of fish (which is a big deal for me), not to mention vegetarian options as well.

I wouldn't recommend the buffet. But it's a nice night out with the family for sure!
