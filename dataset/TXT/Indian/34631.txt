Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg tl:dr 1.5* rounded up: decent ambiance, poor service, limited buffet lacking flavor

We went here for their lunch buffet and were not impressed. The ambiance is nice, but it's a little creepy to walk into the building as it's pretty much deserted but for the 1 tenant (Tamba).

The buffet sucked -- only 3 appetizers (one was a salad), a few vegetarian curries and rubbery naan that no one replenished in the 2 hrs we were there. The curries were not spiced and lacked any flavor, it was very bland and uninspired. One of the curries was an odd choice for a North Indian restaurant (squash...TF?). 

Service was poor in that they didn't care to ask what we wanted to drink, took a long time to refill waters and were walking around like zombies (not looking at guests, no expressions, indifferent).
