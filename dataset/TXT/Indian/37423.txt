o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg Excellent lunch buffet on weekend which I highly recommend. Not much options on week-days. Very cosy n intimate atmosphere at night. Food is awesome at any given time. Spice level can very depending on your preference. We prefer mid-level and it works for us n our 6 yr old too !!!   Taste is awesome .. be it be non-veg or veg dishes.

Must try Items for Non-Veg
Goat Curry, Goat Piper Fry, Dum biryani, Chilli chicken etc
