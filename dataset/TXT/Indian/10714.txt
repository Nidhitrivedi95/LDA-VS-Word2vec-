A_05gZ2QwayLb0YeQ_TItQ Pleasant surprise in downtown Montreal. We went into this nondescript indian restaurant without expecting much. All we wanted was a quick bite to eat. We were blown away by the flavorful food. Chicken curry and Chicken sukka dishes are really awesome and can be prepared to one's spice specifications upon request. The Biryani is good too. We ended up going there multiple times during our 10 day visit. The person who runs the place seems very hardworking and a genuine nice guy. 5 stars.
