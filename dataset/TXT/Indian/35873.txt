To start, I had the mixed appetizer platter. Everything was delicious, and the dipping sauce was great and a little sweet. My only complaint about it is they only gave one samosa. Given the size of platter, it's clearly made for splitting so it's kinda funny to give one of something. For my main, I had the butter chicken. It was creamy and tangy, just the way I like it! It came with a generous helping gravy to dip the naan bread. Speaking of naan; the garlic naan was gigantic... which is awesome!

Everything was delicious and reasonably priced. What more could you want?
