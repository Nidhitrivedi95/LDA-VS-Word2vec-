I have to concur with Jonathan's review in one sense.  The food that we had was superb.  We were a group of between 25 and 30, there for a stag party, and we were accommodated without any issue.  I had a standard chicken korma, which was creamy and delicious.  Having sampled small amounts of other people's food, it was all superb.

I had a different experience to Jonathan regarding the service however.  I found their service to be, on the whole, excellent.  The waiting staff engaged us in conversation throughout the evening, often coming in to enjoy a joke or quick chit-chat.  With a lively bunch of men like we were, this added to the atmosophere, and we all left the restaurant as satisfied customers.  All our needs were attended to throughout the evening.  Perhaps going back with just a few people would yield a different result.

Although the location on Buccleuch Street is perhaps slightly off the beaten track, I feel that it's worth taking the time to visit King's Balti.  Maybe you'll be able to provide another review of their service here on Yelp?
