aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Liked the ambience which per my taste was interesting and basic, some thought had gone into it and the various touches like the posters, hanging 'chandelier' table tops were creative.
Now the food, what I came for....
I really wanted to like and fall in love with the place but have to stay with the Yelpers average of three stars.
The Cannaught place Cold Coffee ( and I have had plenty at the origional place) was weak, just think a frothy vanilly shake with some coffee in the background.
The Kathi Rolls were pretty good. Too much of the red dye though.
The paratha that you wrap the fillings in is the most important element of the Kathi Roll.
The origional in Calcutta is greasy like the philly sub. Owners here have tried to cater to popular taste by reducing the fat content dramatically which makes the roll a bit dry specially the parts not hit by the mint chutney.
Tasted by wife's Acari Paneer which was very good.
I tried the Mutton Roll for 9.95. They assued me it was goat meat which it most certainly was NOT. The meat was tender and they were generous with it, tastewise the meat seasoning was pretty good. In my opinion it would be better if they would keep the pieces smaller also if the quantity of egg was increased a bit there would be a better balance with the meat and paratha.
The spicy mint chutney in the roll was excellent, if you like spicy ask for plenty of this stuff.
Overall a good effort. I am sure they will work things out as they go.
We were there late evening so it was ok but I see where other Yelpers are comming from when they mention long waits for their food.
