EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Can't comment on the food as I have been waiting for over 30 mins for my order. So far two families have asked for a refund and just left. Another family has sent back two orders, and one couple keeps asking for an update on their order (three times) to be told it's "almost ready". The staff also informed them it would be a 30 min wait for an order of naan!  I will let y'all know how the food is if I ever receive it. Unless it's the GREATEST food ever I would highly suggest staying away from this restaurant. It may be the strangest dining experience I've ever been part of. If you do eat here, I would recommend take out as 4 patrons have come and gotten their take out as we are waiting and seem to have not had any issues.


Update: food came! I had chicken wrap and it was good after I asked for the chutney to add to it. Husband said Philly cheesesteak was good. $27 and 30 min wait good? Nah.
