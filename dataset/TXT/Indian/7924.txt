6P4ZzCdd_YQqncnQv1jplQ GROUPON WARNING!

Went here for the lunch buffet with a GROUPON.  The buffet was limited to only tandori chicken, curry chicken and a few other non impressive side dishes.  The garlic naan had no taste.  The vegetable pakoras were over fried, dried out and really greasy.  I couldn't eat them.  The place was over decorated and the gold satin napkins were over the top!   The service was not good either.

The kicker was, they brought me my bill BEFORE I told them I had a GROUPON.  My bill was $20.23 and I had a $20.00 GROUPON.  I showed the GROUPON to the server and he gave it to the Manager.  When the manager brought my bill back, he had scratched out my old total and ADDED and ADDITIONAL $4.00 (and change). He actually scratched out my old total and added an extra $4.00 + !  I asked why and he told me it was because I had a GROUPON and people with GROUPONS pay 15% more than without a GROUPON.  I couldn't believe it!    Never going back there!!!!!!!!
