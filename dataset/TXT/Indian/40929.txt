PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA After a very long day at a trade show, I trekked back to my hotel on a chilly Las Vegas evening.  I was very hungry but didn't have the energy to sit down and stay awake for a long meal.  Fortunately, the Yelp app on my phone pointed me to India Masala for some takeout.  

I was hesitant to venture into the lifeless and downright creepy Riviera but  I quickly passed the slot machines and the desperate souls attached to them on my way to the equally comatose food court.

As suicidal thoughts entered my mind, my spirits were promptly lifted by the friendly folks at India Masala.  My eyes wanted the entire menu but I restrained myself with an order of naan, daal maharani, mango lassi, and gulab jamun.  I carted it back to my hotel and devoured it all in no time.  Mmm, gulab jamun.  (I should've tried the entire menu.)

I'd gladly bet that the food at India Masala is the only worthwhile reason to go inside the Riviera.  Thank you, Yelp, for the unexpected surprise.
