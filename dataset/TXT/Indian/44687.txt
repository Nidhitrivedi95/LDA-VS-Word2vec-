S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Guys please AVOID this place at least for Buffet..!!!! I'm not allowed to give No rating else would have done that..

we just came back from Vegas & I couldn't stop myself from writing review for this place. Being an Indian knows how Indian food taste, smell,looks like. Believe me it was nothing like that. The menu was OK nothing fancy for the price you pay. Here is list of items in Vegetarian sect:
Yellow daal 
Rajma (any damn indian can make that better than what they had)
Shahi Panner (tasted just like Heinz ketchup)
Aloo Baigan (Big chunk of uncook potatoes)
Naan (It took forever to get them, we told them 5 times that there is no naan & how are we supposed to eat all above items)
Rice (we didnt cared about that as we left within 10 mins of our so called lunch Bufftet)
Onion Pakora (Cold Pakora, have you ever ate one)
Idli - (Hard as stone,  they made it 2 days ago to serve it. )
Sambhar (Sambhar was way tooo spicy & trust me when an Indian says too spicy it is...:)

The service is really really really bad. They dont care that you want something or not. They were behaving as if they are doing big favor on us by attending us. ohhh guys cmon .!!!
Its one of the Buffet you never want to waste your money. Believe me.!!
