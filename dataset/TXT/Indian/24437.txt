h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Pathetic experience.
1. Was charged 18% gratuity in advance for buffet. When asked for explanation, the employee told us to talk to owner. Would have been happier giving money as voluntary tip.
2. Insufficient food. Had to ask multiple times to get food.
3. Was denied bread/dosa on table.
4. Horrible restroom. Even the hand wash liquid soap was empty.
5. Vegetarian curries were pathetic.
