gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A From the outside it doesn't look like much so we were a little nervous about eating there but after reading the reviews we decided to give it a try. The chicken tikka masala was delicious, as was the garlic naan. The service was great and our server was friendly and very attentive.Would definitely recommend.
