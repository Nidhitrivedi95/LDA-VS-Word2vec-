vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg I've recently started coming to this establishment, due to the fact that 2 of my other favourite Indian restaurants in the east end closed down, but this is my new go to spot for my favourites butter chicken and saag paneer!! Both always come out fresh, hot and delicious!! ;) 
At times the atmosphere can be quiet and not too exciting, but it's nice for a chill dinner with friends! And if you're lucky they will have a promo on groupon! ;) 

The staff always seem friendly
