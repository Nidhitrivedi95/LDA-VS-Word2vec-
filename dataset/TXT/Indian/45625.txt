ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw It was the first time for us in Cleveland and according to the previous review this was a good restaurant. So we decided to have dinner  at this restaurant.

Order: 
        -Chicken tikka masala
        -Chicken biryani
        -Nan
        -Samosa
        -Yogurt
        -coke


Pro:
        -staff are friendly
        -Order was fast
        - We got welcomed instantaneously 
Cons:
        -Place is very old and outdated 
        - masala: I love and I cook indian food. Never in my life I have tried a masala as bad as this one. It was burned and the taste was really bad it really difficult to describe it. To hide such a bad taste, they put a lot of chillies. (4/10)

        -biryani: even biryani tasted really bad. It was very cold. Full of raw onions, rice is really mushy. No indian flavor what so ever. ( 3/10)

        -samosa: I did not try it. But my wife told  me it was good
        -Price: was unreasonably high. Also they charge us for raita but what we got was just plain yogurt and when asked him he said both are THE SAME PRICE.

I am truly disappointed with the quality of the food. The staff seems  really kind but they can find a better recipe to make their popular dish "masala".

Last comment: the one who picked up the dishes asked me how was the food???? I told him IT WAS OK, and he said "EXCELLENT!!!!" 

I don't know why some restaurants do not read and act upon the review available on yelp and other places,,,
