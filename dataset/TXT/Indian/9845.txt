Then we had to flag the busboy down to ask about getting a beverage.  Mind you it was not busy at all and there were several employees around. We tried many of the buffett options.  The food was just okay.  Have had better Indian food.  My impression of the workers were that they did not want to be there.., maybe if someone smiled a little bit.  We also had to flag a waiter down to get our bill, and like I said it was not busy at all. Will not return.
