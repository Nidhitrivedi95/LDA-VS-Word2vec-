UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I travel a lot, and often seek out a Masala Dosa.
I have my favorite spots in LA, Berkeley, Seattle.
In Las Vegas I have been to Mint twice.

It's okay. I would go again.
I just get a Dosa. It's vegetarian and hopefully a bit healthy.

The Dosa here was pretty good. Not the best, but certainly quite okay.  And the restaurant was very clean and nice, which is not always the case.
