CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A Awful... simply awful.  I love Indian food, and while visiting Madison, I thought I hit the jackpot because I found some that delivered.  How sad was !!!!

Naan bread is one primary method to evaluate any legit place.  Theirs is tasteless.  I could have saved myself the money and got myself some wonder bread.

Tasteless also sums up the rice.  Anyone who goes Indian knows that the rice is very distinctive.  Sadly, this was also not to be.  Another money saving tip would have been to buy some instant Uncle Bens.

The rest of the food followed along similar lines.  My recommendation is to do without at your hotel room.
