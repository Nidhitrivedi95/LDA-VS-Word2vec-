c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg Went there for a dinner.  Very nice and clean place. Relaxing atmosphere. Very nice and polite customer service. Food was very delicious and flavourful.  Mushrooms 65 and fry fish was delicious. Shrimp Masala was amazing and so was the Mutton do Piaza. Everything had the right amount of spices and the portions were generous.  Great lassis as well. The one thing they should improve is the quality of their naan. It was little dry.
