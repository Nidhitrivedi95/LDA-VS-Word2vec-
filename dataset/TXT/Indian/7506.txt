5VOqWjRXUPc7b1A_NSI9mQ Imperial Garden...i have a love/hate relationship with you!!!

-Your Chili Shrimp taste pretty yummy
-My company adores the chili chicken...believes that is better then Frederiks & Lin Garden (likes that there is a lot of sauce and chicken...)
-Service is very good..always checking up on us and refilling the water
-Veggie Spring Rolls are small yet delish!
-Menu is affordable...esp the lunch specials


-HOWEVER, you do lose 1 star. why you may ask? What is the use of having a phone number when NO ONE ever PICKS UP THE PHONE?? I wanted to order take out so many times in the past and no one ever answers the phone. I come there in person (because the my company absolutely wants your chili chicken).....and it's not busy there....

Is it so hard to answer to phone? *sigh
