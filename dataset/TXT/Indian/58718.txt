YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA Great hole in the wall on Yonge between Bloor and Wellesley.  If you didn't know it was there, you could miss it entirely.  Which would be too bad for you.  This is one of the truly better Indian places in this part of town.  

We went twice and had an assortment of dishes both times: Aloo Bonda (appetizer), Palak Paneer, Butter Chicken, Malai Kofta, Aloo Baingan, Fish Curry, Garlic Naan, Onion Kulcha, Chicken Biryani, Mysore Masala Dosa.  Too much food, right?  Wrong.  My partner and I licked the dishes clean when we went the first time.  The second time, there were 4 of us, and we cleaned up as well.

What made the food so special?  The quality.  The portions were perhaps on the smaller size compared to most other Indian places.  However, we loved the spice mixes and each dish had its own unique flavour.  The fish curry was absolutely amazing - I thought I would hate it, but it was just the right amount of spice and not fishy at all.  Butter chicken actually tasted like butter chicken, not some sweet sickly mess - and real chicken breast, not overcooked and chewy!  The garlic naan was a little oily, but oh well, down it went with all the rest.

Service was also wonderful.  Our waiters were courteous and helpful.  The only thing missing about this place is the decor - for those who care, it needs a facelift.  If you don't care about decor and just want to have some good Indian food, this is the place to go.  For sure our new favourite Indian restaurant in the neighborhood.
