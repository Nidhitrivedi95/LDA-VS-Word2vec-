-XNodvHlq9oDu-kQBwGFkg I had their vegetarian options since they do not serve halal (what a shame) I would be there more often if it was. Had their mattar paneer, palak paneer and dal makhni with rice it was one of the best I've had in this part of the world the dal makhni. 
Decor was great nice and modern. 
They had some cool items I wouldn't mind trying on their menu in the future.
Great for a hidden spot. 
Definitely worth a try at least for their vegetarian options.
