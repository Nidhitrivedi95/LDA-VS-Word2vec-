Dh2Z3WNu6M71LbMNHEeg3w I am more than disappointed with the food received! I ordered tiger prawns in general tso sauce and what I received was an insult to my love for that dish. There was a putrid smell that was accompanied by a horrible old taste.  I had two bites and told the owner I couldn't even force myself to eat that dish. He acted shocked for half a second while charging me for the dish regardless!  I read (afterwards) from a previous diner that he didn't believe that the food was fresh. I have to agree. Stale, old, possibly reused... Omg... I think I'm going to be sick...
