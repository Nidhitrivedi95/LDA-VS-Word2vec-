YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A By far, one of the best indian foods I have ever had! 
I have, so far, tried the Butter Chicken, Mint Tikka Chicken and shrimp tandoori, and I must say that they all exceeded my expectations.
Pricing may seem a bit steep, but for the quality of food, ingredients, and service I would not expect the prices to be any cheaper.
