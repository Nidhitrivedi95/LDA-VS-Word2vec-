qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA It's cheap. In both a good and bad sense. The food can be a bit burnt, dry, or otherwise less tasty than normally expected. The prices are low, especially compared to typical western pubs. The decor looks cheap, and the tables/chairs are crowded.

The service is fine (though I guess we were there on a not-too-busy night), the Asian-Western fusion food (bread, rice, noodles, etc.) seems to be neutral (not especially good or bad), and the inside is rather loud from all the chatter echoing.
