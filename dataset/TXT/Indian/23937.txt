gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Straight up some of the best Indian food I  have ever had. I took my girlfriend there a few months ago for her birthday as she's never had Indian food before but always wanted to try it. The restaurant is in what looks to be a former Pizza Hut or maybe a KFC and they set up the buffet trays where the cash registers used to be. Despite the former use of the space, they managed to create a very nice ambiance inside, dark and with banging Bollywood songs on the TV. Those were some great music videos and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the actors/signers and movies being shown and was happy to share. 

As for the food, as I already said it is some of if not the best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm no novice. I found that if there's  something not  on the menu that you'd like, ask and they'll make it. I'm partial to goat vindaloo which they didn't have on the menu but were more than happy to make. My girlfriend got chicken tikka masala. Both our curries were a 10 (which was a tad  ambitious for her) and the spice was very good. The vindaloo was done perfectly as was the chicken. I've found a lot of places when you order a 10, they just dump a bunch  of cayenne to heat it up, but it was clear it was an across the board spice increase  and you could taste the difference. My girlfriend also had  a mango lassi  and while I'm not as familiar with them as I  am curry, it seemed really really good. 

As I mentioned, my girlfriend was  a bit overzealous in ordering a ten and while she managed to eat it, it was still a bit too spicy. The manager  must have noticed she was having issues because he offered  us a free serving of gulab jamun for her troubles. They definitely earn top marks for service as well as food.
