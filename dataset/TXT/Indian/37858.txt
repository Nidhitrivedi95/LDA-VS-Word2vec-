ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I found this at Groupon and decided to try it out. I'm not Indian, but I'm a sucker for Indian food. So far, I've tried other Indian restos here in Vegas that I would recommend than the Origin India. The ambiance is pleasant, but as for the food, they did not taste very Indian-ish to me. They were spicy but they tasted plain. It was not a terrible experience, since the service was not so bad, but food quality wise, maybe try somewhere else.
