GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg We went there for Some tea and samosa guess whar they were Out of Samosa
Super unclean, so much so I was afraid to touch the menus. 
No public restrooms
Windows, floors, table sides and corners dirty and unmaintained.
Tea was fine and the naans bread was fresh but I regret ordering chicken Biryani it was miserable and old, the chicken tasted like old tofu anyway I know I won't be going there at all.
