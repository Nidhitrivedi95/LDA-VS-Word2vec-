KUf4XRy81XMJdY4Pjb27PQ My new favorite restaurant! First of all, best masala hands down! Buttered naan was soft, crispy, and flaky in all the right spots. Vegetable korma was flavorful with the right amount of spice. Husband had vegetable thali and it was my favorite! Lentils were amazing and the paneer is the best in the area. Ready to try the lunch/weekend buffet.
