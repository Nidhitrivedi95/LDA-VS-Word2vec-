9A-y0TWBKqqP5vsn_CwI3g I have been a regular visitor to India house over the last 3 years and I can say with confidence that this should count as one of the best in business here in Stuttgart.


 This restaurant must rank high in terms of ambience, food quality, options for vegetarians and non vegetarians, and overall experience.


 On the low side, one might face a poor service quality but we this being a new restaurant, we can safely hope that things will pick up.
