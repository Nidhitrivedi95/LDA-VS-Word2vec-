LgqGDQsUurUh6qUocPeSsQ The best part of Malhi is it is cheap - a dinner for 2 will cost you CAD30 which is real cheap. But you get what you pay for. The food is not great- I cook better at home. The attitude of the main guy who could be the owner is obnoxious. He yelled at us for keeping on ordering food. They can't handle big groups - we were 12 and our order for 2 came almost after everyone had finished dinner. They outright ask for cash so they will not charge you taxes which is wrong. I will let a Govt official investigate that. They were literally begging for cash (especially USD). Never order the Gulab Jamun- just go to an Indian grocery store - they taste better. I will not be back to the place and will never recommend it. I tasted Chicken Jalfrezi and Lamb Masala - the gravy is the same. If you want quality Indian Food in Montreal please eat at Le Taj - it's way more expensive but you get your money's worth. The only reason Malhi is in business that long is because it is cheap.
