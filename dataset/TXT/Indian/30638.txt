KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA FINALLY!! A truly amazing Indian fusion gem in the Square One/Rathburn/Tomken area with great food and impeccable service (privately owned and the partners are always there making sure you have a great experience)

I'll start with the food.... 100% made to order and after 5-7 visits trying everything from traditional Indian to Canadian lounge food I've been impressed! fav's so far are Chili fish, pakoras, Dosa and the chicken wings (best in town)

The atmosphere is solid... totally renovated in Dec. 2012 and with the same space they created two completely different areas, dining and lounge with a killer sound system and multiple flatscreens...

As a 10 year resident of the neighbourhood I would encourage you to check it out... YOU will not be disappointed!!

They actually deliver too which is awesome if you don't want to make the trek!
