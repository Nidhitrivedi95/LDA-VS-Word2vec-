PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ My favourite restaurant in Montreal hands down.

If you go and don't like it, it's because you're not ordering the right thing.  My boyfriend and I have gone every 6-8 weeks for the last 4 years and we have tried a variety of dishes, but now, we always order exactly the same thing.

Chana Samosa - crunchy, spicy, saucy. 

Baingan Bharta - velvety pureed eggplant with a kick

Chicken Korma - creamy dreamy yogurt-y sauce with tender chicken.

garlic naan - amazing to dip in the bharta and korma.

Buy yourself a bottle of wine, grab a friend, and try the above mentioned  menu next time, (all for about $35).
