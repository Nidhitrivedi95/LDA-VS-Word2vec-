llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Tried this place today for the first time, lured by the positive reviews of their lunch buffet. I am extremely happy we went. Good price, authentic atmosphere, attentive service, comfortable seating - and the food - YUM. More than half of the dishes were vegetarian. All were delicious. Not overly spicy, seasoned and cooked well and not, like some Indian food I've had before, layered in grease and oil. We will be back again.
