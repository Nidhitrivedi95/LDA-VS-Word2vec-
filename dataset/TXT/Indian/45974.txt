sLEIfWO9OEmVkIJ99oVP2w I went to this place, after a family friend raved about how good it was. The inside is kind of old and dark looking. Nothing fancy. 

I ordered a chicken dish (can't remember which one), daal and garlic naan. The chicken dish was just alright. I remember there being some questionable chicken pieces in there which we left untouched. The daal was ok, but not creamy. It was more like home-style. The garlic naan came out with no garlic on it. We told our waiter and he said he would get us some fresh garlic naan. 2 minutes later we get our naan, which looks like he just threw some garlic spices on it. This was not what I was expecting. 

Overall, the food was fine. However I would not go back here. There are better places to go to in the area.
