AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ Overall poor experience. 

We went on a weeknight around 6pm and the restaurant was almost empty. Despite this, the server was still inattentive and we were waiting repeatedly for our drinks, orders and bill. 

They also failed to honor their Happy Hour drink specials. Clearly stated on their website is that Happy Hour is 4-7pm every weekday yet when we went and ordered at 6, they told us we had "just missed it" since it apparently ends at 6 despite the website saying 7 and us ordering at 6:05... This was compounded when they said that our Groupon voucher $30 for $50 could not be used for alcohol despite it saying nowhere on the Groupon terms that this was a condition. We told them at the beginning we would be using Groupon and they failed to inform us until payment.

The food, wish this made up for it/ made the dinner not a bust... It didn't. We ordered the Butter Chicken and the beef. Both were very standard, portion sizes were small and the sauces lacked flavor/ spices. We can both honestly say, working downtown, that we have had better Butter Chicken/ beef curries from Food Courts and Ritual. The original prices for these dishes at over $15 is also way overpriced for what you get. 

Ambiance was also misleading as the bar pictured is beautiful but the rest of the restaurant is quite empty. 

Poor experience, service and food - will not be returning.
