3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ Our first visit to Haldi Indian Cuisine and how great it is!  The expansive lunch buffet takes one whole wall of the restaurant and has plentiful options from the standards of butter chicken and saag paneer to menu items I haven't seen before, can't pronounce or spell; and all were wonderfully prepared and delicious to eat.  The service was friendly, fresh bread is brought to the table while you prepare your plate and drinks were refilled as needed.  The food was moderately spicy and full flavored.  We are already planning our next Indian adventure.
