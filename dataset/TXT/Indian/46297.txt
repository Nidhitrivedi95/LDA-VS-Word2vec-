sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Roti's are delicious I too love the butter chicken and am looking forward to trying a vegetarian roti next time.

They are very one-note but I suppose that's to be expected. I only mention it because it is a very large portion and by the end I find myself feeling very full and a bit tired of having one taste sensation. I'll accept your rage towards that comment if you must.

Definitely spicy as others have mentioned, I go medium and it's what others may consider hot hot. 

Very tasty, certainly over priced, but sometimes when the time comes I gotta have some Gandhi.
