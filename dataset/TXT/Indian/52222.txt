UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Stopped in for the lunch buffet after a morning of golf, on the recommendation of some of my Indian coworkers.  What a great find!  The food was reasonably priced and tasted great!  A little spicier than most of the Indian restaurants I've been to, but that doesn't bother me.  The buffet was pretty big - I really like the chicken korma and tika masala, and the galob jamon for dessert was everything I hoped it would be!  We had a mango lassi, and a cherry lassi for the first time ever - both were really good.  Can't wait to go back and order off the regular menu!
