b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Best Indian in Cleveland. There are plenty of Indian places in the area that are good but this is the only non-vegetarian South Indian restaurant in northeast Ohio. I lived in India for 3 years and can attest that this place is not only delicious but completely authentic. Sooo good!!!
