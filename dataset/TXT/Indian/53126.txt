VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw location was nice and place seemed clean, service was slow and a bit  bothersome, how you may ask, well they didnt want to honor our coupon at first because they said that the business was changing hands next month, not until i pushed it a bit did they honor it. also waiter was nice and helpful but really wasnt listening to what we were asking him. now to the food, nothing to right home about . i would rate the food 3 stars but when you have to pay for rice separately and the naan also being small , i have to knock it down to 2 stars overall...
