jpYAApi_w1bR50EJ71LBHg If you are down for Sri Lankan food then stop by here. Food is yummy and spicy! Mom loves to go here from time to time. I just had the goat biryani on 2 occasion (dine in/takeout). Both times the portions were HUGE! Now I can tolerate spicy food so I will say this is spicy.  Aside from the taste, there is a generous portion of goat in it. 

I wpuld give it a 4.5. The lack in half a star is because they forgot an order of mine. It's not really a big deal (coz they didn't charge me) but it was surprising coz in told them 3 times.
