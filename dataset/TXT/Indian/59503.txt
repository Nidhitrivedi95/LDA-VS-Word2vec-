ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ I almost don't even want to review the place because I like I can rush in get what I want and be gone if need be without huge crowds...this will soon change.  Food was fantastic, service was excellent and we've been there when busy (once) and empty and it was always excellent.

We lived in India for a few years, so we have a solid reference point, but we all know food is a preference individually but I love the place.  They are an Andrha run business (Hyderabad) style cuisine, so they can make it mild, but specialize in spicy!  Loved it.  It was so good my brother in-law who is afraid of 'unique' food, loved it to death!  A convert to good Indian food.
