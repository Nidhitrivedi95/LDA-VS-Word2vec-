LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA This used to be our favorite place for South Indian food. The taste has declined and the portions have become smaller.  The line ups are too long and left to college part time students to manage the reservations and line ups.  Even after making reservation we had to wait for 40 Minutes to get a table. Our order for 3 dosas took almost 35 minutes to serve and the taste waant even good. We will avoid going back.
