Yoc9_4sv6AT1AIohPPiGbA Quality food! My husband were here for lunch on Saturday, and ordered a South Indian Thali and mango lassi. The Thali had three vegetable dishes, Sambar, Rasam, Pongal, Rice, Chapati/Dosa, Curd and Gulab Jamun. Everything tastes good and quantity was sizable.

Pricing is on par with other Indian restaurants, though I find all Indian restaurants being slightly overpriced! Nevertheless, good food is worth it!
