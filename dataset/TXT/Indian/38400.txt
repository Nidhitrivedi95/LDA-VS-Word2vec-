OOBSQF72cl3jBBpLQWhyzw Came to this place on a whim. Was really shocked to find out this is a Sri Lankan restaurant. Ordered the cauliflower pakora, mutton sukka varuval, and mango shake. All were really good! The mutton sukka varuval especially was made authentically; tasted like home cooked Sri Lankan food! Really impressed by this restaurant.
