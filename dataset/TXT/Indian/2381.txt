While the high-quality of their food has not changed as evidence by a recent takeout meal, I felt the decor was a bit gloomy and antiquated (funeral parlor), so much so that I felt as if Robert Irvine would burst in at any moment with his patented golden sledgehammer. 

The matriarch is still as sweet as Golub Jamun to me. She even gave me a free pen with the restaurant's logo on it as I settled up.

P.S. The defunct Billu's Indian Grill was located here before Namaste took it over.
