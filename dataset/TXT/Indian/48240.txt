ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA We have been enjoying Saffron's dining experience for years and it is our favorite Indian restaurant.  The staff has a been courteous, attentive, and willing to teach customers about their different dishes.  We have seen this restaurant grow over the years and we are no longer the only non-Asian customers, which is wonderful to see as the Ayrsley Development has grown to become a vibrant locale. The is now a small park and outdoor seating to enjoy the weather and people watch.  The food tend to have wonderful flavors and textures.  I try to order something different on each busy and have not been disappointed yet.

An excellent example this past visit was our wonderful waiter, Vinay!  He was kind, pleasant, happy, and helpful.  His friendliness was contagious and it spread from one table to another .
