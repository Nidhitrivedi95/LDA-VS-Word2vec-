UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I had a yelp day today and chose this place as it was the best reviewed Indian restaurant in Toronto. I have to say that am always amazed at how every Indian restaurant has their own take on classic Indian cuisine. I always order the same thing (chicken tika massaala) and it seems to be different at every place I go to. That being said I just love Banjara's take on my favorite dish. Not to creamy not too spicy...just right. Overall I was very impressed with this place. The menu was pretty comprehensive and not too pricy. The onion bargi and the samosas are definitely worth a try. The décor is a bit shabby and yes it is cramped but then I really do not expect much else when I go out for Indian. Definitely worth another visit.
