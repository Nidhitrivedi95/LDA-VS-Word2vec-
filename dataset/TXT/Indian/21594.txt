GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Woodlands is a well-known South Indian restaurant in New Delhi, India, so taking that name here in the States is kind of shady. Especially when there's not even a bare attempt to meet the same standards. 

Anyway, Chandler's Woodlands serves primarily South Indian dishes. For the unfamiliar and unadventurous, there are also North Indian dishes on the menu (various curries, samosas, chole bhatura, etc.). There's no real atmosphere to speak of. You walk up to the counter, place your order, and receive your food on paper plates with plastic forks and knives. 

I had the pav bhaji dosa, and some sambar-vada, both classic South Indian entrees (except that pav bhaji is a North Indian twist to the South Indian dosa concept). The sambar was bland, and not very interesting. It lacked the rich flavor that I expect, and was more watery than it should be. The dosa was fine. Because dosa is eaten with sambar, the bland sambar dampened my enthusiasm for the otherwise okay dosa. 

The saving grace here is the prices, which are fair for the mediocre quality, lack of service, lack of atmosphere, and plasticware.
