I was expecting something great from the newly opened Indian restaurant, but when I had got there, they had miss placed my order, they were out of 2 of the items I ordered, and the food was mundane.  Although, I was extremely disappointed in the service and the quality of the food, since the staff was extremely apologetic and the setting was impressive, I'm thinking I may give the place a second chance. Maybe.
