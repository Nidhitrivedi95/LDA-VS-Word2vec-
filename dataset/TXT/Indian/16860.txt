DN_cXMaeAUFFLm6eUOsNWQ This is the first restaurant I have been to which creates a fuss on changing a table once you have ordered. I mean if the table is not comfortable, you just have to change it. 

Place lacks customer service big time and because they have a couple of plaques on the wall with components they seem to flying on cloud nine. 

Servers are outright rude and the manager tried his best to be polite but failed miserably. 

Food is mediocre....yes it's cheaper compared to other there are definitely better places to eat in Brampton that treat their customers well. 

Won't be visiting again.
