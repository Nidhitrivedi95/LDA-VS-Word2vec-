XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw Always up for a culinary adventure, hubby and I found this non-descript restaurant on the corner end of a strip mall.  It looked sketchy from the outside, and lacked ambiance on the inside, but the familiar smell of Indian spices kept our feet planted.

We both dined on tandoori specials (hubby had the raj mahal and I had the fish), and were a little disappointed the dishes weren't exactly as the menu pictures and descriptions suggested, but were still pleased with the flavors.  The naan was a bit on the dense side and, for some reason, was brought out towards the end of our meal.  

Overall, a nice experience.  Nothing special, but certainly worth the drive when coupled with a movie at the independent theatre nearby.  We saw the new Philip Seymour Hoffman movie and were delighted when our evening ended with a rainstorm.

We'll be back for the buffet.
