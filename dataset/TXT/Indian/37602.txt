OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A This is a very good place to come and have dinner either as a group as a date (I did both). The food is very good and the servers quiet but friendly and always here to help. 

I always order the Tali as it has the best quality/price ratio, and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a good evening eating out.

Enjoy!
