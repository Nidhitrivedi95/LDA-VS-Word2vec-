TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA This place serves the pure vegetarian south Indian cuisine .. even though I am not a pure vegetarian, I do eat out at this restaurant sometimes when I am in a mood for a light meal .. the thing with this kinda food is that no matter how much you eat, it doesn't makes your stomach go rumbling or feel heavy .. so I guess I can go here once in a while ..
The ambience isn't that great .. some of the tables are lined up in the middle of the path and I hate sitting in this area. The service is alright, not the fastest but reasonable . Everytime I've been here, I've noticed that the place is kinda crowded .. so there is a lot of noise but then if I choose to eat out then I should not complain about the noise I guess.
Food is good if you are not looking for the typical spicy taste that Indian food is known for. Their spice level is pretty low.
