B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg My favorite Indian food in Madison. I've tried many dishes here, chicken and vegetarian, as well as many of the appetizers, breads, and chutneys. Everything is excellent. Some favorites include the chicken shahi korma, muttar paneer, vegetable samosa, and garlic naan. I enjoy the professionalism of staff and owners. A really nice dining experience whether at lunch or dinner.
