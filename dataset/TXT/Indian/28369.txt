J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Mediocre Indian food - not much different than any other Indian restaurant you come too. Unfortunately due to dietary restrictions some of the better deals (like the thali) were out of the question. I would have recommended this! 

I ordered the eggplant ban gain and my bf had some sort of chicken curry. I was sad to see the treatment of the eggplant, this dish is usually not so creamy! But it was still ok, didn't get much of the eggplant flavour though. The naan was ok, could have been softer. 

Service is pretty good, waiters are very knowledgable about the food (good because we had lots of questions!) the food came out very fast as well, I think we waited about 10 minutes!
