But Haldi was a pleasant surprise. I went in after more than a couple of great responses. I really liked it. The Paw bhaji was a mood uplifter. Hot Dosa and Naan and a decent variety in a buffet. I tried tasting every single dish, to find one preparation that doesn't live up to its name. I didn't find any, but again, I was stuffed midway. Although I genuinely feel that they could do away with the chowmein and concentrate only on the Indian. I loved the koftas. The chicken butter masala was average. The Biriyani was better than most places in Phoenix. And towards the end, I feel they could really improve on their dessert menus. That was clearly a lazy ensemble. Overall it's worth the amount and won't disappoint.
