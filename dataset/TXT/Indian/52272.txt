UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Fantastic dinner; our first time eating here.
We had the 'Indian Prix Fixe' meal for two and it was wonderful.  From the apps to the dessert, each course was delicious, fresh, and well situated to our spice level-- 7.  Yum!!!!  Great service and it was busy at 10pm Sunday.   We'll be back for sure...  

Sorry no picture...We ate too fast and thought of it afterward.
