ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA After a great workout this morning at the Y....I was very hungry and had an intense desire for naan...and other great Indian goodies.  It has been sometime since I had gone to Passage to India for lunch.  We were pleasantly surprised that they had the buffet open until 3PM.  We considered other locations as we drove from the north side to the east.
I am glad we decided on P2I.  It was really great.  The rice, the curries, tandoori chicken, everything all so very good!   Now if we could just have gotten some mango pudding for dessert, we would have been so so so happy!
