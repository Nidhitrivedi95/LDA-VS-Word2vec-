TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Vegas has a gazillion restaurants to choose from, so the list of places that I want to visit is quite extensive. I definitely knew that wanted to go to a place that would have more locals than tourists. After running through my list and seeing the great Yelp reviews, I finally decided on India Palace.

Wow, I was not disappointed! Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.

I went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course. Chicken Vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes, and of course, you can request the level of spiciness. I went for "hot"! To die for... it was sooo good!!! It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full. I didn't even have room for dessert, which is usually required in my book.

When I checked in, I unlocked a Yelp coupon code, which they pleasantly honored. The service was absolutely awesome! Nice, quick, and always a smile.

Will be going back!
