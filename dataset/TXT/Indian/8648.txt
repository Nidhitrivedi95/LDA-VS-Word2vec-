Not outstanding, and I think it's a little overpriced with small portions, but the goat curry is interesting and the rolled-up poppadums are quite different. Nice naan and onion kulcha. Tandoori chicken seems to be a specialty there, as several people in the restaurant had ordered that and it looked amazing, sizzling like crazy as it went by. We ordered a veg kofta which had a nice creamy sauce, but featured a sort of cheese dumpling that I didn't care for. Good saag chicken.
