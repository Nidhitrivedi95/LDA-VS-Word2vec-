SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg This is the Chipotle of Indian food.  That is how the worker presented it, and that is exactly what it is.  The guy working the counter was great and explained everything to us, all the toppings, offered tastes of sauces and gave recommendations.  That being said, this is not my first choice for Indian food.  I got a rice bowl.  This is not how Indian food should be enjoyed.  Indian food has great, complex flavors and when different flavors are mixed together into one bowl it is a mess.  There is too much going on.  I paid 99c extra for the sautéed okra, but that was not worth the cost because after it was covered with 3 other flavors, you could not taste the okra anyways.  The lamb meatballs were the highlight with the cucumber dressing.  With the different toppings on lettuce it would be like a really great gyro salad.  The masalas were lackluster.  Overall, I would not try this place again.
