Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA We've dined at the Pickering location and have been wanting to try Scarborough's eatery for some time and did so this week. Firs off, extremely small dining room compared to Pickering, only about 5-6 tables available enough to seat 20-26 patrons max. Staff were very welcoming and seated us immediately, presented menus and glasses of cold water. Hot summer day so that was much appreciated. 

We had our usual: 1 plate of Chilli Chicken $8.75 (dry version without sauce), you can order a softer saucier version, but we like the crunch. With a plate of Manchurian Vegetable Fried Rice ($6.50)

Food arrived in about 15-20 minutes. Chicken was very delicious, crunchy, lots of kick with the green chillies. Rice very well done as well, huge portions! We were pretty full and had some leftovers to take home.  $17.21 total, we left a $20 with tip for the courteous and delightful service we received.

Overall great value for a dine out with delicious food. Now I know I don't need to travel all the way out to Pickering for some Spicy Dragon.
