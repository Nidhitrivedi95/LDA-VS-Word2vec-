9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A Ordered from this restaurant delivery order to my hotel. Looked it up and found a decent rate so decided to stay in my room watch a movie and get food from here. Because i was TOO LAZY.  

It took the order 52 minutes to get her which is a reasonable time. Now once i opened the bags there was no cutleries no plates no napkins nothing. They literally just sent me food. I had no way of eating the food. Considering that they knew i am staying a hotel they shouldve been more thoughtful and send me such stuff like any other restaurant does for take out or deliveries. So i ended up going downstairs to the lobby  to get cutleries napkins and ice for my room temprature coke that i eece

Now lets get to the most important thing. The food. 
We got butter chicken, chicken tikka massala, veg rice, normal rice , and nan bread with cheese. Considering the price the quality is not even close to being okay. Food was pretty bad and nothing tasted decent except their nan bread and yogurt sauce. Chicken tasted old and their sauces were very runny and flavourless. I was really disappointed.
