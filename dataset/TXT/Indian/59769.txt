ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg This place is by all means the BEST indian restaurant in las vegas. I would highly revommend to come here if you are looking for great indian food. The staff is extremely friendly. They have a lunch buffet that is awesome. Tonight we came for dinner and got the non veg special. Its wonderful!
