Zcd2yYA5ck-38duDOg6dww I'm going to be honest I'm not even a vegetarian and I came here by accident. However, this is probably the best mistake of my life!!! This also happens to be my first time trying Indian food and they nailed it. This was a very pleasant surprise! First off, when you walk in the vibe is great and the decor was nice as well as very modern. The food is awesome too!! The cauliflower order was just ancbhandbajdhwhtjwjjf ( I have no words to explain how good it was). But yes the food: great, service: great, ambience: great. The food is a little spicy too but very tasty. I recommend this to everyone not just vegetarians! A solid 5 stars
