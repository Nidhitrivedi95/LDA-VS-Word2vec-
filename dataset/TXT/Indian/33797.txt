You get to watch Bollywood musicals on the TV.  That's always a plus.  The naan is perfectly cooked.  It is not hard like some places serve them.  The sauce for the various meats were tasty.  They were the right kind of spicy curry.  The meat however was tough.  It has been sitting out in the steamers for too long, I think.  Their deconstructed samosa was a bit of a mess.  It doesn't taste like how a samosa should be:  hearty with soft potatoey goodness.  It is too sweet for one.  Maybe they should call it a sweet vegetable and potato plate instead.  The mango lassi was averagely refreshing.  The Chai was made the way I like to drink them.  It was made hot, milky and full of spice.
