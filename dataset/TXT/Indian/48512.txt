tNPWi75s0o20rNERLg6R_Q How do you write a review for a restaurant that has great food but had a cockroach looking bug on the wall right next to my head....??? So I am just going to put it out there: bugs... 

The food is amazing though. I had some burrito looking appetizer with chicken in it and the Butter Chicken as my entree. The garlic Na-an was some of the best I have ever had. They bake it in a wood fire stove so it has this pizza crust texture but is way softer and super garlicky. 

The service was ho-hum...I really don't think I will ever be back due to the little critter issue...I hope they figure that out, because the service is forgettable with the food being so good.
