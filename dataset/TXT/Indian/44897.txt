S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA I had a very nice buffet here this afternoon! The food was very good, especially the tandoori chicken! Most buffet style tandoori is dry, but this was delicious! I enjoyed the butter chicken with rice, not very spicy so perfect for those of who who can't handle the heat. The veggie pakora had maybe been out too long, they were a little mushy, but still had a good flavor.
