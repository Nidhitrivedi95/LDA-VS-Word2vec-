svYRwm8unFfkki__lJrR2w Was here about 3 months back on a Saturday night. The sambhar was stale, the bonda (potato balls) were rock hard. The staff is polite and gave us extra bondas because they were closing soon. But honestly, the food was rank and stale. My friend said the same thing. I'm kinda shocked how this place has a 4 star average. The ambience is also sad. I feel bad saying this because they were polite, but they need to change. I'm not coming here again, that's for sure.
