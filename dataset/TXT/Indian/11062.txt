a8o8OMGhWg4JwbuMMnVOHQ Found this place on Yelp. Went with my wife and we loved it. We were greeted by Arun, and he provided us with exceptional service throughout the evening. He made sure we were taken care of during our meal. As for the food; probably the best halal steak and poutine I have had in the city so far. Would definitely return and recommend this place!
