fagmJeecurJfXGAxbgMv8Q Jan 2015. The original Cholas has gone. It is now Northern Indian owned by someone else. So my review no longer relates to the new restaurant. If you want good Southern Indian, try going a bit further north across the road to Tanjore.---This is THE best Indian food I have had anywhere, and from any region of India, bar none. The food is fresh, delicious and full of great flavours and colours. Everything is prepared fresh to order. The menu selection is very varied with lots of great choices. The staff are wonderful; very friendly, courteous and eager to create a great dining experience for you. The restaurant itself is nicely designed and set, and is very clean. Have been there twice already in a month's time. They have a great lunch and dinner menu, offer free delivery and catering, also. You will not be disappointed, and will visit often, I expect! Enjoy!
