jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw My husband and I are always on lookout for good  food. We happened to be in Vegas and this place looked promising in terms of reviews and the menu variety that they offered so I made it a point to make a stop here and I think that was a GREAT decision. The food was probably the best I have had in North America so far! I like my desi food to be authentic and this place did a great job with that. We ordered chicken biryani and beef bihari platter and the taste was superb. Everything was cooked to perfection and had a genuine Pakistani taste. The owner personally took our order and ensured that the spice level is tailored to our preference. The paratha and the garlic naan was freshly baked and made a great combination with the beef bihari. The portion size was great for the price as well. Highly recommended. Really wish we had something similar in east coast. Can totally take a trip to Vegas to just eat here!
