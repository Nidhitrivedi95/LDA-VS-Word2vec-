h2cPIifmtPD029q4sthRSQ I haven't ate here but im extremely disappointed because they did false advertising when i called and asked if they were a buffet and they said yes; only to be told they are NOT AN OPEN BUFFET after we drove here for 35 minutes. They give you a mixed platter and call it a buffet. Very unpleasant, deceitful and u professional.
