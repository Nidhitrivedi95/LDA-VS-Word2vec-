Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ Since we love vegetarian Indian food and we travelling through Pittsburgh decided to give this place a try. A big mistake. 

First the decor - it is straight out of the 60s!  The tables have plastic covers on them which are cheesy.

Second the place seems family run and hence service is slow. 

They have a buffet onsite but we decided to go a-la-carte.

Finally, the food was spicy (even when ordered mild) and tasteless. We ordered the Yellow Dal and Makni Paneer. Had it not been for the cucumber/tomato yogurt Raita we would not be able to digest those  dishes. The pooris were more like bhaturas, thick and heavy.
