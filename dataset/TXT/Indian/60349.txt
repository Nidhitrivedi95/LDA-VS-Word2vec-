ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Firstly, so annoyed with the restaurant, pre-ordered a meal which was then nearly an hour late. Driver was amusingly trying to get a tip after not reading the notes and delaying my food further by going to the wrong hotel and the food was cold so I had to microwave it. HOWEVER they are spared a 1 star review as the food was actually excellent, just get your stuff together with deliveries guys please!!
