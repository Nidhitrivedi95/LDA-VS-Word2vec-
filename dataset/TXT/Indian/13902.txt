bU6mVZSuO5EpvfUay87e8g I really like Kebabish Original. I go often simply because its across from my flat and the food is good, fairly priced and the service is also reasonable. I cant say that i have ever had a bad (or even average meal there). Its always really busy and lively and thats always a good sign. No corkage on the BYOB either !
