-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Was here for a lunch buffet. The spread is good, good variety in curries and desserts. The food is pretty good, but can be a touch better, being an Indian I guess I have higher expectations. But, I would go back. Very reasonable. 
One negative comment, a particular person who served us was pretty unhygienic, shabby and awkward. This is not a comment on the hygiene of the restaurant though. Staff was generally courteous. 
Best dishes: Mango Lassi, Garlic Naan, Paneer Tikka Masala, Karee Pakoda !! 
The Carrot Halwa, had a weird unpleasant taste.
