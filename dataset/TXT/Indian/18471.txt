Ehln9m65hoi5ylWCH2osdQ Food was ok. Have to say there are many other Indian fusion places that do Indian food better. The quality of the food seems to be lacking a bit (e.g. Chicken tikka masala, the meat was dark meat, the fish curry, the salmon seemed a bit off) This place tries to be a downtown hipster joint in Etobicoke. I think this place is trying to be a Vij's (Vancouver) but food quality has to increase if they ever want to get to that level.
