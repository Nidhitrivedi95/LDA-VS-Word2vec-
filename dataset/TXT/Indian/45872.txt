I can definitely say it made me love Indian food. Everything from the crusty garlic naan, to the curry, to the tandoori chicken wings. All of it was so good.
The service is pretty good and I loved the restaurant's interior. It felt very comfortable in there. The exterior on the other hand is a different story. Everyone knows this used to be a 1950's themed diner, but does it have to be broadcasted? Also, the Bollywood movies and music got really nerve-wracking after a while.
Although I did love it, I could already tell that there is indeed much better fare out there. I'm an Indian food amateur, but after I've tried some more Indian food, I'm sure I probably wouldn't ever go out of my way to this place again.
