t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Stopped by for lunch with a few coworkers to get additional opinions and to order something off the menu with some kick to the spice level. The other three (one of whom had never eaten Indian food, none of whom had been here before) ordered the lunch buffet, and I ordered the Chicken Madras (chicken cooked in Madras curry) at 8/10 level heat.

I was very pleased with the Chicken Madras. A nice blend of flavors - savory, spicy, a bit of sweetness - combined with a pleasingly spicy kick that complemented the flavors rather than overwhelming them. The naan (we had one basket of regular, one basket of garlic) was excellent as well, served warm, crispy, and chewy.

Everyone enjoyed their food, and the other fan of spicy foods also liked the bit of Chicken Madras she tried, finding it spicy-flavorful but not overpowering.

Service was prompt and courteous, and the overall experience went well.

Given my second experience here, I'm bumping my score up to a 4/5.
