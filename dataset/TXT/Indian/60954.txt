zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA Went there again after a long time after hearing that their lunch menu has become really impressive and I was quite pleased ! I had the maseladar lunch which consisted of butter chicken , butter nan, salad and basmati rice. The butter chicken was creamy, well made and delicious. It was quite a hearty meal. Will be back for lunch again some day.
