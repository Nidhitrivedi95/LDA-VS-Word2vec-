KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Let me start this by saying it's 4:52am currently, I haven't slept much, the need to visit the washroom (la throne) has kept me awake after eating one of Rick's beef burger with achari mayo. I became sick pretty much right after I consumed the to go burger I ordered. Why am I giving two stars instead of one is because of the concept of fusing your regular Indian food to American comfort food. It was essentially just a beef keema burger patty (beef mixed with traditional Indian spices) , with regular mayonnaise avec Indian pickle spices, and regular lettuce, tomato on a soft bun. It's what Normal people would make after we have kebab night and their is leftover mince, so we make a burger out of it. The place was pretty much empty once I walked in however the loud music was enough to distract the employee's not to greet me right away. For the price of each item listed on the menu it's not worth. It is however worth a visit once since not many restaurants are doing this sort of food. Having said that, if you were to really observe the menu, it's straight forward to make any of these dishes fraction of the cost. What you are paying for is the concept. I would not be going back because I prefer to have night where I am not holding onto my stomach from bad food.
