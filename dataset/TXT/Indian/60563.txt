zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Couple guys I work with found this place on Yelp so we went to check it out.  We may have come on a bad day being a Friday and they close from 12:30 to 1:30 to pray but we did make it in early enough.  At first was concerned because they were missing some spices so a few of the items we were thinking about were off the menu.  But we asked what type of chicken was his favorite and he said the Boti Chicken so we gave that a try.  we ended up getting the rice served along with the dish and ordered the Nan? (bread) as a side everything was really good the Boti has a little bite to it but not too much very good but do want to sample a few more dishes before deciding on a favorite.  I will keep you informed on my explorations in the future because we all decided this place needs to be on our regular lunch rotation.
