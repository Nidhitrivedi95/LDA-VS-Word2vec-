iJfS02AOptwkaWD-vOVRew I have only eaten here twice with some friends and family. I can say this though, the chicken vindaloo was amazing. I ordered it spicy the way god intended it; awesome! If you're a novice don't even try to order spicy though, you'll die. Also the chicken tikka masala was a little slice of heaven...
