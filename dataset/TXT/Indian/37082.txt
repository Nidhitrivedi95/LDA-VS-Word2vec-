o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I have never tried Indian food before and let me tell you it was AMAZING. We celebrated our 6 year wedding anniversary here and it was so fun. We got to meet the head chef and the desert was amazing as well! I was planning our next dinner here while i was relentlessly trying to finish everything on the table! We will be back soon!
