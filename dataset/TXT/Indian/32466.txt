LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Salem's is interesting.  It is a grocery store and cafeteria.  Styrofoam and plasticware.

The food is very good and the portions are huge.  If you are a big eater, you are going to be stuffed.  If you are a smaller eater, you will be taking half your meal with you.

Their tandoori chicken is amazing.  Their gyros are also good.
