LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Absolutely amazing experience.  The food and service leave nothing to be desired. My Masala dosa and my husband's cheese dosa were delicious!! The chutneys and sambhar were freshly prepared and just the perfect level of spiciness. Idlis were great too. The only item that was average was the gulab jamuns. Overall, best South Indian I have tried in the GTA to date.
