-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Interesting buffet.  Lots of chicken which is surprising for an Indian place.  The food was pretty tasty.  Usually Indian places are too bland for my tastes as they try to appeal to the masses.  Chutney's seems to hit a nice medium level.  

Unfortunately the food was cold.  I visited at noon and a lot of the dishes seemed to be full.  I don't know if the buffet setup is incorrect - not many lids and the Tandori was covered in tinfoil - or perhaps the food was prepared ahead of time.  The place is obviously still under renovation - you can tell by the pile of junk outside the front door - so maybe the buffet is still under renovation as well.

The service was friendly but when I ordered an iced tea, the waiter brought me pre-sweetened tea.  Granted I didn't specify so perhaps it's my fault - but it did take a while for them to bring me an unsweetened tea.

I think the buffet was a bit of a bust but the food was tasty enough that I would like to try the dinner menu.  I have high hopes.
