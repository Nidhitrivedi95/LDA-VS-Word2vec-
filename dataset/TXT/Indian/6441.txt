3q42_KwDXEwfXSvtohknkA Best Indian I've ever had in my ENTIRE life! I've been to many Indian places around the globe and none were as good as Indian Palace. They have wonderful staff, fluent in English and German, and they are very attentive to your needs. My husband and I always order the same thing: mango lakis, chicken curry, and mataar paneer-and of course the garlic naan bread! I get mine the highest spicy level (4) and it's perfect for me-but I like things spicy and hot! You can always make it hotter-that's what the waiter told me. We always over order and have to take ours home! We love this place and the atmosphere and we come here regularly!
