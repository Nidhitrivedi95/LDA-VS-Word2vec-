ezDMJGONUEy1DyGSJ3vUJw I love this place. It's great Pakistani food near my house. The chicken boti is really good and the naan is acceptable. Last night a few of my party said things were too spicy so if that's not your bag, have them knock down the spice a little for you. 

The service was great. We had a group of 6 and the man was accommodating and friendly. We had drinks all evening and he brought us food when it was ready. It was quick and tasty. 

If memory serves, they do not have alcohol but you may bring your own wine to share at your table (we've done that several times here).
