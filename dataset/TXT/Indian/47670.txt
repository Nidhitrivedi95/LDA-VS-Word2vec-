TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We ordered a bunch of Biryanis and Utappams. And a vegetarian Dinner plate. Food taste was good enough for the biryanis and dinner. Not so good for the other south indian dishes.But the most surprising thing was an " Automatic Gratuity" !!
We as customers can be suggested amounts for tips, but not charged automatically from the amount !!
for a bill of 138.5$ were charged an "automatic grauity" of 25$. Thats 18%.
