LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Possibly my favorite Dosa place in Mississauga. They have the largest variety of dosa options and the restaurant is always really busy. The chettinad dosa was my favorite, as it's the perfect level of spicy for me. I would recommend you try Madras Dosa in Etobicoke as well. Still debating what resto I like more.
