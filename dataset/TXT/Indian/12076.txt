auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ If you're craving Indian food, Taj Palace is a wonderful option. Food is great - very flavorful, lots of texture, smell and color. Plenty of menu options to suit different pallets. 

I love ordering the Mango/Strawberry Lassi. Yoghurt smoothie. Does not taste artificial, just creamy. 

I usually stick to my favorite entrees and each time I've dined here, my dishes have been consistently prepared. Love ordering the Garlic Naan bread, nothing compares to fresh Naan straight from oven. 

Service is friendly and with a genuine smile. I appreciate how the waitress will take time to explain dishes and suggest dishes you might not order. I tried some new suggestions tonight and loved it! Glad she suggested these to me. Thank you.

Restaurant is clean. Great music. Lovely atmosphere. Lots of people walked in shortly after we were seated and we never had to ask for water refills. The gentleman who refills is very sweet and helps answer any questions you might have on dishes or different sauces. Indian cuisine is still new to me but I love dining at ethnic restaurants. Love trying cuisines from different countries rather than eating hamburgers/pizzas. 

We had a wonderful evening, we will return.
