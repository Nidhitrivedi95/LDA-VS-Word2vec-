MmwKWBBrR0NF05hGBxnWjA I have to say I'm fairly impressed (for what it is).

I really enjoy their samosas, as well as their curries. I usually get the small curry bowl ($5 all in!), with rice, and two curries (I get the mixed veggies and chicken curry usually.) I'm a big eater, and it's usually enough (sometimes it's more than enough!)

They accept debit, and provide inexpensive and relatively healthy food on campus. They also provide nutritional information (http://vedatakeout.com/index.php?cmd=nutrition)

It's a 4 star campus servery, and a 3 star "real life" eatery.  (Atmosphere leaves much to be desired... I'd take the food elsewhere.)
