OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This is a wonderful eatery with delicious food and warm hospitality. It has become my go to destination for quality indian food during my Vegas trips. I am fortunate enough to also have tried the food at the eponymous eatery by the same team in Auckland ( New Zealand) and glad to see the team reestablish themselves so successfully across the globe in Vegas.
Don't forget to try the exquisite lamb sheek kebabs, sev dahi puri, vodka infused pani puri and ragda patties to name a few.
I will definitely be back here at every chance I get.
