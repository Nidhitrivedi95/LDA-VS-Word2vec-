DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA Went here yesterday for lunch.  It was ok.  If you like samosas they were good here.  Other than that I've had better Indian food.  They have plenty of vegetarian and vegan entrees though, so if you're vegan or have a friend who is then I would reccomend this place, but Tamba and Ghandi are better. The place is pretty small too so dont go with a big group.  Also it was full of white people (Im white too) but thats kind of a giveaway that its not as authentic as other places because I did not see one Indian eating there...
