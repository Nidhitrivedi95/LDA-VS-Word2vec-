He pointed over to a two seater and told me, "sit over there." The table was dirty. I sat at the table for 10 minutes until I had to wave down a server to take my order. Once my order was placed I was given crackers. After taking the first bite I realized little human hairs baked into the crackers. When I pointed out to the waiter that there were hairs in the crackers he proceeded to do his own investigation of the hairs at my table. No apologies. I should of left. It was late I was tired and hungry. The water was tap, no ice and in a dirty glass. Exactly one hour after I arrived I was still waiting to eat. I couldn't take it. I got up and left. This was a slow Wednesday night. Biggest disappointment. Disgusting place. And lazy people.
