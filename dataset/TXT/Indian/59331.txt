YZHOLWQ36dbDwI78pRmaTw I went here with my family for dinner. There was only one person at the front of the store which was fine because the place was empty. There were a few people who came in for take out.

We got beef samosas, chicken samosas, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, sada naan (plain naan), beef keema naan (you can choose the meat you want in it), garlic naan (it's not on the menu but they have it) and russ malai. For the three main dishes, we ordered it as mild and it was just the right amount of heat for me but some of my family members found it a bit too spicy. For a family of four, we finished everything but the chicken tikka masala (partly because it was too spicy and I think we enjoyed the other two main dishes more).

I enjoyed the dessert but I'm a dessert-aholic! The dessert has a distinct flavour that I can't put my finger on ... perhaps it has some floral notes.

I think I would come back here just because it's close to where I live.
