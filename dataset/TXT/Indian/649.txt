-D9NFU_SZpp5J7VCSsPp1Q We arrived promptly at 11:30. Our hostess/waitress seated us and took our drink order. She was friendly in a quiet manner. We watched them bring dishes out to stock the buffet until @11:40 when our waitress told us we could help us ourselves. They continued to bring out new dishes until @ noon. We made several trips to the buffet so there were new dishes to try each time we went back.

It's not the largest buffet but there were many choices and I really enjoyed most of the dishes. The chicken vindaloo was delicious; fairly mild curry w/garlic. It made me think of butter. The goat dish was fantastic; spicy and I particularly liked that I didn't find any bones in it. The naan was plentiful. I enjoyed the biryani, it was fluffy and tasty. The samasos were fragrant. The only dishes I was disappointed by were the chicken tikka and the rice pudding. The chicken was much saucier than I prefer. The pudding was thicker and not as sweet as I'm used to. That may be how they are supposed to be prepared, but I was not a fan.

We'll definitely go back, but next time we'll wait till at least 11:50 so they have time to prepare.
