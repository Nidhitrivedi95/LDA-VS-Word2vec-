u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw Decided to finally try this place after driving passed it everyday for a while. Today on the way home from work, my wife demanded we try it. I'm glad she did! It was delicious. I had the beef mishkaki with cassava fries and it was awesome. Full of flavour and it had bite. I felt like I was eating outside at a barbecue. It had that amazing smokey charcoal taste which I absolutely love. Dip the steak into the hot sauce... Perfect. Shout out to Zuli for the wonderful hospitality. We'll be back.
