LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw Never do delivery from this place. Seriously. First of all the ordering process is absurd; I even called back after ten minutes after placing my initial order as the person taking my order did not even ask for my hotel room number or contact number. I feel as though they need to increase the wait staff as they always seem overwhelmed. The food is okay, but this is my second time ordering and ecah time I ask for spice level very spicy and I get just over moderate. After having waited over one hour for my current order I called back to inquire as to the status and the receptionist said "we have been busy that's why it's late" so poor service is a total deal breaker for me. Not my problem you're understaffed.
