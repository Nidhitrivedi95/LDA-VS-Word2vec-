DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew One of my favorite restaurants in town. The service is incredible and the food is insane! 

We celebrated a friends birthday and all 16 of us were treated well and everyone loved the food. If recommend mixing it up and trying a bunch of appetizers then rock out with any of the curries, you just can't go wrong
