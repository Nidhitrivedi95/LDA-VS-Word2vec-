J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I've been to the lunch buffet twice, and the food has been consistently good.  I appreciate the fact that they make some entrees actually spicy and some mild to appeal to a broader audience, and that their food is not overly salty.  There are enough items for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.  My favourite was the saag paneer, which was fresh with good texture. Naan was good as well.

Nice dessert selection with traditional items (gulab jamun was not too sweet!), and 4 ice cream flavours to choose from.
Butter chicken was way too sweet for me.  I strongly dislike it.  Why add so much sugar to chicken?

Overall, it was good fresh food and good value for the price.  We will return after we recover from this food coma.
