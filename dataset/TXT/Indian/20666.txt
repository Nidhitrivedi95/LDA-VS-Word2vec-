The two of us ordered pani puri and veggie thali. I'm not an expert of Indian food, but I've had my fair share of Indian food in little India and Brampton. Personally I think this place has the best thali in downtown. 

This place was recommended by an Indian foodie friend, which also proofs something. 

People working here were so friendly and attentive. They didn't talk too much but were observant. As soon as they saw us sharing the thali, they brought individual paper plates for us. 

Will definitely come back here.
