OOBSQF72cl3jBBpLQWhyzw A combination of South Indian/Sri Lankan flavours. A restaurant that just opened up around the end of May/ June I wanted to try this food again to see what was new and to try some more dishes. There's definitely more spicy and flavourful items on the menu- with appetizers of crab cakes, sizzling meat dishes, chennai poutine (fries with curry/meat/paneer). This seems to be a new addition. The three of the appetizers we tried were good and flavourful! The shrimp fry (spicy shell-on shrimp) was good. 

For vegetarians, the 'mock'soy protein chicken seems pretty good! Amazing flavour and texture--- without the meat.

MUST TRY: shrimp masala, crab cake, kothu roti
UPDATE: Dosa is back on the menu!!!

We also tried some of the egg parotta which was nice and flaky. It came with curry sauce.  Maybe a yogurt sauce  would be good too to add there.

In terms of main dishes, the chicken Briyani is delicious and spicy! With a nice chicken piece, egg and a yogurt sauce. 

The dessert is good- mango milkshake and offers an assortment of cake, I like the dulce de leche cheesecake- it's a lighter airy cheesecake.

Service and ambience- amazing service from the waitstaff, polite attentive. Seems good for vegetarian and nonvegetarian food.  This place is clean, nicely decorated and fancy. We even got hot towels before the food! 

I'm impressed by this restaurant will come here again for my South Indian/ Sri Lankan food fix!
