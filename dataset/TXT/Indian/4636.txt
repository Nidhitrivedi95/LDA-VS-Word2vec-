They managed to accommodate our party of six with an hour's notice and we had a great meal. I think between all of us we shared probably 15-18 different dishes easily and nearly all of them were very good. Service was efficient but friendly.

Fish pakora, dal, aloo gobi, palak paneer, okra, garlic naan all delicious. Chicken curry dishes are delicious, anything but dull.

Great service and the price was a good value overall. Six of us stuffed ourselves full of delicious food and each had a Kingfisher for about £115.
