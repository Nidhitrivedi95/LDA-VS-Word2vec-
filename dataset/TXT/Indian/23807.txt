gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This place is really awesome. I've been coming here for years but I think it only recently got better. Buffet is excellent. All the food is kept warm (really warm, not just lukewarm like so many buffets) and they have a good variety of veg and non-veg foods. There are usually a couple of dessert options, and a small salad bar, as well. They give naan for free, which is nice. The wait-staff is always very friendly and attentive, even during the busy lunch hour. The food is delicious. I've never had anything there which I didn't like. Very flavorful, and the spice level isn't so weak like most Indian restaurants who try to cater to the American palate. Highly recommended.
