SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A so we have a choice of mc donald amd india oven...so we tried going indian food...this is the worst indian restaurant in las vegas( maybe the whole US)..the food was dirty,dry and taste awful...its a shame its in the strip...for 11 bucks each..i could have been happy to eat a bigmac!!! Ive never been disgusted in a place like this...the 5.99 chinese buffet are more decent ...ill never eat here again in my lifetime!! I feel robbed!!!
