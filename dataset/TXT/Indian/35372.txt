muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw So I am a Pakistani-American who enjoys eating out. Until my encounter with Tahoora, I was reluctant to spend my money and time frequenting Indian/Pakistani restaurants because the food was never made to order and the restaurateur relied upon a few basic sauces (curries) to make all of the items on the menu. Why bother when I can cook better at home, right? Well, then I was invited to a lunch at Tahoora by a business associate. I went for the meeting and left with the food! The food was amazingly fresh, authentic, and made to order. Since then, I have used the folks at Tahoora restaurant to cater small and larger gatherings. And in each instance, the food and service were beyond 5 stars. Seriously, I don't know if these guys can make a bad meal. In addition, my family and I like to attend the Tahoora Sunday buffet. It's reliably amazing week in week out. I have lived on both coasts, tried so many Inian/Pakistani restaurants and I can honestly tell you, Tahoora is a rare and precious gem found here in the Valley of the Sun. You don't want to miss an opportunity to dine here!
