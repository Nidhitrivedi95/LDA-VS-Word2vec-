JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg Fairly solid spot.  In search of a new Indian Restuarant after my move to Yonge and Sheppard area.  I have ordered the Daal (huge Daal fan!) about 3-4 times to go.  Also have eaten the butter chicken, and the chicken Vindaloo.  Not bad.  Not the absolute best Indian in Toronto, but one of the better Indian restaurants from what I see... Real Indian people who look like they know whats up seem to frequent here, so how bad can it be?!
