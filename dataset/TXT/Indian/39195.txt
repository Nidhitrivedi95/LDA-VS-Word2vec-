oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw I only give this restaurant two stars for the atmosphere/ambiance. We sat on the patio on a beautiful Friday evening. Nice flowers, music and "water feature." The service was terrible. We almost died of thirst waiting for our drink order. I ordered one of the entree specials and it was flavorless! Three out of the four of us were not impressed with our entrees. Getting the bill was like pulling teeth. Maybe it was just a fluke bad night, but our first visit was not good. I have no desire to return!
