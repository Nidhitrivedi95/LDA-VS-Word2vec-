c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A I believe this is the most authentic be gali food in toronto the community are majority bengali so it makes you feel like you are in Bangladesh. We had tehari and naam tehqru is like a spicy beef dish really good and tasty and the mago lassi is a little sweet and sour and is about ley delicious they do give quite a big portion if you have more people it becomes more enjoyable
