Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA I've been here for brunch and it was great- good menu, good mimosas and good service so myself and a couple friends decided to try it out for food and drinks on Saturday night. Never again!
We were walk ins so didn't have a reservation, but there were plenty tables available when we got there. We sat down at one, took our coats off, chatted for 5 minutes then were asked to move as we didn't have a reservation for a table (which is fair enough). We asked for the next available table for 3 and ordered drinks- half an hour later- empty tables are still there, so we asked again and were told they weren't aware we were waiting for a table! About 15 minutes later, more walk ins appeared and were seated before us so we asked again and again were told they weren't aware we were waiting for a table and the wait would be 45 mins-an hour! We eventually were seated at a makeshift broken table in the middle of the floor, in the middle of a bachelor party. The food when we eventually got it was good and we all enjoyed it. I asked for mine to be wrapped up to go as I didn't finish it all, paid the bill then asked if my food was ready- only to be told it had been thrown out as they didn't realize I wanted it wrapped up to go!

The menu is great at The Bristol, its a nice spot and the food is delicious, I'll be back for a quiet brunch but the service and organization was pretty disappointing for dinner.
