DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I stopped by here for dinner after work. Once in a while, I would dine alone for my 'quiet time.' It was my first time here, I noticed the outside looked simple and when I walked in, I was 'Wowed' by the ambiance, it was very modern and beautiful. 

The hostess wanted to seat me at a table and I requested a booth. She wasn't happy and says something like 'just for 1 person..?!!' As I walked closer I noticed the booths were quite big and sits 4 people. I did felt bad that I asked for a booth but I never had a problem asking for a booth before in other places. 

Anyways, I asked if they had Goat curry, she said they don't. Most Indian restaurants would cook it even though not listed on the menu. But that's ok. I was going to get Korma with Lamb. She recommended Rogan Josh.

The food came out in 15 mins, not too bad on the wait. The dish came with a small bowl of rice and they were ok. I have had better. I thought it was pricey being $16 the portion was small compared to other restaurants. I do really like Rose Lassi.

The restaurant were really nice but the restrooms needs work, some nooks and corners looked run down and the latch to the door almost didn't open for me. For a moment, I thought I was locked in LOL!

The manager checked up on me and is very nice. I had a quick dinner like 30 mins and left.
