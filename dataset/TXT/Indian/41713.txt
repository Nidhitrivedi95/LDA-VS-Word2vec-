q7fAiwQVfCxLM3Uvk2oslg Do not judge a book by its cover! When you walk in here if definitely looks a bit run down I won't lie to you BUT the food is worth it. Most of the meals are around 6.75 and the portion sizes are huge. I've only tried the chicken and shrimp fried rice and tandoori chicken but this place always has people coming in and out picking up food. I've never had any issues communicating with the young man or woman behind the counter their English was fine. They even make recommendations and let me know what's popular. I just love he flavour profiles. The fried rice has bits of seasoned chicken and shrimp, bean sprouts peppers, chillies, carrots, broccoli and some kind of spice blend. It's just a little party in your mouth and at 6.75 what do you have to lose?
