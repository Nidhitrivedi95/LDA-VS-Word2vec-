Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw Cheap Indian/Himalayan in the city.

Food: sub-okay
Price: value
Ambiance/Service: poor

For 1, ordered (~$15)
- 1 lunch buffet

Was in the library next-door, when I decided to drop in for lunch at this local restaurant.

For the price, I was not expecting much, but I was not happy with what I got. The restaurant was hot with no AC and not very clean. The food was hot, but was not freshly made. One easy point was that the deserts (jamoon) were soaked in syrup, with an odd texture. This pointed towards 2+ days of storage.

The bread, naan, and other curries were alright. There were around 5 options for curries, 2 deserts, salad, naan, and more. Service was sub-par. I had to ask for a glass of water, etc.. Staff were not attentive. Overall, not much to note other than the food was not very fresh.

If you're in the area and real hungry, go for it once. Otherwise, make the short trip down to King for lunch.
