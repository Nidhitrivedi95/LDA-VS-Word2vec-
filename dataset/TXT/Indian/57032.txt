xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I wish I would have taken a picture of my fry bread taco, it looked and tasted delicious! The restaurant is not much to look at from the outside and the inside is very plain. We didn't dine in so I didn't get a good luck at the set up.  The cashier is also the person who takes the order and she was very helpful and friendly, since it had been my first visit there.  I knew I wanted cheese and beans, but I also added the ground beef. The food was hot, the fry bread was light, and fluffy.  The beans, cheese and beef were seasoned just right, it melted in my mouth.  Even though the portion is large, I wanted more. My brother ordered the green chili and that would be my only regret.  I will be back for the green chili, it has a nice little kick to it and is amazing.  I will be going back soon.
