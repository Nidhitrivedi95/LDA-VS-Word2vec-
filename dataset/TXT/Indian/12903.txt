B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog It's a great place to have hsuan food in the heart of Montreal. The food is real good, very much adapted to the non-Indian palate while still feeling fresh and flavorful for the Indian palate. It's got parking nearby which helps a lot and the servers are very kind. We got the keema naan (great! Made with fermented dough, light and fluffy), chicken kadhai - it was ok, slightly overlooked chicken, but just only slightly and it didn't take away the taste.

The star was the mango chutney for me, which came along with the papad in the beginning of the meal and we made sure it stayed on the table for the rest of it as well. The shahi paneer was delicate and not op overpoweringly sweet or heavy. Gulab jamun wasn't true authentic, one could sense the French influence on the recipe, but it worked decently well
