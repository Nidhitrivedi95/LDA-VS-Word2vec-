5PGBRXTNTUHmh24puxGtSg I've been here twice now. First time the service was pretty slow but they redeemed themselves the second time I went. 

The atmosphere is great if you enjoy Bollywood songs. 

The interior has been done tastefully, on the walls you'll see famous movie quotes, as well as screen shots of Bollywood stars.

The food is served in funky colourful bowls but lacks spice. If you like your food even with medium spice, do mention this to the waiter.  

All in all this is a nice place to bring friends and family :-)
