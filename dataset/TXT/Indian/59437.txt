z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Reasons I will never go to this restaurant again:

-Out of all the empty tables, the waiter (a creepy, older man) sat me at the table against a wall right next to the door, pretty much isolated and alone.

-The waiter tried to find out where I was from (my ethnicity), where I lived, whether I was working that day and whether I was on my lunch break, whether I was married, and whether I lived alone or with my parents. 

-When I was getting food from the lunch buffet, my waiter would pop up from behind me and point to the last dish I got and say "This, very good."

-When the waiter had nothing to do at the moment, he'd stand against the wall across the room and just stare at me. 

I felt extremely uncomfortable there, and the buffet was not worth its price.
