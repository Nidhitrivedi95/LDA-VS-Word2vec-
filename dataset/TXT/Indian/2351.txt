_Q0JeKDrzldpBUgswhlLyA I was in the area, hankering for some samosas, and decided to pick up some spicy ones!  Samosas were already ready, on trays, not fresh outta the fryer like last time.  :(  

On my last visit, I did ask for spicy, but they weren't ready, and I was in a rush, so I never got them.

Comparing the regular vs. the spicy ones, I preferred the regular samosas.  Then again, the regular ones were fresh, fresh, FRESH, so that probably made a difference.  The spicy ones had a bit of a kick and had mint leaves in the potato filling, probably some turmeric on the wrapping.  Samosa was not overly greasy, but good.

Aside from samosas, I haven't had anything else here, but apparently the dhoklas are supposed to be good?

Note:  Take-out ONLY!
