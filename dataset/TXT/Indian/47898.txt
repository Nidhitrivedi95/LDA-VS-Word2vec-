TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This experience has virgin all over it.  The first time for real indian food. The first time at India Palace.  I can say that the it was extremely pleasant. The food was very good. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (medium spice). There was no hint of HOT, but the chicken was smokey and the sauce was delicious.  My husband ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh (medium spice). Again, not HOT, but delicious. We ordered the Aloo Tikki, a side of Peas Pulao and Garlic Naan.  We left no crumbs behind.  I will add, the hotest food I had that night was one of the three suaces that came with the flat bread.

The atmosphere was just right for my husband and I out for date night.  They had recently (within the last two years) renovated the place and it was nice. The neighborhood is in an older part of town, but close enough to the strip.

Although I have nothing to compare this too, I felt the need to express our satisfaction and desire to try the cuisine again and again.
