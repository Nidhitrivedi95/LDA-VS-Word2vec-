tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g Best Indian food in Cleveland. We hired this restaurant to cater our Indian wedding in Cleveland, and they exceeded our expectations. We were concerned about having Indian food catered, as any food served on a large scale can be risky; however, this was not a problem with this restaurant. Our guests were raving about the food the entire night, and continued to mention how delicious the food was the next day. My husband, who is Indian, tried a few different Indian restaurants in Cleveland, and his whole family concluded that not one compared to Cuisine of India. The owner was so accommodating, helpful, and friendly, not to mention he offers the most delicious Indian food that we will eat for years to come. We highly recommend this restaurant, and already gave out the information to our many wedding guests who asked where the food came from. Thank you!
