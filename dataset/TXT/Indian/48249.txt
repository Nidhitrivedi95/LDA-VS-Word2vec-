ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA We moved here from the Bay Area 4 years ago and were unsure if we'd be able to get our staple Asian cuisines. Although we can't get Burmese, this place is a frequent destination as the owners are extremely kind, and honestly the best Chicken Tikka Masala we've had anywhere in the US (at least from what we've compared in LA, SF, San Jose, Seattle, New York, and DC)

We typically get Samosas, garlic naan, and a Chicken Saag with our two orders of tikka masala. Always consistent, and always amazing.
