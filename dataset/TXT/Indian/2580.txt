02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I cooked dinner at home the last four nights in a row... this may be a record for me.  No joke!  We eat out way too much.  But, as a reward for all of my cooking as of late, my husband took me out to dinner tonight.

I suggested we try Indian Delhi Palace, and he agreed!

We walked in and were immediately greeted by Nick, Mr. Delhi Palace's son.  Nick is a college student with one hell of a sense of humor.  The banter between him and Jared made for one comical meal.  

Here's what we ate:
-Garlic Naan
-Peas Pulaou (Basmati Rice cooked with Peas)
-Fresh Okra with Sliced Onions, gentle Herbs and mild Spices
-Bengan Bhartha (Eggplant roasted in a delightful pulp, seasoned with Gentle Herbs and Mild Spices)
-Shrimp Tikka Masala
-Kheer (Basmati Rice Pudding sprinkled with almonds and Pistachio)

Everything was extremely tasty, especially the okra and shrimp dishes.  I normally do not like dishes that have onion in them, but pretty much everything we had contained a lot of it.  And actually, I still liked it!

The serving sizes were large, so we took home leftovers.  The price was a bit steep ($60 out the door), but we really enjoyed it.  I think this will be my new "go-to" place for Indian food, and my new "go-to" place for dinner when I pick up friends and family at the airport around dinner time.

As a side note, the Indian Delhi Palace building also has a large banquet room upstairs that Nick showed us upon our inquiry... it has a capacity of 250 and it's really nice.  Future Yelp event potential, perhaps?  We'll see about that.
