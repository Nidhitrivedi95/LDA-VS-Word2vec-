LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Went for Sunday lunch with my family.  It was our first time having South Indian food. Had the Sambhar vada and idly for apps. Reallly good. Then we had our dosas. I got the mysore paper dosa with aloo masala. It was hugeee and I preferred the crispy texture and spicy flavour of the dosa compared to the regular dosas my family had. 

Service was great. Place was clean. Decor was great. All in all will be a repeat customer.
