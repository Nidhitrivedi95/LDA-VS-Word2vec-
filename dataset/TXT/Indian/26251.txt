IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA For someone who is Nepali it is a traditional food .. Really nice Nepali/ Indian restaurant in vegas. must go place.. I came with my family and had lunch buffet for only $9.95 . A variety of wide selection to chose from. Customer service is great. The server and owner both are really welcoming. They said it is a new place , recently opened , clean .. Less greasier food and healthier than most indian food cause it has twist of NEPALI food..GO GO GO !! You will know by yourself.
