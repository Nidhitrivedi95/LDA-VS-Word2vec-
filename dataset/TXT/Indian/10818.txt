Plenty of space but doesn't feel clean, hardly any decorations, and not a place I would come with a group to hand out. Waiter wasn't 100% certain about the menu or Indian food. He needed to keep running to the back to ask the chef. I didn't have any tough questions - does this come with rice? Which dish is tomato based? I had forgotten the name. The buffet had very few options and the food looked like it had been out for awhile so we ordered off the menu. Food was pretty good so we left full but next time I may order take out. Garlic naan was delicious as was the chicken tikka masala but the shrimp tandoori was deep fried with the shell on and all veggies were super dry and burnt.
