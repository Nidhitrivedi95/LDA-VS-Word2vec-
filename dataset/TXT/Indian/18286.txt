EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Had the Briyani and the chicken tikka and beef boti and it  was absolutely delicious! The quantity was enough for us to eat till we were full. Sanjana, our server was very pleasant and came to our table often to check if we needed anything.
Overall a good experience of Indian/Pakistani food. I would highly recommend
