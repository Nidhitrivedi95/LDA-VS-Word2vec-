t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg My girlfriends and I go out once a week to different restaurants and we decided to give this place a shot. 
I must say I really enjoyed it. It wasn't too busy so we were seated immediately. The food was delicious and the portion sizes were sizable. I was able to take some home which was great! 
The dinners do not come with naan which was surprising so I ordered garlic and cheese naan for the table and I was MORE than happy to pay extra, it was wonderful!
Give this place a try, youll enjoy it.
