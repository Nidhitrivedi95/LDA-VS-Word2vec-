OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Food tasted good but that just doesn't help me go beyond one star. 

Absolutely horrible service and attitude. A very small order took forever to arrive. Asking an extra naan in the middle of the meal could not make it to the table even for another 20 min. But the time we actually finished. 

Asking the server for other status would give a blunt answer "it's gonna take whatever it takes". The server  didn't even bother to pause and respond. He was handling just walking. Not really crowdy so won't give him credit being too busy etc. 

At one point he actually mentioned that go and eat somewhere for faster service. 

We asked for onions that we always ask and get complimentary in any Indian restaurant. This guy said sure when we asked for it and got a full salad plate instead saying we charge for it. 

The another server sort of sensed this all and tried to help out. But it was quite late by that time. 


Please stay away from this place. Don't waste your money to wait for something that will take forever to arrive.
