xhPdBbduivnHYTnoM0K1Bg Food was very good - tried a variety, including a thali.  The "easy on the spice" folks were happy with their bland food, and the "Bring it on" spice person was also happy.  So.. the food would get 4-5 stars.

The service is beyond mediocre.  The servers ignored us when we sat down, barely engaged when they took our order.  We were ignored most of the time - received water only when we asked for it, no chutneys with breads, certainly no check to make sure everything was ok, etc.  We could not even get a server to pay attention when we were trying to pay our bill and leave.  It's really unfortunate ... because if the service was on a par with the food, we would be going back!
