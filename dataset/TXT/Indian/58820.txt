ypvDRtvJV3CVJcmj4xDYVw Took a chance while trying to find a veggie Indian restaurant on the strip.  It started off well, the service was friendly but a tad inattentive as the night wore on.  The dinner buffet was tasty but the dessert selection left much to be desired.  Overall, a decent experience but not sure will be back again anytime soon.
