ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw Got the half tandoori chicken with rice to-go. Started eating an hour later and the chicken was still hot. The chicken was very flavorful and spicy. However the rice was very bland, just plain rice. 

I'd like to come back and try the chicken biryani or the curries I saw people there having.
