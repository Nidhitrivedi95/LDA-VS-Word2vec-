zJRJX2-xnxHCUXA5WbBYPA Four stars for the food and minus one star for the customer service. I have been here for lunch with my colleagues and all they serve for lunch is the thali; vegetarian or non-vegetarian. I've had both and their preparation is good. Ample amount of vegetable and meat servings for the price you would pay. The place is clean. Now what I don't like is the customer service. On a couple of occasions, food came out on our plate right from the fridge. Just plain cold! Some of the items were heated for maybe like 30 seconds, so it was mildly warm.
