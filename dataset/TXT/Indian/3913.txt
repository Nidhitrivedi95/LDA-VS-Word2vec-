0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw My boyfriend and I love coming here! Everyone is always nice and friendly and accommodating, plus the food is great. Buffet style is really nice and fresh, plus you can always count on a fresh warm basket of naan at your table. Overall really good authentic Indian food with great staff.
