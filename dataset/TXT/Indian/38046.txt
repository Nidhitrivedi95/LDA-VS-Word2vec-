ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Hands down the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Their Tikka Masala is incredible and everything I've tried there is equally delicious.  Their super knowledgeable and caring staff have made every visit (Im a long time Vegas local) a real joy. Their large selection of regional Indian specialties and vegetarian dishes is both extensive and creative. 

The lunch buffet is of just as high quality as the dinner menu to the extent that it almost seems a shame to call it a 'buffet' by the standard Las Vegas definition. The location is also great- smack in the middle of town 5 mins from the LV Strip, from the airport and also from the Convention Center. 

The owner Mr. Majid is also a tremendous philanthropist and supports numerous community organizations and world causes through hosting benefit dinners and community events at his restaurant. 

Whether you're a giant fan of Indian fare or just into trying new things, this place is a must - visit for locals and visitors alike.
