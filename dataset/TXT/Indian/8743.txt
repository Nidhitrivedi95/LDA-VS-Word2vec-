I had the butter chicken, and it was just as good as most places I go to. Again, wasn't terrible, but very mediocre for a restaurant that is on the more expensive end of things.
Service was also poor. Mixed up orders, and brought the entrees on first and then the Naans about 5+ minutes after, which is never good. 
Would think of other restaurants to go to first before going back to Aroma.
