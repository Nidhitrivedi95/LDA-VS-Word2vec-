IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw I stumbled across this quaint restaurant in Thornhill after hearing good reviews. 

We walked in after the main lunch hours and the restutant had space for three. The buffet area was a nice three meter stretch alongside the wall. We ordered mango lassis, and instead of sweet mango lassi as I expected, it was fairly thick and a nice yogurt type of sour taste. It was a pleasant drink to show the authenticity of the restaurant.

The buffet dishes were flavourful for the most part. The goat curry, beef curry, and eggplant marsala were all delicious. As well, the naan served with the buffet was extremely delicious and complimented the flavours of the meal.
