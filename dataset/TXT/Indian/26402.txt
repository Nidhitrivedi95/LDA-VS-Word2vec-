ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg What a great find! I was a bit daunted at first when I saw the three $ signs on Yelp but I thought I'd try it out anyway.. and I'm glad I did!

My colleagues and I arrived around 8:15 pm. The weather was so great we decided to sit outside - consequently, I didn't really look around too much inside.. it looked pretty upscale and nice from what I saw though!. The host walked us out to a table and we got settled.

For appetizers, we ordered the cauliflower dish and the samosas. Both arrived fairly quickly and were really good. The cauliflower could have used a little less sauce though.. was bordering on overpowering.

That is where the gripes end! For our main courses, we ordered the Lamb Kozhambu, Lamb Chops and the Cod dish with Tandoori Rotis and rice. All three dishes were REALLY good. The lamb chops in particular were outstanding! I highly recommend you try them!

Since we were enjoying our meals so much, we decided to order dessert as well. I ordered the Gajar Halwa - Rabri combination dish (name escapes me). My colleagues god the Three Excuses and Hedonism. All three desserts were really really good and we polished it all off.

I think we have discovered a bi-weekly Indian restaurant in Charlotte and will be sure to return. You should check it out, and be sure to try the Lamb Chops!
