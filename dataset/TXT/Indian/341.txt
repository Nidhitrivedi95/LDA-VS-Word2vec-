-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g After hearing there was some atmosphere improvements over the last place in this location I was disappointed to see the McDonald's style tile floor still there, and the booths were quite retro and old looking, but not in a good way.  My server was not Indian and had trouble with the menu names, which is a rare occurrence for an Indian restaurant.  My spirits turned around when I saw some modest prices on the menu, especially vegetable entrees.
  
However when they came out, the portions were noticeably smaller than what I normally receive.  They used the same or similar serving dishes, but the amount of potatoes, peas, and then chickpeas in the other were just not very full.  To make things worse, they entrees were nowhere near the correct spice level (way too mild) to the point where I wondered if they confused my order with someone else's.  Bread was tasty though.
