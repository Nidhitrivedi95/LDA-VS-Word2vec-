auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I have to admit I was hesitant to try Indian food with their bold spices and rich flavors but now I could kick myself for waiting sooo long. This is now my second trip to Taj Palace for their lunch buffet and I'm in love! All their dishes are rich in flavor and oh so good. I have not tried any other places in town so I have nothing to compare to but at this rate who cares, I love having them so close to my house. My first visit there I fell in love with a carrot pudding with it's sweet texture and shredded bits of carrot, it is perfection on my spoon. So I was disappointed that they didn't have it out this time when I came in since I had been craving it for 2 weeks. When the waiter came by to see how our meals were I sadly told him how much I loved their carrot dish and how much I'd been craving it. He smiled and said yes it is good isn't it and walked away. After devouring all their other yummy vegetarian dishes plus the oh so scrumptious, piping hot naan bread, I almost choked back my mouth of food in surprise to see the waiter carrying out a bowl full of my carrot dish to the table!!! I couldn't believe how awesome and attentive he was. That's what I call service ;D at that point I had already overeaten and could not take more than 2 bites so I kindly asked for a take home box ashamed to waste such perfection. 
I'm glad my taste buds have finally matured to try the wonderful new cultural flavors I've introduced them too. LOL 
I can't wait to go back and I recommend this place to everyone I know!!!!
