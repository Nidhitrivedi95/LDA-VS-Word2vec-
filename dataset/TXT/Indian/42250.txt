Qlebt777MOvHmu7p7QiM_Q The restaurant is relatively large, but with few customers the two times I dropped by. The first time I came was for dinner; there were no customers inside (it was roughly around 6pm on a weekday) so my friend and I decided to eat somewhere else. The second time, I went with 5 others for lunch, there were about 3-4 other tables occupied. The food was okay nothing spectacular but for the price I guess there's no harm in trying. I would have given it a 4-star, but they didn't bother restocking the meat dishes that ran out. They did however restock the vegetarian dishes.

There weren't many meat dishes, which was fine; however when my group arrived there was only a bit of goat curry and some sort of grilled chicken I believe. We took a bit and there was pretty much nothing left. During the whole seating they did not bring out more even though it was clearly almost empty (there was 1 piece of chicken left and for the goat curry it was mostly just the curry with no meat left inside). I would return if someone wanted to go, but I wouldn't have it as my first pick.
