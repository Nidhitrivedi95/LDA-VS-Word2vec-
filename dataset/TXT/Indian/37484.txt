OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Owners were super friendly and fun. We didn't have reservations and they were able to find spot for us, which we really appreciated. The place itself is cute - love the booths (sit on the floor), decor, etc. I ordered the thali. I thought the price was super reasonable. Naan was awesome, but the rest was just ok. I've had better Indian food elsewhere, so wouldn't go back. Also, if you order anything on a sizzling plate (Chicken Tikka for example) - DO NOT TOUCH IT! We weren't adequately warned and I accidentally touched the handle.. had to go to the bathroom to run my hands under cold water for a bit.
