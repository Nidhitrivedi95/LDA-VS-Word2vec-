VvZnozdEpjw0e7Dg-kKIxg My husband and I are visiting from LA and decided to eat close to our hotel tonight instead of going into Montreal as we did last night. I used to work in an Indian restaurant in college and ate homemade, family style Indian food three times per week so I was hoping for authentic flavor and style, which is what I found here.

It is important to note that this restaurant is a Muslim Indian restaurant, which means no alcohol and no pork. No problem. My husband and I decided to go for a 2-person meal which included an appetizer, two entrees, rice, naan and coffee/tea. For the appetizer, we each received a vegetable samosa and pakora. As expected, three condiments arrived at the same time which included mint chutney, raita, and sliced carrots in a vinegar dressing. Our plates also had a small green salad, which added to the color and helped clear the palate. 

Our entrees included chicken tandoori, which was cooked perfectly and had delicious seasoning. We also had a lamb curry, which was not spicy but very flavorful. The rice was cooked well and the naan was perfect. We ate a lot and will still have a full meal for each of us tomorrow. 

We chose the chai tea, which was served after our meal. They brought it in a pot, which turned out to be four servings total. It was a nice touch that they had dropped a cardamom pod in each of our teacups.

The server was attentive and the atmosphere was satisfactory. We both felt very satisfied after this meal and felt like it was a good value.
