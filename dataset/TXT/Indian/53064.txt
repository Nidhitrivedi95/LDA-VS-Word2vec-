vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg Food was excellent - the Saag was the freshest I have ever had!  The ambiance was a little lacking including the smear of dried food on my menu.  Overall I was happy with the experience but I am entering the receipt in my accounting software just now and noticing that they included a tip themselves ($9.30) plus I added a $12 tip.  That's hefty.  Would I go back?  Maybe if I had another Groupon.  I really wanted to like them so I guess I would try again.
