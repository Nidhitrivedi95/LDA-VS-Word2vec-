jEeJJdDhb8yOk9a-ggEhOw I'm giving them 5 stars because of the 1 star that some disgruntled desi connoisseur gave them. They're more of a 4, but I really liked my meal so I think that they deserve a good rating.

Alright, the breakdown: A modest buffet of all the classics for $10.95 at lunch time. personally I like to eat later than at noon, and having the lunch buffet open till 4pm is a nice treat for me. I get to have a buffet "dunch (dinner-lunch)" at my own pace.

Now, I like a buffet. Mmmmmmm, buffet... With freshly made naan brought to your table by friendly staff and with many different full-flavoured curries to dip them in, this was a very nice meal. My friend and I left stuffed to the brim on their awesome and tender rogan josh. The butter chicken was great as well and my personal favourite, the saag bhaji, didn't disappoint. 

All in all, it was a buffet of well-spiced curries that made me smile. I recommend going here if you're in the area and like to pig out.
