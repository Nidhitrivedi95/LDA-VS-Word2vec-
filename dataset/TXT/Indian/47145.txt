Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Indian Delight is probably the third best Indian food I've had in Cleveland. That's pretty good, because there is a lot of really mediocre Indian around here. 

There have been several complaints about the decor, but I've pretty much resigned myself to bad decor for Indian restaurants in Cleveland. And really? I didn't come here to eat the curtains. 

The garlic naan was the best naan I've had in the states, and the rogan josh was delicious. Josh is always a real test of quality, because goat can be tough and, uh, goaty. This was tender and flavorful without tasting overly gamey.

Overall, a good, solid dining experience, and I will be back.
