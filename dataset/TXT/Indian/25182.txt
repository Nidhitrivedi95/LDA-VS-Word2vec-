hDaookbWWFR3bEm-1_orrw Yes! So happy to find Indian food in the southwest part of the valley! Went here for the lunch buffet - good selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. My favorite was the chicken tikka masala - really flavorful and tender - I was able to cut through it with a fork. 
I'll definitely be back!
