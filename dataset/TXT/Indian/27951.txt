IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Had lunch here after the fiasco and disappointment at the so-called "Persian" place Haji Baba.  Tasty Kabob is by far better than Haji Baba; it has a nice atmosphere and very good service.  This is an actual authentic Persian restaurant unlike Haji Baba; Haji Baba is an Arab grocery store with a side open as "restaurant".  

I had the Kubideh and Ash; Ash soup was excellent and Kubedih was good.  The rice was also good but not great and I think it can be better. 

Overall, my experience was great and will return here again for Persian food.
