82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA One of my preferred Indian restaurants in Montreal. I recommend getting Naan with a variety of curries to share among the table. Mix it up: lamb, beef, chicken, shrimp. Service is consistently strong. I've only been there at dinner, but I know it's popular for the lunch buffet too.
