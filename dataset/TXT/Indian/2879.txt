0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw New to working in Goodyear, I'm still experimenting with lunch spots. This place had come recommended and Yelp supported it, so I decided to check it out. I'm generally skeptical about buffets and, ordinarily, would try to go earlier to ensure the best odds of fresh food. I wound up hitting India Garden closer to 1PM and everything on the buffet looked fresh and delicious. I sampled it all and there was not a single item I didn't like. The buffet ($9.99) with my drink and a tip, totaled $16.15. While a little on the steep side for what I'd like to pay for lunch, I can say I definitely feel like I got value for my money and I look forward to future visits.
