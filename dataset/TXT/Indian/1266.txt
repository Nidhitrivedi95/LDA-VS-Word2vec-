-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg I've never really liked Indian food until I ate here.  This food is off the chain.  The Samosa is wonderful, the Coconut chutney is lovely, and the vegetable curry is awesome!  They give you plenty of food, and it won't kill your wallet.

We've been in town for one week and eaten there 3 times already, with plans to go back.  It's addictive!  Lots of Vegan options!  The place is somewhat of a dive, but it's clean enough for the workers to eat there, so I'm good with that.

Very Nice staff, helpful for those that aren't familiar with indian cuisine.
Lots of loud conversation and foreign languages mixing with pleasant indian music.  Even though the atmosphere isn't top notch, it's a neat little cubby of culture, and I would recommend it to anyone, ESPECIALLY VEGANs!
