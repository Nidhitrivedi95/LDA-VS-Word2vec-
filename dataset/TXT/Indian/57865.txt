yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw This has been my go to Indian restaurant ever since I moved to the valley last year(mostly dinners) . The quality has degraded over the last few months and the worst experience was when I went in there on a Sat afternoon with my wife and small son for an early lunch . As always , called ahead of time and made the reservation . The lady who seated us didn't bother to greet us ( because we are Indians and thats a norm here . They don't care about Indians ) . We ordered the food and waited for 15 mins and voila , in came one of the entrees which was super salty and the Phulkas were cold . It took them almost 15 mins to redo the entree and we were almost done with our lunch by then . A forgettable experience . paid over 66$+ for 3 Entree , 3 phulkas and 1 Naan ( worth it ? Not so much )

Pros : 
- Authentic Indian cuisine  
- Nice cozy place

Cons :
- Customer service
- $$$$ ( They recently increased the prices ) .
- Quality 

Lastly , if you don't have a reservation , don't bother going to this place .
