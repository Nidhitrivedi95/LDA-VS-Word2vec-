7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ Spectacular buffet lunch.   I don;t always indulge in Indian food, but this place may change my opinion. While many place serve stale indian food, I think this place makes em fresh and in small batches to keep the food great.

Tandoori chicken is superb. You can tell it just came out of the tandoor.  Crispy and juicy. Lot of flavorful spices.  The biryani is awesome. Fluffy, light, super aromatic.  

Lots of servers and they keep an eye on the food at all times so they never run out. The naan is served in small batches too, to keep em from getting soggy.  

Come ready to eat cos you just can stop!!
