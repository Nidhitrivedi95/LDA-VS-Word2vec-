LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw Eh, this place is mediocre at best. Came here for lunch w/ the co-workers, really sad looking buffet, the inside looks gloomy and there is a ghetto 2 step down to the sitting area with a "Watch your step" sign. There were 2 types of chicken curry - neither was really good. The bbq tandoori chicken and the rice pudding were the highlights. 

Not much variety and nothing great to rave about here. On the positive - it is cheap
