auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Great food and service...We started with Veg Samosa-very light and crispy.  Our mains were Murgh Vindaloo and Paneer Tikka.  Both were very tasty and plentiful-we could have shared for sure, but now we have leftovers:)  My husband and I love our spicey food, so we order HOT, the waiter warned us, so we toned it down.  Thankfully!  It was almost too hot to enjoy the taste of the food.  
The only downside was that some of the basmati rice was a little crunchy, just mine not my husbands.  Two different batches in the same bowl I guess.  
Manager/Waiters were very pleasant and attentive.
Thrilled to have a good Indian restaurant almost in our backyard!
