v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug I definitely consider this the best Indian food on Pittsburgh. I don't think it's current star rating on yelp is accurate. Maybe it's a matter of preference, but People's Indian on penn Ave has much better ratings and I truly believe it's some of the worst Indian I've ever had. I couldn't even eat most of it. Anyway, coriander is much better and I strongly suggest it. Their chicken vindaloo and Chana masala are my favorites, but everything I've had there is honestly very good. The veg samosa are some of the best I've ever had. I strongly suggest giving it a try!
