Exk-3-8qD_tSXTER85BN8Q I'm very happy to say that this is going to be my regular shisha spot. They're extremely friendly, great service and their variety of shishas including their cold shisha and fruit head shisha; I was very pleased. Their food is also quite good: savoury and delicious with a twist on their dishes including their drinks and desserts. The shishas are priced well and they last quite long. I can't wait to go there again!
