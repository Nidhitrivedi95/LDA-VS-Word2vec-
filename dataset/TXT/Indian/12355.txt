auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I dont go anywhere else for indian food in vegas after finding this place. Staff is very attentive and polite which is nice, sometimes i go in on a slow night with my 5 year old for mommy son dinner dates and the place is empty so i dont feel like he is bothering anyone. Plates are def big enough for 2. Decor inside is beautiful, date worthy.

 I always get the murgh madras combo. I have had it spicy and non spicy by accident when they forgot to ask. I have to admit spice is key when it comes to flavor here but the meat is always very well cooked.. Must go spicy!
