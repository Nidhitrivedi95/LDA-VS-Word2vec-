OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg Came out here for a summerlicious lunch! The place was filled with groups of guests when we went. Decor of the restaurant itself is a bit dated, the place could definitely use a touch-up.

For $15 for lunch, we quickly got down to ordering our meal. There appears to be only one waiter on the floor, so the service initially was a bit slow. I got the chicken tikka naan, which was freshly made and delicious. Next was the matar paneer. A mild tomato based dish, with plenty of paneer pieces. I tasted the lamb roganjosh, which had slow-cooked pieces of lamb in a tomato curry sauce...mouth-watering...

To end off, I tried their Kheer, which was just right in terms of sweetness. I got a taste of pista gulfi, which was amazing, making me wish I had ordered that instead.

All in all, a great deal for quality indian food.
