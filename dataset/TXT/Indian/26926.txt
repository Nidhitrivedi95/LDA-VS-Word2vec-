iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Marigold Madison never disappoints....and it is more than reasonably priced. It is our go to place if we are feeling like Indian food! My favorite dish here is the vindaloo with lamb! Perfectly spicy, with explosive flavors, and lamb that melts in your mouth. For a comfort dish, order chicken tikka masala...but honestly, I've never tried anything I didn't like here.
