b5J-EUKzmzj8U29Q6miV6Q Midwestern student so I always pass by this place when I shop at Walmart. I stopped in gave it a try for the heck of it. It FAR exceeded my expectations! The tandoori chicken and chicken curry were both great. The garlic naan was awesome also. The staff was very friendly as well. I will be going there more often when I get a craving for some Indian food. I see some bad reviews which is surprising. I think most are about the buffet. I can't comment on that since I didn't try it but I'm not a buffet kinda guy anyway so it doesn't matter!
