Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Everything about this place is excellent. I happen to love indian food, I eat it all the time and this is some of the best I have ever had... I had the chicken Korma and it was superb! Pricing was spot on for the quality, actually I would have gladly paid more! I gave the friendly waiter a nice tip instead :)

The environment was also quiet, modern, clean, and welcoming with nice soft lighting and interesting art work that really sets the mood. It is a great retreat from the hustle and bustle of the strip. The service was also excellent, the staff were friendly and attentive and always had smiles on their faces. The food also came very quickly. I also have to give them props on their choice of bowls used for serving rice and curry, they use bowls with a slant cut opening which makes it really easy to pour/serve from without making a mess.

They also had very clean, modern and orderly restrooms which is an absolute must for a fine dining location!

A++++++ Establishment :D
