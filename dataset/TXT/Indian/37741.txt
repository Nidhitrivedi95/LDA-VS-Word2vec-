OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg A visit to The Host on a Sunday was a definite letdown for what I had hoped to have been a higher quality fare of Indian cuisine in the downtown core. In a nutshell, everything tasted muted and significantly flavourless to its other Indian counterparts.

As noted on their website as being the winner of the best butter chicken contest by the Toronto Star, one would expect nothing less than taste bud delight. However, disappointingly, the dish did not maintain a rich mouth feel nor did it have a distinctive flavour - none of it lingered. My assumption is that they use a ratio of less cream to more tomato paste. 

To further underwhelm, the Chef's Sampler of three different kinds of Tandoori chicken, had the result of them all having the same flavour profile. It then made me question the type and duration of marinades each one had. Furthermore, they were all dry. 

Lastly, please avoid the Tadka Dal (yellow lentils) at all cost since what is expected is a watery and uninspired mess of bland blah - something one would find eating whilst in hospital. Disappointed and frustrated, I loathe the ugly bill on my card.
