Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g It was my first time eating Sri Lankan food so I really didn't know what to expect. I ordered the vegetarian string hopper thali to go (red rice vermicelli noodles with a few vegetable curries). The food was very flavorful. I liked the coconut curry and the dal very much. The eggplant was good as well. The items were a bit sweet but I liked it. The restaurant itself is tiny and cute and the owner was very friendly to us.
