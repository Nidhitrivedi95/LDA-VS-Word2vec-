0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I can't stand by and have the dragon diss'd. The chili chicken is amazing and the chicken pakoras are out of this world. Totally unique. Don't go here expecting sweet and sour chicken balls and standard Chinese fare. Investigate the Hakka menu and don't wimp out. Nice folks too...gotta help them stay in business. I'd weep if they weren't around. Do it!
