S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Tonight was our first time coming here and wow it is amazing. We went through our usual routine of trying to figure out where to eat but I was skeptical of trying a new place especially how hungry I was at the time. We made a great choice! I will be back to check out the buffet and will become a regular. I love the family owned atmosphere and everyone is so friendly and helpful.
