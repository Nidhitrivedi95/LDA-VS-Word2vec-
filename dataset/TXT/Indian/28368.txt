J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Love this place. We came to it while on vacation, I wanted to eat at an Indian restaurant that was not too expensive and came across this with a cousin of mine. No regrets because it was a great looking restaurant and the food was good. There was not much selection at the buffet but the meals that were there tasted great. The service was good. I recommend this location if you are in the downtown Toronto area and you want something good, healthy and cheap for lunch.
