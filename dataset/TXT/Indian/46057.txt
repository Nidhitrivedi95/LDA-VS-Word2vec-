SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg indian chipotle, was oh so good! my bowl at chipotle is always literally pushed to the extremes of being filled up, the pictures i saw for this restaurant they seemed as if they were small portions but I still went and went i got there i actually did get a lot of food, you just have to ask for what you want or ask for more (no extra charges on the regular items)
