OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Review is of the bar at Urban Turban.

I added a picture of the advertisement for Vegan Jam Night because the only reason I went was for a 100% vegan BBQ.

There is not a 100% vegan BBQ. There is a vegetarian Indian buffet with some vegan options that stops serving at 10pm (which is not advertised). In the bar, there is an advertisement that says Tuesdays are industry night, half off well and domestics but the bartender didn't know about it. She was nice, just didn't know the specials.

I know its a random complaint but the bar needs to get it together.
