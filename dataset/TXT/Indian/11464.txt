AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw OM Restaurant has the honour to be my 500th yelp's reviews.

Om Restaurant serves both Indian and Tibetan Food. 

This is my first experience with Tibetan food. 

Jasha MOMO = Dumplings (Tibet), Devil (Filipino) My dog (in my world)
The momo here is quite good. The stick is a little thicker than the Chinese ones I used to and they are less juicy/soupy. I am of course a fan of the spicy sauce. 

Masala Chai = Indian Milk Tea with Indian Spice and Herb
The Indian Milk Tea is really rich and milky which give it a nice and silky texture. It really reminds me of the HK style Milk Tea I enjoy. The only difference is the touch of ginger and cardamom. Of course the whole milk and the sweetener here is heated together over the stove. I love it! (I am not thinking about fat content and calories!)

Chicken Vindaloo not equal to Chicken Curry. Vindaloo suppose to be the King of Curries which is actually Portuguese in origin. when it arrives in Goa, India it had been modified by adding plentiful amounts of traditional spice and using malt vinegar instead of red wine. I love the spice inside! Not just hot but has depth in it.

Chilli Pork = a Tibetan dish makes with Pork Belly which 80% is fat cooked in more chilli oil with real hot pepper. Pork Belly is the fattest part of a pig and for some it is the most flavoured and yummy part. It is spicy for sure and I really enjoyed eating the fresh pepper inside. I hope someone would thinks those are green onions and just eat them by mistakes!
