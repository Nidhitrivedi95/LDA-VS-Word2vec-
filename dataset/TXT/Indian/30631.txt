KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA I was looking for some fun place to go as it was my B"dy. Saw some pics of this place. 
Was not disappointed.  We were a group of 4.  
Got a great service from the start. Good drinks menu. Good music, delicious food. I ordered Vegetarian while the rest orderded Chicken and seafood. The food presentaion is lovely.
We did not order any dessert. But they have  nice selections. They served me  a wedge of chocolate cake and played the B'dy song when my guest mentioned the occasion to them...Aww isn't that sweet. Well loved the experience. 
Well I will going there often..hope there is dancing.  Thank you D.B&G
