a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g I love this place! My bro and I were craving gulab-jamuns and rasmalai and it was recommended that we come here. Immediately when I walked in I knew it was the same chain that I loved when I lived near Scarborough. Once inside I noticed that they had a lot of dessert options, in addition to their savory display. But we wanted something sweet, so I scanned the offerings, and sadly some signs were missing, so that meant that I had to point for some items. Argh! I hate that! But the staff was really patient and professional, so it made the order process painless. And because I just had to, I ordered two samosas to go. The actual quality and taste was great, and reasonably priced. I regretted that I did not get more samosas. I am definitely coming back for more!
