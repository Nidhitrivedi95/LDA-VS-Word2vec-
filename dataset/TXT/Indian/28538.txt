J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Needed a curry fix whilst in Toronto and was close by this restaurant - so called in for lunch. I was going to order a la carter but the buffet looked so good I opted for this option. Boy was it good, with the star of the meal being the beef curry, really tender beef and delicately spiced. All the other items were good but I still remember the beef.
