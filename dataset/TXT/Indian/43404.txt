rnEsf4rD5a_BuaJysOezCQ This is great little place in university area where you will find some unique and delicious Indian fast food. They also have desert and they make great birthday cakes. 

This location looks a lot like Indian fast food joint off of Devon Ave in Chicago IL. It's pretty clean inside and service is pretty good as well. 

I have had falafel panini, paneer tikka panini, puff and Indian Chai. I loved all items I had and I will be going back for sure. 

Note:
They can make egg less cake per your request.
