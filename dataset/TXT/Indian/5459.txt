33yClygMVQZb5y9WgOCHLA I eat here at least once a week. The staff is friendly and accommodating to my request! They have vegetarian and vegan options as well. 

I would really recommend the Chana Massala as well as the eggplant. I order those dishes with the fresh made Naan and it can feed both myself and my gf for a nice dinner. 

They are currently updating the look and feel of the restaurant and store. I usually just get togo from there, but sometime may dine in. More of a togo place for me though...

But look forward to seeing their updates! Good lunch falafel lunch wrap too :D
