KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ I used to really like this place.  The food is still good but I do not frequent it as often as I once did.  Perhaps there are more competitive options nowadays or maybe I just wanted a change.

Any how, the food quality and menu selection is great.  The restaurant itself is fairly small, but clean and relatively quiet.  I don't think I have ever tried anything that was not good at this place.

If you have not been there, check it out.  Its worth a taste!
