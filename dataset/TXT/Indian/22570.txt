gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg If my boyfriend would eat Indian food everyday with me, I would be here everyday. Ruchi is the best South Indian food I have ever eaten. Its flavors far exceeds anything else I've ever tried. They're a vegetarian/vegan restaurant, and they are able to make off-menu items for any other special dietary restrictions a person may have. They'll make you most anything you ask, such as less butter with the dosai or more spice to the food. The service is fantastic. Raja, his dad, and everyone else always make me feel welcome. They're also very quick with bringing out the food. It comes out hot, and it seems freshly cooked! Although I wish the interior decoration was updated, the flavorful food and service exceedingly compensates for the interior design. Ruchi is awesome. Come try it if you're looking for some great food.
