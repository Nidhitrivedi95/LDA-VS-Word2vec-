o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg I loved their buffet I had last week. Their pudiogray rice reminded me of the traditional cooking you would find in southern India. While I did not try any of the meat items, it certainly did look appetizing. They had onion pakoras on their buffet menu and I was a little surprised and happy to see them. It's usually an afternoon/evening snack. But nonetheless, it was one of the best pakoras I've had in the US. Not too oily and appropriately spiced.

I will be coming again.
