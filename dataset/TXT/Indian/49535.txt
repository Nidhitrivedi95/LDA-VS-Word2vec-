tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA We drive from the far east valley to have India Oven just for takeout! We do love dining in, but taking out is just as satisfying.

Indian Oven is a small, family-run restaurant.  The buffet is daily, or you may order off the menu. Most offerings, however, can be found on the buffet. The tandoori is flavorful and spicy. The tikka masala, both chicken and paneer, are a wonderful blend of vegetables and spices, in a texture to penetrate your perfectly cooked rice just enough. The saag and other offerings are plentiful and tasty as well.

From the menu, try a qeema naan one day. It is essentially a stuffed naan. Perfectly cooked and delectable.

Dessert items such as golub jamun and whatever the awesome carrot stuff is cool the palate, as does a nice cup of mango lassi (also offered on the buffet).

The prices are meager for the high quality food and service you receive. The staff remembers you when you come in, and is always attentive. Another bonus: India Oven is open 7 days!

If you enjoy Indian food or are looking to venture to something new, give them a try.
