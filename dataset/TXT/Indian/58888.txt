YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A Had lunch here today. The combination of food and service was fantastic and, honestly, in my experience, that's rare for Toronto. The food is flavourful and not drenched in oil and salt. If you like spicy Indian dishes I would advise asking for "Extra spicy" as I think their bar for spicy is more geared towards a tamer palate. We ordered the okra and it took a little longer so the chef came out and personally explained the cause for the delay (okra is cut and cleaned fresh for each order... Effectively cooking it from scratch which takes more time of course). It was a nice touch. The waitress was very amicable and organized. The service was a big part of our positive experience. Ambiance is great. The food is a bit pricey and usually Indian food is on the lower price point but this prices were justified in my opinion. Great place and I wish them a prosperous future in St Lawrence market.
