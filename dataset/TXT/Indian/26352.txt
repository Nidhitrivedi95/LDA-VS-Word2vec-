ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg So, we stumbled on Copper our first couple of weeks in Charlotte via restaurant week. I know restaurant week isn't always indicative of what the restaurant is usually like, but we were very impressed. 

Service - the service was great. Our waiter was attentive and helpful, always making sure we had drinks, water and silverware when ours needed replacing. The decor is also fun, dark and romantic with local paintings and a quiet atmosphere.

The food we had was delicious. We both started with a chilled soup, which was amazing. If it isn't on their regular menu, they should consider adding it. It was more savory than other chilled soups I've had, but the flavors mixed well. It took all I had not to lick the bowl.

I had a duck and mushroom korma with lemon almond rice. It was spiced well, and decadent. It was definitely very rich though, and although the portions are appropriately size, I still took half my meal home. My boyfriend had the salmon, which was well cooked and seasoned with a delicious tangy sauce on the side. The presentation of both dishes was beautiful and portion sizes were great. 

The desserts we had were just OK, although I'm not sure we go to an indian restaurant for delectable desserts anyways. 

We'll definitely be back to try some of their other dishes.
