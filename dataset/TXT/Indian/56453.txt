XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I wanted to update this review so i could give it TEN stars, but sadly, that's not an option. But yelpers, that is what this place deserves!

Came here last night with my boyfriend for my birthday dinner (a very welcomed surprise!) and this visit was as good as any other. It was my boyfriends first time and he loved it too, despite how picky he can be!

We had the fried beef Amdo momo's, chili chicken dry, cauliflower pakoras, chili pork, and of course the outstanding services that always comes with a meal here.

If you haven't been here, you need to try it. And if you have, you need to come back :)
