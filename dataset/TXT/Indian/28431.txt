J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Great food at a decent price. Four of us ate for $70, which included a price fixe special and a couple extra dishes. Hearty tomato butter chicken, rich aloo gobi, great matak paneer all made for an interesting filling meal. 

The atmosphere was a little dark for my liking but that is quite usual for the cuisine I've found in this city.

The service was extremely diligent and the wait staff was prompt and friendly. I would definitely recommend this to people who aren't too picky about their flavors, as the tastes are not strictly authentic. But it definitely is delicious and that counts more than anything.
