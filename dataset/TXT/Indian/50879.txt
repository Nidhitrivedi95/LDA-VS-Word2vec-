uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w I went here recently on an almuni trip with some friends and were recommended to go here for lunch. The restaurant was very clean and had nice decor and lighting. We were pleasantly pleased by the lunch buffet selection, there was a good variety of different foods. Prices were very reasonable for lunch. And for a weekend during summer break, there was a respectable crowd in the restaurant (showing the popularity of such a new restaurant).
While the food was not as spectacular as Bombay Grill, the pricing and variety will mean we will probably be back here on the next campus visit.
