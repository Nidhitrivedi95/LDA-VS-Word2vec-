qDv5GyT2tzlJrbtxqzasQA Frequently eat out in this area, came here with 2 other co workers. I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo Roti, they asked how spicy do I want it.  This was a red flag as I have yet to be asked if I wanted my vindaloo spicy in any Indian restaurant.  That's like asking "Do you want your Armageddon Suicide Wings to be mild or spicy?"  I asked for medium to see what I would get.  My co worker also asked for lamb curry but she wanted it super super spicy.  So it turns out mine was way spicier than hers.  

The taste of the roti was not bad but the lamb was dry and wished that it came in bigger chunks of lamb.  Expensive for meat curry in a wrap, $13 before anything.  Service was fine and they seemed friendly.

Pakora was really good, came with sauces, reasonably priced.  Samosa...kind of small and not really authentic, Samosa's here would be the eggroll equivalent.

This place just opened so I'm gonna say these may be just kinks they need to work out.  I was also told there would be a lunch special menu coming soon.
