TBHpa0OX9WnWdlrti-KBxQ My wife and I visited here for the first time last night. She isn't accustomed to Indian cuisine so we stayed with a simple dish of chicken tikka masala. She enjoyed it finding the peppers and onions a nice touch. I had lamb shahi korma which was truly amazing. We shared garlic and paneer naan and meat samosas. By the end I was stuffed (having finished my portion and some of her masala).

Our dinner was excellent and we were pleased to see more rice whisked to our table when we had finished the portion served to us with our entrees. The staff were are very pleasant and welcoming. The menu has many selections and varieties of common dishes (korma with vegetables, lamb, chicken, or shrimp). There are many varieties of naan and multiple appetizers and desserts to select from.

I plan to visit soon for the lunch buffet served every day for under $10!

This might be my new favorite place in town to eat.

**Note, here I am a few months later and it is DEFINITELY my favorite place in the area. Also, I stopped for a very late lunch (1:30 PM) and found the buffet still very fresh and well-stocked. Treat yourself and visit here frequently to reward a restaurant that's doing everything so well!
