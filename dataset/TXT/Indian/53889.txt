VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ came with a party of 7... place wasn't busy, but there was a sort of long wait for food. Decent portions, but a bit oily.  the flavors were good, but i think they used garlic granules on the garlic naan (bummer).  the okra had some woody bits and i think it was from frozen... not a dealbreaker, as i personally find dealing with fresh okra to be a bitch.  pretty good, but not quite as good as taste of India in Seattle.
