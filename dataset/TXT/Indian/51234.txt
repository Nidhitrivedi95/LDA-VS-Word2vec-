I'm a buffet guy! I love the fact that you get to try so many different things in one sitting and dont have to worry about wasting food in case you didnt like what you ordered! Having said that, I've rarely come across establishments that serve some impeccable buffet spreads! This place, unfortunately, is one of those that does not.

Food : Bordering on Barely Tasty. The spices in some dishes were off like the lamb curry and vegetable rice. The tandoori chicken and goat were decent though. The desserts were HORRIBLE!!! You don't serve stuff like Gajar ka Halwa (Carrot) or Gulab Jamun without knowing exactly what you're doing. The Carrots were stale and you could pick up the taste right off. There was no richness to balance it out as well. The gulab jamun tasted straight out of a can. If I wanted a canned one, Id get one myself from the store, thank you!

Variety : Acceptable as they had 3 Protein and 3-4 Vegetarian mains, along with a bunch of starters.

Service : Prompt, pleasant. No issues there.

Considering the sheer amount of Indian restaurants in the vicinity, Id say skip this one and try some other.
