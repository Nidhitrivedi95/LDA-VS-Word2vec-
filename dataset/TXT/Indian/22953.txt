gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We noticed this place as we were out driving around. We thought it was a drive-through Indian restaurant, which we thought was such a great idea that we had to check it out.  To our disappointment, the drive-through window isn't operational.  Going inside, I expected fast-food furnishings and decor to match the outside of the restaurant.  No way!  White tablecloths and cloth napkins!  Waiters attending to the patrons.  And best of all, fragrant, delectable Indian cuisine - at a $10.00 lunch buffet!

The disappointment of the non-working drive through window was completely forgotten once we experienced the excellent food.  It was so good that we kept embarrassing ourselves, "mmm!  Mmmma!  Oh my gosh this is so GOOD!"  

Every dish was fresh, seasoned perfectly, not greasy, gamy or too salty.  Occasionally they even changed the food, putting out a completely different dish in place of something that was there before.

The naan was amazing.  I could go there just for the naan.  They offered more, but we had to say "no thank you," because the rest of the food was so good.

The vegetarian dishes were at a separate warming table than the chicken dishes.  This speaks volumes for how they care for their customers, and I'm sure the vegetarian customers appreciate this.

The service was impeccable.  Our water glasses were kept full.  Even the water was good - no chlorine taste.  

They didn't bring a check so we paid on the way out.  But that might just be how they do it there, which is fine by us.  We gave the highest tip percentage that we give due to the fine service and quality of food.  We will definitely be back.  This is now officially our place for Indian food.

We just went back again today.  It was every bit as good this time.  And they offered an accommodation for our disabled son without our asking for it, which was very kind.  We'll be back again soon.
