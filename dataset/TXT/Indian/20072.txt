FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q It's fine Indian food, but certainly no more than that.  Go to Royal India, Tandoor or Bombay Sweets in Milwaukee for real Indian.  Somehow they manage to make most of the food taste the same, and even with the heavy cream-based sauces used in many of their curries, pretty non-flavorful.  That said, for Madison, this is about as good as it gets.  My daughter and I did the buffet, the place was crowded.  The service was terrific, which I was concerned about after reading the reviews, but they've obviously taken that seriously, they were VERY attentive.  The prices are high (12.95 for buffet for me is cool, but my 11 year old doesnt eat as much and they have no kid buffet price).  Nice atmosphere.  We'll go back.
