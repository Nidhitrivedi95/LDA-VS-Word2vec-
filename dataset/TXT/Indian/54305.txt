Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A Came here for the weekend buffet and was left pretty satisfied. The place itself is very casual, as is the service. The food was very good, not great, but definitely worth the $10 for the 4 plates of food I had. 

The selection consisted of tikka masala, samosa, naan, papdi chaat, alu gobi, palak paneer, rice, tandoori chicken, and a few other dishes that I can't remember the name of (they don't label the foods). The samosa was a little disappointing. It was all potato with little seasoning. The naan was dry. The other dishes were all very good, although mild. I assume because it's a buffet that they don't make anything spicy, so you may have to order from the menu if you want some heat.

Overall though, I was very satisfied. The papdi chaat is refreshing and full of flavor. The tandoori chicken is actually tender here. They also had a few desserts. Sliced fruit, rice pudding, and something else that was really good. It was this sweet, brownish-orange mush, which I can only guess is carrot halwah from looking at their menu. If you ever eat here, GET THIS.

Saffron Patch is my favorite Indian spot in the GCA, but I will probably frequent this place more since I live much closer. 3.5 rounded up.
