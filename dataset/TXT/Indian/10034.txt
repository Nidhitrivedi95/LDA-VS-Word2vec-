9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g We just had an excellent meal here.  The Chef's Special Naan was very good.  I had chicken Kashmiri which was outstanding--I can't say enough good things about it. My husband had beef voladoori (this is misspelled) and he thought it was very good too. The service was great and we will definitely return.
