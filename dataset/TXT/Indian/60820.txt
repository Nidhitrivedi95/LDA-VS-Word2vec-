Zua91nLoti4rx1VCkuIe6g Please do not make the mistake of coming here if you are looking for vegan food options, even though the menu has a section vegan.  Lunch time offers that are vegan on the buffet only include iceberg lettuce and white rice.  So I asked if I could order from the menu, he said I could but the chef was very busy with a catering order, so it would be an hour wait.  I over heard the chef telling the server that "he could not remember what items on the food bar did not have gee" or were made without animal products.  BTW the server did not know what Ghee was, so if you have any food allergies stay away!
