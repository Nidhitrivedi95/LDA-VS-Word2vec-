TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA Three stars for the absolutely amazing delicious food. They lose two stars from me because their service is HORRIBLE. Not only are they EXTREMELY slow, they don't actually care about it. They forgot half of our meal about 20 minutes after the first part was brought to the table they "remembered" one dish was completely forgotten about, had to ask (the girl who was sitting on her phone in the corner) to please it to us. We couldn't even get them to bring the bill after asking twice. 

If you don't mind waiting or being ignored. At least the food is very good.
