iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA My husband And I had a reservation at this restaurant tonight. We sat down and after 30 minutes not a single waiter even came by our table. We received menus and the lady walked away. After a while several other waiters walked by and not one said anything or offer to get our server or ask if we even needed a glass of water. This is the first time I have ever gotten up and left a restaurant. On my way out again not one word to us. However the manager did manage to a slam the door in my face. Wow, I don't think I have ever had service so terrible. Oh right, I mean NO service. Don't waste your time with this place.
