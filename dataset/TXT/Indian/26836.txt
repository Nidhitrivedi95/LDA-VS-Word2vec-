iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I'm really not sure how this restaurant has received such high reviews.  I've been to many Indian restaurants in the US & in the world (including in India) and this is the most overrated place I have been to.  The food was very average.  Seems like a place people go to for the atmosphere.  I really don't understand the high ratings here.  I recommend Nandini and Little India in Tempe.
