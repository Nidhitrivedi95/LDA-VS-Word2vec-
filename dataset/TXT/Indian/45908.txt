sJ0MYSAIVK28cMzh-s-NPA The butter chicken is my favorite curry/sauce (but the chicken itself is a bit dry)
The naan bread is amazing!! It's freshly made in that stone oven thing (not a heated up naan bread from the toaster) I love the garlic naan, they also have plain and butter naan.

And it also comes with salad or chick peas, seems healthy :)

I have tried the other curries but they are not as memorable, stick to the butter chicken, yum!

The homemade mango drink at the counter where you pay, grab one! Worth it! Goes perfect with the curries.
