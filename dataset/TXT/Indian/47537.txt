TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Whoever heard of serving Chicken Masala without rice? An outrage. This place serves chicken masala in a bowl full of sauce and expects you to eat it without soaking up the sauce with rice. About halfway through my meal when I had little chicken and a lot of sauce left the waiter finally asked me if I wanted some rice. Little did I know at the time that the rice (barely enough for two) would cost an extra $4.....outrageous! I have NEVER been to an india restaurant that didn't serve their dishes with rice on the side. But this one seems to want to soak you for every dollar they can get. Decent food but at a steep price. I wont be back.
