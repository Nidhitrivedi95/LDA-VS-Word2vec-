rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA Visited Saturday night. They give you a small salad with a small plastic side cup of a very good minty and yogurt-based peppered sauce. 

-Butter Chicken (good, but had a unique, sort of dairy cream off-putting sweetness, love it or hate it). Chicken pieces were red Tandoori chicken breast pieces which were great, but not plentiful)

-Chicken Biryani (rice was not greasy/brothy, and flavour was above decent with more varied spices than most resto biryanis). Chicken pieces were non-chicken-breast plain chicken pieces which my friend and I disliked greatly)

-Naan (Very good, not too stretchy but thin and airy, which was great)

Best of all, they dont charge you for a tip or even offer a chance to (if you use debit or credit card, probably if you use cash too) so that was a definite plus.

But the price of that means somewhat less richer food. 

Overall more homestyle/simpler and the butter chicken sauce/curry is unique in a sweet-like flavour which you will love or dislike.

Value was average but worthwhile.
