JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I placed a To Go order through the Yelp app a few days ago. I only had to wait about 10 minutes in the restaurant before my order was ready.

The interior is very nice and service seems to be great. I'll have to eat in next time.

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala for myself and the Chicken Vindaloo for my boyfriend. We got both of the entrees spiced "Medium" just to be safe. The Tikka Masala could have used a little more heat. The chicken was moist and the taste was amazing. The Vindaloo was spiced to perfection and was so delicious. I kept stealing bites from my boyfriend's plate, it was that good.

I definitely recommend this restaurant if you like Indian and are in the area. If you've never had Indian before, do yourself a favor, and try it first here. This will definitely become a staple in our "night out" list of restaurants.
