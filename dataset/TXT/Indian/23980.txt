gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I wasn't expecting much because from the outside it's a converted former fast food building.  But inside is indian cuisine at it's finest.  A lunch buffet every day!  Attentive friendly service and a very nice selection on the buffet.  Prices are reasonable.  Mango lassi is a must.
