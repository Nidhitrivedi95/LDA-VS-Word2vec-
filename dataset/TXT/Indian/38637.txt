OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Excellent place to eat.  The food is absolutely delicious. Very different than traditional indian food.  This is my third time here and once again it's outstanding tasty food.   The service manager Manish routinely goes out of his way to feel everybody welcome as they walk in.   The gunpowder shrimp and vada pav are my favorite.   One of the best street style indian food places in my opinion.  Don't forget to get the paan shots for desert.   That will def get you back there again
