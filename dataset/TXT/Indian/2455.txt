02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I've been here a few times for their lunch buffet. The food is good... pretty standard for Indian. Today I went with 4 coworkers and they charged us an additional 18% gratuity for a large party. First, a party of 5 is too small to incur the automatic 18% gratuity; it's 6 or 8 at most restaurants. Second, the 18% was added on for the lunch buffet. I wouldn't have minded as much if it was waited service since I usually tip that much anyway. However, a mandatory 18% for a lunch buffet for 5 people is ludicrous. There are plenty of Indian places around here that are just as good, if not better, and I will be patronizing them instead.
