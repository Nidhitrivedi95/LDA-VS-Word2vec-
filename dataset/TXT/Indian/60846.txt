I ordered the chicken biryani (mild), which is the daily special but considering that it's every day's special it sort of defeats the of a daily special. It costs $5 exactly (no tax or tax included). I was surprised when the mild was truly mild. There was a hint of spice in the rice and chicken. Overall, I thought this was a great deal. A big box of flavourful rice with a 2 chicken pieces. The rice had nice flavour but less that what I've experienced from other Indian foods. The chicken was cooked well but the meat itself was sort of mushy. I would have also liked a bit more of the sauce. Compared to other Indian places this would probably rank in the middle but stands out for the price. So far, this is the best cheap eat I've found in  downtown core in terms of quantity.
