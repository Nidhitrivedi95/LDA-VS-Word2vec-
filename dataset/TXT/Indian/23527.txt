gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My first trip to Vegas, and instead of partying or gambling, my favorite memory is of dining at Mt Everest. I wonder what that says about me....maybe it just proves how big a foodie I am. :D 
Was in the area looking for some desi food, Yelp suggested Mount Everest and off we went. the server was polite and friendly, and helped us decide what to order. I ordered the mango lassi, naan, Chicken Makhani and the Paneer Tikka Masala. All the dishes were really good, and the Paneer was really soft, and not chewy (unlike a lot of Indian restaurants). The highlight of the meal, however, was the Chicken Makhani. If you've tasted the Butter Chicken in Old Delhi (around Red Fort), this is as close to it as it gets, here in the US. Just the memory makes me drool. :P
I will make it a point to go back on every visit to Vegas, for the Butter Chicken alone.
