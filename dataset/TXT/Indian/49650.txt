I gave it another shot because my brother wanted to go there, and the next time it was actually really good. Loved the flavors; everything tasted really good. So I thought maybe the first visit was just an off night. 

But the last time I got take out, it wasn't that great again. The meat in the chicken curry was fatty and gristly, and the tikka masala was oddly orange--almost unnaturally so. So I don't know what's going on here. But to me, the prices are too high to risk getting subpar food since you never know what the quality will be on a given day. I'd say look for a more consistent place. I intend to.
