H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw My husband and I ordered takeout from this restaurant for the first time recently. It was absolutely delicious! However, we were told it would take no more than 60 minutes to arrive and it ended up taking one hour and 20 minutes, which we found very disappointing, given that we live one block over. We had given them a call at the hour and ten minute mark to ask when it might be arriving and there was no apology. We also found the value for money to be a little disappointing, especially in the meat dishes. Next time we may try either picking up or eating in the restaurant to compare experiences, but we will continue to try out other Indian restaurants.
