7dZtL9I_AsTQ1pc6t9TTyA Went there not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. The inside serving area is designed to look like a food truck / school bus. Staff were pretty friendly. 

Thr experience is very much like Chipotle in that you pick a dish and then customize it. I found this to be easier than ordering at Chipotle as they have preselected toppings already. 

I had the rice bowl with Paneer. Was blown away by the presentation of this take out style restaurant.  Food  was pretty good as well. Would definitly go again.
