UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Great prices, really delicious food. I think I'd bring my Indian family here and they'd be just as impressed. The neighbour is a little rundown in this area and seems sketchy, but maybe I'm just too elite now...But obviously this isn't accounted for in the review. I do think the restaurant could use a little makeover though.

I really enjoyed my Paneer Makhani and I thought getting the dinner platter was a good deal, considering the mains don't come with rice.

Service however, was weird. They have these buttons near each table that I guess you can use to call for service, but I found the servers were super vigilant and sometimes a little intrusive. We were asked if we were finished...while my guy was still eating. I also don't understand why they have to take the order via their phone because it seems like they're texting. Or maybe the server was...who knows?

I'd come back here if my guy ever had an Indian food craving again. I don't get those cravings since...y'know...I'm Indian.
