wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw It has been a struggle finding good Indian food in the Phoenix area but we really enjoyed our meal at Taj Mahal! We went in on Friday night around 6:30 and found the restaurant wasn't busy yet. They offered us a seat wherever we wanted so our group of 3 found a table to our liking.

After looking over the menu, we got the Paneer Masala, Saag Mattar Bharta, & Chicken Tikka Masala along with a garlic naan & plain naan. Everything came out smelling so good, and after only the first bite, we were so impressed with the food.

The Chicken Tikka Masala had a delicious, creamy curry and the chicken was tender & perfectly cooked. I had gotten it with mild spice, which was actually perfect for me! We got the Paneer Masala with medium spice. The dish was very similar to the chicken, equally delicious, only with a little bit more spice. My fiancé decided to get the Saag Mattar Bharta super spicy and it was definitely that! For my mom & me, it was too spicy, but he enjoyed it. The entrees came with a side of rice, but the naan was so warm and fluffy, I'd recommend getting that! I always like getting garlic naan but their plain naan was also good.

Our waitress was available when we needed something, she came by to refill our drinks, and the owner even came by to check in on us. The menu items seemed a bit more expensive than they are at other Indian restaurants, however the taste was worth the cost! I hear they offer a lunch buffet now ... can't wait to return soon!
