scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Easily the best Indian lunch buffet in town. Priced right at $8.95, chock-full of options, the thing I like most is they offer it every day of the week they're open... weekends too! The staff is simply lovely, and everything is labeled so incredibly well, that when I stumble across a dish I'm not familiar with, it's labeled above, often times described if it's a tad unknown. The salad to start is a pretty rad and refreshing way to begin, and from there it just gets better. My last trip they had coconut naan. COCONUT NAAN! Is this a thing everyone knows about but me? It was stellar, sort of salty, sort of sweet, simply lovely soaking up all my curries!
