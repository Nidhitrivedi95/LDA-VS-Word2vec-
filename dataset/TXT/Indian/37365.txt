o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg I am a health conscious eater and a vegetarian..... I like this place and has now become one of my favorite places to eat. The food quality is excellent, freshly made and well balanced spices, not too creamy.... most indian restaurants tend to make vegetarian curries creamy and that's not good and it kills the flavor and I don't prefer creamy dishes for daily meals... Also very few dishes have food coloring in it...

They have a decent lunch menu (vegetarian),  and if you are looking for something home cooked style (healthy and delicious) then this is one of the best places to eat
