P4h8kgy_48oE9vCHJc4BCQ Great indo-pak food options. The chicken lollipops and fried fish seem to be very popular based on how often they have to get refilled. We generally go for the chicken biryani, goat curry, and chicken lollipop when entertaining guests, and they clean their plates. Looking forward to trying other options from their menu.
