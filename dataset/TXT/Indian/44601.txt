S0ekW-gI5jKtMokyra5oZA This is the best place for Sri lankan food in Cabbadge town.
Omg their somosas are to die for and the food ooohhh wow is an explosion of flavors in your mouth, beautifuly cooked always fresh because the guys cook daily, you better go early because it finishes fast.
I have been going there since I move to this neighbourhood.
The owner and his wife are really nice warm people and the cook delicious.
Plus you get a lot of food at a very low price. 
I will keep coming to this place for the rest of my life!
