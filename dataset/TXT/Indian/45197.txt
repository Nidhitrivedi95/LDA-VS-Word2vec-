S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Both my grandma and I visited this restaurant for the first time today. As soon as we walked through the door we were greeted with smiles. My grandma has never eaten Indian food so she had a lot of questions. The brothers were very kind and eager to answer every question. We ordered the Beef Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, 1 garlic naan, one regular naan (to go) a side order of rice and a mango lassi. Yes we ordered alot but we just wanted to try the food. Everything was scrumptious. One of the brothers was super nice and talkative. They truly do care about their customers. The ambiance of the restaurant was very relaxing. Overall my grandma and I loved everything. From the moment of us walking in until we left we had great service and delicious food. If you haven't been here before I would highly recommend that you give them a try! You won't be disappointed.
