ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ We went here for dinner last night and fully enjoyed it. We got the set dosa with vede curry which was actually much like a uthappam in texture than a masala dosa, with a lovely spongyness. The vede curry was also lovely. We also ordered the  Karakozhambhu which is an okra curry, and a home style paratha, and an order of rice. All of our dishes were excellent, though nothing had much heat to it. The only complaint I'd really have is that the rice was a bit dry. Next time I'd skip the rice and order a second bread instead. A very solid meal, and one of the better ones we've had in Toronto.
