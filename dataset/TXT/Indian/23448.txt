gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A OMG what a hidden gem in Vegas! Hubby and I have already visited this place the last 3 times we came to vegas. The food and service are amazing! Be prepared to see some customers eating w/their hands lol. The servers are quick to take away plates when your done cuz this is a all you can eat buffet! Make sure to wear loose clothing cuz your going to be uncomfortable if you wear skinny jeans or a dress haha!
