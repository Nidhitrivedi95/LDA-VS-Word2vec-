V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg Not gonna lie, for mall food, this place is amazing. Expensive? yes. Delicious? also yes. I got butter chicken and rice with garlic naan on the side. Keep in mind the naan is extra, which I did not realize. The food was way better than I was expecting. The chicken was so full of flavor. The naan was incredible, of course. The garlic naan was a great idea. I had gotten so much food I was able to take it home for another meal. I was definitely impressed here and would come again.
