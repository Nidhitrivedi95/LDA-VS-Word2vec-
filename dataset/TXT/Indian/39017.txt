OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g The food is tasty but they definitely need to improve on their ambiance, seats and service. There was no one to seat us for a few minutes. The metal seats were pretty hard. 

Got the chili basil bites, rotis and salli boti. The rotis were the best, so fresh and soft. Wanted to try the paan shot since I had never heard of it anywhere. Tasted just like paan with all the fixings.
