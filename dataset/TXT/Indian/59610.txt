ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ This is quite frankly the best Indian restaurant I have ever tried.  The atmosphere is nice, upscale compared to many Indian restaurants.  The food is out of this world.  The lamb vindaloo is delicious, but do try the Coriander grill specials.  They are all delicious.  The subtlety of the spices is a delight to the palate and they seem to effortlessly adjust the spice level to taste ( I love spicy, my wife less so).  Do try Coriander Green.  You will not be disappointed.
