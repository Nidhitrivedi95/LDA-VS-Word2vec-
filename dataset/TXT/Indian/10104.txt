9K2FHkajUaTU4P2cfFJmGQ Went for lunch on 8/4/15.  With a friendly greeting, we were quickly seated with the convenience of having the buffet. They separate their vegitterian food from their meats, which made it easy to try and figure out what you are eating.  While most of the items I hadn't seen before, there were a few regulars who explained some of the sauces and sides.  

I wish I had written it down, but they had a bean and potato nut thing that was my favorite item!  I may have indulged a few too many times on it, but I used this as my "rice" portion. =) 

Everything had great flavors, and nothing was too spicy.  I'm never a fan of desserts, not a huge sweet tooth, but they had a mango pudding that really helped finish the meal with a refreshing end (I over ate...those green beans!)

It's a little pricey, but well worth it.  The Naan is made while you're sitting.  While I love to carb overload, I liked that they served two of us with only 2 large rounds.  Instead of being overly full on Naan, you can enjoy the curries!
