YywWkWX235ZurTWSLqNPog Service is definitely bad. When you go to dine in, no one arrives to give you the menu or take your order. You must go in line and place your order and wait for your number. They forgot to update the order numbers on the screen so many people were confused. 

We ordered two mango shakes and three thalis. Our turn came to pick our food and we went. There is no dahi (yogurt) to start off with like at other Indian restaurants. They put the salad, onions, and cucumbers under the rice which makes no sense. The naan came way later and the mango shakes by the time we were done our meal. No one informed us that they were ready, we had to go about four times ourselves. The staff doesn't even ask or care. The naans were mostly very crisp and oily, not appealing at all. Most were burnt. The channa had no spices, lacking severe taste. The mango SHAKE was garbage, it was just mango juice. 

The staff doesn't even ask if you need anything else. There were unprofessional foam cups in the corner with some open straws for people to take if they were dining in. Again, had to ask and find them. We just ended up leaving without finishing our entire meals, as food and service was bad. 

BOTTOM LINE: Extremely poor service and food. Pick another restaurant.
