EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg I have been in dozens of dining restaurants.
While visiting Las Vegas, I thought we'd go to this serving  halal food place.
It was a big mistake: dirty place, VERY poor customer service and bad food.
Have been in other pak/ind places, this is by far the worst biryani, kababs..
