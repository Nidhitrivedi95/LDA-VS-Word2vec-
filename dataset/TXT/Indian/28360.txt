J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ My sister and i used to travel an hour at least twice a year to enjoy the amazing food served here.Now that i live in the city this is our go to place to enjoy lunch. 
First things first , the Butter Chicken is amazing! I find myself craving it weekly. Paired with Mango Salad = Perfection. 

The Price is great as well $11.95 for Lunch Buffet with many options. 

I recently took one of my friends and his Girlfriend who was visiting and they loved it! 

If you are looking for Indian Food , I 100% recommended Little India!
