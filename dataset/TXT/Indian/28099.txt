iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw Writing this late review for this place I visited about 2 months ago. Great concept, both a drive through as well as seating outside if you like the weather. We had the paneer chilli burrito bowl, maska bun and chai! Fantastic taste of food as well as tea. The only thing I would wish was if they had bigger bun for the maska bun (like they do in India). Would definitely go again!
