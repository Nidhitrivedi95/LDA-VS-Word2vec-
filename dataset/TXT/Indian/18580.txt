eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Last night 9/19/2015 was the second time I had eaten here. The first time was a long time ago and I remember the food was good, the staff as being a bit rude and the restaurant itself was a bit warm inside.  Last night was wonderful all the way around.  Upon entry we were warmly greeted, exchanged pleasantries and were promptly seated. We got our waters and bread quite quickly and our orders were taken shortly there after. I got the chicken tikka and my partner got the lamb vindaloo we shared some garlic naan. The dining room was not crowded as it was only about 45 minutes to closing time. We received our food in an average amount of time and it was TOTALLY delicious, the portions were large and I have NOTHING negative to say about my most recent visit. In fact it will become a regular in my restaurant rotation due to its incredibly convenient location. Don't pass this place up.
