2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw I'm been coming here for the past 8 or so years.  I only get one thing.

5 samosas for $1. 
1 cup of sweet red sauce for $1.

These are great for parties.  Buy $10 worth of samosas, plus the sauce, and you'll be good.

The line-up can be bad.  They still haven't figured out a better way to streamline the ordering/paying process.  It is inefficient.
