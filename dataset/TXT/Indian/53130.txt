VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw It is very rare for me to give an Indian restaurant a 5 out of 5 star.  I guess I have very high expectations of Indian places since I am Indian, so it takes a lot to impress me.  I came here with a Groupon with one of my friends who loves Indian food. 

We ordered a simple 2 entree, 2 bread, and rice portion.  We went vegetarian with Palak Paneer (my favorite dish), Malai Kofta, Garlic Naan, and Whole Wheat Roti.  The Palak Paneer, which is a spinach dish, had an interesting twist with how the spinach was blended into the seasonings.  Usually the spinach looks kind of boiled.  I was a little worried by that, but it tasted amazing.  I haven't ordered Malai Kofta much, but it tasted similar to previous experiences, which is always a good thing.  Both dishes had the right amount of seasoning and medium spice as we requested.  Both bread dishes met my expectations.

The service was excellent, which is not common in a lot of Indian restaurants that I have been to in Arizona.  The price was also very reasonable.  I am going to give another try for this place during lunch time for their $10 lunch buffets.
