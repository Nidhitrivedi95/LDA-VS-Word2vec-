Wvst5nUM1Yd64cdjIPOD6w Oh yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.  Doubles:  soft, pillowy, fluffy dough filled with the best filling and generously so - satisfying, but not heavy.  Aloo pie ......... ooooooooh ... the flavour of chadon beni in the doubles - this is truly representative of good Trinidadian food, my goodness.

In a nutshell:  ooooooh.  Ahhhhhhhh.

I am lost for words.  Which means.  This place is the real deal.  Their currant rolls ... OMG ... the baigan choka ... (frozen) ... exquisite.  This place is far for me to get to ... but worth it.
