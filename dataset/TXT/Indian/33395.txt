Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q Must try this place. Owner Rupesh proudly presents "American classics infused with eastern spices and flavors". Some of the most delicious dishes are the ribs, the ravioli, and shrimp and grits. Not like anything else I've ever had. This was a good find and I'll be back again and again!
