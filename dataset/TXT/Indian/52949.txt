v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug Squirrel Hill is starting to step up the culinary scene, y'all!  Coriander is delicious, authentic (well, that's what my Indian friends tell me), and reasonably priced.  I've been twice now, and each time we've eaten family style with the friends we were with so that everyone could try multiple dishes.  Now, everything was good, but the goat sagwala was the stand out dish.  That type of good where you start to get sad upon seeing that it's almost gone, or you want to stab your BFF for taking the last bite.  The goat is tender and not too gamy, the spices are perfectly blended, complementing the spinach and the goat.  Seriously, get this dish.  

Because I'm not terribly familiar with the names of Indian dishes, I can't list everything I've had there, but I've liked it all.  The menu is pretty extensive, with several subheadings including a Chinese-Indian section.  I haven't tried the buffet, but unless you're in a hurry, I would recommend ordering off the menu.  The service at Coriander is attentive and pleasant, and they're happy to make recommendations.
