2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg Decided to try this restaurant after finding a Groupon deal. We ordered the medhu vada (lentil donut app), malai kofta (veggie dumplings), and malabar fish curry. Everything was delicious but the veggie dumplings were amazing! The sauce was perfectly spiced and super creamy. It was the best Indian dish I've ever had! I love Indian food and would say that of all the Indian restaurants I've tried in the Phoenix area,  this is the best!
