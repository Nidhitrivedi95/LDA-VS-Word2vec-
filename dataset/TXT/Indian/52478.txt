What a find here! 

For starters, we ordered Vegetable Samosas (4.99) and Papadams 2Pcs (1.00). The samosa pastry was not over cooked however a bit under seasoned. The Papadams were.extra light, lovely, crispy & fresh * TIP : ask for red onion! 

We tried some soup too, Rasam (1.99) spicy broth with tomato & spices. It was amazing!!

Omi, our server, recommended Chennai Special Chicken Vartha Curry (11.99) and it was absolutely amazing. Pair it with an order of plain naan (1.99) which is fluffy & light

We can't wait to go back!!
