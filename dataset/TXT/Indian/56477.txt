xseXz32zjUSGaR46ku8Ixw I really love the food here there are loads of veggie options and they all taste great.  If I order an indian takeaway I always call here. I've also been to 'eat in' several times over the last couple of years. Only drawback is that it's usually very quiet! I guess it's just that bit further out of the centre of town (just past Haymarket) than some folk want to travel. Shame as the food is just FAB.
