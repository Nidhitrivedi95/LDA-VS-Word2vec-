9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Went to the lunch buffet after the gym on a Saturday. The reviewers who are saying it's the best lunch buffet ever are completely right, the buffet is awesome! There is a ton of variety, my husband was impressed that their chili chicken was even good. 

100% going back and I will probably be back every single weekend from now on.

My one complaint is that we had to work pretty hard to catch someone several times to get more water. Either be more attentive with the water or leave bigger parties with a pitcher or something! Other than that, service wasn't terrible or anything.
