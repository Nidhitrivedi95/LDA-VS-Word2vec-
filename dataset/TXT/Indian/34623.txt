Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg excellent food!

just check to make sure they are still serving your favorite things. I  was very disappointed that they didn't have the two items that were the sole reasons I came back to this place and brought a friend : Papad and Gajar Halva    :(
the food is still very good so I would rate it high, it's my fault I didn't check to see if they still had my favorite items.

also if you get to the marketplace after 7:00 you won't have to pay 5$ and call to make sure that they will actually open at 6:00 because today they opened later, 6:30ish, still food worth waiting for but...........may have been able to save money on parking and just gone later.
