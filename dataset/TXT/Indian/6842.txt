4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw We went there on a Saturday at 5PM.  There was no one in the restaurant except the Indian lady behind the register.  She indicated that we should seat our selves and brought over a couple of menu cards.  When she returned we ordered, Lamb Biriyani, Raita, and my husband ordered a tandori chicken and garlic nan.  I ordered Masala Tea and water, he ordered diet coke.  I was served the water and informed that the tea was made but surely I would wait until the end of the meal...if I had known that the meal would not arrive for more than 30 minutes...I might have objected and had my tea.  The place in shabby, uninteresting and inundated with the less than welcoming sound of the appearant arguing in the kitchen.  The lady that had taken the order disappeared for the next hour, and after more than 25 minutes the gentleman who replaced her brought silverware to the table....5 minutes later the food arrived, in 2 stages....I am glad that I stayed as the food was quite good...  After an hour the gentleman removed our plates to package the left overs...appearantly got distracted with an employee who may have been his nephew....10 more minutes past and the lady returned and asked if everything was alright.  I told her we were waiting for the check....later the left overs were brought to the table...The gentleman kept trying to get me to take tea, even though I told him that I didn't want it after such a long wait...the check never appeared, so, my husband went to the check out stand to try to pay the bill.
Bottom line...we will never return...It is such a shame that they can cook so well, but are so inefficient, confused, and lacking in basic business and service skills that it is not worth the going.
