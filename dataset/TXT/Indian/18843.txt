epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg What can I say, I am OBSESSED with this place. I come here atleast once every two weeks. It is very spicy and everything I try is fresh and tasty. My fave is the chicken biryani. Some of the reviewers are complaining about interiors. But really who cares, the place is clean and so what if it doesnt have the latest bells and whistles.
