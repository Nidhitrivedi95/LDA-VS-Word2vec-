llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g The food was alright. I went in for lunch buffet. Service was great but food not so much. Being an indian i guess i am more aware of the flavors and thats exactly what was missing. Desserts were terrible their gulab jamun was hard as a rock and the kheer was missing its main ingredient SUGAR. I give this an average go.
