I went with my boyfriend for a lunch date and we were promptly seated only moments after arriving.  The hostess was courteous and upbeat. You could tell she was genuinely happy to be there (which in my experience is uncommon).  The service was fast and well-timed! She knew exactly when to stop by to see if we were ready to order. 

The meal was excellent!  Very nicely presented! I got the spice lunch and enjoyed it very much. I'm so glad naan bread already comes with it instead of being extra (I LOVE naan bread, I'm pretty sure I have an addiction).

I had a restaurant.com certificate with me and when the hostess noticed it she came over and happily enquired if I would like to use it. FINALLY! A restaurant establishment that doesn't make me feel like a bad person for having a coupon!  

Final Thought:  Great atmosphere, fantastic service, delicious food.  I recommended this place to all!
