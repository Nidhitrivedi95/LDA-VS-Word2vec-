xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I love this place, been there twice and the food is fantastic. Building appearances may be deceiving but the food is excellent and I'm telling you, you must give it a try. The Green Chili Stew is top notch and the Navaho Taco's are great as well, but the fry bread is 100% A OK

The only issue I have is that they are closed on Sunday's, but I guess everyone deserves a day off.
