iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Ate here recently and I loved it. We had the saag peneer, garlic naan and tikka masala. The saag peneer was outstanding!! I've eaten Indian food all over the Valley and this one is the best. It was so flavorful!! I was less impressed with the tikka masala. It tasted good but was a small portion of chicken. The garlic naan was so good we ordered another. I will definitely be back!!
