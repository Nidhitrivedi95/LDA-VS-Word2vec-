uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg I was really impressed with our lunch at Fast Biryani.  We both ordered the non-vegetarian lunch special and everything had great taste.  The flavors were all very distinct and there was no shortage of spice.  Definitely on my list of places I would return to for lunch.  It's like a quality Indian fast food!
