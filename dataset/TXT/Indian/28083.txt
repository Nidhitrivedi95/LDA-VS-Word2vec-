iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw This place is super cool. I'm moved here from California and one of things I miss is food trucks. This place is super good. It has that food truck vibe. It's run by the owner who is a super funny guy and very friendly

I ordered the spicy paneer chili burritos, samosas and a mango lassi. It was all super delicious, very filling, and tastes super fresh. I. My with the samosas were a little crispier. I personally like mine slightly crunchier and flaky. But hey, it's his place. His recipe. The flavor on the inside of them was delicious.

I would definitely come here a second time. 

My boyfriend recommends the chicken tikka masala and the masala fries
