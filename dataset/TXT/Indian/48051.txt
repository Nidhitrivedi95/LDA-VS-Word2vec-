TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I have to start by saying- my boyfriend is Indian and he LOVED this restaurant. He is generally hesitant about dining out for Indian food because nothing can compare to his mamma's cooking- this restaurant was as close to home as it gets!!!

We are both vegetarians and loved that there were plenty of delicious options for us.  We had veggie samosas, vegetable biryani, red daal, saag aloo, and baigan bartha.  The bartha is rich and smoky tasting.  The daal was creamy and lucious.  Everything was spicy enough to get your taste buds excited but not so overwhelming as to make it painful.

We left with plenty to take home and snack on for the next two days.

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated, we enjoyed the bollywood music videos playing around us.  I knocked off one star for service.  I dont expect good service at Indian restaurants and wasnt surprised with a service that was pretty much limited to throwing food on the table and bringing the check at the end.  They would also benefit from a fulltime bartender- while they had a full cocktail list I was hesitant to order from it doubting my waiter's ability to make a decent mojito.

When the craving for a taste of home returns we will certainly be back!
