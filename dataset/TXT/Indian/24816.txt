h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA I will be in Az hopefully next month-ish and this is one of my must have's for the trip. I miss the Taj *snif* This is one of maybe 2 things I miss about Arizona. The owners are truly the most hospitable people I have ever met. They are so proud of what they have worked to achieve, and it shows big time! 

The food.. I don't even know where to start. Mouth watering, just the right kinda spicy.. mmm mmmmm good stuff! The naan is always fresh and hot. My personal favorite (which wasn't on the menu but they made it for me anyway!!) is the lamb dahiwalla (sp?). Can you say heaven on a plate? 

Not sure if they still have the buffet, as it's been a few years since I moved back, but it's the best damn 9 bucks you'll ever spend on lunch if they do. Know how normally all these places have buffet's full of dishes that taste like watered down versions of the same thing.. with slight variations? Eh.. meat with potatos and a sauce.. another meat with potatos but a different sauce.. stuff like that. Not the Taj!! Everything looked and tasted like it's own thing, and it was always fresh. No nasty burnt on, sitting for hours, looks like roadkill stuff here! 

Possibly the best Indian food I've ever had. Possibly the best Indian food you'll ever have too heh :)
