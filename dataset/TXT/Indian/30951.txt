kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I've yet to try Woodlands, so Maharani is currently my go-to Indian in Charlotte (mostly because it's right around the corner).  I've only ever had their lunch buffet, and I've been pleased both with the price (LOVE) and number of vegetarian options.  Fully half the buffet is veg, which is more than I can say of other Indian buffets.

The curries were decent but less spicy than I would like.  With that said, I have to echo others in raving about their samosas, which were the spiciest thing on the buffet and were truly revelatory.  I would go back to Maharani simply for the samosas, hands-down.

The people that own it seem nice.
