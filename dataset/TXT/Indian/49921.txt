U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg So this is actually my second time I've eaten from here. First time was a walk in food was great a bit too spicy for my liking i had gotten the shrimp/potato curry roti, as well as a few samosas(which were extremely cold inside). The restaurant is an adequate size, but fairly empty. I think most people order takeout or opt for delivery vis skip the dishes or uber eats.

This time I actually ordered through skip the dishes and got the butter chicken roti with two samosas. The samosas are average I've had much better. The butter chicken roti on the other had was sooo delicious. Great  portion of meat along with potato ratio. the sauce was full of flavor and nice and creamy. It was nice and warm packaged in a foil container which kept the freshness and heat. I opted for mild as i am a wuss when it comes to heat lol.

I did find it a bit pricey, I'm used to buying samosas for 3/1$ from my local spot in Brampton. So paying 1.50 each here when they tasted quite bland was a bit much. The roti was about 13$ plus tax which again is quite pricey but I guess prices are higher because of the area. Although it was worth it because I enjoyed every bite and had left overs for lunch the following day. Must warm up in over. Microwave leaves it all soggy :)

Definitely will consider returning.
