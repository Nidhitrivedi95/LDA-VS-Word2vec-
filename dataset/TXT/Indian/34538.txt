Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg We had great food and service from Anand.   He had great recommendations and was thoughtful about the timing of everything. We ordered a chicken tikka korma and the aloo gobi. Both were delicious and one of them was off the menu. The tamarind sauce was great. Ambiance was good - the entrance to the mall is off putting but once inside its very comfortable.
