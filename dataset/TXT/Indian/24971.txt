H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ This restaurant is charging 9.3% sales tax ?  The local rate is 7.95%.  This, coupled with "adjusting" credit card receipts in their favor suggests they are very unethical.  Good food but these guy's are thieves.

When I called the owner and asked about the inflated sales tax and to advise him that his staff is inflating their tips on credit card receipts he seemed to care less.
