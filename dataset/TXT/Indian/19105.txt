They have lunch buffets only on Fri-Sat-Sun. The variety is good and the taste is par excellence. Not too heavy on the spice or oil, the food is delicious. Worthy of mention was the simple goat curry, which was perfectly tender and got over pretty fast. Second to it was the chicken biryani. The aroma was inviting and the chicken literally falling off the bone. Closest to perfection in my opinion. Staff is polite and friendly.
