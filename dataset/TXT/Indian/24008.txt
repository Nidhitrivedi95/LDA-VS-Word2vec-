gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I have been looking for a good Indian food restaurant since I moved here from Portland a few years ago. A friend at work invited me to join her and her husband at Mt Everest. Everything I ate was fantastic and I've been back three times in the last month. Even their lunch buffet is great. I'm usually nervous about buffets but this is top notch! I love a good "off the strip", hole in the wall and this is a great one.
