They use paratha, which is like a flaky, super tasty tortilla with your choice of filling (chicken, lamp or veg) and topped with fresh cabbage slaw. Pros: Delicious food that fills you up without that gross "I ate too much processed crap" feeling. Friendly, quick service. Good options for vegetarians and carnivores. Cons: None.
