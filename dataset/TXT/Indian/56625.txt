xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg This is our second Indian buffet in Vegas. We understand that some people like the food spicy, but we don't so it was perfect for us. There was a good variety of food including a selection of vegetarian dishes. The staff was friendly and attentive. I especially enjoyed the sautéed zucchini and the mango creme with fruit. We will be back.
