ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ I went here yesterday, and the food was not as much like what most people talk about here.  There was barely anyone in the restaurant, an the service was very slow,  The sambar we got with our set dosa smelled like it was a month old. When we told the waiter about his, he said, oh ya, and disappeared.  Later he came to us with a bill.   I will never go back here!
