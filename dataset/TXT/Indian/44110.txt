RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Have been here half a dozen times at least and always find it so hit or miss. Their bbq ribs have been consistently good. However a lot if their other dishes have either been really good or way to greasy to eat. I know that indian food isn't generally the healthiest but sometimes the bbq stuff other than the ribs is just dripping in oil. Other times it is grilled to perfection, i guess it just depends on the day. I would nit recommend the mango lassi. It seems to sit in their display for most of the night until someone orders it and i have always found it watered down. This place gets crowded fast on weekends and seems to stay crowded all night.
