DKqhCd3Vwl3CEo8vUHhLYg I have been looking for a "quick" place to grab some Indian food to take home. I tried this place on the way home and ultimately was less then impressed. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, however the overall experience was not so much...
There was a long wait for my pick-up and while trying to pass the time a language barrier made it difficult to explore new menu items.
I did however enjoy a Kingfisher (Indian beer) while I started to write this review...
It was a little pricey for take out, and while the food was good, I have had better experiences picking up $7.99 Butter chicken from M&M Meats and taking home for the family!
