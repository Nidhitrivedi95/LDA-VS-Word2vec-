tQH_DyUIWYOHMD7CYg6-jQ The food quality is pretty good I must say. I've had take out twice and I must say that the chili chicken is great and the quantity is very generous (Bigger portion compared to what is offered at Tangerine or Federick). I will also add that the beef with broccoli plate was also good. I highly recommend Hakka Wok.
