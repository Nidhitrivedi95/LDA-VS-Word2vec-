0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ pros:
Friendly Staff: always out to make sure your order matches what you want
Chili chk is great if you like spicy.
Sesame chk is great if you like sweet
Lunch combo by far the best value in the area

cons:
Seating can be an issue
Time it takes for food to be ready is slower than i'd prefer but they make up for it with how it tastes.
