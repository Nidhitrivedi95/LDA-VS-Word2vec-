gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Good lunch buffet. Third day in Vegas and we started craving for Indian food. After reading the various yelp reviews we decided to go to Mount Everest and we were not disappointed. The restaurant was pretty busy. The spread was usual, not a great lot of variety, but enough to satisfy your Indian food craving. The good thing was that the food was pretty spicy and flavorful. Not bland at all. The naan bread was soft and just amazing. Except the palak paneer ( spinach and Indian cheese) I think everything was made to perfection. The carrot halwa ( carrot pudding) was good too. The yellow daal tasted homemade, just how my mom would make. The butter chicken and goat curry were good too. 
I always get excited when I see momos ( Nepalese Indian dumplings) on any menu. We ordered those with our buffet. But they were nothing close to what you get in India. 
However, a decent place to have Indian food in Vegas. And it is around 15 min by cab from the strip.
