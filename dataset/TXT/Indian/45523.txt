ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw I decided to visit this Indian restaurant near my home in Lakewood because of the Yelp reviews I read and the fact that the parking lot was always full of cars. I use the theory that the majority has it right. 

I arrived at the beginning of the dinner hour and was promptly greeted and seated by the waiter. The water explained the menu and the level of spiciness. One problem I had was reading the menu as the room was so dark it was hard to read the menu. I ended up ordering the Mango Curry Chicken which came with Basmati Rice. The waiter asked if I wanted any Naan, so I ordered the Onion Naan. I had Iced Tea to drink with my meal. I wasn't at all disappointed with my meal which tasted wonderful. The wait staff was very much on the ball and refilled my tea at least 2 times during my meal. Even the Tea was special and tasted great. The waiter said it had special spices in it. For dessert, based on the waiters recommendation, I had the Gulab Jamun, which is a North Indian treat, deep fried milk dough balls, served hot in a sweet syrup. My dessert was very yummy and I savored every bite. Overall I was very pleased with my meal and would definitely return.
