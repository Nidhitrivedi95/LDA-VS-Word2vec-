dNZbJdDWWKULd_KoG4lnkQ My husband and I stumbled upon this place randomly and were so impressed. The staff were so nice. There was a large variety of fresh, delicious vegetarian dishes; everything was so good and flavourful! I'm always looking for good vegetarian options in the city and wish I knew about this place sooner! Would definitely go back!
