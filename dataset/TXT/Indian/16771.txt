DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Great food .. Amazingly soft and soaked sambar vada and really good ! The dosas were really good too. Been here 3 times in the last 10 days and I think I will be a visiting  again! Service is delayed but you can see they are learning the ropes... But overall really good Vegetarian food and is sure worth the trip !
