tt1ERGD9RSfQIwX2ANyJ1g What a disappointment!  They changed to a "fast food/cafeteria" style of service. Which you know actually means less service for you. Their old place was nice since you had table service from a very nice menu and you were able to sit and enjoy your meal. Now it's just "rush in/rush out" and the experience is far from enjoyable. I've recently seen this style of service at an Indian restaurant near my home and they have closed within a few months of opening. The portions are smaller, the menu selection reduced to a few basics, and the prices are ridiculous for what you get. And they promote "healthy" but no longer offer stevia as a sweetener, instead your choices are sugar or health damaging chemicals as a substitute. Does any if this make sense to you?  If not, then go elsewhere. Heck, Chipotle is just across the street and they have better food and value for your money.
