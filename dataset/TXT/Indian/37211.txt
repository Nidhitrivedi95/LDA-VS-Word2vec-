o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ After walking past here many times, I decided to stop into this West Queen West roti place and see how it stacks up to the many roti places in Parkdale.

Butter Chicken Roti seems to have more variety of vegan options, and I opted to try the kale and chickpea roti.  After waiting for it to be prepared, I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the roti.  I could have easily made it into two meals, and the flavour was spot on.

Will definitely come back in the future so that I won't have to go all the way to Parkdale for a good roti.
