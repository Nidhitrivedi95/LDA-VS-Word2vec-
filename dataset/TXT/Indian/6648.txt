Lots of variety from rice pudding to salad to curry chicken. A group of 5 was seated near the window overlooking the beautiful Aspinwall neighborhood. Lots of parking around (and a lot) and greeted immediately with smiling faces. If you're looking for a unique Indian dish, try the Spinach Pakora with Tandoori Chicken! I'm so happy I found this little spot to go to and if you need great Indian food, stop searching and go here now!
