aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Strolling by on a lunch break and wanted to grab something quick before heading back to my hole (er, I mean, office), I stopped in at TKRE.

I ordered the mumbo sized chick pea masala roll ($3.99) and eyed the pre-packaged desserts while I waited.  I enjoyed my roll and found it to be on the small size.  Next time, I will upgrade to the jumbo size.
