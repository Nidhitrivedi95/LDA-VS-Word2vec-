o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ The food is particularly delectable. I had a Curry Chicken Roti and Chicken Korma on rice, both are incredibly good, but the price is a little high for that small serving.

 The atmosphere is nice and clean, plus the people working inside this place is genuinely good, friendly and accommodating. Good enough reasons  that I will come back.
