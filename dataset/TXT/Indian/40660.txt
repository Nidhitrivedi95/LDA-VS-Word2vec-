PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Their take on vindaloo does not match with my, or most other restaurants, take on the dish. It's not traditional, or even modern vindaloo by most definitions. There's no sour, there's  no heat, it's basically bland and yeah that's the key dish I try every new restaurant on.   The onion pakora was excellent, good value but there's always a but. The two sauces green chutney, and tamarind? come in tiny cups that aren't big enough to dip but a corner in, and finicky so I ended up wearing it.   Maybe great place for appetizers the main event was a let down.
