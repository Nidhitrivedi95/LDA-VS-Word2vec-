XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Great little place for authentic Tibetian/Nepalese food. Veggie momos were just okay, but the veggie Manchuria and the Chilli shrimp were really flavourful. Also have a nice little patio in the back, with tons of street parking up front. Super friendly staff and very reasonable prices as well! Definitely will go back here.
