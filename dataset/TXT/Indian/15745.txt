CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ I have been visiting at Masala Bites for last one year and it has always been awesome. We have catered for friends and families with them and their food has always been appreciated. My favorites there are the chicken seekh kebab and the Mutton Biryani. 

Their desserts are pretty good, especially the Gulab Jamun which they claim they make onsite. It does taste really good. It's a small place and is getting very popular. I did notice they upped their buffet prices but then thats because they are confident of their food quality.

Sujay is the co-owner who has been a chef at multiple restaurants in the past and he himself does a lot of cooking. That's a good sign when the chef is invested in the restaurant.
