muzZW1AqlfdWGMND0jf_kw This place is the real deal! My wife and I went and redeemed our one free samosa with a good old fashioned Yelp check-in, which was really good, and we shared some chicken tikka masala- shizz was de-lish! It was plenty of food for the both of us, and it came with rice. We got some garlic naan on the side which completed a full revolution of an Indian foodgasm. 

The people there were super nice, and Muhammad is the man and will take good care of you. The only thing they were missing was some background music. I was hesitant to even talk much because the whole restaurant would have been a part of my convo, but music would easily change that. 

Next time I go I'm definitely gonna branch out and try the Afghani stuff!
