We went in and I felt like I was in the Caribbean (and yes, I know what that feels like since my background is Caribbean). Older style wood tables and chairs, a nice bar, cute server, and football (soccer) on the tv with everyone watching and relaxing to reggae in the background.

The jerk chicken tasted pretty good. A small was $5 and consisted of about 4-6 pieces. My friend got the medium for $10, and consisted of about 6-8. 

Definitely would recommend if you are in the area and feel for a Caribbean experience.
