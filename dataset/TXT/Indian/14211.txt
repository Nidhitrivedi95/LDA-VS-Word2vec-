c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Makkah produces the tastiest, chewiest, most flavourful naan East of the Don Valley! Watching the naan being made by the window is intoxicating. 

While the signage is dated and the construction around is off-putting, this is maybe the tastiest Pakistani/Indian food I've ever hard. Portions are large enough to feed 2 per dish, and their karahis (Pakistani stews) are top notch. I have a soft spot for the Lamb Karahi, and the spicy pain it causes me every time. For those sensitive to spice, ask to dial it back on dishes you're not sure if; they can really leave you crying, either for your mother, or for more. 

If the ambiance and decor was a little bit nicer, Makkah would beat Lahore Tikka House by a mile, but thankfully because nobody seems care, it remains a nice gem in an otherwise increasingly gentrified East York neighbourhood.
