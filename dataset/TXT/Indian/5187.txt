It was October and pouring so I sat inside where it was super hot!! At least on hot summer days you could wait by the lake. The two guys working were literally running back and forth from the kitchen, so they really make every effort to get food out fast. Very friendly.

The take out bag weighs a couple pounds - definitely two meals (and only $7.95). The roti wrap is light, soft and splits part easily with a plastic fork. The potato and eggplant filling is spicy when ordered medium. Other than the spice, a mild curry flavour and the occasional burst of a coriander pod, it didn't have a whole lot of flavour. The filling actually tasted better when I heated it up the following day. 

I will definitely go back and try a different roti. Maybe a chicken saag or something that would have a more flavourful filling. Quality lunch options in this area are lacking, so I think Indian Roti House would be a good place to stop every once in a while.
