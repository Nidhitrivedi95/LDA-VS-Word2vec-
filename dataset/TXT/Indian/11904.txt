auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Visited Vegas for the memorial weekend and visited this place. The food was wonderful. Didn't taste the closet indian tasting biryani in any other places I tried. ( tried not too many) lol. 
I ate here 2 days in a row. I would visit it again. 1 less star because they could improve on cleaning of water glasses a little .
Thank you. Good luck!
