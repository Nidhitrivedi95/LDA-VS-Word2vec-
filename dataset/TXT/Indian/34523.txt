MmwKWBBrR0NF05hGBxnWjA Thank UTFS (U of T Food Services) for VEDA

VEDA is one of the only locations on campus where I feel I can find reliable, healthy, and yummy food that is filling and doesn't break the bank. The SF location is also probably the biggest and best location on campus.

Samosas are about $1.50, a bowl with rice and two curries/dishes will cost you about $6 (and is very. filling), and the empanadas are something over $2. All are tasty and come highly recommended - especially since they are relatively healthy, quite filling, and don't come with the greasy bloatedness I've learned to associate with a filling Indian meal.

Also, they are super vegetarian friendly. Perhaps as veg-friendly as it gets, without being exclusively veg.

I will continue to come regularly, and will even miss VEDA when I am off campus.
