1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw So first thing I was pleasantly surprised with is how nice, neat, clean, and chique this place is. Yes. For an Indian restaurant that is not always a given. Even the bathroom is clean haha

The interior decor is trendy with a big mural depicting Mumbai with marathi (language spoken is maharashtra where Mumbai is located) inscription saying ikde tikde which I belive is slang for here and there. I'm probably wrong. I can read the letters but my marathi is crap. 

Menu is pretty eclectic with authentic looking and sounding foods along with amazing ice cream flavors. Decent price.
