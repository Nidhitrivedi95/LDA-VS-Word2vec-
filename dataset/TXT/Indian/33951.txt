m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew I like it. I am not going to say that it is the best Indian food you are going to have in Toronto, but look, it is probably the best bang for the buck within the 10 block radius. The selection is not overwhelmingly large, but what is there tastes good, and the service is just fine. 

Yep, I'll be going back regularly.
