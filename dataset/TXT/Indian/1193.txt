-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg First off, Udipi isn't in the middle of nowhere.  It's on a somewhat isolated stretch of Old William Penn Highway, but for people from the city who think it's isolated, that comes from unfamiliarity with the area.  I'd imagine the location is GREAT for people going to and from the nearby SV Temple, for example.
I live right up the hill from Udipi, and while my dad and sister have been there a few times, I hadn't until recently.  The food is very, very good, and it's a quiet, low-key kind of place during the week, with a steady stream of customers.  I've seen it quite busy on weekends.

I can't comment on the authenticity of the food, because I'm not Indian, but I really enjoyed everything that I had and I can't wait to get it again. It's a great value, better perhaps than India Garden, which I also like, but I feel like Udipi is the more homey of the two and definitely the best-kept-secret.  The waitstaff were also really nice and helpful.
