YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ A decent Indian restaurant in the midst of busy streets. Stopped by for early dinner and was surprised to see how all the tables were occupied. Luckily we got a place quickly.

Orders took quite sometime coz of the busy hours I guess. I got a non vegetarian thail. My husband got a vegetarian thail. Yes, thali served for dinners too here.

The veg thali had two vegetarian curries, one black lentils curry plus roti n plain white rice.
On the other hand the non veg thali had one starter (tandoori leg) one veggie curry (black lentils) and one chicken curry plus rice n roti.

The quality was good and the quantity was sufficient for one person.

The price is quite reasonable. It's crowded during lunch and dinner time, make sure you stop by early so that you avoid waiting.

One down point is that the place is filled with tables you have to swish in between to sit down.
