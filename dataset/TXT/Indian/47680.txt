TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I've been to this restaurant several times, and each and every time I still really enjoy it. Manny was the waiter who waited on us this last time we were there and he's magnificent. The food is very good, and the atmosphere is authentic Indian. We will definitely be back, and we would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good Indian food.
