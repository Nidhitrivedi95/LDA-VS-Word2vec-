S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA I've been here twice now, once for takeout, once for sit down. I was very pleased both times. The second time I went with my wife and she loved it too. The food was top notch, especially the lamb boti masala. The service was excellent and very friendly.  They made great recommendations for menu items and had our food out in good time. The atmosphere is great for either casual dining or for date night.
