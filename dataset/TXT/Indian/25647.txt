hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw By far the best Indian restaurant in our neiborhood, SW. I think this restaurant is ome of the better Indian restaurants in Las Vegas. Great neiborhood restaurant to satisfy ur appetite. My husband had Lamb Korma and it was very good and my Chicken Tikka Masala is very good, as well. I never have a craving for Indian Food so we don't visit here often but whenever we do, it doesn't disappoint us. 

Naan here are very good but Paratha are just okay.  

One thing that did bother me this time is that the girl, the server?, did not offer a lunch menu, which we didn't know it existed. Same thing that I ordered could have been $5 less. It made me feel that I was screwed over. SO! I highly suggest you to ASK for a lunch menu because they were not offering unless customers asked.
