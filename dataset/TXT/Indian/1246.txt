-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg This little gem of an Indian restaurant is hidden away near a large Indian temple in Pittsburgh. But if you make the trip out  here, you will not leave disappointed. 

Udipi is an all vegetarian restaurant (meat eaters - don't run away! You need to try this part of Indian cuisine, and you will be converted... at least for a day!) that serves primarily south Indian dishes, with a splattering of (extremely delicious) North Indian dishes as well. 

Get the fried Idis, Paneer butter masala with Chapatis and the Channa Bhatura if you're not sure of what to order.... you will not be disappointed! \
