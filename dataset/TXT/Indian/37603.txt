OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Stopped in for lunch based on good reviews.  Let's just say that although the naan was to die for, the madras shrimp curry I got was SUPER sour...not good.  My husband got the Punjani Choley which was yummy and hit the spot for him.  The ambiance is super dreary and very much not high end (not that we were expecting that). The service was good.  Wifi was spotty until the very end when they figured out it wasn't on!  Overall, I am sure there are great Indian restaurants in Montreal.  This just didn't hit the mark for this Indian ;)
