PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q Tasty food for a good price, but the service is spotty. I once called to order to go, and the guy taking the order was a bit rude and snappy. I've ordered from them a few times, though, and can't complain about the tasty food.

There's an evening discount on their food, by the way.
