QzM-p93UPqQ3JN-iqgUNPQ Shout out to Joey C for recommending Blue Water as a stop on Food Tour 2.0 (Scarborough Edition)! Good call.

This was the fifth stop on our trip. By this time, some of us were struggling from food comas. We came to get doubles and potato balls. Carbs + food comas. Oh dear.

We came during off hours, and there was basically no one in the restaurant, save for one man nursing a beer (so I'm taking they have some sort of liquor license). We ordered two doubles ($1.50 each) and an order of potato balls ($2.50/3). Our food took a while to make, but it came out piping hot, so I'm not complaining. 

I'd never had a double before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but basically, I got two fluffy pieces of bread (which I think were fried) sandwiching chickpea curry. I thought I would enjoy it less than I did. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The chickpea curry was not very spicy (thankfully, because I've been coughing for the last five weeks), but it was quite flavorful. The bread was light and spongy. For $1.50, I didn't think it was ridiculously cheap (bread and chickpeas don't cost much), but it makes a nice snack.

The potato balls were super crispy on the outside, and thankfully, fairly light on the inside. I was afraid it was going to be a dense ball of potato. I believe the inside of the potato ball was mashed potato, spices, and perhaps some other sort of starch. These were served with a (sweet) sour pepper sauce (?) that was not very spicy, but had a nice tingle. It went quite well with the potato balls, and made them feel less carb-y than they actually were.

If I'm in the area, I'll be back to try their rotis.
