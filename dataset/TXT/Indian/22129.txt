GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw So I was having a really bad craving for Indian food one day. I had always heard about this place and was curious so I went in. Initially I wanted to get my food to go but the manager or owner (sorry I'm not quite sure) struck up a conversation with me and talked me into dining in and enjoying my meal there. And why not this was a rare day I was off work. Kids at camp. Why not? The gentleman answered all of my questions about the menu and and what he recommended. And the food was delicious!! I had a side salad, nann bread, rice, a spicy chicken tikka masala and it was all so good! I will definitely come back and I recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a great meal and service.
