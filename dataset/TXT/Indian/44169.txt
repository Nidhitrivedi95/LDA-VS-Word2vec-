RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Plastic cutlery, decent food, not as authentic but packed with lots of flavor. They made us leave our stroller at the waiting area and had to lug our belongings to the table. Being from Hyderabad, I was craving Haleem and ordered some - it was just OK. The biryani and kababs were good, very greasy but this is the nature of Indo/Paki cuisine. Had to wait about 20 minutes for the first dish to arrive. Gotta add that they gave our little one crayons, a coloring book and some new toys as well. Will make another trip for sure. Perhaps on a weekday.
