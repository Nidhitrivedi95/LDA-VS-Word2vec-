qCTuGaciae73u7C57s2_0Q There are some pluses to Poonam Delite, but the big negative is the food isn't that tasty.

The positives are that the lunch buffet is 10.99 and the dinner buffet is 12.99 but don't expect anything expansive. You do get what you pay for. We got takeout and the prices are reasonable and the portions are good.

The bad part is the food lacks depth. The butter chicken was more a sweet tomato sauce that lacked the depth of a lot of Indian food. It was very one note, which was sweet, and too sweet. The saag paneer also felt very watered down and lacked punch.

The best I could describe it would be North Americanized Indian food. Someone who likes curries and spices and food with lots of depth and soul should not come here. Other than that it is a fine establishment. I just think they need to tweak their recipes.
