ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ The vibe: A cute and small Southern Indian place right next to Banjara which has always seemed strange to me, except I recently found out that it's apparently all in the same family. Which makes a lot more sense. 

The food: I've only tried the Dosa Madras Masala, so I can't say TOO much, but it was great! I think I'm more of a curry gal myself, so next time I'll have to try one of their curries. I need naan in my life, ya know?

My go to meal: TBD! Must try more. 

Secret: There's a nice patio in the summertime..
