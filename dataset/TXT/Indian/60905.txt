zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA Yuva is my favorite place for Indian food - it's at a convenient location for me, and they always have great service and food. One of my favorite experiences there was Valentine's Day, when I went with my boyfriend. They had a special Valentine's Day menu with different options for couples, and the package we got was naan, lamb chops, curry, and dessert for $50. At the very end they handed him the check and me a bouquet of roses, haha!

Aside from special holidays, I also go there often for lunch or dinner when I don't feel like cooking. Their lunch menu has very reasonable portion sizes. I would try the Yuva Lunch on your first time there, because it has a great sampling of their best curries and comes with naan, rice, and salad. I almost never am able to finish the entire meal. For dinner, I normally get the chicken tikka masala, which never disappoints. The only  thing that I ever had that I didn't like was the mint and cumin lassi. I expected the drink to be sweet, but it was really strange and bitter-tasting.

The ambience is quite nice and the owners often come up to greet me. They have this wonderful tv behind the counter which plays Indian music videos all the time, and it's hilarious as well as educational...
