UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg When this place opened about 4-5 years ago I LOVED it. Honestly, I was so happy that I could finally get decent Indian food in my hood'! I was seriously suffering from withdrawal after having moved back from the U.K. and could only find crap Indian.

Now, it's still good but I have to say it's gone downhill over the years. With popularity it has given way to smaller less tasty portions, crappier service, less meat in dishes than previous, etc. You know the drill.

On top of that, the place is always rammed so it's a waiting game. You 're best to get take away.

Now, the best thing about it that I discovered more recently, is that you can ask for them to use less oil in your dishes (because if you eat here you know the dishes are usually drowning in oil). I love the Lamb Rogan Josh, for example, without the oil. With the oil I gain 10 pounds just looking at it. 

In brief, there are many great dishes here but they are not up to the quality they once were. Go here with high expectations that are slightly curbed, get take away to avoid the bad service and long wait, and ask for less oil in your dishes to avoid cardiac arrest!
