xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA After reading all the amazing reviews I decided to stop by on a Wednesday to try their roti special. At 3pm the place was still wow busy and there was an order line! I got a boneless chicken roti and two doubles to go (chicken and goat). 

The doubles were delicious! The meat added some different flavors to them though I'm sure plain they would've been just as awesome. The pastry texture was lovely and held up well during the car ride home. The sauce is great too though I only got one for my two doubles to share. 

The roti was filling - absolutely massive for me and no way I could finish in my own (especially after two doubles!) The one thing I didn't like was that there was a high roti to filing ratio. At times I was just eating mouthfuls of roti because I was low on filling. 

Staff is friendly and fast, would creatinine so by to pick up more doubles if I'm in the area!
