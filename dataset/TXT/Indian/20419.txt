FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ I have great news, my loong and agonizing search for tasty well balanced Thai food it's over! I declare myself a fan of this place :) :) 

I had their sweet potato chicken curry and what a quality of ingredients! Vegetables right on point, not hard, not soft, chicken cut thin and so well made! Flavors wonderfully balanced of salty, sweet and spicy. Besides, the dish has the perfect portion size, usually when I ate curries at other places I ended up with a belly like if I swallowed a whole cow! This time I finished with a big smile in my face of such comforting experience :) my hubby had the lamb curry and it had a nice earthy tomato based sauce, I even tasted like a hint of cinnamon. He liked it. The Roti bread ahhhhhhhh..... Super yummyy with such an interesting taste like if it was cooked in an open flame difficult to forget!! And last but not least, their Thai iced tea, deliciously sweet (not too sweet) finished with half and half on top which, for some reason I loved to discover, it matched perfectly with our food. Very nice staff also,  I CANT wait to come back!!
