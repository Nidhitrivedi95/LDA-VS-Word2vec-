tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Gonna be honest- I have no idea most of the time what I'm eating or how to even pronounce the foods I've eaten at India Oven. Buuuut if there's a picture of it in front of me or I'm at the actual buffet, I'm fairly certain of what it is. 

Abundance of garlic naan is sooooo my favorite [also bad for my low-carb diet], so if there's any sauce leftover from whatever meat + sauce combo I have on my plate, it's easily scooped up. It's also always piping hot when brought out! Never a dull moment when the staff is always on it for the naan. 

My favorite things are the paneer tikka masala [because cheese, duh], carrot dessert [although I prefer it pureed], chicken tikka masala, some lamb + sauce dish, and the mango lassi drink. I think they should put out larger glasses for lassi - those baby cups only last me like 2 sips! hah. Some of their vegetarian dishes are good too, but I can't recall what they are. 

The few times I've been their service has been amazing - whether it be with a few people, or a large group needing more space than others. All of these things make the $13 cost worth it!
