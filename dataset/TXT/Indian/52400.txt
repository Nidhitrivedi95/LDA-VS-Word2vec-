uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA Excellent food at a speedy pace and decent price. Service, needs work. I would have given this place a 5 star but the guy who helped with my order just was not all there. I had to repeat the details several times and he still needed help keying it all. As I stood there taking this all in I had to wonder if it was his first day. When I saw him and another young staffer watching as a third more experienced staff took over helping a client who obviously knew her stuff. The young man helping me also needs a few lessons in salesmanship. When a new client comes in through your doors you want to do everything possible to make sure he comes back again. So, if you plan on going to this place, do some research first. They have a website which is very detailed. I went in there to find out that they did have butter and garlic Naan, I wished that my server had known.
