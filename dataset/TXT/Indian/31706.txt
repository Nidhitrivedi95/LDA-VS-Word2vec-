KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ On  the Thai menu, Pat- thai with chicken and shrimp is a choice that i dont regret making and might consider trying it again. Other main courses to choose when were eating here with a group of family members or friends are lemon chicken and hakka noodles, crispy beef, egg fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, hot and sour soup. Its licensed halal meat and the best Chinese fusion in Mississauga. The environment is clean and has some nice touches like the buddha fountain and liquor bar. The service is really good and feels upscale when your dining with your group. I gave it 3/5 for the halal menu and high quality service.
