TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw India Palace is an AMAZING restaurant! 

The food was beyond exceptional. The garlic naan, mango custard and lamb rogan are so very delicious! The spices served were on point. The service was just as great. Vick did an excellent job of helping my friend and I chose the best dishes. He was also incredibly funny and sweet. It's obvious that the owners care about hiring genuine people and serving the best food possible.

I am definitely coming back to India Palace! I highly recommend this restaurant!
