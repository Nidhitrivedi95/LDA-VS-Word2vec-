YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA Having newly moved in the neighbourhood, I was excited to try the Indian cuisine within walking distance. Went here last night to try the dinner buffet with one of my girlfriends. The food was very good, although I would've liked a few more options in the hot buffet but for $13 it was well worth it. I also tried the Mango Lassi which was a perfect pairing with the food. Interior was very nice and wait staff were attentive/friendly. 4/5 stars :)
