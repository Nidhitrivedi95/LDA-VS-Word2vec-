UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ Kabob Express is an absolute gem. They they're in the food desert that is Laveen Village just makes this wonderful place shine even brighter. I'm not any sort of ethnic food expert but I've tried all kinds of combination orders there and everything has been (a) delicious and (b) priced right. Plus the service is always on point. 

We all talk about shopping local. We all talk about spending our dollars at quality restaurants who provide great service. We all talk about supporting our neighbors. Well, if you want an easy way to put your money where your mouth is, just grab a bite at Kabob Express. You will not be disappointed.
