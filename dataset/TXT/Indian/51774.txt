UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA If you are in vegas , craving for some indian food , you have to stop by here ! Esp their buffet , yes their buffet ! They have a wide variety of both vegetarian & non vegetarian dishes , their speciality chau - chau , sweets & salads & chat , all that you can eat for 14.99 + taxes ( as of dec 2015) clean , fresh & hot ! But mind you cz there is always a long wait during the lunch hours for this buffet , they have their own waiting system where you enter your name , phone no & party size in an ipad outside the restaurant & the waiter cmes to call you ( which i found interesting) , they serve you your choice of naan / flat bread which is on their menu of that day .

Dinner time is usually an alcarte , they make food according to your choice depending on how spicy one wants to eat ! Try their kheer , gajarhalwa , idli & cutney !
