Does no one wash their hands? The cook came out of the back restaurant to go outside and he looked filthy... Like he didn't shower in a week and his clothes were very dirty and not washed. We left. If the restaurant doesn't maintain cleanliness in the front... I don't want to know the condition of the kitchen at the back. I'm sure the food tastes fine. But I think with today's restaurant standards the place should have good food and a maintained restaurant where I don't have to doubt how the food is handled.
