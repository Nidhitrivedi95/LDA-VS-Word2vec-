A2aeHV_EsLIxEqRthPoujQ Amazing!! I can't believe I waited this long to try this restaurant! The food was fantastic and well priced ($9.99 for lunch buffet!), the place was very clean and the service was great, they even gave us complimentary mango lassis because they recognized my sister who is a regular. We took our parents for the lunch buffet and it turned out to be perfect for what we all wanted. Even my mom who usually eats like a bird was pleased. We were all impressed. Really, really nice people running it! I've been telling my friends to check this place out since then. I definitely recommend trying this place if you're in the mood for Indian food!
