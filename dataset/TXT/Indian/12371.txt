aX_uLs7LYmnK7VJTZJzACg K2 is a handy wee kebab house to pop into. Situated in the centre of the Newington area of Edinburgh, K2 is just a short walk from the city and centre and it is very close to the University so it is incredibly convenient for the students.

K2 specialise in Indian and Turkish cuisine, with dishes such as curry's and kebabs. Their menu consists of Tandoori Indian dishes, as well as the more popular curry's such as korma and Rogan Josh. K2 also sells the more traditional dishes too such as fish and chips, burgers, fried chicken and pizzas. 

I have been to K2 several times for dinner over the years and I have never been disappointed with my meal. Their burgers are extremely well cooked and haven't got a layer of grease on them which you can sometimes find with takeaways. The chips which came with it were also very tasty, and the whole meal comes to about £3 - what a bargain! 

There is also a good selection of vegetarian dishes available on K2's menu and so there is something for everyone. You are able to order online on their website and they have a home delivery service which is incredibly convenient. K2 is open late so it is a great place to stop by for some food on your way home from a night out.
