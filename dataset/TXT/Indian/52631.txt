uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ We came here to try out Indian food and scout for places where we could possibly host a dinner party. After reviewing many many restaurants, we decided to try out Sher-e Punjab who had gotten good reviews. Walking in we could see a big party enjoying dinner a la family style. Good sign! Sitting down we were quickly approached by a server who offered us some water and menus. 
After going through the menu we decided to start with samosas. One portion contained two samosas, we had one meat samosa and one veggie. The veggie samosa was way better than the meat one. It had a lot more flavour, felt like they forgot to season the meat one.  
We followed this with an order of sizzling tikka chicken, paneer tikka masala and sizzling paneer. The first two were delicious, very flavorful! The last one sadly was very boring, dry and tasteless. With this we had plain naan, which was freshly made and very good. Included with any meal is papardom with chutney. 
The portion size was good and we packed the left overs to go. Price was good for this, however let's talk about the bad things. First of all, as i mentioned previously we came here to talk to them to se whether we could have our dinner party here. However, we asked the waitress repetedly to talk to the manager and she kept saying he would come to us in a few minutes. He didn't! The whole dinner passed and we had to leave so we asked one last time upon which a young guy approached us. He was not the manager but took our contact info and promised the manager would call the next day. Let me tell you, he didn't! We kept calling and calling but never seemed to catch him. In the end we decided to have our dinner party at a different location. It does not seem to be in their interest to please possible future customers. I'm very disappointed! 
To sum up, food is decent and so are the prices. However don't rely on them to help you out with a dinner party!
