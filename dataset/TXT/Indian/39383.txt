oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q Delicious hakka food. We ordered sweet and sour chicken (our fav), beef chilli (pretty good), chowmein, szchewan chicken perfect blend of spices, tandoori rice and regular Chinese fried rice. The food was spot on delicious. Everything was up to the mark. Definitely a place to take family and friends or just regular cravings for hakka food. Thumbs up!
