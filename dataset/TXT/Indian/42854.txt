RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg We were in the area waiting for traffic to clear and saw Blue Taj on a Yelp search. We both love Indian food and decided to give it a try. Glad we did. It was really good. 

Despite having the address and Google maps, we couldn't find it. I had to call as we were walking aimlessly around. It's underneath the theater far in the back corner. 

Service was prompt and efficient. Not sure it was due to the fact we were there early and the only ones there or if that's typical. We started with the masala-chili cauliflower florets which were quite good. Had better but these were good. The menu is more limited than many other Indian restaurants but adequate. It's also a little pricier than most by a couple bucks per entree. It's rare to see entrées priced at $15-17 but here it's normal. 

I had the chicken mehti curry extra spicy and it was quite good with great spice level. My wife had the scallops which were terrific. I'd recommend them. 

Atmosphere is cute for a strip mall environment and the food is worth the trip.
