82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Decent quality Indian food with the spice level tuned down to suit a wider clientele. I came here for lunch today 'cause the cafeteria in our building is closed, it's -20c out there and this place is right across the street. They serve a buffet composed of: lentil soup, salad bar, rice, lentil, naan, cooked veggies, tandoori chicken, curry beef, curry chicken, and three deserts. All for $18 plus tax and tip.
