TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw The new ownership of Namaste, improved Health Department standard as well as stellar reviews and recommendations made me suggest this as the place for a co-worker's birthday lunch. I shared the Yelp link with all and we were waiting with anticipation to partake in a bevy of curries and mop that up with Naan.

Namaste is really well done up. Dark wood paneling, soft muted lighting, cosy booths...I can see how this place could be the setting for quite the romantic date night (although Indian food may not be something you want to be eating on the first few dates!). Melque (?) the owner was very very personable. She checked up on us multiple times and sang a song ("Ungforgettable") during lunch. Yes, it was a little strange and hard to talk to my table but she did have a good voice and she's just so sweet. 

Now the food...I only ate vegetarian since...I am vegetarian...a fairly extensive selection at Namaste so that was really nice. There were the usual salads and chutneys all of which were very fresh. The Navaratan Korma (mixed vegetable curry) was really really good, the soft basmati rice with peas also very comforting and the dal makhani was creamy and tasty. I wasn't a fan of the Uthapam and Sambar. The Uthapam was too sour (I guess the batter fermented a little too long) and I'm reiterating my usual complaint that no restaurant knows what Sambar is in Las Vegas. The Aloo Gobi and Spinach and Potato Puree were passable.We got a basket of Garlic Naans that was tasty but rather tough and dry. 

My co-workers enjoyed the carnivorous fare but everyone asked me the same thing when we left..."When are we going to Mount Everest again?"

I'll definitely be back as Namaste is one of the better buffets in town and the service and ambiance is really top notch.
