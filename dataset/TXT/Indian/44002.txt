RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Just came back to Lahore Tikka House last weekend and the food is still amazing!  They still have the plastic utensils and all, but a lot has changed too.  There's a lot more people working, waiting the line, etc.  The ordering is a bit different, they make you write down your order on a little whiteboard.  The service was impeccable and the wait for a seat was completely worth it.  

What's also new is a buffet that they have upstairs.  There's no wait for the buffet, but I feel like it's a bit of a newbie trap.  Don't do the buffet, the selection is small and it doesn't look nearly as good.  Stick it out and wait in line.  Always order the naan, and there's no reason to order more than one rice dish unless you have a party greater than four.  And if you have room, always always order the popsicle called kulfi.

I can't believe the place is still under construction after all these years!!!
