h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Good food and good service.  My only complaint is that when you order the Chicken Curry dish off of the menu the portion of chicken is nearly not existent. It comes in a tiny little bowl filled with curry sauce and  6 - 7 very small pieces of chicken bits.  The Curry Chicken portion doesn't even amount to the size of a small chicken breast but it is good & tasty. Not worth the money though!!!!!
