kbSSGo6zRPSdBT-CwG2cNg Birchmount and finch hosts one of the best biryani's around the Markham area. Amazing portion, flavourful sides (eggplant and pickles) . Biryani already has shredded chicken and also comes with one piece of Tandoori chicken (seasoned amazing) plus a bonus boiled egg.

Its only $6. Portion big enough for two people. I can almost never finish it.

MUST TRY!!!! Great little tamil dive in. Probably one of the best deals in the area. Quality and taste for that price is a steal.
