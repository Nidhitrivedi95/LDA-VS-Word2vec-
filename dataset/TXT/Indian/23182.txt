gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Been to Vegas multiple times but never went for the Indian Cuisine but this time finally decided to try the Indian also. Now comes the time for the making the decision making and after reading the reviews this restaurant was picked. Its little off the main strip. The location is in sort of a strip mall but as it the first place from the main road so don't worry you wont miss it :). 
Now lets talk with the ambiance, so this wont blow out your mind and just standard. 
The food variety is good for both veg and non-veg. There was good selection of the non-veg and generally the mutton is not easy to cook and this place has mutton served the day we went and luckily it was not under-cooked. 
The nan's were hot and fresh. 
The staff is friently and from Nepal. The owner didn't charge the money for the kids which I am not sure if all the other resturants do that. 

In the end i have to say I can out with yummy food in my tummy. 
If you are in vegas and want to try Indian i will recommend this place.
