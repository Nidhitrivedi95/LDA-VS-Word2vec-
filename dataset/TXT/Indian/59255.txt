yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Came in around 6:15 on a Friday night for dinner. When we got there, there was only one other party seated. Thankfully we ordered before the other party, or else I don't know when we would have gotten our food! Ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chana Masala. For about 40-45 minutes after we ordered, we watched 3-4 employees walk in and out of the kitchen with no food. When the food did come, it was absolutely delicious!!! We thought maybe there was only one cook who had to make one dish at a time. However, in those 45 minutes the restaurant filled up with 7-8 tables. If the first people to order had to wait 45 minutes for their two dishes, I hope the last people who ordered weren't sitting around for hours waiting for theirs...
