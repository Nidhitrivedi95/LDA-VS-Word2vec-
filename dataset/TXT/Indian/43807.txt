One thing to avoid: "Taj Mahal" brand beer.  "Brewed for Connoisseurs" my ass. Per born-on date, it was brewed 8 months ago. It was apparently then shipped on the poop deck of a shit raft from the smelly part of India to the smelly part of the US and along the way exposed to the sun as much as possible. What I am trying to say is that it was as skunky of a beer as I have tasted since high school.
