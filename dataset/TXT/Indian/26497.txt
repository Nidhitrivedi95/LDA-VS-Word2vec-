ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Definitely a fan of Copper. I also love that I can use Restaurant.com coupons here too. When I first came here, I thought I was going to somebody's house, haha. I usually get the Chicken Chettinadu for my entree. I love they give us Naan, but it's usually not enough for me, so I end up ordering a Garlic Naan on top of that. Overall, a pretty good spot. I know they're making the most of the square footage in "somebodys house", but some of the seating arrangements are a tad bit too close to other peoples' personal space. Either way, I'm still a fan and will continue to stop on in, assuming I have coupons, haha.
