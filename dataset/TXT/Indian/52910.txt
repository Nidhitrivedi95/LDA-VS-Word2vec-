v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug There's something so satisfying about eating Indian food on a night when it's super cold outside. I want to give this place 4 stars for the taste of the food, but as a whole, the value for money could be better. We ordered the sizzling chicken tikka, vegetable Jal Farezi, Goan tilapia fish curry and tandoori roti. All with Indian spice levels, which was great! The chicken tikka and Jal Farezi were very tasty, but the fish curry could have been more exciting, especially for the $14 price. I would have liked chicken thigh parts for the chicken tikka instead of chicken breast as it was not as moist as I would have liked. 

Service was good - pleasant waitress and fairly quick with the food. Ambience was a little strange - it seemed like a confused sports bar/Indian restaurant. 

Overall, it's good. But again, considering all factors, I cannot give this place more than 3.5 stars. So I have rounded it down to 3.
