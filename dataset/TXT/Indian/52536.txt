UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw Overly priced and not much quality. Chicken in the food was smelling and caused uneasiness in the stomach later. (happened thrice, the effect of food here) Noodles ordered during the happy hour was just oil and some noodles with sweet chicken mixed here and there (especially after we asked if it would  be actual indian taste).
I guess you can try dosa here, it was good.
