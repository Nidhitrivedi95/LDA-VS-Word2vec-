They have great combo specials which include an idli and vada appetizer, two dosas, and a pop. It is really affordable compared to other dosa restaurants. The specials run every day even on weekends before 6 pm. 
The service is friendly and fast. Each dosa comes with three different chutneys and a bowl of sambhar. You can request for more chutney if you like a particular one and the staff will happily bring it out to you. It is worth driving to Brampton just to have the dosa here. This is my go to place for south Indian food and I can see that it will be in the foreseeable future.
