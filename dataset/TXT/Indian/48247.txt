ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA I came here yesterday with a friend for the lunch buffet.  I'm not one to really care for buffets but I have been wanting to try an Indian one for awhile.  For about $9 I ate samosas, naan, a spinach & chickpea dish, aloo gobi, & vegetable biryani.  My stomach did feel weird the rest of the day but it may have been because I ate 3 huge plates of food! Definitely hit the spot for my Indian food craving.  

Service was nice, although a bit slow on refilling water.  I will admit I probably drink way more water than normal people when I go out to eat.  I also ordered a chai tea & I guess it wasn't what I was used to because it tasted really watered down.  Our total bill for 2 lunch buffets & a chai tea came out to under $23 not including the tip but we left happy & stuffed.  Looking forward to my next visit!
