zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I had never eaten lamb before, so I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered Yuva's lamb shank. But when the waiter brought it out, I was speechless. The shank was an enormous hunk of meat attached to a skyward pointing bone. The presentation immediately garnered oohs and aahs from my friends, who all scrambled for a bite (hands off, it's mine!!!).

As for the taste (which is what really matters, right?!) it was like nothing I could have imagined. There was an enormous medley of exotic spices blended in the sauce, and the meat was soooo tender- literally falling off the bone. I hadn't had lamb before, but I finally figured out what the appeal is: it has a rich earthy taste that fills you with every bite. 

The food I ordered was quite spicy (just the way I like it), but my cup was always filled with water by the prompt waiter- did I mention that he was very cute? The atmosphere of the place is also very nice: they have a TV with lots of Indian pop music videos, and there's large pictures from around India all over the place. What I'm trying to say is that it feels like you're stepping out of Pittsburgh and into a little exotic alcove of delicious foodstuffs. The polished wooden floor was spotless and all the silverware was shiny! What more can I say? I'll definitely be going back next week.
