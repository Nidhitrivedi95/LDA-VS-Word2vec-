My favorite in Parc Ex is India Beau Village on Jarry, but for Jean-Talon, this is the place to eat.
I remember this being Curry and Naan a while back, who were very good, but closed shop. This is taken over by new owners and staff.

The food is quite simply amazingly fresh. The place is small and you could hear them making the food ( which is rare in this day of prepackaged and re-heated).

I've had the Chicken Tikka, huge portion and deliciously spicy. 
I also had the Chicken 65,  very hard to find in Montreal ($6.50 is a great price).
The palau rice is about $3 and well worth it.

My friend had the thali with lamb curry and he said it was awesome, the potatoes ,rice and naan were great.

The service is very quick and friendly, they brought us complementary papadum and rice pudding at the end.

Last time i passed by the area and the place was packed, while other places that have disappointed me were practically empty, seems word of mouth moves fast.
