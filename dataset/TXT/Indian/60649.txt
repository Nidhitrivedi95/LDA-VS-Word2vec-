zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q After seeing this place on Check Please, Arizona I had to try it!   I never had Afghani food before but love exploring different foods and learning about different cultures.  My husband spent time in Afghanistan and wanted to visit as well.  We went with my son, brother and sis-in-law.  I think we ordered the entire menu and it was all delicious!  I can't even think of one particular dish I would recommend.  We will definitely be back.  I think there may be one or two items on the menu we didn't try.
