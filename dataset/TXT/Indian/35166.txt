MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw This is the second time I've been to Adrak, the first time being in August. Our server informed us that they changed the menu, and he seemed to know it very well. Overall he was very polite, I wish I had gotten his name to recommend here. I was a bit nervous after reading other reviews. My friend was so surprised when our server offered to pour his beer for him. Perhaps they've read the reviews and realized that quality service counts!

The food was amazing! The prices may seem a bit high, but the portions are huge! One of the BEST butter chickens in the city. They don't skimp on the chicken either. Don't be fooled by the appearance of lobster and prawns plate, there are indeed many BIG shrimp hidden in there. :)

Looking forward to going back!
