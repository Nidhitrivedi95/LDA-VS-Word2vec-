RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg When I was an undergrad at UofI from 2003-2007, I loved going to Bombay Grill.  I think they actually opened in 2005?  Not sure.  Regardless, my life hasn't been the same since I have eaten their food and also when I had to leave Chambana for St. Louis.  Every time I drive up to Chicago, I stop by Bombay Grill - the last several occasions they have been closed and I have resorted to eating at Za's.

Anyway, the chicken jalfrezi there is amazing.  I would gladly eat dog shit to be able to eat Bombay Grill once a week in St. Louis.  For all you lucky people still in Chambana, go and enjoy.  I-L-L- !!!
