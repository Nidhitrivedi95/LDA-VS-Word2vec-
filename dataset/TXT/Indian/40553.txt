PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ Went there on a Saturday night. Over crowded. Couldn't put my purse nowhere I had to keep it on my lap. Food is horrible and over priced (7.99 for 4 extremely small pieces of chicken drowning in way too much sauce) frozen vegetables are served too. The only positive is that the staff is nice.
