tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg Went there for lunch with co-workers, in all nine people. 
This place is clean, however for the food, we were not impressed.

Buffet was not fresh, nihari had no taste, butter chicken was little sweet. tandori chicken and seekh kabobs ran out but were never refilled, fish karahi was missing main ingredient ... Fish.

Not sure if I will go there again.
