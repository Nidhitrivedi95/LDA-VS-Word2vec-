yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg This place has some the absolute best chicken tikka masal in the valley... The courteous staff makes it even that much better. This dish can range from mild to blow your taste buds hot but they always seem to get it just right unlike other places. I would recommend this place to any and everyone!!!!
