ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Indian cuisine at it's finest. Literally. There are a handful of decent Indian restaurants in the area and I would say this is definitely one of the more upscale places to go. Great venue- served out of a remodeled home and VERY fancy interior! Outdoor seating. The food is pretty decent and their cocktails are impressive. Can be VERY pricy. 

My only complaint is/ was service. The food prep and transit time is adequate, wasn't the issue at all. Apparently their staff thinks it's alright to tack on their mandatory 20% gratuity in the event you use any type of gift card, or discount. That's an initial check without mandatory gratuity, and a final check WITH one. Nowhere in their gratuity policy does it say anything about this, but of course they tell you it's how they do things. Shady. Congrats Copper, you just lost yourself a customer.
