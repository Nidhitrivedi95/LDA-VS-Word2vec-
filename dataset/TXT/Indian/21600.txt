GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g The food is Good.    3 - average

I had vada sambhar, panner butter masala, rice roti. by taste all things are good 

Presentation crap    1 - bad
Really shady place, bad arrangement of tables, sambhar is not free, it is really outragious as all the places in san jose, long beach, LA from where my friend is they have free going sambhar

Service below the ground    -3  below reference
They should ask for tip if they deserve, if they think we do not deserve a good service, they they do not deserve a tip. my friend asked twice and was waiting for next serving of rice for 15 minutes, it is not that we were in hurry but one can take a break from eating.

overall - 3 tables occupied, a guy standing at door doing nothing, self service dhaba place, pay first -  eat later. Zero in name of service.
