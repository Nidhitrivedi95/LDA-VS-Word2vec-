TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw My brother found this restaurant, asking local folks where they went for Indian food.  Certainly the outside of it would never have attracted us!

But ooooh, the food!  The lamb curry was good, the chicken vindaloo was delish, and the goat curry (yes, goat curry) was to die for.  Service was swift and friendly.  The decor was odd -- a cross between New Delhi and someone's living room -- but that went weirdly well with the sense that this was, in fact, some fabulous home cooking.
