XcgLpUOMkK2PoaUmieHR6A Pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food, considering there were only a couple of tables when we came in.  Nice clean & quiet atmosphere, and smelled nice inside (if it doesn't, we usually walk out right away!)  Being a Vegan, we are always trying new Indian restaurants, noticed a new one at this location, and considering it's pretty close to home, we will definitely come back. One of the best Chana Masalas we've tasted, and definitely the best Biryani!! Deliciously hot Naan bread, and Pappadums with REAL lentil flour. They really understood what "Vegan" means & not all Indian restaurants do. Food came hot and fast, and price very reasonable.  Hope they stay, because they are leaps and bounds better than the previous 2 Indian restaurants in this exact spot.
