3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Wow- my husband and I are vegetarians from phoenix who love indian food, and we loved this place! 

The food was very flavorful and colorful - some unique items. It was presented elegantly, with a good selection of alcoholic beverages. 

Also, the owner came to our table and was very polite, asking us if there was anything we needed. 

Don't usually eat much dairy, but we got the free mango lassi and it was to die for! 

Definitely check this place out! It's HUGE so it would be great for big parties. Good atmosphere with lots of natural light.
