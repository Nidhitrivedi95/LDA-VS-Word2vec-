PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA Probably a little biased in that I love indian food and cleveland selection (at least what I've found) has been lacking.  But the food was delicious, the decor plain, and the waiters friendly.  But most of all, the food was delicious! Some friends and I had a sudden urge for indian, and I just searched on my phone for anything near by while we were driving.  Lucked out huge in finding this place.  We got there at about 15 minutes before close (i felt bad, but was starving) and the wait staff was friendly and seated us in the main room.

When we ordered our food we were a little unsure and our waiter was happy to assist us and make suggestions after asking our interests.  we ended up with a lamb dish and chicken curie and chicken curry with some naan.

The food was the best I've had in cleveland by far (meaning its better than Saffron Patch and the one off of taylor and cedar.)  The portions were solid (but not large, naan was a good choice to complete the meal) and the dishes spiced wonderfully.  They had a good kick, but still focused on flavor over heat. The meats were tender and the veggies pungent.  The rice was cooked perfectly. If anything, I thought the naan left a little to be desired and could have been softer and fluffier, but I was still ecstatic to scoop out the main courses with it.  My favorite indian in cleveland!
