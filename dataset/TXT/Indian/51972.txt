UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Great food, best Indian food I have eaten here in the states and I've eaten at many upscale/regular Indian restaurants. Although on the buffet I would recommend some more desserts. Maybe add a kheer or something because the buffet is very widespread and has many dishes but adding a desert or two would really bring it up to par. Other then that you can expect fabulous service and food at a great price although you may have to wait! It is totally worth it for some GREAT Indian cuisine.
