uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw Worst Biryani for the name. Made us wait 50 minutes after we ordered. We we all starving and couldn't wait to try it, when we opened the box and discover that only 1 piece of meat in chicken and beef biryani and 3 pieces of potatoes. What a joke this place is. Bad customer service, dirty place. You really need good cleaning in this place.
