GRIRHR35knxFo0qySwIysw This place was really great! The pakoras and dhaniya chutney are to die for. We also loved the veg biryani, malai kofta, and the soft, airy naan. We'd definitely recommend trying this place if you're missing home-cooked desi food. The owners are really sweet, as well :) great find
