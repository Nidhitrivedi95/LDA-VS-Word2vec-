JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Second visit here and upgrading my review from 4 stars to 5 stars. The food here is ridiculously good. My wife and I were the only non - Indians dining on our second visit. Kinks in the service from the first visit have been worked out. The menu is huge. Ask for advice as necessary.

I am now looking for excuses to go to Concord so I can eat here again. And again.
