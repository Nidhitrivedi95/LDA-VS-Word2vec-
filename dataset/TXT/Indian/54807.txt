WmtJ1bArMGPPLdwsIPahBA Had a really bad experience. Just wanted to enjoy different kinds of dosa with there dosa buffet but all we got was soggy dosa with a pinch of filling in it. When asked to one of the management that what quality is this we were told this how buffet quality is. So basically they admitted they are serving bad quality in buffet. The staff was rude and arrogant. Whenever we went towards food buffet they were out of half of the stuff and weren't refilling even after we asked them many times. I will not be going back there and would not recommend it to anyone.
