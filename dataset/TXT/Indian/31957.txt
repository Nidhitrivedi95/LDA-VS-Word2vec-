La_yPXZpdIJINeDEP-THLA If Nawab isn't a franchise, then it's coordinated by one helluva successful family.  In addition to this location in Mississauga's trendy Streetsville, they're in Thornhill.  And in India, Malaysia, Uganda, and several locations in the UAE.  

Sometimes, when ordering Indian, I suspect that the cooks cater their recipes to the comparatively timid Westerner palate and serve their hotter dishes to what someone in Poona might regard as suitable for toddlers. My chicken hyderabadi (fiery chicken with minced lamb) was very nummers though, and I was only disappointed that the serving was just this side of modest.  

In addition to the vindaloos, roganjosh, kormas, biryanis, the obligatory butter chicken, and other dishes that Westerners have come to expect, Nawab offers some plates that frankly I hadn't seen before.  (Maybe I just haven't been paying attention, or maybe I'm just that habitual in my ordering lamb korma or chicken vindaloo.)  Several prawn and other fish dishes are available here, including Bombay (a "roadside" recipe with chili paste, curry leaves and whole coriander), saffron, tawa (griddled prawn with onion, yoghurt and coriander leaves), and an Indian interpretation of Thai green curry.  The palak kofta (spinach dumplings stuffed with cottage cheese in a creamy spinach sauce) looked incredible.  The baigan bharta and baigan bagara (eggplant in tomato, onion, and yoghurt, either smoked and mashed or cubed and fried) would definitely meet my eggplant fix.

Our server was cordial, polite, and attentive.  The tunage was eclectic and unique without seeming overbearing or unpleasantly distracting.  Several wines and lagers make up for the standard booze selections, including beers from India.
