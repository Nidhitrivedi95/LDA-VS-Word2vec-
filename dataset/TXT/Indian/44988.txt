S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Wonderful experience at New Gate. We went for dinner and shared the Chicken Korma, Lamb Madras, basmati rice and naan. All of it was so amazing and flavorful the servers were so accommodating and helped us really understand what we ordering. Their Chicken Korma is now my favorite Indian dish! Definitely going back!
