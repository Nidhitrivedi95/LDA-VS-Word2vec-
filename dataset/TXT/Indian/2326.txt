_PKXarw3GjlbwbXhjdpUMA Went here for lunch and the place was filled with students and such a small place.  NO PLACE TO EAT?

WHY DON'T PEOPLE MENTION THAT????

NO DINING - ONLY TAKE OUT!!!

Ordered the chili chicken lunch special - man it should've costed $2.00!  The dish tasted very oily and NOT FLAVOUR!  JUST OIL AND CHILI'S?!?!  Sorry, that's not what Hakka is all about.  Aweful food and the owner didn't even try to make room or did NOT even try to control the kids for us adult clients who'd spend WAY more money than any student with.  Yeah, thanks lady!

Suggestion, if you like Hakka food, DON'T GO HERE! Suggest, Tangerine or Super Hakka. If you like oily tasteless food with chili's on rice, then this is the place for you!

Now I know why there's only take out - owner's don't care to take accountability for their food.  BEWARE!
