PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Brampton is the capital for Indian food in the GTA so it was obvious to us to look for an Indian restaurant when we were in the area.  Since we rarely go to Brampton, we decided to try the biggest one around in Tandoori Flame.

They bill themselves as the largest Indian buffet in North America and I have to admit its the largest and nicest looking Indian buffet I've been to.  The look is classical but modern Indian with wood panels and designs.  There is a lot of seating as the place can hold about 500 guests.

Ton of options with regards to curries, tandooris, meat and veggies.   Pani poori, naan, samosas and even dosas are found here.  There's also some halal and even a section for kids with pizza, nuggets and fries.

Like most buffets, some items were really good such as the butter and tandoori chicken but others not so much like some of paneer dishes.

The dessert section was actually a nice treat with various Indian desserts including the fresh made garam kadari kheer which is a fried syruped batter that is topped with a sweetened milk pudding.

Service was overall attentive and friendly so that is always a plus.   As a side note the washrooms were perhaps the nicest and cleanest ones I've ever seen in an Indian restaurant which is a HUGE plus! Haha!

Pricing here is on the high side for an Indian buffet at $26/pp and $11 for kids 3-11 and $3 for kids under 3 but its understandable for the variety and upscale decor.  You can actually have a nice gathering for large groups here.

Overall I still prefer India's Taste in Markham for food quality alone but with the huge selection and decor it definitely warrant a 4 out of 5 from me.
