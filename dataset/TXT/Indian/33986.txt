M4vHTtux1VDKA_KC5I_JOA When someone says "buffet", usually the world of foodies dies a little inside, but I was surprised at how lovely this place was to eat. Me and my fiancee went here as part of a Groupon for a 2-course meal with rice/naan for 2 but after taking our seats the lady who I took to be either the owner of joint owner offered us the chance to try a little more and asked if we would like to take the buffet instead of the 2 courses. I thought I had went to heaven, as bad as the idea of a buffet is, I couldn't say no to unlimited Indian food.

If the manager is to be believed then everything in the restaurant is homemade, or at least made on the premises. The starters were delicious, the curries were magic, the naan breads were hot and soft and even the desert were lovely but not too sweet.

There is a part of me that feel reviewing a buffet is like reviewing a Tesco, but I was very surprised at how nice and intimate this place was. Service was great and the food was even better.

After having a quick look at the a la carte, I will definitely be coming back to try that.

I'm a self confessed buffet lover and no matter how many good restaurants I go to, I will never change in my need to get elbow deep in food once in a while.
