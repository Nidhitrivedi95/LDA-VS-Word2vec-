gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA I decided to give them a try while we were in vegas recently. i ordered chicken tandoori that comes with rice and a side of garlic naan. When my food arrived, I found the chicken to be not cooked enough so I sent them back to the girl at the counter and told her that there were still some reddish colour in the middle of the chicken pieces. To my surprise she asked, "do you them well done?". I'm not sure if she was just surprised that I asked the chicken to be cooked more or if she was really serious. I shall give her the benefit of the doubt! lol. Anyways, about 15min later she signaled that my food is ready (again) so I went to the cashier and was told that the cook decided to make me a new order altogether and this time the chicken were thoroughly cooked.
