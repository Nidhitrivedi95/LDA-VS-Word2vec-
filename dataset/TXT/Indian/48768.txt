TqL0ytKAucWdW2mR7EbayA Such a pleasant surprise.  Recommended to us by Indian friends as the best in Pittsburgh.  

Authentic South Indian cuisine, great deals!!! nice service, strong flavors, very fresh.  Even love the wall art!  Second visit just as satisfying as the first.  We'll be back for more dosas/ sambar/ coconut chutney soon.  

Thank you Tamarind.
