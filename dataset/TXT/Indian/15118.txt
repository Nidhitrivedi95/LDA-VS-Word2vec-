CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I ordered delivery from here since my usual Indian place was closed. I know a lot of people complained about delivery times but I had no problem. 

I ordered 2 vegetarian dishes,  salad and garlic naan.

The food was lackluster at best. It had no flavour more then stale cumin. I've had better from frozen. It was nasty. Even the rice tasted like it was soaked in butter. I chucked my leftovers despite how much they cost me. 

There is so much good Indian food around, I can't imagine a reason to order from here again.
