vzjmi_Cxom5b1OVQC3B6MA Resteraunts like this are exactly why I like Scarbrough. This place is clean, fast inexpensive and delicious. The atmospher is fairly chill and the staff are polite. Unless there is simply no pleasing you or you dont like indian food then there is nothing to dislike about this place. They did slip up ONCE however, I ordered out and nearly choked on a clear plastic band in the food. You NEED to watch out for that KITCHEN STAFF. Your stars will drop like flies if that happens again.
