Their burgers or naanwich are good to start off if you haven't been here before. We also tried their daily special of their tandoori wings which tasted amazing!!

Really neat business idea to have the burgers with an Indian twist. 

They had masala fries too which came with the wings. The fries reminded me of Costco fries!! I love Costco fries so obviously I loved the fries too. I don't think I can really taste the masala spice in the fries though unless masala is suppose to taste like nothing much? But I think if the fries had more flavor to it..it would be a bomb sellout. You can of course opt for their loaded fries too if you want to spice it up with butter chicken or shahi paneer. 

We ordered the butter chicken macaroni and cheese as well. This came from their hot table meaning it's already pre made and ready to go if you are in a hurry. I really liked the flavor of the mac and cheese however I don't like the macaroni's consistency though. I thought it was a bit over cooked. I would assume so since it was sitting in the hot tray for a long time. It would be better if the mac was a better texture, that would taste great! 

One thing to note here is that their portion sizes for the loaded fries and the hot table items are huge. They are very generous with their portions and the price isn't too expensive for the food here! 

Last tip? 

Try their freshly mixed mango pulp and yogurt with the meal! Won't be disappointed. Sit tight because there is a bit of a wait(~15 min) for that goooodness because it usually will take some time for them to prepare your meal!
