FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg I tried a few different dishes today. The lamb Vindaloo was more mild than I would expect from a Vindaloo and some pieces of lamb were really tough. The samosas were absolutely delicious and had a nice amount of spice (not very hot either). The naan was nice and soft. The chicken biryani was okay. 

The food was good, but I like more flavourful and spicy Indian food. Especially Vindaloo. That dish needs to be hot!
