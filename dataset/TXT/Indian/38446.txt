OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I ordered dahi puri and sev puri which wasn't great. In fact yogurt had turned which made it inedible. I informed the waiter and he gave me an excuse but didn't take care of the problem. Ordered egg curry and tandoori naan as well - both of those were really good. Not happy that the waiter didn't tell me that the dish comes with rice while taking order. Not cool as he was looking for me to order more... Had paan shot - would recommend that!
