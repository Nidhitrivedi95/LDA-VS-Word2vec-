My personal favorite dish is the lamb shawarma (sandwich, not salad). It's a huge portion of food and the cost is under $7.00. It is difficult to eat the entire thing in one setting, but when it does happen, it sends me right into a (wonderful) food coma.

Additionally, the market side is a nice little place. They have a pretty good selection of Indian/Middle Eastern spices. I've purchased meat from them a few times as well, all of which is very fresh and clean.
