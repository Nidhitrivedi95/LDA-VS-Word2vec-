UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Food is very good but the staff is 'out to lunch'. Management has a bad attitude. When you walk in the will turn their back to you and later turnaround and have this look on their face like 'what do you want'? Have also experience sitting down to a dirty table with what looked like food from the night before. Also, I asked for a spoon and they handed it to me holding the cradle end.
