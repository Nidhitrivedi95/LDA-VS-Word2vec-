dNZbJdDWWKULd_KoG4lnkQ Let me start off by saying that this is the first review I've ever written. This place is so bad that it makes me want to sit at home on a Friday night and write a bad review about it so I can warn the rest of the world about its horrendous-ness.
The waitresses are bitchy and awkward, they stand over you while you're eating and make you feel uncomfortable. The buffet is actually TINY, the trays are arranged in 3 rows and  3 columns so that when you reach the very back tray you end up spilling half the food into other trays...which probably explains why the place was dead empty when we came in (which was, by the way, during regular dinner time)... usually when a place is dead, that's the first warning sign.
Also, the food isn't very good. I dont mind spicy food, but not when it all tastes the same regardless of the colour...
Aside from the same tasting but different color sauces, you have a choice of rice, potatoes or veggies... really limited for a buffet.
It made my stomach hurt the entire day and I didnt even eat that much... its poison!
And why do they call themselves "gagan SWEETS"?? Did you know that their dessert consists of oreo cookies? ( I kid you not).
The website is really deceiving b/c they have beautiful pics of various desserts, but that's not part of the restaurant at all.... that's a separate bakery but in the same space.

Bottom line, the only time you should ever go here is if you want to experience a truly terrible 'restaurant', or play a practical joke on someone.
otherwise, STAY AWAY!!
