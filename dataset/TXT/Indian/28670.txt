jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ On a vacation back to AZ, and we've had way too much meat recently. It was time to get our vegetarian on. 

This is a wonderful little restaurant, wonderful flavors, good prices, the works. One of the gripes I've heard from Indian coworkers about the standard fare Indian restaurants is that it is over rich food that nobody eats on a regular basis in India - its food you'd get at a wedding or other special occasion. 

Not so here - you get a large variety of choices and sides, and it seems to be what you might actually eat for lunch or dinner on a regular basis in India. This is the first time I've ever found this in the states. 

I have a soft spot in my heart for Indian vegetarian food, because it embraces the vegetables. No need for "I can't believe it's not turkey!" or "we swear it tastes just like meat!" It's vegetables and they can be magical all by themselves. And they are here. I wish I could visit more often, but I don't live in Arizona anymore :(

Do you feel like Indian? Is your heart in arrhythmia thinking about the richness and saltiness of another chicken tikka masala? Give these guys a shot.

Only comment, to make the menu a bit more accessible for novices (though it was well explained to us, during a rush I could see things getting awkward) might be some more simplified plate options presented as the things to get. Along the lines of "three curries,  rice and bread,  pick your own or let us pick for you" kind of thing. That's ultimately what the thali meals really are,  but highlighting them makes it an easy intro.
