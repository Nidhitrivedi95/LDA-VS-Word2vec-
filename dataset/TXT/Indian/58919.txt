YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A The food at Bindia is definitely tasty and well prepared. I don't care if it is authentic or not, as long as it tastes good and it does. But there are a lot of good Indian places in Toronto which are similar, for a lot less. The prices here are higher, and you get less protein/paneer in comparison too. You are basically paying a premium because of the location and space.

Definitely cute and clean, and the service was fast.
We had the lamb vindaloo and it had just the right amount of spice. The stuffed naan was also great. I had never had stuffed naan before and it was definitely worth the extra money compared to the regular naan.
