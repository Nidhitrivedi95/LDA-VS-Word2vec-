gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but this place was pretty good. Lunch buffet was only $10! Great price for Indian food and they had an array of different dishes. I really liked the sweet rice. I've never had that before at an Indian restaurant. Great place if you like Indian food.
