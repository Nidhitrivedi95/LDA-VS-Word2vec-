xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Had a great time here! After not knowing they were closed on Mondays, I visited the next day, and have to say I was impressed! Although small inside and a little dark, the waitstaff more than made up for it! Friendly, outgoing, and prompt. Now for the food, I had the Gongura Lamb, samosa and regular Naan. All were great! The Gonrua had just the right amount of spice mixed with sour Gongura leaf, awesome flavor, and the lamb was so tenderit practically fell apart on its own. The samosa was equally as good. Now the Naan, was probably the best i've ever had! I just wish I actually lived here so I could way more often! :)
