OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I have ordered delivery twice and been to the restaurant once and I am very pleased with the price, service and most of all the food. The tandoori chicken is so moist and flavorful... mmm. The Thali is awesome if you would like to try several dishes. My husband loves their hot and spicy lamb madras. The garlic Naan is really good but they have lots of varieties, I would like to try the onion Naan next time. The chai is excellent with a slice of citrus and cardamom. Everyone was so very nice and welcoming and the ambiance is perfect for a romantic dinner.
