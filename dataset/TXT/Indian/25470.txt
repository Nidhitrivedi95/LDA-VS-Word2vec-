hp1qK1gOvYRdhhBQsE-zLg The overall quality of the food was excellent and authentic. portions sizes were also great.
The service was excellent and the waiter was very friendly. The only con was that the restaurant felt slighlty cramped and uncomfortable. I definetly recomend this restaurant to anybody that wants to experience authentic south indian cuisine.
