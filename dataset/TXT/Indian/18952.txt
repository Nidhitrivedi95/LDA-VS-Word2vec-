ezDMJGONUEy1DyGSJ3vUJw A friend and I were in the mood for Indian food last night for dinner, the place that I wanted to try happened to be closed due to storm damaged, still didn't want to give up on the idea of having Indian cuisine for dinner, she suggested Copper Kettle, which I have been meaning to try for awhile now. We went inside the restaurant and waited to be seated. I have to say service was excellent, never once did we have to ask for our drinks to be refilled and they were very attentive to our needs.  For starters we ordered  hummus & the tandoori naan basket, we picked Onion & Garlic, The Garlic Naan was crisp and garlic was not over powering but my favorite was the Onion Naan, it had sauté  diced onions layered in the center of the bread, so delicious both went well with their Mint Sauce! We ordered Pea Pulao, which was outstanding and very flavorful. Also ordered the Ginger Balti Chicken and Tikka Masala Chicken and on both dishes the chicken was tender and juicy, though the ginger chicken was great & full of flavor I just couldn't get enough of the Tikki Masala! Since it was my 1st time there I am definitely going back & will work my way through the menu!
