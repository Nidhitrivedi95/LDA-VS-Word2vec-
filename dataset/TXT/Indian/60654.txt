zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Went here for lunch today. Small place but very clean. Started off with the veggie samosa and the hummus with pita for appetizer, forgot to snap a photo!!  Both very good, the hummus was especially delicious. If you ever had the hummus from Switch on central ave. this one gives it a run for its money. next had the chicken boti with rice and the beef kabob with the afghani rice with carrot and raisins  Both were wonderful and tasty.   Service was great. The kid with the black framed glasses and the other kid with the curly hair both nice kids and very friendly. Food is great can't wait to go back.  Check them out, you will not be disappointed.
