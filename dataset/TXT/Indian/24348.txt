GYmdm_Vy7sf9tji7WUcohg Mr.Singh sold the place one month ago. You can tell with the taste of the food. The usual was ordered. The curry shrimp was not as tasteful, void of the coriander flavour and smaller shrimp. The butter chicken was less flavourful less cinnamon and tomato sweet flavour. The Mount Everest biryani was less tasteful and has less saffron taste. The man bread was good. That was one of my favourite restaurants ever, Mr.Singh was a great chef with a fantastic family. It disappoints me that I will have to give it one more try then possibly look elsewhere. I thought that would never happen. Mr.Singh made  the greatest Indian food I ever had the pleasure of tasting.  Best wishes to him and his entire family. The food is not the same. Lacks spice and flavour.
