PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Only been here once on my trip to Toronto but I was pleasantly surprised. We got there about 30 mins after opening for the lunch buffet on a Saturday and so seating was no issue we were 6 and got a great place. The decorations inside were very pretty, I liked it a lot. We were close to the buffet and the selection was big. There was a lot of choice and the food tasted great. They have a good selection of deserts and fruits. Only downside was some of the fruits like oranges had gotten dry and the strawberries were very sour. The waitress was very friendly but not much of a smile to show and we never had to wait to get water or to have our dishes get picked up which was great. All in all the place is a very good Indian buffet, considering the price too and the selection.
