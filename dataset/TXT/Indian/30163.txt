JziBbXfW_SRE8hAV9vzq8A Not sure exactly how to describe the genre of the food, maybe modern middle eastern/Indian fusion. Definitely a good choice for vegetarians and some amazing sounding meat dishes too (that I didn't get to try).

We ordered 5 veggie and share plates to split between two people and we were stuffed and took home a bunch of leftovers. I really like the courgette fritters, roasted cauliflower, and okra. The only disappointing part was that some of the menu items we wanted weren't available - it seemed like quite a few dishes/juices/cocktails weren't available.

Decor was modern rustic, wood tables with white napkins. Service was good, not too intrusive but prompt and knowledgable about the menu.
