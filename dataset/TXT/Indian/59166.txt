yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Was visiting Las Vegas for business and took a wrong turn on my way to the strip. Saw it, saw 4 stats on yelp and figured if try it. So glad I did. Split some dishes with my guests we got the lamb kabobs, the chicken tikii masala, channa masala, and shrimp masala. Oh and lots of Naan. 3 regular and 4 garlic. Wow this place is good. Can't complain about a single dish. We are actually going to come back tomorrow!
