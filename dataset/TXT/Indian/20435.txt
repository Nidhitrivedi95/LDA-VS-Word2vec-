FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ Prices are great, portions are perfect and you can't beat the deal.  Little place tucked in.  The sign is very small, so if you don't know what/where your looking, you will miss it.  The atmosphere is nothing special, but it is comfortable and well spread out.   The staff is pleasing, polite, and professional.  I recommend this place for a quick bit or take out.
