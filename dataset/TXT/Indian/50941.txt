uMVDGJn9jvLXSbqOJwvHHw I like their biryani. Never tried anything else and always ordered to go. Chicken pieces in the biryani are well done and deserve 5/5 but big chunks of potatoes in it is not very appealing. The rice is little too oily and no matter what spice level you choose, they all taste the same.
