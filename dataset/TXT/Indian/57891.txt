yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The food is good I have always been a regular here more with pick up,after a long day I prefer to call and place my order so i don't have to go there and wait but the time duration specified by them is more than 25 minutes which is a tad too much.

Also they refused the free In House dessert which was a deal on yelp for check in,they said it was not valid on pickup!
Wish they would step up the service and make it as good as the food.

I will keep coming back because the food has never disappointed,the service however is questionable!

They also have a little store next door which is great if you're looking for Indian spices.
