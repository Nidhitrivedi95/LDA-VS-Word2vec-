C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA YUM! Our favourite quiet dinner/relaxing brunch place in Toronto for years. Our usual order is:

Warm Apple Walnut Salad
Beet Carpaccio Salad
Lobster Ravoili
Swordfish

+ a Kalendar Martini for good measure

We have literally had this meal every month for almost two years and the service, atmosphere, and friendly staff never fail to impress!
