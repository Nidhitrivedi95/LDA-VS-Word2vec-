2ph-6k3mXY93TLDCteC6IQ I had lunch there a few more times since my last review. Thali options are consistent in taste and competitively priced, though I would suggest avoiding the lamb option (chicken is much better). Quiet and large dining area. Take-out counter available. Quick and courteous service. My go-to place for Indian.
