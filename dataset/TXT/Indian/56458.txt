XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw A nice little restaurant in Parkdale with a great fusion of Himalayan/Nepalese, Asian Fusion and Indian food. I've heard many great reviews about this place before coming here. We came here after our curling game in High Park for lunch. It wasn't busy so there are no reservations needed. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful and try to give us some good recommendations which convinced our group of 8 to order most of the things he mentioned, We ordered the Chili Chicken, the Momo's both pan fried and steamed, the sliced beef dish, a chow mein dish and Tibetan style sausage. The dishes came out in a timely manner and across the board, I definitely loved all the dishes. Great flavours and pretty decent portions for each dish. The restaurant and the food definitely exudes that Tibetan culture which I like since I've never eating their ethnic food. Overall, a great little hidden gem in Parkdale if you are looking for great food with a bit of a spice kick to it. Definitely recommend it for people who have never tried Tibetan food.
