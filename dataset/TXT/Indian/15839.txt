d6XiEFppPRpj5AZk_VzWZA Leave it to a local friend to guide my taste buds on a trip to the Caribbean. Best part the total trip cost me only about $12.50!! 

Located in Brampton just off of hwy 10 and Queen you'll find this little West Indian gem. 

I don't know much about West Indian food but I know roti and curries and this they had a plenty. Now don't be sad when I tell you that beef and pork have no place on this menu because they have a perfectly acceptable substitute - boneless curried goat.

I had a choice between rice and roti... Guess how hard that choice was? Roti. No questions asked.

My perfectly packed and folded roti envelope came shortly there after literally bursting at the seams. And it wasn't just packed with filler either! Each curry covered bite was filled with succulent, tender, perfectly cooked goat meat. Literally to die for!

When I ordered I'd asked for the roti hot but the kind man at the counter looked at me with distrust, as if to say "I dun trust this white boi" and kindly suggested I try medium because he didn't want to be charged with assisted suicide. Fair enough - game on. 

Medium was more than tolerable on the patented Eatcrest Spice Scale. A 2.5/5 at worst. However ill award and extra 0.5 because right at the end there was a patch of roti that was hiding a small forest fire and it caused 3 new chest hairs to grow. True story. 

To wash this all down I went for a bottle of sweetened Solo Gingerbeer which is apparently native to Trinidad. Not too peppery but a perfect accompanyment to my meal. 

Great meal. Neat hidden spot. But consistently packed! Locals advise that weekends are out the door slammed so come prepared to wait... For an amazing meal!!

Eatcrest out.
