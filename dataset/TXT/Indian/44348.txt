Everything was really good. I especially enjoyed the flavors of the South Indian Vegetable Curry dish. As an appetizer, I ordered the Pukka chaat. I appreciated the option to omit the yoghurt, upon request. 

It's a beautifully decorated restaurant, and the service was exceptional. Very accommodating. When visiting Toronto again, returning to Pukka will be a must.
