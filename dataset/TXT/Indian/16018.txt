dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q Best Indian buffet in the city. Their eggplant delight is literally the tastiest Indian dish you will ever put in your mouth - I could eat it every single day. Fresh hot naan brought to your table, fantastic and authentic pilau rice, veggie pakoras that are addictive and incredibly tender goat.

Better for eat in than take out, but always my comfort food go-to spot either way.
