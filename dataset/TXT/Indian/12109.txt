auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Food was of the typical buffet fare. Chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, lentil, spinach paneer, etc.  The chicken tandoori was a bit dry, but the vegetable dishes were very good. The naan and rice were freshly made and the service was excellent. I didn't like the fact that they only had 1 dessert and the chicken in the dishes were a bit dry. The lamb was tender for the most part.
