B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog Wow. What a great place. Smallish and casual but with amazing food and service.  I had the Grilled Cheese Goon which came on home made bread and loaded with cheese.   The home made jam surprised me as I basically had written it off as a garnish.  I was wrong!  I would eat this meal every day if my heart would allow it!  My wife had quiche which had an amazing crust. Kids had make and cheese with maple pork.   The serving sizes are big and meals are hearty.  This place should not be missed!
