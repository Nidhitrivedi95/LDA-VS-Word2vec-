PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA Do not go here for the lunch buffet, they can't handle the crowd. All of the chicken dishes were out of chicken, so they just had a buffet of sauce labeled chicken. I was there for an hour and none of it was replenished. The pakoras were burnt. Our server never took drink orders.
