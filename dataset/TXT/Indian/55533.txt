X1OnZ6sy5c5TmZCDwCR1Gg Roti serves some of the most innovative Indian inspired cuisine availably. Run by Tony Singh, who also owns Olorosso (which I don't like) it goes back to his roots and produces excellent food. You seriously pay for the privilege however, and the new premises on Morrison street are far from the intimate little venue this restaurant had in Rose St. previously.


 Last time I went, the restaurant was cold, draughty and playing Britney Spears on the PA which detracted significantly from the enjoyment of the meal.


 Look out for the toilets. They are almost hidden within the wall panels and very hard to find!
