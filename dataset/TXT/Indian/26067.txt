Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw We'd used to order delivery from this place, and when we were in the neighbourhood a couple of weekends ago, decided to dine in for the first time.

Unfortunately, it looks like their buffet is a think of the past, you could see where it used to be setup, so that was a bit of a disappointment, but we decided to stay since it was frigidly cold outside and wanted some good food.

On the food front, things were pretty good.  We had the channa masala, butter chicken, and lamb biryani, all solid in terms of taste, and spice level was exactly as described (be forewarned, when they say hot, it's actually hot).

Overall, a good meal, fast service.
