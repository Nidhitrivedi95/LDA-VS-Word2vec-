Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw The service was good, prompt, and polite. Great location @ y&eg the one and only gripe i have with this place is the food is kind of bland for indian food. It wasn't bad by any means, just a little underwhelming. It would be a bit more appropriate for someone with a sensitive palette, but I'm the kind of person who likes his indian food spicy and packed with flavour. There are a few things they can do to get some easy points which is why I'm giving a score of 3. More sauces, chutneys, and general flavour options. Adjust the heat lamps to not dry out the food, I could cut a potato with my naan, just a little too crispy. Other than that the experience was pleasant and I probably will go back because it was adequately priced.
