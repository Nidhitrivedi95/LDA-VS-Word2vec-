Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw Visited this place for dinner with friends. I don't usually go for Indian food (as I get all that at home) so when I saw that they had butter chicken, I went for it. Butter chicken is not something that is part of traditional Indian cuisine, so for me, it's something special. This place is also special because it's not just Indian cuisine, but also Nepalese cuisine. While we didn't try anything that's traditionally Nepalese that evening, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and service, as well as the food. I will be back to try more things. Something that's interesting is that they served food on thalis (those metal tray-like dishes each item is separated in it's own place). I do not enjoy eating off thalis so much, but it's a different experience if you've never tried it before. The prices are fair, and the portions are large. Worth the visit!
