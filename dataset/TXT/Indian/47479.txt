TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw If ur looking for indian food in Vegas, this is the place to go. Food and Service was good. We ordered the goat briyani, Chicken Manchuri and garlic naan. First 2 items were delicious, but i personally felt the naan to be little dry but my husband thought it was perfect so i guess overall we both enjoyed our dinner here very much. Nyammy!
