xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I would have probably given this 3 stars if not for the awesome green chili stew and the variety of dessert frybreads that rock my world.

The various frybread tacos are solid, but nothing that exceptional. I like the chorizo one with lots of hot sauce. 

It's a good neighborhood spot when you're in the mood for something a little different, or especially if you've got a sweet tooth! :)
