scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg I eat a lot of Indian food and find Haveli reliably friendly and tasty.  The lunch buffet today was outstanding, with excellent goat curry ... not on every menu.   Try Goa style or Madras style foods in the evening.  Inexpensive given the quality.   Pleasant wait staff.   Worth a detour.
