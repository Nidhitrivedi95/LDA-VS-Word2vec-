LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw The buffet was very typical Indian buffet. I'm from Edison, NJ, which has a large Indian community with a great selection of food, so this one didn't meet my expectations. There were limited options in the buffet. It only had 3 veggies, 3 chickens and 2 soups along with dessert. The veggies didn't include some popular items like paneer or anything. Overall, for the price it was okay.
