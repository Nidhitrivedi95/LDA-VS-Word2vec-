I ordered my lamb sag med-hot and I don't think it would even register as mild.  I enjoy Indian not just b/c the level of spiciness clears your head, all the spices together make you feel rejunivated after.  I would return for the cleaniness, and attentive service but wouldn't rave about how great the food was.
