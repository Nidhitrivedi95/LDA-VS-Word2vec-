jRxLnJ9my31Re_O2MvQGhw Mouth watering rice bowls? Yup Tasty Bowl Subs N Such has them. I've been scoping this place out via yelp for a couple of weeks now . I decided today for lunch im going to finally try this place i have a good feeling im going to love it. Low and behold i called to place a order so it would be ready when i arrived and Raja who's the manager answered and he could tell i was unsure of what i really wanted i heard so much about the jerk chicken bowl when i mentioned it to him he asked did i like spicy food? I told him yes to a certain extent so he took it upon hiself to say hey tell you what when you come in ill give you a few samples so you can decide which rice bowl you want to order,surely when i arrived he said i been waiting on you, he did as he said he would and fixed me up a sample to make sure it wasn't to spicy for me if thats what i really wanted,well it was a winner and i was sold! Noticebly i realized Raja knew alot of the customers by name which let's me know he engages alot with his customers, now that i think about it he even asked me what my name was when he gave me the sample, also i noticed him walking around asking everyone how was their food etc, he will go very far, with all of that being said i ordered my Jerk Chicken Bowl and was on my merry way!
