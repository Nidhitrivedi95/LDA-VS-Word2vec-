S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA I am in town weekly for an information security internship and so I have been going around to the local Indian restaurants. Every restaurant has let me down besides this one. New India gate has the most delicious Indian food I have found in AZ so far! Even better than every Indian restaurant where I live! "Atlanta" thanks so much for wonderful food!
