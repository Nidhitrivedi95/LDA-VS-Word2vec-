Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw Came here for the lunch buffet today.  It's located on the lower floor and can be tough to find.  Though there wasn't too much selection (3 meats, 3 vegetable dishes, rice) the service was quiet good and the food tasted good as well!  The lunch buffet is $12.99

There was samosa, pakora, a variety of salads, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb, and 2 types of dessert.

I'd recommend for a quiet, simple, and tasty lunch.
