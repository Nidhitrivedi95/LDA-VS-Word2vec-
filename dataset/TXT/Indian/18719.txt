eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Really loved the papadum they served as the bread! I have a wheat allergy so this a huge perk for me.  We ordered the rice and aloo Chloe as well as chicken tikka Masala and Lam vindaloo.  We like spice, so 7 was a perfect level for the chicken & lamb.  For the appetizer we ordered the onion Bhaji; if you like onion rings, go for it! Delicious.

The service was gentle and attentive and we had a wonderful evening.  Try this place!!
