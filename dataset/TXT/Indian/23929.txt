gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A After seeing good reviews on Yelp I went to this place. The food was no so great. It was a lunch buffet and the taste was just fine. Nothing really extra-ordinary about the place. Don't believe the reviews that it is the best Indian food that they have ever had and all that(Probably those guys have never tasted authentic tasty Indian food)
