gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A SUPERB!!!!! This food was so full of flavor and the owner and his son were wonderful hosts! We were in vegas for my birthday and I was craving Indian food so I looked on yelp and found Mount Everest. When we first arrived we were greeted with a smile and seated right away. Just by reading the menu we knew we were in for an amazing food experience. We ordered somosa, chicken tikka masala, and tandori chicken. The food was absolutely outstanding! the spices and flavors were a little spicy but too good to not eat!! Since we left Vegas I have been craving the same experience but have not been able to find something remotely close. Literally, THE BEST INDIAN FOOD I've ever had
