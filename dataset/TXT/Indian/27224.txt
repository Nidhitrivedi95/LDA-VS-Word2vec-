iJfS02AOptwkaWD-vOVRew When I entered at normal dinner time, there was only 2 other customers than my party.  I was really worried that the food would be horrible and a waste of a Groupon.  I ordered the usual dishes I would get with my parents (garlic naan, onion kulcha, mattar paneer, palak paneer, and chana masala).  Each of the dishes had an unique taste than what I expected.  It tasted different, but it was good.

My major negative is we asked for medium spice and the food was very mild.  In addition, I had to try really hard to try the garlic in the Garlic Naan.  The food comes in decent portion, but it might be a couple bucks overpriced per dish.

I would come here again to try some non-vegetarian dishes or the buffet.
