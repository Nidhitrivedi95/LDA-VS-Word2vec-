OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ This was SO delicious! Everything I tried was full of flavor; no two dishes are the same. I know virtually nothing about Indian food, but I do know a good bit about quality food, which is what I had today. The curried dishes were wonderful, and there was a chicken dish that looked like it has a dry rub on it; very red. AMAZING. The breads there complimented the food very well, and there are vegetarian options that are just as good as everything else. Make sure you try the potatoes in red sauce, the chutney and creamy yogurt sauce, and the "orange shot" drink, too! There is also a very nice, very fresh selection of salad vegetables and fruit, both beautifully presented. The service was perfect, and I loved how we were brought a lovely carafe of water. I HATE having to ask for more water. Just a perfect lunch. My husband and I went on Sunday, and the buffet was 12.95 each. Super price for healthy, non greasy food.
