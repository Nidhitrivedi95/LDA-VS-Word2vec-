GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw So I have never eaten alot of Indian food, but friends of ours suggested dinner there so we went.  I am so glad I did! Talk about delish!  The Chicken Saag was one of the best things I have ever eaten.   Prices are reasonable, service is so-so and the food=yummo.
We had chicken saag, chicken tikki masala, fish masala, garlic naan and rice.  The four of us left stuffed and happy.   It was so good, I went back the following week for lunch only to discover some terrific lunch specials.  8 bucks for more lunch then you can eat.  All I can say is "GO".
