pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Bad and slow service
The food was sweet and overpriced
The cocktail tasted like water...
We had to ask for water and the server never came back to ask us how was the dishes.

After all the server didn't feel sorry when we told him about the service problem. The owner should think about what happened about their service training.

Not gonna come back again
