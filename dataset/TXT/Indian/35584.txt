MZgIUrRRF3AuTLzbSgGEIw I ordered 1 dozen patties, and I'm hoping that this was just a bad batch. But as I ate two of the patties I must say that they were mostly patty crust with very little meat. I was extremely dissappointed and would not recommend this place to anyone.
 KMT...I still have 10 more go...
