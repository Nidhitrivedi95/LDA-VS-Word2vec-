Not too much variety, but of what they had to offer, it was all delicious and well spiced. We went for lunch this past Sunday and there were probably about 3 other tables partaking in the buffet as well. I had palak paneer, aloo gobi, chicken tikka masala, samosa, naan and gulab jamun for dessert. There's also a cold bar with chutneys and salad and fruit, but I don't bother with those fillers when I'm being treated to Indian food. As an aside, my friend and I both noticed the mural on the wall. It was really neat. Finally, I had found a coupon for Coriander in a CityPaper ad for $3 off two buffets, which brought our bill to about $20.
