RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w After enjoying the afternoon at Woodbine beach, a friend recommended this place for some decent South Asian food. We went on a Sunday night and there were several groups of friend and families waiting outside making it very promising. The restaurant is very large so we only had to wait 15 minutes which was relatively short given that there were several groups of 6 or more ahead of us. Their covered patio is one the largest I've been to in Toronto.

You write your order on a mini blackboard which is an interesting concept. We decided to do family style eating and ordered: Naan Bread, Paneer Masala, Butter Chicken, Lamb Kebabs, Chicken Kebabs, Lamb Briyani, Channa, Tikka Chicken and Falooda. 

The food was very flavourful and texturally accurate. The portions were adequate.  The butter chicken however could have been slightly juicier. It was a little dry for my liking.

The food came out quickly and the service was good.  It was a reasonable $20/person (includes tip and tax) given that we left highly satisfied and full. I recommend this place and would come back again.
