FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw For Madison, it's probably a 4 to 5 star place. By Chicago standards, it's a 3 star. For New York standards, it's a 2 to 3 star restaurant.

Whenever the menu is vast and seems to caters to wide variety of North and South Indian cuisine, I get confused. The South Indian part me inside is excited going "yay! I'm represented" then a part me is skeptical of the quality when they try to please both cuisines.  

Being with vegetarians, we tried shahi vegetable korma (this was bland and too creamy), paneer kadhi (I guess it was ok with the bell peppers balancing the spices), and the gravy style gobi manchurian ( tangy and fried balls in red sweet and sour sauce). The MIL got the masala dosa which I must say the sambar did pass for sambar.

Service was initially attentive but the food was super slow to arrive. They were rather busy with 2 other private parties going on as well

The best part was we ordered kulfi (Indian ice cream) at the end which was sooooo good.
