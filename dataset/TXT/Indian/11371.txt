afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w The quality of this food is poor.
It used to be great back in the day. It has lost its touch.
I ordered sambol (a coconut dish to compliment the larger dishes) and there were flecks of actual coconut shell...the curries taste of mostly cinnamon - wrong spice to have overpowering the curry.

I would not eat here, also for the lack of cleanliness. 

There are so many better places nowadays in the GTA to get good Sri Lankan food.
