FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q The  all-you-can-eat buffet is fun for me as a hardy, yet mainly vegetarian eater. The well-dressed waiters may look slightly disapproving if you attempt to taste EVERYTHING in one lunch hour, but they will not block your path either.  Being less familiar with Indian cuisine, I would appreciate more translation of what the colorful dishes were steaming before me.
