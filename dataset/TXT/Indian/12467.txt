aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Went here for lunch yesterday, and was very underwhelmed.   I was so excited to try it, as I love kathi rolls.  

First of all, I would not recommend this place to office workers out on a lunch break who are pressed for time.  It takes them a very, very long time to get your order ready, and it's not as if the food is cooked right then on the spot.  I had the Lahore chickpea kathi roll, and found it rather dry and dull.  Fortunately, it was not greasy or overly salted, but I was expecting much, much more flavour and interest.  

That and a pre-made mango lassi cost me almost 12 dollars!

The men at the counter spent most of their time on the phone rather than preparing food and attending to customers.
