FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Best Indian restaurant ever!! I get the butter chicken(chicken mahkani) medium spicy to hot most of the time, the vegetable pakora are the best I've ever had! I may sound over excited but you have to try this place, you won't regret it. I have been to all of the Indian restaurants in Madison, this is the one to beat. Oh, don't forget the mango ice cream tastes super authentic, it's just delightful!
