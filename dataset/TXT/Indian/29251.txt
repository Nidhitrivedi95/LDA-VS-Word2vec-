jpnts8lMTGUPvIYUj7rg1A Whoever decided to open another branch of Iman's just a five minute walk from my flat is my new best friend. Whilst threre's no denying that Newington has more curry places than it really needs, this one is definitely a keeper.

Usually I'm wary of places that offer too many different things to choose from on the menu, as it usually means that it's not going to be particularly fresh. But in this case, it just means I'll always be able to try something new the next time I come here or order a takeaway.

So far, my current favourite is the Tikka Madras Korma. Creamy and almondy like a Korma, but with some kick to it at the same time thanks to the Madras, what's not to love? And at roughly £7, depending on which meat you have it with, it's not going to break the bank either. Next time I'll be trying their Salmon Punjab Curry, which is marinated overnight according to the menu...

My one criticism though, is that they also offer pizzas. But although this gives the impression of lacking authenticity, the curries are so good that I'll forgive them.
