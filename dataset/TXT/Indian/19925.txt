FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q The restaurant is located very near to Capitol and at a prime location. The ambience is really nice, with tables organized in a nice manner. The food was delicious, it wasn't too spicy which make sense depending on the spice tolerance of various people. I got overwhelmed with the choice of desserts, mango ice cream is a must try, gulaab jamun was average, kheer, ras malai and caramel pudding was really nice.
Price: $12.50 per person on a Sunday.
