0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I am so impressed with my trip to Chaupaati. The menu clearly stated what was vegan and what was gluten-free. As a newly converted vegan, it can sometimes be stressful and intimidating going to a new restaurant. 

The people working there were more than accommodating to my dietary restrictions and the food was outstanding. I worked at an Indian restaurant during college so it was great to get some familiar tastes along with my stress-free vegan experience. 

The atmosphere is casual, you order at the front desk and sit with a number. Water, silverware, extra plates and napkins are self-serve. Bus your table when you're finished!
