112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA What an interesting place to add to Little Italy,  talk about a little diversity.  If you want to spice up your life, I would try Chutney Rolls.  It's a really unique and cozy spot with 4-5 tables inside.  There are games like battle ship and four in a row, what restaurant do you know that you can relax and play some games before your meal.  The worker did a great job explaining all of the dishes I asked about.  Since it was my first time, he was more than happy to let me try out some dishes I was curious about.

The lamb rice bowl was awesome, a little too spicy for me, but full of good flavor and spices.  I ordered an extra piece of bread and was waiting until I realized that they had forgotten about it.  He immediately apologized and offered a refund.  I just wanted the bread so I declined and he made us a new piece.  He was so sorry that he gave us free samosas.  Little bites that are breaded, basically a fried dumpling, which was pretty good as well.  This is definitely a place you can go for a quick bite or even a fun night out for board games.  The price is moderate, like a chipotle and the idea is pretty similar as well.  I would go back to this place and try some of their other dishes and mango lassi!!
