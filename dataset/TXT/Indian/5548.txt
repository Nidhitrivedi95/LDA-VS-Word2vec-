3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw There are only two types of Indian restaurants.  the hole-in-the-wall-hut or the Palace.  Kama is definitely the latter.  With large tables, pristine table clothes and servers who know how to serve.

The bufet is nothing to love though.
While the service is incredible.  and I MEAN incredible.  The food isn't as good as the Indian restos on Qn Street (Trimurti or Little India).

The only reason why you would go here instead is because they have an all you can eat dinner buffet- whcih is not available at the queen street locations.
