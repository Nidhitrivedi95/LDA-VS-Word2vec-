x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ Really need 1/2 stars here, more like 3 1/2.  This is not a Chicago restaurant  but for dumbed down Scottsdale it is decent.  At least there are some interesting choices and the food is pretty tasty.  A bit heavy handed on the salt or soy I think, but some good flavors.  I chose the hottest dished available, and they were still not very hot for me, but I could add some of the table sauces and that did it.  My hsb likes blander dishes like the stir fried beef.  The chicken and beef were good quality, not grisly like some places.  Our service was fine, we had a really pretty Indian-American girl who was on the ball.  The place was 1/2 full Saturday when we came in at 7:30 then really got busier.  Most of the patrons were ethnic which isalways a good sign.  But most appeared to be of Indian heritageor that neighborhood, not Asian.  Anyhow, we'll try it again.  There is really slim pickings wth this type of food here.
