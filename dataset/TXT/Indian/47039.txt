t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Hmmm Hmmm taking the gamble of ordering Hakka King over Fredericks paid off well.
This small unit is well laid out, clean, and their service is up to my standards.  You'd be surprised to hear that they have special promotions every week. For example,  if you purchase one order of Chili chicken ($8.95) you get the second for $5!!!  It's essentially a sweet deal that no one can refuse. Another promotion that Hakka King has available is their $30 gift card that entitles you to $50 worth of food.
We had to make a quick pit stop for more food, so it was a no-brainer to try out their dry chili chicken. This dish was a solid 4/5.   Just be sure to advise them to make your order mild as their spicy can get REALLY SPICY.
The Portion, price & quality was worth it and I'll be back to try some of their popular dishes.
