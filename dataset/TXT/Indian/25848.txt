I stopped in for the ubiquitous Indian lunch buffet, and was amazed from the moment I entered. Classy surroundings and fast, friendly service.  

Neat tables and the waiter immediately poured me a water and left the pitcher.  Which was a good thing, as the spice levels here were right on the money.  And by that, I mean SPICY!

The entrees were widely varied and contained a good mix of vegetarian to meat choices.  About half and half.  Even as a staunch carnivore, my favorite dish (of the twelve or so options) was a spicy vegan eggplant curry.

I am an avid Indian food "luncher," and stop by a "meat plus two veg sides" (Sree's or Bombay Gyro) place about once a week.  I rarely order off of the menu at restaurants due to my utter lack of knowledge of the language and cuisine.  I'd rather try a bit of everything, but never remember the names.

Everything was amazingly tasty and obviously fresh.  I loved the varied choices of rice:  a brown, a jasmine, and one with herbs and veggies.  I'm not sure of the reason, but the rices were levitating above the buffet trays on a base of saran wrap.  I almost wanted to pop it! 

The spice level can suit anyone.  I loove spicy, and I found a dish that was too hot for my taste buds. Others range from about 2 to 7, with condiments to up the heat. 

If it weren't over an hour away, I would be there weekly.
