pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Our first time at an Indian restaurant.  We had the buffet.  Everything was tasty, lots of unique items.  It was a great way to try a lot of different things without any pressure.  The poor waitress was running around like crazy, but she did a good job considering.  They need to have more than one waitress on hand during busy lunches.
