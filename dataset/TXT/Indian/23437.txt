gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Ordered the chicken tikka masala and the aloo kauli. Both were great. The tikka masala was a little two sweet for my liking but the flavor was still excellent. I ordered both dishes to go and we're both surprisingly greasy. I ordered dinner. Wouldn't mind checking out their lunch buffet to get a sampling of their other dishes
