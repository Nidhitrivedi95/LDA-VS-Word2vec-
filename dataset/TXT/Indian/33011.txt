llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Upon arrival I was surprised that there weren't tumble weeds blowing across the floor or the distant sound of crickets because it was a ghost town.  So expect to feel like you're being watched. The decor was a little much, but I guess it was "modern". ALSO, the food is not great as others may have said. I am a VEGETARIAN REVIEWER, so I got the veggie korma and a mushroom dish.  the veggie korma wasn't anything exciting. though the cheese cubes were not bad there were massive pieces of cauliflower and the most prevalent flavor was peas.......little spice.....no flavor......and the mushroom dish was terrible....but the roti was good and the service was awesome, yet these dishes made my insides hate me and I recommend that you should be wary once entering the ghost town of India Palace.
