9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g I've never heard of Chef Sanjeev Kapoor before, but since he's apparently some hotshot chef from India, I was excited to try this place out.

I had the chicken biryani and stole some butter chicken/roti from my friends who were dining alongside me. None of us were big fans of spicy food, and the restaurant really toned down on the spices at our request. Big points for that. The chicken was amazingly tender and flavourful, as was the butter chicken.

Now that I know this place is quality, I'll be sure to be a little more experimental with my menu picks next time I'm in the area.
