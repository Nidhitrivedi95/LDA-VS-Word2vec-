UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I went here with my uncle and his girlfriend when they visited from California.  My uncle liked the weekend thali special because it included a complimentary glass of champagne.  His girlfriend liked it because it was all-you-can-eat.  I liked it because even the thali special wasn't bad.  One of the dishes, the lentil soup, left a great deal to be desired, but everything else was fresh and tasty.  When the lunch special is mostly good and nothing makes you shudder, then the regular menu is usually superb.  I also like that they do a lunch-wallah card delivery service to UNLV.  I might consider it next semester.
