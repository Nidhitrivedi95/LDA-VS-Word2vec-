Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I have been here many times and every time  it has been a pleasant experience. This time I thought of leaving a review b'coz their service was exceptionally good. They were very courteous and quick and they even accommodated our dog in the outside patio. Food has been consistently good as always! We'd ordered Budha's feast and Ashoka's feast and they were very flavorful. Overall this place is great and highly recommended!
