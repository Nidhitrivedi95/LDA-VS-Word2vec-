_4UyKqVcyO8xajUgMKK-Nw I'm the friend of Max E. from above.  This restaurant really turned Indian food around for me.  I haven't had any Indian food quite as good as Nouveau Delhi yet, but I'm definitely going back to this place when I'm back in Montreal.

The service was amazing, and the food was amazing.  I can't wait to go to Montreal again!
