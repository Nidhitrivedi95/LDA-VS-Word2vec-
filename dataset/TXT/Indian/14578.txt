C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw I was stealing wifi from a nearby friend's office when we decided it was lunch time. Luuunch time. Time for lunch. Out of our way. 

We called in a take out order to Saffron Spice Kitchen, a place he was familiar with but I had passed without noticing many times. I had the butter chicken roti bowl (I forget what they actually call it) and a soup. The mulligatawny was delicious, and my box of deconstructed roti was also good. It wasn't as cheap of a lunch as I'd hoped, but there were tons of leftovers and the flavours were fresh and spicy. 

Lastly, I leave you with this ol' gem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upclJMOnlSs
