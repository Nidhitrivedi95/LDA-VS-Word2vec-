wtODHqs34RYh1Q3bEI4OUg First off the restaurant is a sort of convenience store selling cigarettes and candy etc.  Its has a dingy and drab atmosphere inside, not even a fresh smell of cooked food. The chicken kabab I had was dry and tasteless, the man preparing my kabab wrap was not wearing gloves and actually licked his fingers to taste the hot sauce I asked for as im guessing he did not even know what was inside those bottles, he then proceeded to place his licked hand under running water for maybe 2 seconds to "wash" it, didnt bother to use soap OR dry his hand and with that wet hand continued to roll my wrap. If the food was amazing I MIGHT have considered forgiving that but the whole experience was disgusting. This place is dirty, the food is dirty, and you will definitely not ever return unless you need a 5 hour energy drink or cigarettes.
