UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Best indian food ever!  If you like chicken dishes almost all of their chicken dishes have white breast meat.  The food is just amazing.  The staff are quick and efficient.  Nothing bad to say. The decor is not fancy, 
but the food makes up for it.  For a casual night out its great.
