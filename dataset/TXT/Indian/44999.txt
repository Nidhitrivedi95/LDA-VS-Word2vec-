S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA We love New India Gate! Family run, family cooked simple good food at a great price. The service is wonderful. We always few guilty about eating too much on the buffet as the price seems too low for the quality and amount. It is not fancy, but it gets simple right and that is the best thing about it.
