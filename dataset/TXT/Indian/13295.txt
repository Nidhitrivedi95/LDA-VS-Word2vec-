bfR-vJvrjdOJaWsXGJgzPA I come here about once every two weeks, mostly out of convenience, since it's near my workplace, has vegan options, and offers a decent alternative to subway/sushi/pizza options I have in the area.

Service is always friendly and helpful, reasonably quick, and they don't use a microwave to heat up your samosas - which some other Indian restaurants do in the area. Ew. 

I've had curry bowls from here in the past and like everyone has said, the curries are quite bland.  They are spiced but not really (especially if you've gotten used to more authentic little India flavours) and just generally have a "healthy" flavor to them. it's not terrible, but miss-able. 

I'd recommend the vegetable samosas instead (or get the spicy lentils as a veg dish for a closer to normal level of spice.) They do bake them - so they aren't deliciously deep fried, but still the filling is nice.

They've recently upped the price of the samosas, but 3 samosas and two chutneys will still only run you just under $5.
