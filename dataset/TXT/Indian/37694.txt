OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg Came here for summerlicious but decided on ordering off the regular menu.

Sevices was good but we were also the first in the restaurant. I typically rate service based on how often they refill my free water without asking...and they were excellent.

The Nan bread was great...I ordered two..one would have been enough since it was so large...especially if you ordered rice as well.

The beef vindaloo was good but the beef was kind of tough.

The tandoori chicken was okay...a bit dry for me.

All in all I liked the restaurant and would go back.

Not sure why I didn't rate it a 4...3.5 for sure...
