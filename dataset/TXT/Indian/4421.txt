1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g I have nothing negative to say about this place! It's really cute once you walk up the stairs. The food is very reasonably priced for the amount and quality you get. It's clean and the staff is nothing but nice and welcoming. When we go we usually order from the napalese or Chinese portions of the menu and have yet to be disappointed. I have had their napalese lamb multipal times and it's amazing, you get so many things to sample in one meal. The food is very colorful and has a verity of spices and fresh ingredients. The only sad thing I can say about this place is that every time my partner and I have come, we have been the only customers there. I wish the place was more widely known about.
