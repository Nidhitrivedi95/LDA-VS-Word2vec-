2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw I totally enjoyed meal here.  I was driving by and the sign caught my eye.  I went in and was seated right away.  my waitress was very helpful I. suggesting food options.  I wound up getting what my server suggested.  basically a spicy chicken appetizer that was great followed by a green sauced chicken dish with garlic naan.  Finished with rice pudding g dessert.  was a lovely dinner.
