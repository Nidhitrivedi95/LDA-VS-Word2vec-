DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA I had some extra time today to run down the road and get some take out Indian for lunch. It's Indian and Nepalese. 
We went with the vegetable momo which is a nice little dumpling. One order was maybe ten dumplings. Very generous and came with a nice spiced sauce. We also got vegetable curry which at medium spice was perfect. It came white basmati rice. We also went with garlic naan. It really was great and still temperature hot when I got home. Also, the man ringing me up asked if I ate meat and I mentioned I do but didn't feel like it this particular day and he went over to the buffet (they have one for lunch) and got me a small Chinese container of the lentil soup to try for free which was my favorite. I'll go back just for that comforting and velvety soup!
It's not easy to miss when driving by as it has a nice big sign. 
Enjoy!
