Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw I love Indian food; more specifically butter chicken. So no surprise I would check out this restaurant that's been highly praised. 

The cumin flat bread, fresh but far too salty for the average tongue, you're gasping for water after the first couple bites. 

Saffron rice was alright; my boyfriend loved it I thought it was just okay. But the naan (which I'm sure you can't mess up) was far more superb! 

We ordered the lamb and spinach curry and butter chicken. The lamb and spinach; surprisingly tasty- still can taste the lamby taste but quite delish. The butter chicken I must say was just okay, nothing amazing compared to Everest. 

As for the atmosphere you have to for sure bring a jacket or a cover up, absolutely freezing. I'm sure in a matter of 10 mins the curry is past room temp and border refrigerator temps. 

The service was great, very attentive and very quick but it wasnt busy (though it was a Friday) overall not a bad experience but I could say I would try other places before I go back
