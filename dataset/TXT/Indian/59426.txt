z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Went here on a Saturday night and waited around 10 minutes to be seated. The restaurant has a very rundown look to it. The carpets were all dirty black and the tables were from hundreds years ago. The menu had a hair in it, silverware wasn't clean and overall I got a very unhygienic vibe. The food was a turnoff as well. The bread basket was quite disappointing and so was the chicken tikka masala which is their signature dish. Chicken peices were very hard to break and kadai paneer was the worst I have ever had. No reason for me to give this place a second try.
