yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I bought the $25 for $50 groupon for this place so we headed over on a Saturday night. We were warned that they were busy, but they found us a reservation at 8pm. We got there at 8, but didn't get seated until 8:50, (they only have 9 or so tables, so they were turning people away left and right as we were waiting). We didn't get our food until 9:30-- I was starving at that point. The food here was very good and the service was friendly.  I would recommend this place if you're prepared to wait quite awhile after your reservation. For us, there are so many Indian places nearby without the wait, we're not planning to come back.
