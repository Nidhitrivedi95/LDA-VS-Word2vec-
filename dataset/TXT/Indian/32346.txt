LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw My family and I have frequented this restaurant for some years now. I write today because I'm always impressed with the consistency of their quality and great tasting food. This is hands down the BEST place in the city for middle eastern food! Their customer service is outstanding and welcoming. I enjoy the peaceful, friendly atmosphere with its casual vibe. If you're in the mood for tasty, food and a plethora of options this is the place for you. EVERYTHING I've ever had was scrumptious!
I would highly recommend this place to the burger fans. There's a butcher on the opposite of the restaurant, in the market. So the meat is fresh & halal. Then you can have beef bacon if you like a bacon cheeseburger. 
Also,the spicy chicken dish, tikka masala dish and lamb shank is tasty and plentiful. The portions are enough for two or leftovers. 
The people working there are informative, kind and willing to answer any questions. This is just always a nice experience m: from the vibe of the place, to the food and the friendly service. I'll be back here for years to come.
