sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I went for the first time a couple of weeks ago.  I have only tasted roti once (the west indian style), and that was a while ago.  I was just out for a stroll with my friend, when I saw a huge line up for this place.  We were wondering what all the buzz was about... we're not very tall, so we were tip toeing to see past the line up crowd.  

Then suddenly this guy came up behind us, and asked us "Hey, how long is the line up?"  We told him no idea, since we never ate here before.  We asked him if it was any good.. and his response was a shock on his face, that we even dared to ask.

Okay.  So we decided to split a roti... ordered up a mixed vegi... ooooh wow.  Talk about flavour!!  Everything about it was great.  Spices, heat (ordered medium), texture... it was a perfect dish for sure.  Portion was super large.  There is no way a person can finish this alone.  I also appreciated the fact that it was not greasy at all.  Our plate (or foil) had no grease left behind.

Next time I would like to try the butter chicken :)
