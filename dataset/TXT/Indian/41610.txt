Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I had very high expectations for this place based on what I had heard from friends who live in the area, and other Yelp reviews, but overall I was disappointed.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either, the three curries we ordered (palak paneer, eggplant, and shrimp) lacked flavour and were far from spicy (which we had asked for).   The salt level wasn't through the roof like it is at some other Indian restaurants, which is good, but the food was just bland.  The shrimp "curry" was about one spice note away from shrimp in plain tomato sauce (from a jar).The pakoras and garlic naan were delicious though.  Service was also pretty slow and confused, and it wasn't like it was a full house.  I'm glad I tried, but I will probably not go out of my way to return.
