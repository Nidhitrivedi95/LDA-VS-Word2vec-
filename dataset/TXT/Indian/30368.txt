Having eaten at every Indian restaurant in Toronto & at all the top five star restaurants when I last visited Punjab, India (2011), The Indian Kitchen has the absolute best naan's you'll ever have. Period. Thin, soft with a slight crisp, they tear & fold easy. They never get hard & are so easy to chew. Absolute Perfection!
