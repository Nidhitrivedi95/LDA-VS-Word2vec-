jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q In a bit of an unusual location on the second floor above Fresh Kabob on Sunset just west of Spencer.

Parking lot is small but there is a parking garage under the building with an elevator to the second floor.

I've only been for lunch but I can say that the buffet is worth the money and shouldn't be missed.

Great to see some good Indian in this part of town!
