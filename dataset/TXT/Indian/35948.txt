nNeckRzLfs2q9ztjfsKzgQ What??? No current yelp review on this place yet?!?! 

Came here back in May 2011 and I have to say.. this is probably one of the best Indian buffets I have ever ever had.  

Buffet encompassed a LARGE selection of choices with a vegeterian section, various chicken curries, and fresh fruits. They also had a huuge selection of various indian treats.  

It was so good I literally sat there for 2 hours eating with the cousins. This lunch was then proceeded with a long afternoon nap. =P
