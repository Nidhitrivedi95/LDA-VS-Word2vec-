Veda prides itself in serving healthy Indian foods you can take and go. Personally I usually get the samosa which there are two variations, vegetarian or chicken. They are also baked not fried which is the healthy aspect to it. I've also tried the stuff naan which was ok, the dipping sauce was really yummy.

One thing to note is that they don't always have their whole menu available. It seems that they never had the mango lassi and other things the site says it has (perhaps it's a reduced menu). Oh and they do serve coffee and have a couple of tea choices.

There are like 4 tables where you can chow down your food but i just head straight to class!
