BmFStvt6hs77XmYR7zmHtQ The veggie food was bad... like bad bad. I had Paneer mutter (paneer only on Thu Fri) & Kadhi pakoda. Paneer had stale dark pieces mixed with fresh. Kadhi pakora was tasteless... less salt, as if they ran out and added more water/ gravy to existing. The only thing I like is their fresh hot Naan. Don't take what they give u, ask for fresh from the oven.

Skip it. The fact that I am writing a review interrupting my meal proves the point.
