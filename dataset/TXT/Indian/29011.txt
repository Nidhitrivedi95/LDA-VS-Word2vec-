jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Definitely one of the best Ive ever had! Been over 25 yrs sincr Ive been to the Middle East and this brought me back! Heres the rundown. Naan bread w garlic is done to perfection,  soft hot and the finished edges done jist right! The buffet had a wonderful selection, several vegetarian items. Tandoori chicken had amazing flavor and by far best butter chicken out west. Curry goat was amazing and rice were exceptional. To top it off the runway views are awesome.   We live 120 miles away and when we come back to Vegas we will return!
