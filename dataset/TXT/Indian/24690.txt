h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw We came in for dinner, and ordered two dishes from the menu, both of which were fantastic. The waiter was very attentive, and the food came out very hot. Rice portions were small, as to ensure that it did not get cold, but more was provided upon request. 

I am a fan of spicy food, but i found a seven (scale 1 to 10) to be extremely spicy. I would not recommend going any hotter.
