03bL5yYHb-chhJwyeSAkfQ I am always on the hunt for authentic chicken biryani, and Student Tasty Biryani has put an end to the search. Spicy chicken that melts off the bone, fluffy basmati rice with the perfect blend of yellow, orange and white grains, a hint of cilantro. 

This is a small, no-frills establishment, with a very chicken-themed menu. Chicken biryani, chicken korma, chicken karahi, butter chicken, chicken tikka, chicken tikka biryani. Daal chawal is the veg option, & aloo matar keema if you like red meat. I have only had the biryani so far, but am going to eat my way through the menu and report back. 

The chef and staff are incredibly friendly. And a small army of delivery boys will bring this deliciousness right to your door.
