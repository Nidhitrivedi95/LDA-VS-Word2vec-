VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I usually get take out, however they are very inconsistent with their food. Some nights it's great, other nights it's bland. I stopped going there due to that, also I ordered rice one night and found a bug's leg in it. I have taken food back (once) due to it being completely tasteless and watery to the point where I could not enjoy it. I was told by the "manager" that I was poor and I couldn't afford to eat there. I was dumbfounded especially since I order takeout weekly and spend anywhere from 80-100 since I am feeding two. I haven't returned in over two months. I have been experimenting with other indian restaurants and have since found a place that is very consistent. I have NEVER been treated with such disrespect and I actually managed to overlook that one occurrence, however the food was lacking consistency. Some nights it was as if they gave me the leftovers from the lunch buffet. I can tell the difference, especially since I have known the owner and his brother since I was 10 years old. I was also told by a previous employee there that they re-use their lunch buffet during dinner service. That's disgusting! I hope they figure it out because it will hurt their business over time, and judging by their lack of customers when you visit....it already has.
