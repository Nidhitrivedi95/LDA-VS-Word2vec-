The food is good, not fancy but tasty. 
Order of Operations is as follows:
1.You're sat in a portable(LED Christmas lights abound), given a menu. 
2.You check the boxes on the menu to order your dinner and then bring it back up to the counter where you started.
3.Then in return for your menu you are given a number. . shortly after that dinner arrives! 
4.Bring number back up to front when you're finished eating to pay.
