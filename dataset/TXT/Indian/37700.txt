OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg THE GOOD:
Food was superb.  Had the 6 item tasting menu and they threw in a few more.  We tried everything and have no complaints.  Lighting is kinda dark which I don't usually like, but I thought it was appropriate as it kept the dining experience quiet/intimate.  Pricing was reasonable.  We were stuffed to the gills and had a bottle of wine and coffee/tea.  It came out to approx. $55 each.

THE SO-SO: None

THE BAD:  Price is suppose.  Was seriously worth it.  The food was really well prepared.
