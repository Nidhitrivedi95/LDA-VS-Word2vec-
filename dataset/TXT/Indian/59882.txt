ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Went for dinner on a Monday night......Very authentic and colorful dishes with a lot of flavor.....Chicken Tikka Masala was very tasty and rich(the way it should be)....Naan and Peas Pilau(Yellow Rice) were both perfect....Owner was very nice and attentive....This place is a much needed addition to the Vegas Indian food scene.
