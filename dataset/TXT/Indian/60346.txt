ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Finding an Indian restaurant in my new city was on the top of my list. I found this place on a Saturday cold night and we couldn't just passed by, specially when u see so many good reviews on Yelp. We enjoyed the food so much, even my one year old who has been tasting Indian food since he was in mama's belly, enjoyed it so much. They made the Tikka Massala no spicy for him and still had that delicious Indian kick. It is not close to my place but I see myself driving just to keep trying the food at this place.
