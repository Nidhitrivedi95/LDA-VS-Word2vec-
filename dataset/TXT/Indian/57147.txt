XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw I was hoping for AMAZING, but I didn't get AMAZING. I did get pretty good though. 

We got Butter Chicken on rice ($13) and Saag Chicken (12) on on rice, 2 samosas ($1.5 each), and mango lassi ($4). I have to say that the place is a bit more expensive than I expected and it definitely was not the best indian food I've ever had. It was good, the portions are big, but I wasn't wow'ed.  There wasn't a lot of chicken in the dishes either, mostly sauce, rice, and potatoes. The samosas were the most disappointing, after being nuked in the microwave. 

I was asked how spicy I wanted my food, and I said "spicy!" and the server said "are you sure? because it's really spicy" so i settled for medium. The medium was a good amount of spiciness that induced a bit of snot running down my nose, but I would have preferred HOT and have tears and snot running down my face. 

Maybe I'll go back and try their rotis
