-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g I visited this place initially when they re-christened as Nandini. Quality in lunch buffets can go south but at Nandini when I visited the following were what I found to be turn offs : 
1. They served rice in a cooker ( could have changed over time) 
2. The naans were extremely greasy and charred 
3. Almost all the curries I tried were greasy and bland 

I hope they have/ will improve and serve better food .
