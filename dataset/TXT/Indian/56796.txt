I took note of the sanitary aspects -hair nets and gloves. I get freaked out when I watch people make my food at restaurants but it was nice to know they are pretty sanitary despite the building being run down. Just in case you were worried. 

My fry bread was FRESH not greasy and bigger than my face. I got the vegetarian taco which came with hatch chili -it was a little hotter than I like but not overwhelming. The lettuce was green and cheese didn't taste low grade aka imitation cheese or a "cheese like product". But next time I will probably get the regular taco because of spice. 

Everyone was friendly, worth the price and I will definitely be back when my little mother refuses to make me fry bread. 

Don't forget to check out little art market located inside with the natives selling their bead work, pottery and jewelry.
