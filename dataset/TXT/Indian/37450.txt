OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I have mixed feelings about this place because the service was so-so. The hostess/server was friendly. The decor was beautiful. Food tasted as it should but part of our order was forgotten so instead of making our plain rice we were given masala rice instead. 

And then a strange occurrence: Our reservation was for 8:30pm which is when we arrived. We finished up by 9:15 and were chatting as we awaited for anyone to come over to ask if we were ready to pay our check. We weren't necessarily bothered by the lack of service or attention because we were in no rush. Meanwhile the entire kitchen staff of about 6 people is starting to exit and sit in the dining room staring at us but would look away if you made eye contact. Except for this one older guy who continued to stare at me without saying a word or smiling or gesturing in any manner while maintaining his gaze with me lol so I said "Hi" and he continued to stare for a few more moments without returning my greeting and then eventually looked away. The server finally came over and and took our empty desert plate and whispered shyly that they were closing as if she was slightly embarrassed to announce we had overstayed our welcome. But it was strange because we'd been ready to leave but no one came to service us after we'd finished our meals. Very odd and off putting indeed.
