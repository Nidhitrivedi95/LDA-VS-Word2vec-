h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ We ordered to go - Veg Hakka noodles was one of the items. I don't remember reading anything about spice levels regarding the item. The person who took my order did not ask me about the spice level I want. After coming home, I very eagerly opened my Togo to only find that it was the spiciest I had ever eaten. Inspite of adding 5 spoons of sugar to it, my tongue was on fire. It tasted like at least 10 or more red chillies spicy. I called up the restaurant and inquired about this. Their response was that Veg Hakka noodles is usually at that spice level. The person who took my call doesn't know who took my order. He also said he doesn't know why the other person did not ask me my spice level. This brings two points: 1) How am I to know that there is a set spice level for something? 2) If at the time of order, no spice level preference has been mentioned, why is the default spice level the highest? 3) Is the person taking my order trained enough to ask all pertinent questions? Horrible experience! If there is a chance to give 'zero', I would!
