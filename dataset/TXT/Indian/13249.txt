Ambiance is good, it's clean, well maintained and airy.
Portion was quite good (though I missed the lunch specials by 5 minutes) value for the money, chili chicken was spicy and flavour filled, with an ample serving of rice. 
They don't really check up on you if your dining in, so if you want more water or something your going to be kind of on your own. There was only myself and one other table while I was there. 
I'd go back, but maybe more for takeout.
