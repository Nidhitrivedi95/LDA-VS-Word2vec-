IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Tuesday evening - pretty dead except for one couple already seated inside. There was 2 waiters (college kids) and the owner (she was running the cash register) and came to talk to the other couple about how her place might be closing down.  I am from out of town so I guess irrelevant but anyway, even though the food was okay - the service and atmosphere was horrendous. 

The British couple sitting in there were mid meal and the man with the heavy accent was clearly plastered. He was on some crazy rant about how "STYUOOPID" Americans were because they didn't support this business or Persian food in general. He kept telling the owner that Americans only like carbs, fat, and sugar and were very stupid people. He kept going on his rant and the owner, agreeing with him kept saying that she will probably go out of business  and it wouldn't be because of the food. 

Well let me tell you sweetheart, it might be a combo of both customer service and food. The chicken kebab was dry and obviously reheated. The rice was flavorless, and the onions were also old. The only good thing was the fire roasted tomato and the beef kebab. ($22)  Now, the reason you might lose business is because of drunk, annoying pricks like that man who came into rant about how much he hates American's and America and you agreeing with him. Funny how he claimed to have money and then drove off in his red 1998 Ford Fiesta. Maybe with all his money, he can invest in your business.
