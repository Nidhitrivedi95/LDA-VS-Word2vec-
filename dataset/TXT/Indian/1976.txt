-z_DR7omzpcR__l7MbDu0A Everything we ordered was so good! Service was attentive though a little confusing as to who our server was as it changed throughout the meal. Menu has a few surprises too - like Asian-style Hakka noodles and fried rice! The basmati rice has great flavor as did my palak paneer. Definitely recommend this place! Can't wait to come back to try more menu items and the Biryani!!!!!
