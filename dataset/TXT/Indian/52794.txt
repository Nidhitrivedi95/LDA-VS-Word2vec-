V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w new management, and new food.  I can deal with a learning staff.  This was nothing like the old nirvava 2 food.  Chili chicken bland and saag paneer looked just weird.  They dont make yogurt chicken anymore.  Also went up on prices.  1* and no more visits until old food is back.  I have talked with numerous regulars that wont be returning as well after similar experiences.
