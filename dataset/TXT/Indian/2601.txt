02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Horrible food horrible service. Had something with chicken and the chicken must have been the worst part of a chicken. It was rubbery and nasty. You had to order the rice separately and for lunch it ended up being $18.00. Service was horrible. I would have rather gone to the Subway next door.
