kl3qVhrVcdKkZAHWOo1caw I've been to this restaurant many times when they first opened (which was years ago) I was in there today. I placed my order over the phone, thinking they would have the naans ready and we would just have to go in and pick out the curries. This place is a disaster when they see more then 3 people in line waiting to order. They don't have a proper system. The staff ignores one another, kind of in a way where they are showing whose "boss". I seen my naans waiting near the cash register. I paid for the food. And after 25 mins of waiting for them to proceed other orders whom were waiting for their naans to be made. They had them pick out the curries before us, knowing the fact our naans are ready and getting cold. This place was much better when it was run by the owner's family. Now it's just a bunch of young girls who have attitude issues with one another. When we got home, not only were our naans cold they were burnt as well. I hope they owner pulls this place together soon. Before they get more bad reviews for more disappointed customers.
