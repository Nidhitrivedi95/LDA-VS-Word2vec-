0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Got takeout today, after a long time and was shocked by how busy it was (1hr wait; although I don't think it is this bad on most days) 
Ordered vegetable chow mein, hot garlic chicken and veg. machurian. 
All the food was in very good quantity (expensive but worth it) 
everything was amazingly tasty. 
I have been to this place over half a dozen times in the last two years and this place always impresses.
