FGwclM_lg__75xDmXz65tg Huge disappointment. I would give it a 0 star. Ordered food and waited over 1.5 hrs for main dishes. When asked for an update on status waitress never came back to our table to provide an update. Horrible service. Food never came. We told the waiter we were going to go elsewhere for lunch.

We had 2 apps that they said they wont charge us for when asked for the bill as we were going to eat elsewhere. 

What a disappointment as the 4 of us were looking forward to it.
