NRQSeBoEyFpiGJDf3ebtyA Tried this place after my fiance raved about it. The food was pretty good. We got some chicken platters and the chicken comes fresh off of a spit and the rice and hummus was amazing. Service was very friendly and the food is all halal. Price was very fair as well. Would definitely come back here.
