2-Y-kNEbrP_m1U9Hc2xH7A WOW what a great place!

As the old saying goes... Don't judge a book buy the cove!  The building doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is very good!  The menu they offer inside the restaurant isn't as detailed as the one on the website but the food is still excellent!  The service is also very good.  The next time I am in town I'll be glad to visit a second time.
