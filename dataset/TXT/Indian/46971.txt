t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Garlic Shrimp was at level 6!  The onion and pepper were cooked to perfection.  The slice of cucumber and tomato helped cool the spicy heat of this dish--Flavored perfectly!!  Defiantly coming back for this dish!!  The Jasmine rice was the best Jasmine rice I've ever had-- I am usually a Calrose rice fan but this Jasmine has changed my mind.   Garlic nan was out of this world!!  Garlic Buttery Heaven!!! My husband had the Chicken Madras- he enjoyed it!   I am not an Indian Curry fan so I can't comment on that.  The atmosphere was nice loved the drapes and color... Nice decor for a restaurant in a strip mall.   Rajesh was charming and had great suggestions!
