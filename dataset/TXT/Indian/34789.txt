Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I rarely write negative reviews. I wanted to like this place, but the parking was difficult, the service was apathetic and blah, and the food was just "okay." Our order was of course jacked up. Then to cap it off, got to wait 30 minutes for our bill. There are a lot better Indian places within a few blocks of here. Seek them out. I gave this two stars because the food was edible. I will not be returning though.
