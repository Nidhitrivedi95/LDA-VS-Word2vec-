Unfortunately as it is the oldest Indian in town it appears to have gone into a rut of complacency.
Whilst I heartily recommend it for a standard curry their is nothing startling about it.
The Handi Buhna is well worth a try and you can order it to whatever heat level you wish. The rest of it though is as you would get anywhere else. Nothing bad but nothing special
