DzYpjCOATXKYi1IsBLSPfQ I've eaten here at least 4 times and each time I'm impressed with the taste of the food and the value of the portions. The vegi biryani is exceptional and could be a meal on its own for only $4.99. The tandoori is delicious and the aloo ghobi is a wonderful side. The take out service is always quick and accurate.
