oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q This restaurant is not conveniently located close to me but when i pass by missasauga on the 401, i tend to make a stop for it. 

The only thing that keeps me coming back is really just the fish pakora (im a sucker for good fish pakoras!), the chilli chicken was good also. I tried the cripsy beef , hot and sour soup but those are not impressive. another thing i noticed... they keep the restaurant very cold! maybe spicy food suppose to give you enough heat so you don't need to eat in a warm environment?? didn't work for me. 

still probably will return... for fish pakora.
