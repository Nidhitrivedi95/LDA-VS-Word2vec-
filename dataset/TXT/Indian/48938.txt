tt1ERGD9RSfQIwX2ANyJ1g At the Tatum store the food/service were always good.  That is no longer true.  I wanted something light, so I ordered the lentil soup.  It was extremely watery with tons of salt, in fact I think it had more salt than lentils.  The lentils were not even cooked thoroughly.  It was so bad, I asked to exchange it and they refused.
My dining companion had a rice bowl.  The rice was undercooked and barely warm.  She tried all of the sauces, and liked the curry, spinach, and vindaloo.  The masala was too sweet.
