RGhWcpC9hA2wvlWSjptxvg I'm always ordering their  patties by the box. Unlike other patties, their filling is really good. I've seen the area downstairs where they make everything and I'll give you the green flag that it's clean and the food is made the way it's supposed to be. Tried the soups and they're pretty good too. But stop by and try the coco bread with the patty too!
