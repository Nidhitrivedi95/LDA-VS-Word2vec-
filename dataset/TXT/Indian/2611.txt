02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ We came for the lunch buffet today, and after eating here, I'm pretty sure I'll skip breakfast before I come next time.  There's a huge selection of different curries served at lunch, with both vegetarian and meaty options.  The naan brought to our table was buttery and delicious, and the curries had great flavor.  My favorite of the lunch buffet items was the ground lamb with peas... don't skip that one!  

Also, you know you're at an authentic, good-quality place when the table next to you is filled with twenty Indians and there are six cute little kids sprinting around the tables.  :)

We'll definitely be back, and I'll likely fail at stopping myself from eating three plates again.
