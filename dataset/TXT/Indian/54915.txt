WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA The food was average at best. My mom and I ordered palak paneer, tandoori murgh, naan, and kesari pillau. We also ordered kheer for dessert. To be quite honest, the paneer was disappointing. It lacked seasoning, or any flavour for that matter. I personally love palak paneer when it has been made right, and I think that if its hardly passable at an Indian restaurant, you're doing something wrong. Chicken tandoori was fine, neither outstanding nor disappointing. Naan was nice; soft, fluffy and generous with the butter. The pillau was honestly just basmati rice with a few peas thrown on top. I believe the description in the menu described something much more impressive. And finally, the kheer. The rice pudding was delicious; perfect amount of sweetness and not gloopy and gummy like a lot of places will serve. My favourite part of the meal.
