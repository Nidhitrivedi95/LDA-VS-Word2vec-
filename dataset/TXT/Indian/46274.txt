sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I usually get the mild butter chicken roti and attempt to save half for another day. Not always easy to do that. :) On a very un-hungry day I got one of the small chicken tikka rolls. Great portion size but for this mild spice eater it was a little on the hot side but until the spice got to be too much it was really tasty.
