ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg We were up for the day from Charleston, SC to shop.  Since we relocated to the South from DC, we've been desperate for good Indian food.  So trusting our fellow yelpers, we walked in to Copper without a reservation on a Saturday evening.  Our waiter was especially kind and friendly.  Upon ordering, we were promptly served complementary naan with a trio of sauces, mango chutney, raita, and our favorite, the mint chutney.  We loved the mint chutney so much we asked for seconds during our meal.  The tikka masala and lamb gohst were excellent.  And to my surprise, when we opened up our to-go bag to eat our leftovers the next day, they had not only included more complementary naan, but a ramekin of the mint chutney.  Not sure if this is a standard or if they did it just for us, but it really tipped the scale.  We think that Copper rivals famed DC Indian restaurant Rasika.  We'll definitely be back the next time we're in town.
