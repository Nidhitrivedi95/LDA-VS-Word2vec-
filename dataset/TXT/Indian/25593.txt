hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Forget the location....it is non descript, but the food.....wow, amazing food, you can detect the different spices used and there is little to no oil. The selection on the menu is not extensive, but ask the Chef if you want something that is not listed. They do not rush you and service is is okay. i owuld recoemmend this palce for good Indian cuisine. Try the mango lassi....to  die for....flavorful, tasty and refreshing.
