t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg This place is sensational.  I have been looking for good Indian cuisine near me, and this place hit the spot.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy.  The meats are cooked and spiced to perfection. The curry is everything you would hope and expect from good Indian cuisine.  My favorite dish that we ordered was the combination platter of meat, which included some of the better seasoned meats I've purchased in a very long time.  My only gripe is the portions in relation to the price. It is a little pricey for the small amount of food that you get.  If the portions got bigger or the price was reduced, I would be eating here very frequently.  As is, I don't feel like spending $40 on a meal for two all that often.
