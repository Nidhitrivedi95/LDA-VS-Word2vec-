nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Based on reviews, I tried it out.  Reviews are correct that the view is deceptive.  Walked past it twice thinking I might have it wrong but then noticed all the accolades on the window and despite the place being empty I went in.  I soon was thankful I did.  Chef Dan and his partner are wonderful hosts.  The meal was a fixed selection around 3 courses but they offered me a second appetizer when sharing that my choice of dessert was not available.  The appetizers of roasted tomato soup and then the calamari were the highlights in term of taste and presentation.  Had the salmon which made for a meal fitting of their name.  Highly recommend and the bill did not reflect the quality of the food.  Will be back
