ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Food was Ok but the staff was rude. I called a day earlier to check if they'll accept a gift certificate that I had. The person on call checked with someone and confirmed that they will, but they flat-out refused to accept it the next day! And to top it, they were rude. Would never be back there. If you call the restaurant, take down the name of the person you talk to, else they'll just deny that you called them.
