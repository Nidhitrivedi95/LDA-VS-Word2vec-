2f6N22VYSwEndSq7oYL6CQ We were a group of 7, I understood the chef will need time to prepare so that all dishes can be served together, just not as long as 1h30mins I had to say. I also noticed almost every table was facing the same situation. Mango lassi tasted nice; butter chicken was my favourite. I wish I could give a higher rating since the flavour was really quite good. However I won't go back because of the ridiculously long waiting. Sorry :/
