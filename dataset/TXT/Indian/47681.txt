TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Ive been here 2 times. Not located in the best neighborhood but it doesnt bother me because when we walk in, its very clean and friendly.  As we walked in, we saw a wall full of pictures and saw the owner photographed with some celebrities that have also been there. One that caught my eye was the celeb that played the host in Slumdog millionaire. As they escorted us to our table, we get greeted by waiters that remembered us from last time. There has been a lot of customers both times we have been there but still got amazing service. 

Plus, My mother in law who is from England is very picky when it comes to food. Before she left to England we took her to eat here. 

She loves Indian food and brags about the indian food restaurants in England. But when my husband and I brought her here, she ate so much she couldnt stop saying how delicious it all was. 
The service has been super both times. 
We will be back.
