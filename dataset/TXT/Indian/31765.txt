kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA I have been coming here for years, I lived across the road in my student days so the lunch time buffet was always a go to for vast amounts of healthy food. Sadly I am never in town these days at lunch, but I have been in for their evening service many times in the last few years so my review is more focused on that aspect.

Birthday meal for the missus last night who had not been here before and is vegan, so a dedicated veg/vegan curry place was ideal. First impressions were I liked the new decor. Service was efficient and attentive.  

Now the food. I always opt for the Thali (All three courses served at once on a tray containing little dishes) in here on the a la carte, alas my favourite the southern Indian Thali hasn't been on the menu for a while.  I opted for the Royal Thali and the missus the vegan thali with popadoms to start. The poppadoms turned up with pickles and a "with compliments" ... grand. Everything was great they even presented us with a new pickle we hadn't tried before, which was sag and chilli pickle. 

The mains arrived promptly and what a feast to be presented with lots of curry options, great nan and amazing parkoras. We were too full for the deserts but tried a little of the vegan desert and the rice pud, which were very nice. The food was excellent and filling, just what we needed. One of the best Dal's I have tried. The missus loved her offerings too. The food was 5 stars for me.

The only downsides was when I paid up and left without checking the bill. It sounded roughly right but i was in a hurry.  We were charged extra for the pickles that were presented "with compliments" that we didn't order,  the service charge was on there and the beers were not terrible just not good. The taps really need run through a bit.

All in well worth a visit for the food. I will be back for the buffet one lunch time, but the extra costs lost a point for what would have been a 5 star review.
