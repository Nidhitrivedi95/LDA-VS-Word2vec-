TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA I tired their Special Thali today ( only thali on the menu ) and it was fantastic, it was a gloomy day and it was just pefect, 14 items all veggie, it took about 10 minutes to get my order ready, that is kind of odd I would say as they were not busy all all when I entered, that being said it was worth it..the food you could just tell was fresh and clean.

They also renovated, the place looks way better than before, they added some booths as well . so if you are in the mood for some spicy south indian cusine, give this place a try.


Please note: If you are trying south indian food for the first time, it is pretty spicy :)

thanks for reading 

PS. the service is a bit  odd but not rude. so dont be surpised if you find your server to be a little odd :)
