UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg While I walking along Bloor street, I was met with a sudden stabbing for Indian food and and two choices.  Madras Masala or Banjara.

Based on my previous expierences with Banjara on Yonge/Eg, I decided to go to Banjara. I got the butter chicken thali which included rice, naan, pakora and a couple of veggie curries for $11.99.

The naan was delicious however I found the butter chicken was quite westernized.  I ordered mild and when I order mild at other Indian restaurants, there is usually some heat.  There was none here.  

I think this place is a-ok for Indian food starters but if you are looking for very authentic, this may not the place.  So give it a try if you have friends that are apprehensive about Indian food, otherwise there are better options.

Other pro's: service is great, nice ambiance.
