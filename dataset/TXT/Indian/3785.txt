0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Have had the buffet three times now and I am amazed that each time was equally delicious. Have brought  friends and we all agree its the best Indian food that we have had. The tandoori chicken is delicious and its whole meaty pieces. The chicken Korma is one of my favorites of the meat entrees and love the  paneer and there are a number of vegetarian entrees as well .  The desserts are also lovely and they have flavorful rice pudding, mango pudding and a number of unusual treats to try........ Also food was served fairly hot which was really a plus when you consider how many restaurants do not keep their buffets hot enough, 
I will definitely be going back again.
