Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ Terrible food, expensive, extremely poor service.
Spent $50+ there and received mediocre food at best. Would not recommend, worst decision ever to try out a new place. Many positive reviews are fake, or paid for by management to manipulate their ratings, the whole retaurant is a ghost town, see for your self.
