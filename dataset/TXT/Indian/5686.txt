But if have a slightest, a sliver of idea how Indian food should taste then you will absolutely hate this place and will never ever go back. With that said as you can tell by my name I am knee deep familiar with this kind of food I will never ever ever ever ever go back to this restaurant. To sum it all up the food was really bland and tasteless even though I ordered extra spicy when I was asked by our waiter what level of spicy ness I like. I literally washed down my mix grill Platter with lots and lots of Diet Coke and nan. One last note to the owners please do not put dishes on your menu that you never serve, this was my second time (1st time I only called to ask) that I asked for pomfret fish and I was told they don't have. 
Glad I can check another restaurant in the valley that I will never go back to
