x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ I have been here twice and made one attempt to get an event catered. This review combines all. 
The food is good. If I could split the stars between food and service, the food would have got 4.5 stars out of 5. A ding of a star for portion size. It is small. In the overall review, the two negative stars above are for the customer service and portion size, specifically, when you try to cater an event. The portion size for the catering menu claims it can feed 10 people for $100 for a vegetarian menu and $130 for a Chicken menu. Our event headcount was 15 and we decided to order one of each, total would have been $230

We attempted to reach the manager. We were told that he was not in the office and our contact info was noted. The guy did not call back. On the fourth try, we got hold of him.

The manager said that though the menu said 10, the quantity in the tray would not suffice ten people. It would be half of a half tray...( whatever that means). If it says 10, it should suffice 10 at least, if not more. 

He recommended that we order 2 appetizer 2 entree 1 rice 1 noodle for $320. Delivery charge is $75. We asked why we could not order exactly as per the catering menu, only to be told that "he did not work that way" and also asked to place the order right then and now, since he had a lot of orders. It seemed that he did not want my business. Message taken.
