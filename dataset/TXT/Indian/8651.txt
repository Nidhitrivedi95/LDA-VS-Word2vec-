7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA Came here on a cold night after going to the Bell Lightbox.  We were quickly welcomed and offered a choice of seats.  The staff were friendly, helpful and not overbearing.  The decor is quite pleasing, not loud and no Bollywood tunes playing.  Great menu selection, the usual chicken dishes plus goat, lamb and lots of vegetarian options.  Everything was delicious and leftovers were wrapped up for us. I enjoyed a chicken and spinach dish with lovely spices, so much flavour.  Very reasonable price.
