iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Food : Very tasty delicacies! We ordered Pani Puri as Appetizer and Aloo Naan, Onion Naan, Paneer Tikka Masala for main course. Each dish was great! The Pani Puri was slightly off (we've tasted better) but the rest of the dishes were spot on! Such soft naans and creamy gravy! I specially liked that you can pick a gravy/sauce as base and add veggies/paneer/chicken/meat of your choice to it. Made to order, and yummy!!!
Service : Excellent! Very attentive staff.
Ambience : Good decor complimented by Indian paintings and photographs. Indian music completes the experience
Price : Competitive to other Indian restaurants. Sizable portions and taste make it worth paying slightly more too.
Parking : Big lot outside
Overall : Great! Definitely making this a regular!
