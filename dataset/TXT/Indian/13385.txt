bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug I'm not the biggest fan of Chinese food, but my family is and I've eaten it countless times throughout my life. I lived in Harlem, NY for a while and grew a love for Chinese food but couldn't find anything in Toronto that tasted as good until I came here. Comparing it to the many hakkas in Scarborough, such as Lin Garden, Hot Wok, Lucky's, Chinese Halal, etc. this is the best restaurant hands down! I don't know if It's because I'm pregnant why I eat their food all the time, but it tastes amazing compared to everywhere else. I would go once or twice a month, after my OB appointment lol. I haven't dined in, but I would love to. Their dine-in section is nicer than the other restaurants I mentioned. It's actually presentable and clean, but it takes up space from the take-out section lol. I saw in previous reviews that it isn't a place to have a first date, but they've renovated since then. Anyway, I don't usually rate things 5/5 but this place deserves it. Their service is great also. And they give you a discount for using cash. My favorite dish is the General Tao Chicken. I have yet to try the Chili Chicken and Chicken Pakora.
