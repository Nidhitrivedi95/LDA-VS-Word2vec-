RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA Loved it! Absolutely LOVED it!
The BF and I went here over the weekend and it was wonderful. We started out with the chicken samosas. I would have probably preferred the traditional potato and pea, but the chicken was still delicious. Delicious enough that I finished mine first and kinda wanted to grab his and run out the door with it. For our entrees he got the Tandoori grill, which is basically an amazing array of MEAT! (when you see this plate, you'll understand why it cannot be called just 'meat'.) Now, I am by no means a vegetarian, but when we are taking Indian Cuisine, I usually opt for a veggie option. Simply because they are so good. While I can say his was a carnivore's delight I prefer something to accompany my MEAT! He suggested I get the Tikka Masala, so I did. Words cannot describe how much I loved this Masala. I would have to create a new word, like fanterrifayummuniciuos...ness. I wanted to lick the bowl, and then ask if I could lick the pot they made it in. He had the kheer for dessert. It was pretty good but I was still obsessing about the Masala, so I'm not sure I got the full effect. The service is mostly provided by an older Indian couple (I assumed the owned it) and is exemplary. Now, it was empty on a Saturday night, (which makes me nervous) so it should be exemplary, but quickly you realize that most of their business is take out. Eat in or Take out, but I would seriously try this place. 
*Although we did not get it, I would try the dinner for two. It comes with tandoori chicken, a meat dish, a veggie dish, dal, rice, kheer and a tea of some kind- all for $36!*
