GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g Features a very large menu with lots of choices almost all between $7-$9.  We each had a Dosai and a Samosa. Everything was very good. The Dosais were large and filling. All the chutneys are free with the food. The mango lassi was delicious as well. We'll definitely be going back to try more. Great for lunch or dinner. At some point I'll try one of the lunch combos which sound like a great deal.
