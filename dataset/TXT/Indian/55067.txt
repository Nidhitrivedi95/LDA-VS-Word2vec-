Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I love Indian food! And I've had a lot of Indian food regularly though out my life in many countries. Delhi Palace Cuisine serves very good North Indian food it's as simple as that. It is reasonably priced too.

I went there for dinner with a few friends of mine after one of them boasted "I'll take you to the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix!" He's probably right.

We shared the food so had the beef biryani which was very good, the chicken tikka masala which was great, its a creamy dish as it's supposed to be but they didn't over do it as some places do. so don't feel guilty about ordering it. The Tandoori chicken was excellent and I'm picky about tandoori chicken. They have  a decent vegetarian section but I only tried the Palak Paneer & it was some of the best I've had; even though it's not usually my type of dish.

I didn't like the Ice tea though, it tasted like it had some special spice or something but serves me right for ordering Ice tea at an Indian restaurant. The garlic nan was good too.

The atmosphere is typical for lots of indian restaurants. It doesn't feel like a cafeteria or anything like that but it's not going to impress anyone or wow your date. But it's comfortable, relaxed, unpretentious and true/authentic to the type of restaurant. There were a few indian couples around; always a good sign.

The service was excellent; they didn't interrupt the conversation as I've found happens too often in US restaurants these days, But they were always there; prompt ready to serve & respond. I didn't feel rushed either.

In a nutshell, if you want to experience tasty authentic north Indian food and enjoy your meal & company check this place out. I'm definitely coming back.
