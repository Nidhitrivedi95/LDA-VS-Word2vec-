xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Diarrhea & Extremely Upset Stomach.... I am serious. Both my wife and I. I've been to Leela's for lunch before on my own without issue. This was Saturday night, 7- 8pm or so. They looked like they were preparing for shutdown soon, vacuum was brought out, a good sweep was being done in the dining area. Still taking orders and a few people were seated. My wife had the Chicken and I the Goat Roti. My wife's looked strange as the Roti was wrapped really loose, the cornmeal inside seamed excessive although it all tasted normal. 2 hours later her stomach started. Mine shortly after hers.
All Sunday confined to the home with multiple trips to the toilet thanks to the diarrhea. I often eat many spicy foods, with curry as well, no allergy here, ever before. Bad food poisoning, period. We may have got the bottom of the pot seeing it was late. Whatever the case, poor cleanliness or old food late in the day, it's no excuse. If you are serving food, you better make sure it's clean and handled appropriately. Thanks for giving us the loose stools Leela. Here I am Monday, two days later and still feeling the unsettling in my stomach, on the road to recovery though. Never Again Leela's !!!
