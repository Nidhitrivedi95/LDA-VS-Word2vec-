TWmfrj9DjmG_B28j6cU6Zg We started going to this restaurant about two yeard ago for Saturday or Sunday for Gobi Prantha breakfast special. Pranthas were made with TLC with all the typical spices, ginger corriender eyc. The Gobi stuffing was plentiful. One Prantha with yogurt would leave you totally satisfied
Alas! Like most Indian Restaurants, success usually leads to quality deterioration and significant increase in prices. Pranthas are half the size and about 50% more expensive.  Last time we went, there was no ginger or corriender in Pranthas. But still their vege buffet  is pretty good.
