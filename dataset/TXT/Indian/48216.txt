TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA I am a big Saravana Bhavan fan. Back home in India as well as here. new to Mississauga. food is good. enjoy the buffet specially. Thali with tiny cups and variety dishes is another favourite specially the vata kolambu. I love the cabbage curry too. 
samabr vada is another favourite. 
I was wondering about the tip money I left for the server. I did not see the server come back for it. but supervisor/manager lady took the money and went inside. I am wondering how much does the server get? I went twice after that day, but did not find the server who had served me. other restaursnts have a tip collection box and the money goes there. 
I was charged extra for a coffee I did not drink I brought it to their notice and it was taken off without an apology. 
well, I love the food, and I am willing to overlook these thing.
