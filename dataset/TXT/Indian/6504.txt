3r5FidzFQ9rfAoQOtixfxA So far my review is related to the samosa chaat (4.5/5) and peshawari chapli kabab (5/5 - my parents). Oh man both were amazing! In regard to the samosa chaat, the size was generous, the quality was great, and the price was very reasonable ($3.99). I unfortunately did not try the kabab myself, however it was met with nothing but praise from my parents! 

Moreover... what made me really unhappy was that my sister placed an order for pick up 30 minutes in advance, and even though there was no line up, we had to wait an additional 5 minutes upon arrival. I suppose compared to the overall experience this was negligible - albeit I hope this does not become a frequent thing. 

Nonetheless, I will definitely drop by again to try other items on the menu! Thumbs up for the great food!
