9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw BEST IN TOWN A MUST TRY!!!! This is hands down the absolute best Indian in Vegas. I'm so so happy to see them on the west side finally:) We always used to drive 30+ minutes to the east location. 

Everything on the menu is amazing . If you have never experienced Indian food I assure you that you will undoubtedly be coming back once you go here. I have listed my favorites below: 

Chicken Tika Masala 
Chicken or lamb Korma 
Any of the Naan breads (garlic is my fave)
Samosas -any 
Lamb paneer
