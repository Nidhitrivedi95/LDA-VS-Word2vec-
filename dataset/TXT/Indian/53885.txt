VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ We had the lunch buffet today and it was delicious. The restaurant was sweltering, probably in the mid to high eighties when we entered. We asked them to please turn the air conditioning on. We were seated and said hello to a male server who did not acknowledge or answer. We got glasses of water and a basket of garlic naan and there was no service after that. That server, he may be a manager, never came near our table again until we had finished when he came by and threw the bill on the table and never said a word. We wanted some more naan and the male server had baskets that he was giving to other patrons but never offered to us. I was even waving to him that we would like some more naan but we never got any. I know the owners of this restaurant. The food servers do not get to keep tips. The tips are rung up and put in the cash register, and the servers are simply paid a higher hourly wage. This is not a good system for good customer service. We will give Guru Palace a little break for the rest of the summer and go back in the fall when hopefully this food server has moved on to some other job.  The food is delicious but I am not going to be treated like a piece of dirt by a surly busboy/waiter.
