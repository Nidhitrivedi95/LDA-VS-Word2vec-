S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA We love this place! The brothers who own it are very friendly and the service was great! Food on the weekend lunch buffet was fantastic! Some of the best naan I've had in awhile. Only strange thing was ice in the mango lassi... now that we know we'll order without. Chicken curry was out of this world! The entire place was very clean (something not always found in Indian restaurants.) We'll be back for sure.
