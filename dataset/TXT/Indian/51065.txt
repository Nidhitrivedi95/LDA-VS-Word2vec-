UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I am sorry to say that the people who have written awesome reviews for this place have probably never eaten good Indian food before. Food coma is what you get after a large satiating meal, and FOOD TRAUMA is what I would call our experience of eating here. Karahi Chicken wasn't anything like I have ever eaten before: more like slushy tomato paste with few pieces of boiled chicken and mustard seeds thrown in together. Naan was burnt and soggy, seemed like they had thrown frozen pieces from the grocery store into the oven. Tandoori chicken was burnt with a bitter taste. Masala Chai was probably the only saving grace. And to top this, our bill came to 40$ for 2 people for the worst Indian food I have ever eaten in the last 6 years in the US! This place should be reported to the local authorities for being such a disgrace to Indian food.
