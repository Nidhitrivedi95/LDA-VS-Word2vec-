aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q Like others have said, it is a cute Mom and Pop place. The husband and wife that run it are super friendly. Their menu is a bit hard to read and understand. So every time I go, I ask for a mix of vegetarian items, they always give me great stuff. The Channa Masala is so great! The portions are huge and prices are small. Oh get some naan too, its delicious!
