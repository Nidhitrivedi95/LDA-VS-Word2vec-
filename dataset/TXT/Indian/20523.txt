fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw I visited with CM for lunch a week ago at 12:30.  I'm not a huge fan of buffets in general, but the positive reviews and word on the street convinced me to give this place a try.  CM was game, so we met there to enjoy some quality Indian cuisine.

As a regular at Prince of India, CM was impressed with the range of options available on the buffet, which put theirs to shame.  I was as well, with the caveat that, as Lauren B. mentioned, all the meat items were chicken-based.  While this wasn't too much of an issue for me, since I'm picky when it comes to meat, I can see how lovers of lamb and goat might find it off-putting, and even I would have appreciated the ability to try the fish curries that other reviewers speak highly of.

For a buffet, we felt that the quality of the food items was good, though nothing in particular stood out.  The only item I found lacking was the rice pudding like dish--but then again, I'm not a huge fan of rice pudding, anyway.  The price for the weekday lunch buffet is now $10--not $8, as it used to be.

As others have mentioned, the seating area is on the smaller side. It wasn't busy when we visited, however--perhaps because the word hasn't spread about this place yet?  At any rate, we were pleased with our experience here, and would return the next time we're hungry for Indian food at lunch.
