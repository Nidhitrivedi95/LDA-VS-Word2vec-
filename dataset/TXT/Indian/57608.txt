yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I don't understand how the place has got such nice reviews. Just landed in Arizona and thought of trying something based on reviews. 
The place is not even worth 1 star. 
We ordered lahsuni chicken kabab, Punjabi chole, biryani and naan. 
The Chicken kabab seemed like an old boiled chicken tossed on stove on order. It did not taste or look like barbecued. We did mention the same to the owner but she denied it blatantly. Additionally they added some awful color which is not even added to a lahsuni kabab. 
The Punjabi chole was not at all made with Punjabi spices. Moreover the chole was not properly boiled. 
Everything seemed to be stale, heated and brought. over. The only thing edible enough was biryani.
