GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I've eaten Indian food one other time. It was buffet style- ok, but... Curry Corner is a sit down, order from the menu and I simply do not have a metaphor to describe how good it is. We ordered: (spelling?) tandoori  chicken, masala chicken and a thick lentil soup- don't know the name. Our meals came with long grain white rice and nam. The tandoori chicken came sizzling to the table, perfect char, covered with onion and bell pepper slices. It was unspeakably good! The lentils over white rice was a perfect side. The rice was plentiful and steamed (I assume) correctly. The nam was sprinkled with cilantro, there was more than enough and it was amazing! Now for the Marsala chicken. Served boneless in a red sauce, I couldn't believe how good it tasted! It had a flavor that imprints on your mind. Slightly spicy but no way over powering, since I'm a novice with Indian food I am unable to identify the ingredients. Let me also say; in my opinion, when one eats at an 'ethnic' restaurant and 40%+ of the other customers are of that ethnicity, you can pretty much bet you are getting the real thing! My only thoughts on improvement would be the chai tea didn't seem to have the sweetness I'm used to and I like to listen to the music from the country with the food I'm eating- just me... Curry Corner- you win! One more thing before I go; I usually try to take a photo or two but when the food came to the table, photography was the last thing on my mind
