Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q Having recently moved to the neighbourhood, I was hoping to find a nice Indian-style restaurant. I tried Banjara and found it to be lacking, so I was glad when I noticed Indian Grill on Ossington.

Indian Grill is a smaller and modestly-decorated Indian-style restaurant, with good service, good food, and a relaxed atmosphere. Our server was very accommodating, offering to separate tables so we could sit by the front where the floor-to-ceiling window opens--fully being able to enjoy the evening breeze while watching everyone go by. He was always very quick to refill our water, brought our dishes in good time, and was very friendly.

The wine and drinks menu is generous, and the dinner menu had just enough selection so as not to be overwhelming. My only request about the menus is that portion sizes be added. We ended up ordering much more food than we had intended; we could have done with one order of samosas which comes with two, but the menu said "samosa" so we ordered one each, and we asked for an order of rice each, while one would probably feed about three people. Of course, what we did order was delicious (the samosas had great flavour, but were salted too much on the outside). I highly recommend the chicken bhoona and Kashmiri naan!

Overall, I will definitely be going back to Indian Grill. The sign outside says they offer free delivery, so I'll be sure to take advantage of that as well. Recommended!
