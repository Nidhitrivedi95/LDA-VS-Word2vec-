wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw At first I was reluctant in trying this place even though I had a Groupon. There were many negative reviews from Yelp. 
I tried and was pleasantly surprised by the quality in food and service. The service was great. I had the brother-in-law and Freddie who help with the menu. Food was tasty. The chicken was moist and delicious. 
Definitely a little on the expensive side but Groupon alleviate a bit. Will definitely return . 

Side note - You can't combine the Yelp check-in and Groupon.
