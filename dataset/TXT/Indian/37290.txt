O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Great place for Indian/Nepalese food. Definitely recommend the naan, probably one of the best naan I've had in NE Ohio. The one thing I love about this place is how spicy the food was. I've been to many places in Ohio that claims that their food is spicy when in reality is not for me and this place was spot on. Staff and service was great, clean. Location isn't the best for them as it prevents them from getting a lot of the visibility but I'm not going to complain if they remain open and continue serving delicious food.
