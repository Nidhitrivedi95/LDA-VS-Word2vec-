H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ I took my parents yesterday for a dinner. They gave us the table right away but it took another 10 mins to come back with a menu. We looked at the menu and were ready to order in 5 mins but no one would come to table to take the order. Another 10 mins later waiter came with Papadum and Chutney... Took our order... Than the waiting was unbelievable as I asked the waiter and the manager after 30 mins where is our food... And the interesting part was that another family who came after us and order after we ordered but their food was served within 25 mins... Finally, after 50 mins part of the order was served and waited another 12-15 mins to get the remaining order. Service was horrible and had to asked them twice to get us pickle and onions. The food was terrible...despite telling them medium spicy the food was tasteless. It felt like it was warmed up in the microwave and served except garlic naan. I am not sure why the owner is not taking any action to improve the service.
