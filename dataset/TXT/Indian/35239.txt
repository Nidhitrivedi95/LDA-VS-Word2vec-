MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg We get appetizers and sweets from here on a regular basis. You have to obtain a ticket and wait for your number to be called so it's fairly organized. The food is great and it's a good place to purchase bulk samosas and other appetizers for parties and get togethers for a very reasonable price!
