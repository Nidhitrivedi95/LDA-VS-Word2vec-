GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Yes, they have a dinner buffet, but even for this Indian buffet devotee it was bit too pricey and not up to snuff visually. Everything was the same shade of brown, and the overall impression was that the food had been out for a decent amount of time. Plus, there were few vegetarian options. which are generally my favorite! Thus, we decided to order off the menu, which is a rare occurrence when I step into an Indian establishment.

The most impressive thing about Bombay was our server. He was impeccable. He had worked at another restaurant in town for a brief period of time, and he remembered my name and my husband's occupation. He was incredibly kind and attentive. He recommended the mixed vegetable curry and paneer tikka masala. For $2 extra you get a combo with rice and naan, which brings each entree to around $14. 

When the naan first arrived, it was clear we had been served a reheat. As soon as we said something, our server whisked it away and soon returned with hot from the oven, fresh naan. The new naan was good. As for the entrees, the tikka masala was definitely the stand out. I would order it again. However, the mixed vegetable curry reminded me of a Haldiram boxed meal. These meals aren't bad, but when I eat out, I expect a bit more. Some of the vegetables were canned, and the curry flavor didn't seem unique. 

On an interesting side note, if you're looking for big, black leather booths (this seems to be a common Vegas request), they have them here. Of course, the fluorescent lighting and Indian fare probably aren't really vintage Vegas. 

On the Strip and are craving Indian? This will get the job done.
