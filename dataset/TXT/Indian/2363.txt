_qQYIW24-8nWwjg9-uL0LQ Excellent Indian food!  I love the fact that they deliver to your hotel room at the Toronto Pearson Airport.  I was on extended stay for business and this restaurant was one of a few that will deliver to your hotel.  Perfect when you want a change from the expensive hotel food. The food was hot and very tasty.  Delivery staff friendly.  Highly recommend.  See "Just Eat" for delivery option.
