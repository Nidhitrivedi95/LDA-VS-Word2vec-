f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I seldom give five stars but the food at this place almost warranted it.  We had the buffet and both of us enjoyed it.  The food was fresh, flavorful, with a good selection.  They had some of the best goat  I've had in years.  We went on a Friday and somebody said they had a better selection than during the week The chicken was ok. They had two or three vegetarian offerings. After the Buffet; next to it is a place that has the sauces (yorgurt/green) for your food and also a rice pudding for dessert. There weren't any dishes for the pudding when we were there but the man at register got some bowls.

When you come in there is water pitcher and some glasses for you to get water.  And then just head to the buffet.  I haven't ordered off the menu  perhaps someday I will.  

There is one bathroom for both genders.  It was clean and tidy though.  

This is a casual place with good food and I am planning to go back someday
