B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Excellent food, attentive staff. I really enjoyed all the vegetarian options, the vegetables masala was flavorful without being too greasy. The vegetarian appetizer platter was perfect for 2 people, lots of food and variety and everything was super tasty. I felt very lucky to eat on the patio there, today as well. The garlic naan was great. I didn't feel like we overpaid.
