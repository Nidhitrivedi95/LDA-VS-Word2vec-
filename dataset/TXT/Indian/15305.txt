CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ Some of the best Indian food in town, with a good vibe. I always order a lassi when I'm there. Ordered a special for under $10, and shared it with another girlfriend. The joy of it is you can try a little of every sauce, curry, yogurt variety. Just the meal itself is a colour of joy
