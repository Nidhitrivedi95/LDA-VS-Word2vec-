Qzq-m_TKJ-Iv1BmYLcjlVA After eating the food at Epicurean at Niagara on the Lake today which was just awful (see my review), I wanted to eat some great food on the budget.  We've been to Spicy Drago because they are just AWESOME... They get 5 PLUS STARS FOR FOOD!! 5 PLUS STARS FOR PRICE!!  
This place is not the place to go on your first date.  This is a bare bone hole in the wall.  But the food is just SUPERB!!! We go there every week and they have never disappointed us.  The price is very reasonable but the portions are HUGE!!!  So if you go there, don't order too many dishes.  Oh and they give you 10% discount if you take out.  They are also very fast and each dish is made to order.  Nothing is microwaved or reheated.  They have the best Hot and Sour soup and at $6.50 for a big bowl that is enough for 4 people...that's a great deal.  
Their Spicy Dragon Chicken is to die for......Love this place.
