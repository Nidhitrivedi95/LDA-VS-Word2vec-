WCW9a5AfUlyx98Ul-hRMHg This is a great little South Indian place. 

  I've ordered the dosas which I would recommend.   The dosas are large and pretty filling.  The food tastes fresh and doesn't have a lot of oil added to it which keeps it healthy.  

As the previous reviews have mentioned the prices are very reasonable.

The owners are a super friendly older couple.   I am really rooting for this place.
