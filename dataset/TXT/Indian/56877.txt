xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I'm no Dodger fan, but we had to come here after reading about the restaurant on Andre Ethier's blog.  Ethier plays outfield for LA, and he has roots here in Phoenix.  I ordered almost exactly what he ordered, it sounded so good.  And it was!  I don't think I've had better hominy stew. And this was my first time eating anything quite like the fry bread with red chile. I probably made a big mistake ordering so much, but I didn't have any idea there might be a half pound of meat in there. The cooking is high quality, the experience definitely original, and the atmosphere is very comforting, being in a remodeled house.

Alas, there is a downside. I generally have a strong constitution. I eat street food in Mexico as often as I can get there, and usually with no ill effects. But the Ethier special had me reeling. Not in the many-unscheduled-bathroom-trips kind of way, but I felt bad and was belching uncontrollably for about the next 24 hours.

I really like the Fry Bread House.  I'm just not sure it likes me.
