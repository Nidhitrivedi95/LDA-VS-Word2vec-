FlVOC0CfQzf_Fd5TlhHfGw We'd intended to try this place for a long time, and finally one night when I was seriously craving some Indian, we decided to give it a spin. The atmosphere is great - very clean and well decorated (it doesn't really smell strongly of spices like a lot of Indian restaurants I've been too). 

The staff was extremely friendly and very attentive. Our dishes were fantastic and we were both very pleased with the quality and taste of the food. The portions were great and we were able to share our meals with one order of rice, which is great since I find at other places you usually each need your own order of rice. 

Our food came out quickly, and we were not rushed through our dinner even though we left only shortly before their closing time. We were too full to order dinner, but the waiter brought us out some sort of mango puree dessert in shot glasses to try, on the house. It was delicious and confirmed that we'll be having dessert the next time we visit.
