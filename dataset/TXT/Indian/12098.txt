auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Just had Christmas dinner catered by Taj Palace last night and it was wonderful.  The food was delicious and perfectly spiced.  The team that came in was efficient, polite, and did a great job setting it up and making it easy for us.  We've had other Indian restaurants cater for a party before, but this one has been the best one so far and we would use this again.  All of our guests commented that the food was great too!
