The atmosphere is very different from the Indian restaurants  I've been to before, but it is very comfortable nonetheless, not like an authentic Indian restaurant, but more like a Indian version of Milestones! Whether that is appealing to you or not, the food is fantastic, just as good if not better than other places we've tried.  We had chicken tikka and lamb vindaloo; both had ample portions of tender meat and delicious flavors. This would be a great place to take a date: Romantic atmosphere with dim lighting. Everything was well presented and the price was right. Very nice overall, clean and meticulous with friendly, attentive service.
