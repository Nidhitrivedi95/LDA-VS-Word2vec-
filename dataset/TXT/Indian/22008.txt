GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I was greatly impressed. My mom and I went here a little after they opened for dinner and it was absolutely wonderful. We both are "kind of" experienced with Indian food...but not really. So it was really great to have a server who was intelligent, patient, and genuinely nice. 

The restaurant was very open, colorful, and comfortable. The food was delicious. My mom had plenty of meat-eating options and I had plenty of vegetarian options. Hint: skip the salads and appetizers to have room for dessert. The rice pudding is cool and refreshing and not like any other rice pudding I've ever had. Expect to pay about 10 bucks for whatever main dish you order and everything else is awesomely inexpensive...like 2 bucks or so for sides and desserts.

I absolutely loved this place. It is good food for the die-hards and good service for the new, shy foodies who are just getting into Indian cuisine.
