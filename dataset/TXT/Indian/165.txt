-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g We went for dinner with a Groupon and were pleasantly surprised!  Good food and service.  The shrimp tikka masala and shrimp tikki masala were great!  very flavorful and big portions.  The Garlic naan was really good too.   I took half mine home for next days' lunch.   I asked about the rice and once I understood it was an additional price, we went for the veggie biryani which complemented the meal.  I would recommend this place
