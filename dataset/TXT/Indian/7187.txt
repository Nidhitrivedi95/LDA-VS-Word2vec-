The samasoas were crispy and fragrant and very filling. The chicken tika was nicely marinated and came out super quick. They also brought out an order of the onion rings complimentary for us to try. Honestly they was on the mediocre side all things considered. Service was great and I'm sure the food will improve once the restruant fully opens.
