Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Tried tonight for the first time. We had the Bhuna Boti lamb appetizer which was excellent and the ordered the Tamarind Lamb Curry which was exquisite with just the right amount of spiciness! We finished the meal off with the Kulfi traditional Indian ice cream that is infused with Cardamom spice! We will definitely be coming back to try their other dishes! Wonderful wait staff also!
