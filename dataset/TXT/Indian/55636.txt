I was really excited to try this place because of their indo-chinese selection.  They have a vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and even vegan menu! Love that they appeal to all types of diets. 

Appetizer: Corn Soup and Chinese Behl
Both were delicious, but I wish the behl was spicier. I was impressed how long the behl stayed crispy. 

Dinner: Hakka Noodles and Manchurian
The noodles were just as I expected, but were too bland for my taste. I was completely disappointed in the Manchurian. It was soggy and had no flavor. 

TIP: If you like very flavorful and spicy food look for items on the menu that are "tangy."

Overall, I'm sure there are hidden gems on their menu because the restaurant smelled phenomenal. I would give this restaurant a second change if I was in the area, but not go out of my way for.
