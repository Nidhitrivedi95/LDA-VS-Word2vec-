kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w Visiting Charlotte for the weekend and participated in the Tour de Food event which featured this restaurant. The restaurant was clean, quaint with nice ambience. The food was very good and since it was lunch time, they featured a buffet which allowed us to sample many of their items. The curry chicken and tandoori chicken were excellent and the other items were very good as well. If you're in the mood for good Indian cuisine, this place is definitely worth a visit.
