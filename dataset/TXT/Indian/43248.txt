RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg We ate here quickly before heading into Penn & Teller.  I chose Indian because as a vegan, there is generally meat-free stuff on the Indian menu.   The service was stellar, the ambiance was lovely.  The food, not so much.  I had Eggplant Bhata and though I asked for extremely spicy, the governing flavor was salt. It was nearly inedible.  For the value of my few bites, it was a very expensive fail.  We would have done better at a storefront Indian place.   My sons and husband had just okay food.  We don't need to go back.
