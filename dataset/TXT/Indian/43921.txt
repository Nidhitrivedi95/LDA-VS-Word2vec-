RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w The food is very bad and unhygienic. We ordered paneer tikka masala.that was really bad inly 6 pieces were there and it was not worth and the rest of food like green boneless chicken and lahori kabab were also tasteless.i was very disappointed and my bill was $40. Too expensive
