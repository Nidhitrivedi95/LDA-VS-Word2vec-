CHrH99pDvs_jPA22o1xBAA Looks are deceiving. The restaurant looks quite expensive from the outside, and sitting smack bang in the centre of town you'd think prices would reflect its location. However, a decent meal will set you back less than £15 per head. The restaurant is large and well-kept; my last visit saw the tables packed. 

Varied selection of favourite curries on offer. All dishes ordered were destroyed in about fifteen minutes with lots of head nodding, so the grub definitely hits the spot. 

I suspect the desserts are bought in so I steered clear of them and opted for a mango lassi instead - delicious! 

Good option if you are looking for a half-decent curry that won't break the bank.
