UadX71pjUtIDHaR61qTx3w This review is for their Greenfield park restaurant. Went there with friends, service is quasi I existent and very very very poor. Food does not seems to be fresh. We didn't even got our appetizers, lamb was undercooked and butter chicken was super oily. This is far from being Indian food it's junk!
