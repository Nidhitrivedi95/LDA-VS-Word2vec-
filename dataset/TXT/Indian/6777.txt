4g9DDKepRkxissGgiMntUg Wish there was less than star, preferably a negative star or stars. Have just ordered what would, by any standards, be considered a higher than averagely priced basic Indian meal in Toronto. The tables are sticky and littered with the debris from previous meals. The sever's response to our request to clear and clean? "I'm busy now. Later".

Update: The server whisked a napkin over the tables and brought the food. My advice to anyone who is inclined to try this dive? DON'T!
