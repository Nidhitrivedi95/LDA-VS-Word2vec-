gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw Went there on a quiet sunday evening. We ordered samosa (yes there was just one!) to begin with. It was dry and unseasoned and the salad was definitely just there to decorate (and apparently it had been there decorating for a few days). We then had lamb rogan josh and the butter chicken... I wondered if the chef had even ever been to India... Either he hasn't or the taste of people for indian food around here asked him to downplay the food. It was very bland, clearly he forgot his spices somewhere. The rice was overcooked. The only positive point was the naan, which was quite surprisingly good. Thanks for the naan, chef! 
Not at all a good indian food (unless you don't know what indian food tastes like and enjoy blandness) and above all quite expensive for the quality served. Too bad!
