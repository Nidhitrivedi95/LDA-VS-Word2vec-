K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g Madras Anandha Bhavan is the best place in Phoenix to get Vegetarian Indian food. Nan bread is always good almost in all Indian restaurants. I tried Chapati bread here. It a whole wheat not greasy bread which tasted soo good. I also love masala dosa, paneer dishes and aloo gobi. I also like the lunch buffet here. 

The food is good, restaurant is clean, service is good, staffs are friendly and fair priced. I will surely recommend this place to my friend.
