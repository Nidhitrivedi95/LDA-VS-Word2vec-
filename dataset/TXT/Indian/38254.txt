It's def a no frills joint and that's reflected in the prices. 

Ordered the lunch special. 2 chicken Shawarmas for one low price. 

The sandwich was assembled with style and grace. I asked the owner about the soup and he brought me a nice abundant sample. 

Shawarma itself was delicious. Very low salt content, fully stacked with all the trimmings, and lightly toasted. 

Good food. Fantastic value. But if you're looking for that extra salty nonsense, this isn't your place. Homemade, authentic food st a great price.
