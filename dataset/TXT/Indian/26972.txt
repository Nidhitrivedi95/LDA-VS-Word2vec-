iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Tried this place because of Yelp.  Ordered the chicken Tikka masala and chicken curry... shared meal.  We also ordered chicken pakora.  Chicken pakora was delicious and the accompanying sauce was dynamite. Both entrees were fantastic!!!    Tikka masala is out of this world!!  The masala sauce is rich and delicious.  The curry was equally delicious and plentiful.  Service is excellent, attentive... but not to excess.  Highly recommend.  One appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 soft drinks.  $50 bucks.  Not cheap... very reasonable none the less!!  Try it... you won't be disappointed!
