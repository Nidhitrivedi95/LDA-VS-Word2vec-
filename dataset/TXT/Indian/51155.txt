utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw I really enjoy the food here... some of the time. The quality of the food here swings from good to bad each time I go there. I have gone both for the lunch buffet and for dinner, and in both experiences this quality lasted. I will admit I enjoy the food here but the inconsistency of the food throws me off.
