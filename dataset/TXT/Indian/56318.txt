XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw This is the first time I've ever had Himalayan/Nepalese food and I didn't think I would like it but it was a really good first experience. The service is amazing, so friendly and welcoming. I already loved the atmosphere and vibe as soon as I sat down. The food was really good considering I'm not a huge fan of this kind of food. I would definitely come back and I cannot wait to sit in their patio as soon as it's opened. I definitely recommend coming here if you've never had this kind of food and want to try a new place out, the service and food is worth it. (The mutton curry is a must if you do, the pork chilli is also good.)
