DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Walked in on a Friday night and it was dead, other than two other small tables. 
It was so quite, and the music was barely heard. 

The service was okay, and kind of slow. Our waitress seemed like she was in a hurry and started walking away before we even finished telling her what we wanted. 
That always strikes a nerve in me. You should say, "was there anything else?" before you walk away from a table. 
The lady that was helping her out was much more kind and welcoming. 

We ordered:

Chicken Tikka Masala
Lamb Rogan Josh
Saag Shrimp

Overall, it was okay. It was good, but for some reason, some of the curry seemed powdery? It's a weird texture/consistency to me. But, you know. Whatever. Maybe I don't know anything. 

I've been to so many places around town for Indian food. And a couple of places, I've found this odd texture. 

So, I doubt we'll be back. I was somewhat disappointed due to the high reviews.
