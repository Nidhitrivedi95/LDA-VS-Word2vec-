ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ This review reflects a change in management/ownership. To start with we have been dedicated customers of Madras Masala for many years, from when they first opened. Because it was a cold and wet night we were craving some of their really yummy dhosas. From the minute we entered the reception was less than friendly. Gone are the young friendly waiters, who knew how to serve, replaced by a couple of young woman who just didn't care about their customers. Instead ensuring basic customer service they spent the majority of their time fussing over their children. While we were disappointed by the service we hoped for the same quality of food. Sadly, the food also has changed for the worse. The dhosas are now a pale imitation of what they once served. Gone are the crisp finished edges replaced with a mushy, wet exterior showing that the lack of attention. The potato and onion interior was also a mushy mess replacing the original chunks of potato and onions. We asked if the place had changed hands and were told in less than friendly way, that yes it was under new management. A note to the new owners/managers if you want to survive in Toronto's cutthroat restaurant market, the quality of your food and service is paramount. If nothing changes I would not be surprised to see the place shuttered.
