Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Do you know how hard it is to find vegetarian food in Vegas??? I didnt think it would be that difficult, but turns out all people want to eat when they gamble is crab legs and steak! After walking forever and searching endlessly on Yelp, FINALLY we found vegetarian food! They have some meat items like chicken tikka masala, but tons of veg options (at least in the lunch buffet).

The idly are fluffy and the sambar is very good. The paneer was mostly missing in action and not very good when it was to be found, but the halwa was delicious!!

Given that it was lunchtime, I'm shocked that this place wasnt more crowded. In fact, there were only a couple other patrons there (They are kind of tucked away). Cheapest buffet ever! It was small, but only like $13 and had many good options.

To find it- just follow the signs, and they'll lead you into some weird sliding glass doors of a deserted looking building. Then go up some escalators and you're there!
