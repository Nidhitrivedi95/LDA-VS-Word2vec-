PQTtKaBK_WdvLm-zp4fQ1g wow! if you're looking for a third world dining experience,  look no further.  This has to be the most dysfunctional restaurant crew I've ever come across. It's a Thursday night at 8, there's only 3 tables  of customers, I placed a single take out order. After an hour of waiting, the lady  who took the order came over not with a glass of water and an apology but with a bogus excuse of how the printer wasn't working and that's why the order was taking so long. How do I know the excuse was bogus? because she phoned the last guy who picked up his take out order to come back because she had put my order (which had taken forever to prepare due to a broken printer) in with his order. My food had been gone from the restaurant  for 15 minutes with some strange guy. When he brings it back she puts it in a bag and charges me full price. No discount, no free coke, nothing but just wonder about what the strange man could have done to my dish. Horrible service, you can hear the kitchen staff yelling and laughing all the way into the dining room. the food is mediocre,  there are better south Indian restaurants in town with better service. Folks.....leave the third world, don't give a crap attitude back in India. You were ruled by the British for a long time, I'm sure somewhere along the line they taught you about order, let's try to get it together.
