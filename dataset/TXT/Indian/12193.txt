auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ This was my first time ever having Indian food, so I can not compare to any other places. What I can share is that our food was Delicious!!! The flavor and aroma was like nothing I've ever experienced. My husband and I ordered the veggie samosa, chicken tikka, and garlic naan bread. This was plenty of food for us to share. I ordered the chicken tikka with medium spice and it was perfect! (We both enjoy spicy food). We both agreed that we would order all three of those items again but I can't wait to go back to taj palace and try some more from the large menu!
