KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I came here by myself last week. Upon entering it smelled delicious. I was seated at a booth. The service was excellent. 

I did find the lighting in the place to be a bit distracting.  They had these almost like flood lights outdoor lighting in some of the areas. It felt too bright in the spots and made the restaurant seem industrial, not warm and inviting. 

As my usual I got chicken Tikka masala with garlic naan. I thought the chicken Tikka was too salty. The naan was OK seemed a little dry to me.  I also had a mango lassi which was delicious. 

Overall it seemed like a nice place and maybe there were other dishes that would be delicious, but chicken Tikka masala is my favorite and if I don't like it then I'm probably not coming back. Also the lighting situation really bugged me. Maybe they don't turn those bright lights on in the day time.
