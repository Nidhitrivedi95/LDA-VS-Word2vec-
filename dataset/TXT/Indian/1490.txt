-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Noticed this new Indian place near our house so I thought we'd give it a shot.  The first impression as we walked in the door was very positive, decor and ambiance were a step up from the previous establishment that was in this location.  Service was also good - prompt and responsive, but that's where the positives end.  
Food was where they fell short with most items we ordered lacking in flavor.  We ordered a tandoori chicken and saag paneer, both were OK at best, the garlic naan was pretty good but it's hard to go wrong with that.  Being a native Indian I have pretty high expectations for indian food so I can only give them 3 starts based on the food.

It's a new place so hopefully things will improve as they get established.  I might try it again for the lunch buffet in a few months.
