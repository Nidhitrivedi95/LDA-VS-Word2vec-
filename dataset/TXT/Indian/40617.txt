PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw Hole in the wall excellence. Not much room to sit, served on paper plates with plasticware, but the food is fabulous. Soft drink fountain hasn't worked in the 6 months we've been coming here. I don't drink soda, but this might be an issue for some (cans available, but of course no refills). This is the only reason I knocked a star off and service can be slow, but the food is five star! Favorites include Paneer Butter Masala, Chicken Korma, Lamb Vindaloo, and naan (onion or garlic). Prices are very reasonable.
