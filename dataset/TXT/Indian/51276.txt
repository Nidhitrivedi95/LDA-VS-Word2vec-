uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg I'm a bit grossed out by my experience here. "Fast" to them seems like just keeping everything low quality. Ordered the chicken masala biryani and two samosas. Got water cups. Water from the fountain tasted gross... and then I found a baby spider floating in my water. Alrighty.

Food came out and it seemed pretty legit and  slopped together. First few bites were good and then the spiciness caught up to me. Had to load it up with their creamy sauce which was delicious and cut down the spiciness a bit. The sauce for the samosas were good too and the samosas were decent. 

While some flavors were good, likely won't be back...
