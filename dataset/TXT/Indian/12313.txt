auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ It's good and I'll return.  I'm new to the area so will have to learn their spice level.  I ordered the lamb curry spice level 4/10. Our Indian waiter stated he likes spicy and eats his food at level 6/10, so I ordered lamb curry level 4/10 to be on the safe side, but it was more of a 1/10. They may have forgotten on mine. The Palaak Paneer we ordered 2/10 was spicier than the lamb curry.  It was decent and on par with most Indian restaurants I've been to throughout various states.  The goat Biryani was flavorful,  one of the best I've had.  I typically don't really eat it, but I'll definitely order there's again.  It's worth me giving them another try on the curry.  The goat and the lamb were fairly tender.  I did have a few tough pieces of lamb,  but most of it was tender.
