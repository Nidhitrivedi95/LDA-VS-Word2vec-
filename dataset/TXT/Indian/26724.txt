iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I have ordered take now twice from Marigold. To be honest, as mentioned in previous reviews, the food is rather bland for Indian food. The portion size was decent, but the restaurant is nice, clean and modern, but when compared to other valley options, I found the dishes a little tame. There are other Indian restaurants in the valley nearby, and I would suggest trying different options to expand one's experiences.
