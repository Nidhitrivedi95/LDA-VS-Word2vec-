gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I ordered a plate of their food at the vegetarian festival this past weekend.  Their food was an excellent value, for $5 I got a plate of rice and lentils, lentil donut, chickpeas in sauce, potato thing(?) and dessert. I enjoyed the rice and lentils, had a creamy and nice texture.  The lentil donut was not my favorite, bc it was kind of flavorless and had a pretty tough texture.  It tasted better when I dipped it in the sauce the chickpeas came in.

What was most notable to me was the DESSERT.  I wish I knew the name of it!  I have had Indian food many times in my life, but I have never ever had an Indian dessert that I liked.  I really liked the dessert they served!   It was an orange cake/pudding type dish.  It looked like cake, but it was very very very moist, almost like a pudding.  It tasted slightly gingery and was just really delicious.

I would like to try their food at their restaurant some day.
