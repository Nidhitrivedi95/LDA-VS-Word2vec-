ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I came here with my boyfriend on our Vegas summer trip. I had seen this restaurant on Rachel's Vacation and wanted to give it a try. It was my 21st birthday dinner so I wanted to try some cocktail. The bartender recommended a few drinks for us and I decided to try something that had ginger in it (I forgot the name). It was crazy strong...I didn't eat before drinking it so I got really sleepy. Anyhow, we ordered the nan bread with mushroom. The nan were fresh and tasted okay.  We ordered two entrees, one seafood and one lamb. My fish was very boney, bland and hard to eat. My boyfriend got the lamb with some spices - it was not good at all. We had a really bad experience with the food. I'm not sure if we ordered the wrong things but ours were not good at all.
