uBcwnALb3HFKZ-Vvj0conQ I called to order before I went there because of other Yelp reviews. This place is not far from my home so I thought pickup was fine too. I ordered a butter chicken meal and it turned out very good! I enjoyed the strong flavor and their naans are so good!!! Would definitely go again
