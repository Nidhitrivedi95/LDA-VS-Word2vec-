I found they were very generous in comparison to other Indians places in town. We were so full, we couldn't finish it all. My dinner companion and I ordered the following:

Lamb kebabs 12.8
goat cheese filling + apricot chutney

Butter chicken 19.4
Mennonite-farmed chicken, fenugreek, tomato butter sauce

Fiddleheads + paneer 13.5
pan-tossed with tomato, ginger + garlic

Butter naan 2.8

We were quite pleased with all the choices. Although I don't know if I would order the Lamb Kebabs again. It was similar to eating a slider patty without the bun. I have a feeling they have better options in the apps section.

Secondly, if you like it spicy, make sure to tell them beforehand. The dishes above are not spicy at all by default.
