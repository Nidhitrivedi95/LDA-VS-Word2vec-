1TRoTVHIJVRSMtlSn4605w Love this place.  Great value for the servings.  Toonie Tuesday is awesome.  I keep telling Coco (the owner) that he has to bottle and sell the red sauce.  My favourite is stew chicken.  On Tuesdays - I get BBQ or fried chicken.

Lines are long and slow - but to me - well worth the wait.  I just wish there was one near my new place of employment.
