xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Its better than other Indian Restaurants in Pittsburgh. I tried buffet once and à la carte once. Buffet was definitely better option than ordering from menu. Also gulab jamun served in buffet were much better. Overall, it is worth trying this place if you are craving for good Indian food.
