auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I live in Silverado  Ranch and for 2yrs I've been driving all the way to Flamingo and Maryland to eat Indian food. I just was told by a friend that this place was just across the street from where I live. I went today, and I'm telling you it was amazing. Food was great and the service was top notch. You also don't feel cramp. Much more room then the other Indian restaurant. I will absolutely be back again...
