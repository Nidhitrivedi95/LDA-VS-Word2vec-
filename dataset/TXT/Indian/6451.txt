3q42_KwDXEwfXSvtohknkA Butter chicken was great, it came with rice. Make sure to order one naan per person as portions aren't that big. Everyone was friendly, they accepted card, and had wine/beer/cocktail selections. Plenty of free street parking and english menus, but "butter chicken" and most other entrees have the same name in both menus.
