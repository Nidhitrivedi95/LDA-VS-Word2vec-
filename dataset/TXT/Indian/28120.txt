iw1WJt3wl6-NquZGKVamLw I just ate here today and it may not be the greatest Indian place to eat in Las Vegas I believe it serves it's purpose. I had the Vegan Burrito and the Vegan Burger. Both were good enough, not fantastic but I will give it five stars because someone went out and opened this place, the Vegan Burger and Burrito are basically Indian flavors in a bun or in a tortilla and that is never a bad thing. The service was pretty good as well, accommodating and helpful.
