ctW7CyEghLR2yMJGubep9A We placed an order via the restaurants website paying successfully by paypal online for the order unfortunately the restaurant then refused to deliver our order unless we also paid by cash on delivery. They were not interested in the fact that we were able to produce receipts for both the order and payment. 
The restaurants handling of the matter was beyond shocking and ultimately I was told by the manager that he was 61 yrs old and therefore did not understand computers and was therefore unable to help me or do anything at all to resolve the situation.
I have been left to contact PayPal to try to recover the £27 I am out of pocket for.


 Please do not order food from this restaurant unless you are prepared to be conned into paying twice!
