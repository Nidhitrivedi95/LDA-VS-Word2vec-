Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA Would love to review the food but unfortunately I can't, having walked in twice to a partially empty venue and having to leave after waiting 20 minutes for the indifferent wait staff to acknowledge me let alone offer to take a food order. The place looks pretty cool which is why I gave it another chance, I think they were happy to see us walk out. I guess queen west staff are above the clientele.

Update: this place closed down, surprise surprise
