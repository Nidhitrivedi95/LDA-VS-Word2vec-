vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Very nice vegetarian indian food. it's close to my job so I go there often and each time it's the same taste and quality. lunch specials are super cheat only $6.50, I must warn the people with sensitive stomachs that the foods can be quite oily and therefore feel heavy, so watch for that ;) Enjoy
