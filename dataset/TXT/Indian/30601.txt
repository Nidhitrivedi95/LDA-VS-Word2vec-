kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I used the Yelp ordering to get lunch.  I ordered the Karee with Chicken.  It had the right spice level and everything tasted good.  The jasmine rice was cooked well.  The chicken was a bit tough but I have teeth so I was okay with it.

Delivery was fast and efficient.  I would have lunch with them again.
