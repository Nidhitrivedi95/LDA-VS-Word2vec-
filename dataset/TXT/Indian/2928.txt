0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw I'm a glutton for spicy food, so naturally I was drawn to this Indian restaurant. On my first visit, I ordered the food extra spicy and was truly pleased! This is definitely the place for spice lovers, such as myself. However, regardless of your spice preference they have a dish for all palates. My personal favorite is the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. 

I've become a regular here, and it's not just due to proximity because I'm the type of person that doesn't mind driving a little extra for great food. The service is excellent. I really enjoy the environment. The staff is always very welcoming, and they've come to recognize me and my friends.
