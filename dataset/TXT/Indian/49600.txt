tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA As my first dinner in Mesa - I looked to Yelp and found my answer. With my usual enormous dinner appetite I decided that a well-regarded Indian buffet was right up my alley.

  I showed up around 7pm and was instantly seated at a dimly-lit, partitioned-off two-seater (note: good option for a date). It became immediately apparent how attentive the staff was when I was served a complimentary piece of sizzling chicken tandoori (placed on a bed of cabbage and sautéed peppers/onions), followed by some freshly made garlic naan as I sat down with my buffet starter plate of samosa, vege fritters, sweet cheese balls and some accompanying sweet/spicy sauces.

  A little about the spread: They have a nice variety of savory chicken, lamb, goat and even egg dishes. A tasty chicken biryani, or an optional bismati rice right out of the steamer go great with any of the creamy masalas/currys. There are some vegetarian dishes as well, and they have bottomless mango lassi and creamy tea available to wash it all down.

  I tried almost everything they offered and enjoyed it all - up to the point where I could barely manage to grunt when offered service by the ever-so-attentive waitstaff. But I had my mind fixated on one item I saw up there.. I had to go on..

  I took a final, small plate and loaded up two scoops of their mango custard. Woooww.. In my food-borne inebriation my eyelids sagged whenever this godlike concoction hit my tastebuds. Insulting my already overstuffed stomach with a final, unneccessary swig of their delicious tea I was walking out with a large grin on my face - knowing that I have already found a keeper on my first night out :)
