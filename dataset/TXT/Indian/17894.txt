E9WG3HL_IYsfJucQ9o4oiA Definitely Stockbridge's best Indian take away -- staff are always lovely and friendly and it's great to be able to see the food being made so you know exactly what the hygiene of the kitchen is like! My partner has a nut allergy and the staff have always been willing to advise on what he can and cannot have. The chicken bhuna is particularly good. Great place!
