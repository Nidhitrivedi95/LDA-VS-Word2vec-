Came back with another bowl of rice... which is from the same pot of rice the hair was in initially. It was disgusting. We ate the rest of the food.

We received the bill and was charged for the rice... my parents are very calm people and they don't say anything, even when they are being taken advantage of... and if they weren't there I would have said something. 

There are lot of Indian restaurants in the area with better staff and customer service. Just because somewhere is overpriced doesn't mean the food will be better... its all the same ingredients that they get some costco and the indian grocery store down the block.
