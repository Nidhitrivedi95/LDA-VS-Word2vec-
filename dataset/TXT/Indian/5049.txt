2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw I wish I could give a zero star. We visited the restaurant today (June 18)evening. The person on the reception asked if we had reservation. We had no reservation and then he made annoying faces. And remarked that we should always come with reservation. He was rude and disrespectful. And he even offered us a table. The restaurant was fairly empty at that time. Even if they did not have a place, he could have simply said there is no space or there is a wait. 
After witnessing such rudeness, we opted to walk out and eat somewhere else.
