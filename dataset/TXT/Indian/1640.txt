-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA We ordered delivery through Yelp. The whole process was very confusing and seemed to confuse the staff as much as it confused us when I called to ask some questions. The reason why that is frustrating is because I expect an establishment to be able to help me through a service they offer, and not refer me to a website that refers me to a customer support number. 
We received an underwhelming amount of food for the cost, and the veggie samosas were burnt to the point of being inedible. They were so hot when they were put in their styrofoam container that they burned a large hole in the bottom. I've attached pictures of the amounts of food and the burned samosas. The delivery person rounded the total of $45.27 to $46 when he gave me the price of the food. This probably seems nitpicky, but it im in the food service industry and I think it's lazy and dishonest to do this. I'm really disappointed. Won't be eating food from this establishment again.
