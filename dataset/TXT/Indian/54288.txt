Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A We'd had some food catered from JJ at a friend's place, and felt it was good enough to warrant a try, but we were in for a surprise. Awful - easily one of the worst Indian restaurants (in the Cleveland area) we have been to. We ordered take-out, and the food and service was not too good. The restaurant is really small and it smelled unpleasant. Service was pathetic, with the guy taking the order really skewering it badly (he also worked at the Udipi Cafe in Parma before, and has taken his 'attitude' to JJ now, looks like). Not sure if we will go back to JJ.
