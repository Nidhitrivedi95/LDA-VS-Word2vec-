0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I got the pick-up for dinner. Great food, great flavors. I got chicken biryani and samosa chaat. Excellent taste. Not 5 star experience, rather 4 star. So, taking away one star because he gave me sweet yoghurt with biryani which is never the case in my dictionary. All good though !!
