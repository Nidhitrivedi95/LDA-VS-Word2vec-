9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw I have been looking for great Indian food in Vegas for a long time now and I finally found it. If anyone is addicted to Chicken Tikka Masala like I am then you will love this place. 

We ordered:

Garlic Naan
Cheese Naan
Chicken Tikka Masala - level 6
Rebel Curry - level 10
Saag Paneer - level 5


Honestly, everything was delicious. You will not be disappointed. Will definitely be back!
