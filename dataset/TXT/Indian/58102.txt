yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The best word to sum up my experience would be "IMPRESSED". Upon walking in, the decor is beautiful, I love the authentic looking place settings, and the lighting  just gave an all around warm feel to this small space. And even though the restaurant is very small I didn't feel like they had the tables packed in there, so we were all sitting on top of one another or stuck listening to anyone's conversation. Our server was very nice and informative, and was really helpful when selecting the perfect variety of dishes. When our food arrived it was amazingly flavorful and portion size was more than enough for leftovers. Which were just as delicious the next day.
