-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Just had lunch buffet here. Food ok. Only 2 dishes were good, goat curry and chicken Briani . The rest no taste. Service 2/10 of course not great. Wanted to have another beer but got check before asking. Yvonne didn't even ask if I needed anything else before bringing the check. No thank you. It's like they are doing you a favor. When it should be the other way around.
