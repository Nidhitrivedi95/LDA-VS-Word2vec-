-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg I went here with a friend who promised it would be amazing. She also warned that it is kind of in the middle of nowhere--and it was. I'll admit this probably isn't somewhere I would have ever stopped on my own based on its appearance and location. 

But the food! I had the chana masala and it was pretty much perfect. Just spicy enough and tons of flavor. The dish was served with rice and sauces. We also split several other appetizers and everything was great. Portions were generous and we took home leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

They lose a star for service (took foreeeeeever to get a check and boxes) but the food made up for that. I'm sure I'll be back here in the future--definitely a special treat.
