xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw While Fry Bread House East gets 5 stars I can only give the Phoenix location 4 stars. Still good fry bread but not as good as their other location. We've eaten at the old location on 7th  several times and a couple of times on Indian School. The difference seems to be in the fry bread itself, the Baseline location fluffier and perfectly cooked while the Indian School location was a bit thinner and a little greasy. Both locations share the same excellent red and green chile and beans.
