8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw I am definitely no expert on Indian food, but since this this place serves nothing that even resembles that, I feel qualified to offer my thoughts..  Once you get past the dismal decor of the "restaurant" itself and figure maybe the food will at least be ok, you get a dish slapped into a takout plate by a pleasant woman. It all goes downhill from there.  I ordered the vegan lunch which consisted of Eggplant , Tofu and Vegetables and Tomato and Lentils over rice.  All three were substandard.  The eggplant was ok, but did not appear to be fresh..was visually unappealing and basically not good.  

The lentils and tomato served over mushy brown rice (not basmati), was light on both tomatoes and lentils but was passable as food.  But by far the worst was the tofu.  Large cubes swimming in a disgusting broth were like sponges of awfulness.  Biting into one resulted in a gushing of water that looked like it came out of the Ganges river, (thereby establishing it's only tangential connection to authentic Indian food.). Thank Annapurna (the Hindu God of food and cooking),  for the half a slice of whole wheat pita that was laying on top of the rest of this slop.

My understanding from what others tell me is there are better things to order on other days of the week. But I don't plan to return ...maybe when it eventually becomes a Subway or Starbucks.   

Hoping I don't get sick.
