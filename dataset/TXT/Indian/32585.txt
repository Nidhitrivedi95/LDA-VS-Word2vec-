LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Its more like a 6 star.  The food was fantastic.  The service was super fast.  We tried the dahi vara, mini idly, paper butter dosa, chat dosa.  They were all amazing.  I would recoment going with a group of 4 people and make reservations ahead of time other wise u might be waiting for an hour to get a table.

Compared to others the price is a premium but quality costs money.  

Defiantly will be going again.
