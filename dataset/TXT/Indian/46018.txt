slUmNbUGPVs_uRpIl4y3YA My office is not too far by from this spot so we decided to check out the buffet for lunch. The food is fresh and the price is right at $7.99 for all you can eat buffet.  The fare is Punjabi as you would expect from many restaurants in Brampton, however the food is piping hot and fresh and to be honest, Punjabi food in its self is very heavy so there is only so many helpings you can eat before exploding.  SAVE ROOM FOR THE GAJAR HALWA!
