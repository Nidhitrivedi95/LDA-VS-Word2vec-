K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I'm not a vegetarian but I really like their lunch buffet. It's all so delicious and I like that they don't always have the same thing. 

The food has good taste and spices and it's hot but in a enjoyable way! I very much have enjoyed their soups and usually use a carrot stick to cool off my mouth.
