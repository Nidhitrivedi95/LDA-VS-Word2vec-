auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ My favorite place to eat! Took my girlfriend here for her first time experiencing Indian food and the bartender kept grabbing little things for her to sample and letting us try the different Lassi while we were waiting for our food. Excellent service every time I visit, the food is delicious (I am a big fan of the vindaloo), and well worth the drive across town for me.
