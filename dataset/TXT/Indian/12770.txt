B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Ordered the Non-vegeterian Meal for Two to go. While the food seemed great quality it was a little bland. I had ordered over the phone and the gentleman who took my order was rather impatient and unhelpful. I had asked a few questions about the spiciness level of the food since there was no info on the menu (i.e. a 1-5 scale) and he was thoroughly unhelpful and the food was very mild when I picked it up although I prefer spicy. So maybe my lack luster experience is due to this misunderstanding. I will give this place another shot but next time I think I will order in the restaurant even if it's togo.
