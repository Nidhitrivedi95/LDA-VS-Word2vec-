8g0D6INpSyRz60_aSztXeA Been here several times and have ordered chicken spring rolls, samosas and sweets. Ordered in big batches and they have provided it on time and always fresh. 
The mithai is soft and tasty. The chicken and potato samosas are pretty good tasting except they have a lot of dough. You end up having to break off the sides to get to the good stuff. The filling has the right amount of spices and pretty flavourful. The pricing is reasonable and probably one of the best places in Mississauga. Will continue ordering from here for the many years to come.
