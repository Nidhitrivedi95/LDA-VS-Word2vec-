m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Word on the street was that the owner of Sitara opened this restaurant, and as a big fan of Sitara, I was excited to go. I went with a group of 7 people, and we waited for our food for over an hour and 15 mins.
None of the waiters apologized to us for the long wait and no one seemed to care.
There was also a table next to us who were seated after us (with a group of 7 as well) that recieved their food before us. The waiter even apologized and gave them an appetizer on the house for waiting. My table did not.
The waiters made some of our orders wrong, but quickly corrected them. The food was mediocre, as I was expecting a similar taste to Sitara.
Not going back anytime soon.
