sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I love their food here. 

I ordered for pick-up. Although they did mess up my order but they so apologetic about it and even offered to make a new meal for me. 

But I was in a hurry, I couldn't wait. When I tried the food that evening, it was actually it is hands down the best Indian food I've tasted. And trust me I've tried a wide variety. 

My only problem with them is that, I feel they close way too early. Like they close at 7pm which is not the most convenient time for customers, I think. 

Also, I hope they start offering delivery soon cause it's a bit far from my location but the food is worth it all.
