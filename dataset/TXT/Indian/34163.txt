md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA Being of South East Asian descent, I can be very picky about going to any Indian restaurant, especially if it's an All-You-Can-Eat venue. Bombay Grill is quite an excellent place to eat if you're looking for some good Indian food. I usually go with the family when I'm out in Ajax, and have yet to be disappointed.

Friendly service, food is always fresh and there's no Indian tunes blaring out of the speakers!  (sorry, I'm kinda whitewashed like that).

My recommendations: Daal Makhani and the Lamb Curry. 

4-stars as I don't think, but am not sure that the desserts are fresh and they, just like any other AYCE have the same "run of the mill" ice cream.

Great place if you don't have a mom like me that cooks Indian food flawlessly!
