h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Went there today for lunch . Saw some friends who were already there and sat at same table .

Coming to the food , the chicken biriyani and Tandoori chicken were good . Rest of the food was average or poor .Had to wait a considerable time at the buffet stations for the food to be refilled , especially the Naan, biriyani and the appetizers.  In other Indian buffets I have been to , a Naan basket or dosa is served at the table . There was no such courtesy here . Overall the service was poor .

When the final bill came , there was an 18 % gratuity added.  I have not seen this kind of mandatory gratuity added for other buffets I have been to . I am all for tipping for good service , but not for non existent service during a buffet  !!! I inquired with the restaurant manager about the 18% gratuity and she said that this is how it is done in the restaurant and that I could call the restaurant owner !

Not a good experience overall ..
