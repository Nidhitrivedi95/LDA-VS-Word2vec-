oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw Drinks here were just average, not bad, but not excellent either. For an app, we did the sampler with gyro meat, hummus & pita, a grape leave (dolmades) and greek meatballs (keftedes). This was a great app, something I would definitely recommend. The gyro meat was definitely from a spit and was above average. If i go back, I'm all over the dolmades for my app and gyro as my entree.

We also did the greek salad, average salad with olives, feta, cucumber, tomato and onion. It was fine, nothing too amazing.

The entrees left a little room for improvement. I had the lamb shank, so lets talk about that first. The meat wasn't tender or saucy enough for my palate. It was served with orzo which was full of onions, which was part of the problem. There was an appalling amount of onions which once discovered, I had to pick out one by one. Other than that, the orzo was good as I love veggies. I want to give this dish a make over, by de-boning the meat, removing the onions, and adding a tomato based sauce to the top. Then this dish would have been divine. The fisherman's stew was OK, but was missing some more chicken or seafood stock (it was a little too tomatoey).

As a greek girl, I have had the best greek food ever made I'm sure. I really wanted to love this place. I think if I go back, I will try new entrees since the service was pretty good. Also, for what you get I couldn't help but to feel they were a little over priced. Not a cheap dinner once you add in all the little extras. So next time I hope I love it, so I can feel like I got a better value.
