gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Back in Vegas again for another short business trip and my coworker and I wanted to try something different. Something out of the normal. Came across this restaurant on yelp and thought this might be a new experience. I have to say that I loved the atmosphere of this place. Great scenery. Wanted to try some spices from the east. We ordered the chicken tiki masala which I certainly loved along with cheese nans. Wow perfect meal for what I was looking for. I only tried Indian food once before but it didn't catch my eye like it did this time. Might make it a weekly dish if I can find one as good back home. My coworker had lamb which I didn't enjoy as much. But overall great experience.
