MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Lurking out among a bunch of light industrial malls is this no nonsense Indian food store that makes samosas, pakoras, paneer, and various Indian sweets. It's all cash 'n' carry. I think normally they have 3 piping hot samosas for $1 but when I went in there they were offering 5 for $1, including a salsa like green sauce and a sweet and sour red sauce. I'd challenge you to pack away 3 in one sitting. But five? For a $1? Oh man. I thought the $5 foot long was the deal o' the century in terms of cheap dining.

Other delights include these things that look suspiciously like chicken mcnuggets but turn out to be paneer, crisp pakoras, and a kind of sandwich fried up pakoras style.

Oh yeah the gulab jamuns are beyond fraking amazing. They have this buttery kick to them totally lacking in versions I've had at Indian restaurants. Forget tim bits, lay out a box of these. 

Everything is not only cheap and filling but nicely spiced. Nothing mouth burning. Just enough heat to let you know you're not eating oatmeal. And the spices serve to render complex flavors.

Many items are sold by weight but you can (and we just did) layout out lunch for a small software development company for $25.

The place opens at the crack of 11 am and you need to get there at the crack of 11 am because lines form quickly.
