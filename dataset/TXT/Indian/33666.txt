lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw True taste of Bombay!!! The food is fresh and the ambience reminds me of a south Bombay cafe! #memories
The adrak chai (ginger tea) was alright not exactly what I was expecting
I'd recommend the salli chicken bowl (light chicken gravy garnished with crispy potatoes) or the beef kheema pav (buttery goodness!!!) 
The food is super filling especially if you order the daal chawal rice as a side - Like I always do! 
I always go back to Bombay street food for nostalgic reasons but the food has never disappointed
