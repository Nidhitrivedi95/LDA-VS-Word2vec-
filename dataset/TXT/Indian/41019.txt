PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q Oh India Garden how i love this Indian restaurant probobly the best one in the pittsburgh area yet, this is the one and ONLY indian cuisine place i go to for there awesome buffet and there delightful tikka massala wither its shrimp or chicken your never disappointed. but alas all good things have an end, recently they been kinda slaking so i wondered and asked our manager why does out food taste less.... tasteful... he explained to me and get this!... there head chef takes a break on mondays which is out "indian food night" for us.


and another thing i started noticing is that it u order from a scale of 1-10 on how hot your food is its always a gamble u never how how exactly spicy your food is gonna get unless u tell them BURN ME 10/10
