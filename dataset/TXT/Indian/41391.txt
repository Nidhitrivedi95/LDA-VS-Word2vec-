Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w So I want to like Maharaja but I have a hard time doing it. I live very close to the restaurant and it always smells delicious from the outside. Plus, how can you beat a well priced lunch buffet?! However, I LOVE indian food and have had some terrific foods in other states and this just doesn't stack up. Their naan isn't quite fluffy enough (not sure they cook it in a tandoori) and their food is a little too one note and a bit on the heavy side.
