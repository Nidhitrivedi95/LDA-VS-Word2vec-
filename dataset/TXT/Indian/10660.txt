A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Lets start with what was good. My husband and sister in law ordered the Paper Masala Dosa. It was beautiful, crispy, paper thin, and from all the raving about it, let's call it great.  

One person at our table ordered the Thali, and said it was mostly good, Chappati was mediocre, a little rubbrey, and the assorted fried veggies were nothing to write home about.  

My masala dosa wasn't crispy or hot when it arrived at the table.  The potatoes that were in the middle were mostly bland, and tepid.  

The most concerning thing was the staff seemed mostly untrained. The waiter that brought our glasses of water, picked up the glasses closer to the top, when he should have picked them up closer to the bottom so he wasn't touching where you'd drink out of.  When we asked for straws, he brought unwrapped straws in his bare hands defeating the purpose of asking for a straw. Some place settings had a knife and a fork and other place settings had a fork and a spoon.  That made no sense to us at all.   The waiter tried to explain to us that their appetizer platter was meant to be shared by people at the table, and that most other people ordered their entree after their appetizer order.  No idea if this guy thought we were completely new to the concept of a restaurant but it was annoying.  We were served by several different people, it seemed chaotic. 

This place needs a serious boot camp, I worry there might be some healthcode violations taking place.  I will not be visiting it again, or recommending it to anyone.
