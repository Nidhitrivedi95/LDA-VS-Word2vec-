h2qoDqeVdTDnJRGQGqsi4g I was pleasantly surprised after having dinner at Bombay on the Lake.  The food was great.  My friend and I had the chicken bryiani, coconut lamb mutter panzer and garlic nana an.  The food was tasty and distinct as with some Indian rests tend to use very similar sauce base.  Portion size was good and filing.  The staff and owners were nice and personable.  I look forward to the next time visit
