8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ I have ordered several times since my last review and the food and service is consistently excellent. 

The butter chicken is excellent.  The lamb/goat is great quality meat but the reason I continue to order is because the curries/sauces are amazing and so flavourful, and there are many to choose from

I am trying to taste everything on the menu which is hard because I keep ordering my favourite dishes 

Service and delivery have always been excellent, friendly and on time
