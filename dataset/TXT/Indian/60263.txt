ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA we decided to try Passage to India out during dinner time, which it's not very busy at all. When you first walk in the place, the curry smell hit your nasal right away. 

I order a mango lassi  which taste more like a dessert.  We got Samosa for appetizer, and  shrimp biryani, curry chicken, garlic naan and plain dosa for entree. Then the cheese ball and rice pudding for dessert.

Overall, the food is ok not very impressed. I do love the garlic naan, which is crispy outside and soft inside. The price is a bit expensive for the amount of food. I probably wouldn't go back here again.
