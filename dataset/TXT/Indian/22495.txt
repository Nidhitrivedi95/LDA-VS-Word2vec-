gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Switched my lifestyle to Vegan food.First restaurant to get my experience on vegan. Must say DELICIOUS! I had the Gobi Manchurian oh my god it was one of the most delicious foods i ever had my entire life! I had no clue vegan food would taste so good. Im glad im not eating meats, 1 less of a person to slaughter animals for. Thank god i came to my senses and thank you Ruchi for making my experience with Vegan food that welcoming and delicious! Definitely 5 starz will be back again hospitality was great!
