I walked in and the place is not very inviting, dimly lit with florescent light and old paint on the walls.  Fairly clean tho.  At lunch I was the only one there and I only saw the one server, who was mostly watching nasty court TV shows.

I ordered at the counter/bar since the server didn't come to the table.  Tried the Saag Paneer, 2 samosas, roti and Tea Masala.  

It took about 15 min, and I was prepared for the wait.  Everything came out at the same time, no apps first.  Then he asked if I wanted rice, so I said sure.  Half done eating and the rice comes out.  Then as I'm finishing, my tea which I forgot about, came out in a paper cup with a lid.  

The paneer lacked any depth of flavor and I even ordered it medium spice.  The rice was perfect and the tea was good. The samosas were also just OK.  I kept thinking that I've had better from the frozen aisle of my grocery store, unfortunately 

With the poor service, dingy interior, and unimpressive food it's not someplace I'd go back to.
