1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw All of the warm spices and colorful flavor of Indian food delighted us in our first visit to Bombaychaat.  My brother who knows much more about the culture and cooking of India invited us here while their lunchtime buffet was served.  I was glad to have the opportunity to try quite a variety of dishes without having to figure out how/what to order from the menu.  That means, however, that my review cannot include the names of the dishes, but here's my advice about the buffet:  try everything!  The curry-enhanced vegetable-chocked soup was a comfort food. Chunks of boneless chicken swam in an orangey-red sauce that was abounding in flavor.  The lamb was moist and flavorful, in a different sauce.  My brother lives in the loft apartment building where Bombaychaat is located, so he eats here frequently.  If I lived in Cleveland, I would too!
