They let us decorate as we wished and provided us with delicious and fresh Indian food. My mom does not like tandoori chicken and she loved it here. They are amazing and if I could I would give them a 6th star. Top notch restaurant and even better staff. Make sure you come early for the buffet because it taste best fresh.
