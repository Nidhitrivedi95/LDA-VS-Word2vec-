I still can't place the extra spice they put in it.  The saag ghosht was superb, just really an excellent lamb dish.  Tender lamb and mildly spicy spinach gravy.  And of course the chicken tikka masala was solid.

And TT serves gajrela, an Indian carrot pudding.  It's been a few years since I've had gajrela.   I still love it.  

Service was friendly and speedy.

The belly dancing with the sword was unexpected.

My only concern with TT is that if that was its Saturday night rush, then I hope they are making it up during lunch.  The place was only 20% full.
