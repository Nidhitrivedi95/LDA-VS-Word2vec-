-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ One recommendation....come here hungry!!  This place is like heaven on earth for Punjabis!!  Everything and I mean everything was muy delicioso.  Oh wait, another recommendation; come here with a large group and share!!  You get to sample a variety of dishes which is great because they offer such a wide selection. 

When I walked in my eyes were immediately fixed on the mithai(sweets) and homemade  kulfi(Indian ice cream).  Mithai in the shapes of apples and pineapple upside down cake...yumm!  We ordered quite a few items from their vegetarian menu; starting off with pani puri, aloo tikki, and chaat papdi.  For our main dishes we ordered chana bhatura and thali plate which included bhindi masala, kadhi, and matar paneer.  We also had gobi parantha(cauliflower stuffed flatbread), aloo parantha (potato stuffed flatbread), and roti.  The paranthas were accompanied by achar(pickle) and way way too much butter than one can handle.

We packed kachoris and mithai to go so I could savor them at home in the Bay!  I was disappointed to find out they were out of kulfi.  They should definitely stock up on kulfi especially for those hot days in Ontario.  Oh well, that just gives me another reason to make another trip here! :-)
