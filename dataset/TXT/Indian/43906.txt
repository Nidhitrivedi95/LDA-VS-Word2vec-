RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Awesome tasting food here. I would definitely recommend it if you are a fan of spicy food. However if you cannot handle spicy food then I would not recommend coming here as the choices for mild food are limited to two. One is the kids chicken and the other is something similar. Also do not go here if you are a vegetarian as that menu is limited too. The food is awesome and the service is fast that is once you get a seat. The waiters are plenty and get you that sizzling food pretty quickly depending on the amount of food you order. However they always tend to forget something that you have ordered, so make sure they have given you everything otherwise you will be charged for it. There are seats inside and outside, but the seats situated outside are cramped and not up to standards. I feel like I am in 2 star restaurant that provides 5 star food most of the time. They make tons of money but none of it is being invested in the infrastructure, which I think is a major shame as it can become bigger than it is now. Overall definitely visit this place if you love spicy meat dishes and you don't mind crowded noisy environment.
