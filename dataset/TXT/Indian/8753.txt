7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA Came here a few times for lunch during the week. It is usually crowded during lunch so better to make a reservation beforehand, especially on Fridays. 

It's definitely great value for buffet - $12.95 for lunch. There are lots of variety (chicken, beef, goat, fish) for the price. The goat was delicious and the naan is hot and fresh. There is also a small salad/chutney bar area and ice cream. 

Service is mediocre, staff is a bit hasty as there are a lot of people in the times I went. All in all, good food for a good price.
