CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I ordered last night 3 dishes (2 chicken and 1lamb) and was extremely disappointed. 
Each dish had only a handful of tiny chicken or lamb pieces. All the rest was just a watery sauce. In total I paid $60. We are two small eaters, but we were both left hungry after finishing this poor meal. 
I will never order here again.
