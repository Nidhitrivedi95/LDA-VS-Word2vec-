xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw what a great surprise and I wished we didn't stop in after having lunch cause there was more than a few savory things i would've love try with the navajo fry bread. it was so good that it made me look for it in California which is super hard to find.

interesting story of the navajo fry bread which has a similarity with matzo bread.
