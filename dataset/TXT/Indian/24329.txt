GyHJAwBQ58L3ORBLm0G-hg I've been to India Grill twice for the lunch buffet, once a year ago and once today, and I must say, it's ok, but nothing terribly special. They have a good variety of food on the buffet, but nothing is especially wonderful. The butter chicken and saag paneer are pretty generic. The naan was ok, but a little on the burnt side. Nothing had that 'yummy' factor that I look for in good indian food...the food lacked some depth. Anyway, this place is fine, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to go again.
