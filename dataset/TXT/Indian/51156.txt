utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw I have a love-hate relationship with this place. Let me explain what I meant by that. 

Here is a scenario: 

You go in hungry and feeling like ready to chow down all the food display. After two plates, you start to slow down but you sill go for your thirds. then, you have to have the dessert. The mango ice cream is calling your name over and over. While you are near mango IC, why not, scoop up some of the pistachio ice cream and hey don't forgot those sweet balls.They are a must. Then, you are really stuffed and can't move. you look around the place and when you think no one is looking, you unbutton your pants and try to get up slowly. Thinking you might explode if you move quicker. You feel really bad that you had eaten all the food that can feed a small village. Then, you hate yourself for eating like a pig. You regret the whole thing ever happens. You go home and feeling sorry for yourself for putting 10 extra pounds in a matter of minutes. 

The next day comes and when the food is digested, you crave for Maharaja buffet again. Eh!! Circle of life. Does it sound familiar to you or am I the only one? Hmmmm..........
