UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I don't typically write review updates this quick, nor do I usually write another 5 star review for a place I absolutely love. There's no point in beating a dead horse, but I popped in for the lunch buffet at Mint Indian Bistro with my Dad yesterday and it blew my mind!

Indian lunch buffets are usually pretty sketch. In most cases, it's the food leftover from the night before, and it's obvious. Not the case here.

Every single item in the line was FRESH, DELICIOUS, and tasted as if had been made right there and then. I know this because I had been here for dinner just a couple weeks back, so I could judge accordingly.

I sampled a little bit of everything. The Chili Chicken, the Tikka Masala, Chicken Pakorda, Saag, Daal Tarka, the Idli Sambar....mmmmmm!

For 10 bucks, this really is the best lunch in all of Las Vegas! You get a ton of food and it's delicious. 

If you have Vegan or Vegetarian friends, there are plenty of options in the buffet line as well. Everything is clearly marked, so there is no hanky panky.

Service was great, just like last time.

I can't wait to come back.

In closing, no need to worry about the lunch buffet here. It's just as good as the a la cart menu.

Feel free to eat your meals with your hands, and use the bathrooms afterwards to wash up. The bathrooms are spotless here!
