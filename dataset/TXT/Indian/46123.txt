sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I used to go to Gandhi all the time because I worked 1 block away from it.  Since I changed my job, I am distant away for my favour roti place for 1.5 years.  Finally, I decided to go back to get my fix tonight and it was a total disappointment.  The favour is not the same any more.  It's not as rich flavor as it used to be.  On top of that, my whole roti has only 2 small pieces of lamb meat inside.  All I tasted was the sauce, potato and the wrap.  Overall, I am very disappointed with my meal.  It will be hard for me to go back again anymore.  I really hope they will go back to their original style of cooking for sake of other customer.
