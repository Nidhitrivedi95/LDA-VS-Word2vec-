KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ First time! Extra spicy!
REVIEW: PASSAGE TO INDIA--A nice place-- Good service...
Although MY 1st time with food from India, my son had previous experience with this spicy Indian cuisine...So he knew what he liked...We also asked our server for some guidance.We tried a few dishes...: We split everything...1st, a vegetable "fritter" type appetizer with some spicy chutney; Then, spicy lentil soup I broke up my fritter into the soup---- yummie. Then we tried 3 very different-from-each-other "main dishes": Lamb Tikka Masala: A kind of meat stew with a red curry very robust gravy Very good and very rich....Chili Vegetables, A sort of "vegetable hash" of potatoes, carrots, peas, onions, bell peppers,cauliflower in a spicy sauce; and Palak Paneer, a spinach/ cheese dish which was very good. The flavors were wonderful and each dish had a different spice/flavor palate. We ordered it extra spicy-- and our waiter and waitress advised against it. We convinced them we could handle it. So they were VERY surprised when we asked for more of the spicy sauce to kick the heat up a couple of notches. We topped it off with a sweet "smoothie" type mango yogurt drink Kulfie, and a cup of Indian Chai tea.
Plenty of left-overs for take home and we spent about $50 plus tip.
I understand that lunchtime, they have a huge selection, served buffet style, and it would allow for an economical way to try more of these very savory dishes.I would do this again!
