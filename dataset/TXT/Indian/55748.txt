x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ One of a few restaurants that offer Indianised Chinese food. This is as good as it gets. I came here skeptical, but left a fan. Everything we ordered was good and tasted great. The ambience is also very nice. If you have never tried this cuisine, I highly recommend that your try it here.
