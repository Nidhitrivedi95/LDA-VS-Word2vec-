9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g Ordered small party combo for take out only cause it was the one place I found while I was quickly searching that would offer such a deal for my large crew visiting from out of town. Had very low expectations since I basically picked the first place I found, but was pleasantly surprised by the amount of food that we got and the quality. The combo came with 6 dishes, 10 naan, rice and dessert for $75 and that was plenty to comfortably feed 8 adults with leftovers. Food is North Indian, so not on the spicy side, but very tasty! If I ever come back to the area again I will strongly consider paying this place another visit. 
Also props to the staff who were handling orders coming via phone and counter, and packing up food  like pros during the dinner rush.
