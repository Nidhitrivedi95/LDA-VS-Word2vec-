1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g My best friend and I found this place about a year ago and are so happy we did! We find it hard to get take out from anywhere else because we feel nowhere else compares. If you are looking for what is good on the menu I would recommend... 

1. The General Tsos Chicken: it's not overly sweet like a lot of take out seems to be. 
2. The pork momos: the dipping sauce they come with is a perfect combination of tang and spice (you won't go wrong if you get the veggie momos instead)- fried or steamed
3. Chicken Lo Mein: perfect amount of sauce, its not drenched 

There's nothing fancy about the inside but don't let that steer you away- the staff is always friendly and quick. It's close to PNC Park if you wanted to go somewhere a little less mainstream before a game!
