YPHUfRvUo44LvsaXRTg4fw Aurora has be longing for a good Indian restaurant for years and Vintage spice doesn't disappoint. The chicken tikka masala was delicious. Just the right spice. The other dishes we had were great too. They have a lot of selection. Service was excellent with owners and the chef asking if everything was ok and the decor adds to a great evening.  

This will be my local go to for my Indian fix and I look forward to seeing vintage spice thrive in our community
