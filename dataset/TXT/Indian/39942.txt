We reached this place at 7. They gave us a plate of broken pappadums. It seems like they gave leftovers from a previous order. Seriously, if they are making fresh papas, then its not going to break on its own from the kitchen to the table. Either, they purposefully broke a plate of pappadums or they reheated leftovers.

They didn't come to get our order until 7:20. No one came. In fact, I had to wave at the only waitress to get her attention. My daughter had stuffed herself on papad by then. My son doesn't like papad, and he was steaming. So, we ordered an app, a rice and dal for the kids,  a naan and a curry. 

The app came in 5 mins. It was 7:40 and the food hasn't arrived yet. My daughter was tired already, so I took her out, leaving my wife and son. If the curry was taking time, the least they could have done was get the dal for the kids. We suspect that they forgot about us.

My wife started complaining and they said that they had a huge party right before us, and the chef went on an extended break before our order. I had noticed the "chef" earlier. The "chef" is an old Indian auntie who can barely walk straight. I wonder how she can run a kitchen. Poor lady has to take a breather after a big party, which means everyone who follows goes hungry. 

The "chef" might be a good cook, but she is not a chef. This place should hire a professional. The entire front of the restaurant is run by one waitress and busboy. They need more people to run a restaurant with 20 tables. At least hire more people on the Jul 4th weekend. The uncle who manages the front does nothing to help. He just shows up when its time to collect the money.
