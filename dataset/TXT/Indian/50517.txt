UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg When it comes to Indian food, one would figure that I know my stuff.

Well, I got a bit of a shocker today - I went to Banjara for dinner tonight and I thought that it was going to be bad - as I had bad experiences at its previous incarnations as Mr. Maharaja (on Balmuto) and Banjara when it was at Yonge and Charles - but, I was proven incorrect!

The food was quite tasty!

I was with five others and we had a good array of dishes. I tried the Panner Tikka (a little crispy, tangy and done just right!), Aloo Ghobi (which had some curry leaves in it - so be careful), Chana Masala (not bad) Baingan Bharta (a great Panjabi dish) and Palak Paneer (not the best I had, but very good).

I would have to say that the Eggplant and the Paneer Tikka were my faves! 

The naan was decent, and the rice was cooked to perfection!

I will return!
