0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw One of my favourite neighbourhood places....it's the place I go when I feel like a cheat day from my regular diet...the staff is very polite and the food is absolutely delightful....would recommend this place to any and everyone looking for a true experience of the Hakka Chinese cuisine......I am a devoted cook myself and appreciate the authenticity of the cuisine here...I am moving a bit far soon but will travel here just for the awesome food...keep up the good work...cheers
