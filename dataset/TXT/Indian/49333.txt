tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Been hearing about this place from a couple people. It was very tasty and had a good selection for the buffet. $25 including tip for 2 is a very good deal to me! I only gave it 4 stars because they didn't give you a hot sizzling chicken tandoori on an iron cast skillet. Maybe I'm spoiled for expecting that since I'm from Chicago originally. They give you one every time. Otherwise, really good food. I was full after 2 plates only...
