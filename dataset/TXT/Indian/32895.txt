llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Been here twice in less than a month, both times for their weekend lunch buffet. Love it Love it Love it!!!!

I've had my fair share of buffets and it's rare to get food that's as hot, fresh and tasty as ala carte! And this place gives you just that. Both times left me satisfied and impressed and a sure sign of coming back again :)

Highly recommended!
