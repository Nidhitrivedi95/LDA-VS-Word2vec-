ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I love this place. I have been looking for a good Indian place for awhile and finally went today. This is my second time having Indian food and this was just as good as the first. We ordered the lamb meatballs as a starter and it was delicious! My friend who went with me LOVED the sauce that it came in. I had the chicken vindaloo SPICY and it was PERFECT! I didn't feel the heat right away but after awhile I found myself sweating just a little bit. My friend had the lamb dish which he liked as well. We also had a side dish of lemon rice which was good as well. 

I would really recommend this place to anyone who likes Indian food. 

The ambiance is really nice too. Very cozy!
