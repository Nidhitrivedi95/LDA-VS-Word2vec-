2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Awesome place! The food was delicious with great spices/flavour and a good meat and potatoes to sauce ratio.

Always lots of people there and coming for take out which is always a good sign. Great to see a local place doing well in an area with lots of chains. 

Got the chicken vindaloo and went with the medium spicy option. Good spice level but i like spicy food so I will probably up to hot next time.

If you like roti, hit this place up.

Even a few tables outside in nice weather.
