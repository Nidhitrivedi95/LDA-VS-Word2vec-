Had the duck option and there really wasn't too much meat in the mix; what I had instead were a lot of bones (meat-eaters might be better off sticking to one of the boneless options perhaps? I'll have to try that next time). What meat there was tasted pretty good though. Overall a pretty solid place, it's just that next time I'll be looking to fine-tune my order to something that suits me a little better.
