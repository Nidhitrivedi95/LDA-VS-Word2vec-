e8_Xt-ldpDgWHn92s3rBaQ I loved this restaurant. I rarely hand out 5 stars, but the food was so authentic and delicious I couldn't give it 4. 

The chicken biryani was the best I've had in a long while. The naan was great, we had the garlic and the onion. 

I forget the name now but we also had a mango drink that was incredible. 

I love indian food but am rather picky, luckily I found a joint I can regular.
