I have never had Pakistan rice or palak paneer before.  Different, but delicious! The naan I ordered came on its own wicker tray which was cute.  

Waaaay more food than I could eat on my own.  My server was nice and made sure I was comfortable.  The owner seemed concerned when I didn't finish my food so I know he genuinely cared if I had enjoyed my dinner.  No worries, I loved it!
