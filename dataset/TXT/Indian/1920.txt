-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ Mr. H and I went to Kwality since I was craving Chole Bhature and that turned out to be the only thing we liked.

Although I made reservations we never needed them since the place was not too packed. We ordered the Tandoori Platter with Seekh Kabab (goat)(good), Paneer Tikka (better than good), Chicken Tikka (so average) and Chicken Hariyali (uh..).

We also tried the Pani Puri which was so average and don't even get me started on the Kulfi Faluda... let's just say I never finished it.... and it's still lying in my fridge... I should probably toss it out.
