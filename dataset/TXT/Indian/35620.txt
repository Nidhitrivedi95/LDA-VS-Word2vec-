N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg I've never had Indian fast food before, but I'm guessing curry pot is a chain. Their menu is at least varied, with vegetarian and meat options for all. I ended up ordering the shahi paneer because I like a good paneer, although I have never had shahi before. 
It came out steaming in a small plastic container, so I could take it back to my place if I really wanted to. It was served with naan, a side of masala sprinkled vegetables, including onion, cucumber, and tomato, rice, and the curry. 
The rice was steaming. The naan was fresh. The vegetables confused me until I dipped a piece into the curry. Then I saw a huge flaw. 
The curry was cold. 
Not cold cold but room temperature. Eating the shahi paneer with naan and rice disguised it, but dipping in a piece of onion confirmed it. The curry was cold. 
Don't serve cold curry, guys. It's the end of December. Please keep me healthy. Thanks.
