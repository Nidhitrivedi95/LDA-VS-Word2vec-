TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Don't let the sketchy exterior of this place fool you. It's actually a pretty nice and clean restaurant. The owner who also is the main entertainer is really nice and has a great singing voice. There was also a belly dancer who kept things lively and entertaining as well.

Food was reasonably priced and very good. Everyone in our 13 people group enjoyed their food very much. Three of us shared the Lamb Vindaloo and the Tandori grill plate. That was freaking delicious...very good seasoning and flavor on the chicken, lamb and shrimp. My only complaint is about the Naan...it was a bit too toasted and not soft like what I'm used to. But no biggie..it was still very good.

Overall this place was a hit..the main reason I can't give it 5 stars is mainly due to the service. Although the waiters were friendly, they seemed a bit confused and the food took a long time to come out. Which I'm sure was due to our large party. Other than that I would definitely recommend this place.
