-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g The food was so good here! I would recommend the butter chicken with butter naan, but any chicken dish here is very delicious. What I tried of the lamb wasn't anything special, it's not worth getting over chicken.

One dish came out before any of the others and our naan bread came out after all the food had been served.

The service was slow, even though it was only my table of four and another small group. It was also a little pricey for what we got.

Overall, the most stand out thing was the butter chicken with butter naan. It was a great combination worth going back for.
