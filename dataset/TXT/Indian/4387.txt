Asia Subba opened up about a month ago, and I was waiting for the right moment to go, namely someone else offering to buy me dinner. The restaurant offers sushi, Indian and Nepalese food. We came specifically for the Nepalese food as I had never tried it before. We tried the pork , lamb, samusas and chicken fried rice. The lamb was amazing, very juicy and flavorful . All the entrees came with curried vegetables and steamed rice. There were also Nepalese pickled veggies that my friend referred to as a "warm condiment". The samusas were less spiced than the Indian version that I am
Accustomed to and my son ate his fried rice. The restaurant is clean and air conditioned! Also Mr.Subba, the owner is super friendly. Please note that the restaurant is located up stairs.
