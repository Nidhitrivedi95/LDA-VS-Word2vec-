XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I'm no expert on Tibetan cuisine, but I can't imagine the experience gets much better than Tibet Kitchen. We ventured to the west-end in hopes of something unique and delicious, and we were not disappointed.
We explored the menu, and tried the steamed chicken momos, steamed beef momos, pan-fried veg momos, chicken spring rolls, veg spring rolls, dry chili chicken, and blood sausage. To my surprise, my favorite variety of momo was definitely the veg, they were super flavorful and well-spiced. The chili chicken was a big hit, but the real prize was the blood sausage. Very distinctive, but also super approachable and not as strange as some of you more reserved eaters might think.
The reasonably priced beer and amazing service were just extras. I can't wait to make my return in the summer and check out their patio. Also note that their chili oil might be my favorite to date. It's the first thing I try at any restaurant that places it on the table, and this one was phenomenal.
