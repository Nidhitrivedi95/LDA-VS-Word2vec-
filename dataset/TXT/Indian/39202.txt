oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw I use groupon quite a bit for restaurant deals and decided to try this place since I had a taste for Indian food and have not had it in awhile. My son was with me and he was game to try something new. Upon entering my first thought was the place looked dated  and tired, it was also empty but the patio had some people eating. My son wanted to sit outside and so we did. Our server was very nice. I order the chicken tikka with a side salad and my son got the shrimp rangoon. I also order a beer. I got a semi chilled glass and a barely cold bottle of beer which turned warm rather quickly with the outside temperature. The food came pretty quickly but our server forgot to bring the side salad out first so I ended up asking for it. My chicken was good, flavor wise and spice wise but the chicken itself was not tender. My son liked the shrimp but didn't care much for the curry. Overall the prices are a little high for the size of the portions. The service was just okay and the atmosphere was also just okay. Would I go back? Hmmm, maybe...?
