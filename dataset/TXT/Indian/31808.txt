kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g I am newly gluten free and dairy free (although not a vegan). I'd been dying to try a tikka masala but had never been able to due to the common use of cream in the dish. I was amazed to find this restaurant had extensive GF and vegan menu options. Our server (also possibly the owner or manager?) was patient and knowledgeable about my requests. The lentil towers were delicious. The chicken tikka masala was rich and savory and delicious and even came with some GF bread for dipping. I also loved the iced tea. I look forward to returning to this place.
