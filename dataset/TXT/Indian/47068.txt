Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Great place. Do not be fooled by the location or the minimum of "ambiance". The food is fantastic and the service is always great. If you opt for take out -- it is ready quickly and worth the trip to pick it up. You can have delivery but we have never tried that since we live in the area. Recommend.
