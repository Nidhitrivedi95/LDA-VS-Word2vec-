TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw My friends and I always finish our trip to Vegas with some indian food and usually go to Mint. This time Mint was packed and had a long wait so we decided to venture to India palace. The quality of the tikka massla is superb!  Moist and tender, and very favorful! They didn't have garlic naan readily available but when we asked they made it happen! Service is great! We'll we be back and probably make this place a new tradition. The only bad thing I can say is they didn't have a variety of dessert and didn't have my favorite indian dessert Halva and Galb jamun.
