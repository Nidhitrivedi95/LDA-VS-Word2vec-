UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ I've been eating east Indian food all my life, from California to Indiana, and Express Kabob is some of the best Indian food around!

Food is Cooked to Order, choice of mild to spicey. Staff is friendly, and place is clean.

I've tried their Chicken Korma (my fav), Chicken Tikki and their Chicken Curry at a medium spice and each dish was delish!!!

If you like Indian food or Kabob's come check it out! The best and only local restaurant for east Indian cusine.
