yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug This is by the far the best Indian food I have experienced in Vegas. I have dined there 8 or 9 times in the last few months. The service is great, the restaurant is beautiful and clean and the food is excellent. You can request your preferred spice level for each dish. I have dined there with Indian and non- Indian friends and we all agree the food is excellent. Was there again last night and the bar is open. They have received their liquor license and have a full bar. The lunch buffet is a great deal. Unlike many Indian buffets, the food here is fresh and the buffet area is well maintained. So why only stars? The restaurant is located in an ok area getting in and out of the parking lot is a pain.
