gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A My husband and I went to have some dinner and we didn't realize the time. The restaurant was actually closed and the owner Prakash welcomed us and gave us the option to order take out. We really appreciated that, and we were worried that his staff would be upset with us for ruining their closing routine! Prakash was so nice and he took our order and we even ordered extra sides after we had put the original order in, and he still accommodated us. He didn't even charge us for the extra sides. We will definitely come here again within hours when we are in town next time. The food was amazing spicy like we enjoy.
