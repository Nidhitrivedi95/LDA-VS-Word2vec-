aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q I used to really like this place and went in on Friday's for many weeks.

Then I got FOOD POISONING from a rancid ras malai.

The moment I put it in my mouth I realized it was off.  I spit it out immediately.
Instead of a sweet milk it was a sour bread-like foam -- sort of like vinegar cheese.
I was heaving and spitting out food into their garbage bin for several minutes.

The guy at the counter made me pay for the rest of the food, which I could not eat.
IMO he should not have charged me anything for making me suffer so much.

When I got home my stomach was very upset, with mild food poisoning and I was commission for the day.

I won't go back.

Also, during the winter they don't seem to turn on the heat.
