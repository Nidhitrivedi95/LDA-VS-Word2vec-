GYmdm_Vy7sf9tji7WUcohg Sometimes, it doesn't take the best food or wildest decor to get a five star. It's a combination of great, passionate food and warm hospitality. 

The place looks small from the outside and I barely notice it driving by. But you know a place is going to be good when the owner himself greets you with a welcoming smile and each of the buffet options are cooked in small batches with heart and pride. 

The owner checked up on us a few times during our visit just to ask if everything was good. He had such a friendly smile and even though we didn't converse much, he made us feel welcomed and I could sense how passionate he is about his food. Thank you for bringing a bit of your culture to us!

The butter chicken is amazing!! Tender chicken with a delicious tomatoe-y yogurt-y sauce. I couldn't get enough of the fresh naan dipped in there. The goat curry was also very good! The lamb curry had bones with the bone marrow still inside all gelatinous and bursting with flavour! 

Honestly, I get random hankerings for some good Indian food, but never can find a place at a good price with a variety of dishes to enjoy. So glad my fellow Yelpers recommended this place. I'll be back for more!!
