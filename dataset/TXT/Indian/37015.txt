o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I just moved into the area and a neighbor highly recommended this place. Had dinner here last night with a friend. We started off with tea, I got the raspberry flavor, it was sweet and delicious. We then ordered the Lamb Vindaloo (medium spicy) and the Butter Chicken, these dishes are a la carte so we had to order a side of rice too. We also got naan for my gluten indulgent friend which he liked. We each tried both dishes and really enjoyed them. 
The manager (owner?) of the place came over to our table not once but twice to chat and she asked how we enjoyed the food. We really like it and there was plenty leftover for my lunch today. The medium spice level of the Vindaloo was just right.
Pricing was reasonable but I will say that the entrees should come with the rice.
My overall experience was really good and I will definitely be back.
