-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Having recently turned vegetarian for health reasons, I wondered if the Paneer Tikka Masala could be half as good as their Chicken Tikka Masala, which was the best I've had from England to NYC to Phx. Well, no need to worry because it was superb! Smooth and creamy, the dish melts in your mouth. There are numerous vegetarian options. I strongly suggest samosas to start, and you can't go wrong with their saag/palak, chana masala, either of the dahls, the yummy okra dish, or the aloo gobi with savory cauliflower and potatoes. Add rice and garlic naan and you will have a delicious  meal. Take some home too cuz it's even better the next day!  Friendly and courteous staff, and the owner usually stops by every table.
