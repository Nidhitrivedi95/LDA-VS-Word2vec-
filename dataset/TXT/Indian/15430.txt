CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ I have had my fair share of Indian over the past few years, all from the various regions of India. Prices are decent and the place is new. The downsides?   Who charges extra for Sambhar ?? I dont want wada sambhar if it's been sitting there for awhile and already soggy.  If I order regular wada and want to dip in sambhar, I have to pay extra!  I though sambhar is complementary for most south indian dishes.  Also, some of the combo's are misleading. It says "2 ea" plain as day but it only comes w/ 2 idly, 1 wada. To complicate this further the menu picture screen shows 3 idly!  Confusing.  I think I'll pass on this place and try that other place up the street.
