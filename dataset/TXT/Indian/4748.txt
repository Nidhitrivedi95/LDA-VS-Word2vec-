2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg I came to this place when it was Indian Paradise 2 and got my order to-go it was absolutely horrible but decided to give them another chance since they changed the name recently to Mayuri Place. My mom just moved to Arizona and has never had a curry so I brought her to this place and the service was great but the food was horrible again. I have had many curries and this place just doesn't compare. :-(
