8vq9tnnH5qvnbBdeXYBJyw The butter chicken is amazing, it's my absolute favourite butter chicken. I also tried the butter chicken wrap, which wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I think they used naan bread as the wrap, which was a little stiff and it was dry in the outside and drenched with sauce on the inside. It was very hard to chew. The service is always terrible. Half of the time the employee is on their personal cell phone talking, and doesn't notice customers until loudly spoken to. They're not the most enthusiastic people either. If it wasn't for the butter chicken, I wouldn't be coming back.
