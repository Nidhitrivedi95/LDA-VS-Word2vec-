-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Our beloved Royal Taj has returned as Nandini! The ownership stayed within the same family so the dishes are blessedly all the same. The interior got a bit of a facelift, and the service is still very warm and friendly.

Get the korma, and you won't be sorry. I have yet to try a place that comes close to their sublime version. They also have the best garlic naan of anywhere I've tried. We are big fans of the saag paneer and their masala dishes. I love the paneer tikka too since it's just grilled cheese on a bed of onions and peppers. It's a nice change of pace from the all the sauce-heavy dishes.

I have only gone for dinner because of my work schedule, but my sister says the buffet is awesome. Fewer choices than other Indian buffets, but the quality of the food is unbeatable.
