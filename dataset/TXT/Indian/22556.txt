gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Came here for dinner with my white colleagues. Quite an unsatisfactory experience, as they were disgusted at the way the food was handled by the waitresses. No serving trays were used; in fact the waitresses would carry bowls of food in their bare hands, with their thumbs dipping into the dish they are carrying. The far more disgusting part is that these same waitresses were cleaning tables and dishes just before carrying us our meal, after which they returned right back to their cleaning. The lack of hygiene downgraded the good food, and made everything feel quite unpleasing. I would give the restaurant another chance if the owner Mr. Raj corrected this improperness.
