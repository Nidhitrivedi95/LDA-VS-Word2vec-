rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ Not sure how this was rated one of the best Indian restaurants. 

The lamb chops were great and also okra fries. Order these.

We also got the chaat, and butter chicken. Meh, nothing special. 

This is no way on a similar level as Dishoom in London, Vijs in Van, Junoon in NYC ...there is no comparison in quality, ambience, taste and experience. Our waiter was in a rush and kept calling the naan, bread. 

I would argue Tich is better in Etobicoke for Indian food if your in the GTA.
