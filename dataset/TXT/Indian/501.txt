-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g We went here on a Thursday night (05-12-16) and asked one of the waiter's  who happened to be outside on a break if they had a clay tandoori oven. He said they purchased one 30 days ago. My requirement for any good Indian restaurant is that they must have a clay oven. When we went inside they were having issues with their A/C. Since the A/C wasn't working we decided to order (Medium) Chicken Tikka Marsala and some Garlic Naan to go. They gave us a free Apple-Seven up cocktail while we were waiting and it was extremely refreshing. When we got back home we enjoyed the food very much. The chicken was very tender and the seasoned Marsala was mouth watering. What a great find for a Thursday night. The sign out front said that the restaurant was under new management. If we lived in Scottsdale we would certainly be back trying more of the menu.
