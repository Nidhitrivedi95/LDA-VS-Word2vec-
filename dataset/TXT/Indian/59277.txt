The chopping is so sporadic, and obviously rushed. The chicken Tikka Masala was SUPER greasy! Waaaay too much Ghee, or maybe even oil. The chicken in the Tikka Masala was grainy and powdery, and there was so little of it. Odd.

We ordered from EAT24, where it said that they're delivery fee was free. Then when we checked out, our receipt said it was a $5 charge. They said that India Masala charges $5 for delivering "Far away". We are literally 3 blocks from them, and THAT is considered far? What's close? If you live in the same strip mall as the restaurant? Our order took an hour and 15 minutes to arrive. We will not be ordering from them again.
