VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ Guru Palace is our favorite Indian restaurant, equal to or better than most Indian restaurants in New York City and London. This advice is from a former New Yorker who grew up in an Indian neighborhood. And we routinely cook Indian food at home! The food and service is consistently excellent. We regularly order the vindaloo, achari, saag, and mixed grill dishes. It's totally worth it. Someone mentioned the tikka masala and that too is consistently perfect.The decor in the restaurant is lovely but we believe the restaurant could draw larger crowds with better lighting. Prices match the quality of the cuisine, so it's worth it.
