XYnhQq6aUSVcYXymsfngcA I had this place for delivery and we ordered the butter chicken, naan, palao rice, onion badgi, samosa and lamb bhuna. Everything was very good. I've ordered from 6 or 7 indian restaurants in Montreal, and this is the best I've tried so far. Will order from here again. The butter chicken was velvety and the lamb bhuna was flavorful. Also the dessert was fresh and not made a week ago.
