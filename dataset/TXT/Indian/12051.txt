auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Excellent!  What a gem. 
Good food here.  The lunch buffet 7 days a week is by far the best deal for $10 and it was fresh food. Good way to try the offerings. My wife and I also had dinner here and it was a little more expensive but outstanding. Tandoori chicken is some of the best I have ever had. I noticed it is a little spicier when you order for dinner which I thought was great.  Also good vegetarian selection including the lunch buffet.  Highly recommend this place.
