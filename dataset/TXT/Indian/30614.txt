KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA My boyfriend took me here last minute. Usually I am given time to read reviews and even one poor review can make me turn away. I'm so glad that I wasn't given the time for that. Was service a little slow?? Sure. Did I care? Of course not..... I was there spending time with my boyfriend and we were in no rush. 

The food was worth the wait. We ordered the Kadai Chicken and the Chicken Tikka Masala with rice and naan. There is nothing that I can complain about. I loved everything (we shared of course) and was still talking about how great the food was the next day. Please don't visit this place if you're in a rush and are going to let the wait for service cause you to rate the food poorly. Don't visit if you're impatient because the goal is to get some pictures for your Instagram album. The food is fabulous. Just go with someone that you really want to spend time with and don't worry about the wait.
