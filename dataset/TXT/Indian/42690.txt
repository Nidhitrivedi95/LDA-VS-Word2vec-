RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Checked out Blue Taj for a business lunch recently and was a little underwhelmed, especially after reading some of the reviews. The place is located in the Ballantyne Village, but it's a little hidden in the back under the escalators. There is some outdoor seating but it faces the parking garage. It was also pretty dark inside, which if I was on a date, may have been ok, but for a business lunch, the mood didn't need to be set :) 

All the lunch entrees were under $10. Ordered the popular chicken tikka masala, which came with soup/salad. The salad didn't sound interesting, so I went with the the coconut tomato bisque. It had great flavor and set the stage for me. The entree came separate with rice and the tikka masala. The tikka masala was good, but not great. My only issue was that the flavor of the soup and the entree were so close (red cream sauce) that it felt like a continuation of the soup with some change . May not make sense, but a different soup choice would be nice especially since the tikka masala is so popular.
