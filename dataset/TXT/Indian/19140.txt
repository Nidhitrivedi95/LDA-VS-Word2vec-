f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Awesome place. I love all the items on the menu- be it veg or non veg. Anyone who is North Indian would love the food here - people are very welcoming. I went (3 times ) when they were closed but still they let us in. Quality of food is good and it's super delicious. Highly recommended.
