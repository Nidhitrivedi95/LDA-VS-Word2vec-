HVK_m2JUL24hV-w5q_d2Rg Indian Kitchen provided me with a satisfying meal that scratched my brown itch quite nicely.  Service was kinda rude at the start but they eventually warmed up and were pretty friendly by the end of our meal.

The chicken tikka, saag and butter chicken were rich with flavour and delicious.  The chicken itself wasn't as tender as I would have liked, but very rarely am I happy with the chicken I find in curries at restaurants.

The garlic naan was piping hot, baked to perfection and oh so damn good at moping up loose bits of rice and murky pools of sauce.  I'm happy with my experience here, would have no problems coming back.  Wish they delivered.
