vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw Love this place....great indian food, nice waiters who serve well and are friendly from the moment you walk in the door, and delicious Indian cuisine.  Went with a Groupon and will continue to return when craving real authentic Indian food.  Perfect for warming you up in these cold winters.  
Their Naan is yummy :)  and everything we ordered was made to perfection, right down to their rice.  Even had leftovers to bring home...great prices too!  well done!
