t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Customer service was great! The garlic naan bread was the best. I ordered 2 orders each of the garlic and butter naan bread. They give a lot of food. I ordered the food with the #6 spicy and it had a good kick. If you like spicy I'd suggest to order 10. I ordered the Veggie Samosa as an appetizer. It was delicious only came with 2. Chicken Tikka, Madras w/vegetable. The yogurt sauce was good.The food was tasty I'd go back.
