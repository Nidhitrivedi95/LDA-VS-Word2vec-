3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Oh boy!  My sister found a great South Indian Buffet in Vegas (via yelp, of course!) Fantastic buffet spread!  I especially like that they have Chicken Biryani, Saag, Dhal, Butter Chicken, the most tender Tandoori Chicken and lots of other items too many to mention.  All were good!  There were 2 kinds of naan brought to the table and helped me to try out all the different curries in the buffet.  Eat all dishes with bites of the split jalapeno peppers.  Sure adds that heat in the food.  Dessert was gulab jamun and kheer.  

Will be back!
