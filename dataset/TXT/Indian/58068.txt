yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Out of all the Indian restaurants that I've been to in the valley, this one is definitely the best one I've been to so far. Their curry dish is amazingly delicious. I wanted to order one that tastes sweet and this one is definitely favorable. Their flat bread is so fresh and I can't get enough of it. 

I order a Mango Lassi and it tastes a bit weird to me. As for the dessert, I ordered rice pudding and it is a bit too sweet for my taste (still delicious). Service was average.  

I will come back here again to try other dishes.
