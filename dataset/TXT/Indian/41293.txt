Pros:
-awesome lamb curry
-best naan bread ever
-great samosas

Cons:
-no air conditioning ( I went on a hot day)
-small space
-bad service

To elaborate on the cons, I went on a hot day and the small space and heat just made it uncomfortable to eat the hot food. They had one air purifier that blew air but it was right at the front of the restaurant and my group was in the very back near the kitchen. It wouldn't have been bad if we were up by the air but I feel it's unacceptable for a restaurant to have no AC in a place like Toronto where it can get pretty hot. The service was lackluster. We waked in, and one waiter looked at us and I said we had four people and just kinda walked off. We ended up walking to the end where there was a table. Then we sat down and waited about 7 minutes for any sort of attention. No menus, no water, nada. We also had to remind them about things like refilling water, the chutney and rita we ordered, and the rice. Overall, this place had great food but an uncomfortable atmosphere.
