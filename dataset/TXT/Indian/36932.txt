o_sq_rvTBo59hm6TkDi6tg Really surprised. Came here with an entertainment coupon and didn't know if it'd be good, but their own special butter chicken is the best I've had in GTA, like the ones I've had in Hong Kong and better than ones I tried in India. The goat was spot on too. We got the bread basket, and two curries plus that bread basket was just right for the three of us (when the curries first came they looked small, but worked out). 

Highly recommended if you know your Indian food and like flavourful.

The Papadaums (rolled) in the beginning were a great welcome, followed by hot towels at the end. Fine dining indeed.
