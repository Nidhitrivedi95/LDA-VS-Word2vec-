FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Dear Swagat where have I been I didn't meet you before?? I just wanted to say I am so happy I did today :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
I have tried other indian buffets and I could taste the big difference. It is the same price as the other Indian restaurants but I don't mind as long as it is quality food and it was indeed. My hubby and I were seated in a table where all the people passed by next to us but I enjoyed the food so much I felt the world around me disappeared and I just focused on the fireworks this amazing food made me see.

Things that really pop compared to other Indian buffets, chicken tikka masala, it was so tender and the sauce so well done (others tend to be lemony), Vegetable pakora and samosas (the breading was thin enough to taste the beautiful flavors of the veggies and also so golden and crunchy!)  paneer kadahi ( nice small cottage cheese pieces with a heavenly creamy sauce). Their biryani rice was colorful with small chicken pieces and it tasted soo good! My God I don't even know how to continue explaining how good the food was, in a sentence, it was such a pleasure to eat such a variety of flavors in every single bite.......mmmm, I suspect this new acquaintance and I will become good friends....to be continued......
