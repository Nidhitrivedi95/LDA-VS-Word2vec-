dNZbJdDWWKULd_KoG4lnkQ I went with my boyfriend, we found this place on Yelp and so glad we did.

The food was delicious and there was so much selection and that's saying a lot considering we are both vegetarians. 

The service was so fast and friendly and she gave us a tour of the buffet telling us what everything is. 

When the bill came we assumed they made a mistake. It was $25 so my boyfriend asked her if she forgot to charge for two people. Nope, it's $10 per person for a huge feast we didn't even get try everything!

Highly recommend!
