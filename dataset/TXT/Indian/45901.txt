sJ0MYSAIVK28cMzh-s-NPA I stopped by at the Eaton Centre food court to grab some food inbetween my conference. The selection was so wide in terms of restaurants. I was craving Indian food so I checked out Amara Express- I chose to have a combo of Shahi Paneer with rice and a small garden salad to go (10$), with a Perrier my combo came out to 15$. The restaurant was generous with the amount of rice but I only saw 5 pieces of Paneer! Really?! I'm not paying  for meat here! Regardless I thought this was too pricey for 5 pieces of cheese! The flavours were good though. 
Next time you're craving Indian food - stick to a proper restaurant that gives you larger portions that match their pricing!
