kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw Really really wanted to like this place but yet again the food has failed ! Decided to give this place a second try and ordered envy green curry (the menu stated it was spicy) and that's what I was in mood for. Food was super salty and has no spice to it.. I could barely finish it. I hate writing negative reviews but this was awful. Last time I had ordered chicken tika masala and it was less than average. The pro: cute place and friendly service. 
Con: if ur in mood for spicy skip this place..
Won't be returning
