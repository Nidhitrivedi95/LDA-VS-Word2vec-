MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ My husband and I went to Al Hamra for the first time tonight and we both really enjoyed it.  
We started with Samosa's.  They had good flavor and taste, not a lot of spice.
The plain Naan was warm and delicious.
Entree's were Chicken Tikki Masala (spicy scale =3) and Lamb Korma (spice scale = 8).  Both were flavorful and well prepared though I thought the sauce to meat ratio was a little high.  
I don't tolerate spicy food and 3 was just right.  By the time I finished my mouth was pleasantly warm.  8 for my spice craving husband was perfect for him.  He was sweating under his eyes and enjoying every bite.
Both entree's came with jasmine rice laced with cumin and cardamom - yum.
Yes, the prices are a bit high but you pay for the location.  I think it's well with it.  Ask for Damir (not sure of the spelling) - he was genuine and attentive.
