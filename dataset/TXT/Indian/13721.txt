BQsHIeY0x__B5IHyyQZ1ng A friend of mine pointed out this restaurant to me and I decided to check it out after my workout.  

A few tips when ordering here: 
1. They will have things labelled "vegan" but may include cheese or yogurt.  What the V actually means is that they have a vegan option and you need to tell them that.  

2. Ask the cashier for recommendations as they have a very large menu.  

With regards to the restaurant and food itself, the location is in an industrial plaza off Dixie road.  

The atmosphere is that of a casual self-serve restaurant.  

What I ordered:

-Veggie (vegan) biryani: You get to tell them how spicy you want it which is good. I had it medium spicy and it wasn't too spicy at all, so it was not bad.  The taste was good, had a good helping of vegetables and it was tasty. My only complaint is that it was a bit too greasy for my liking.  

-Channa Samosa Chaat - It's basically the a mini samsosa topped with chutney and curry.  It had a nice tangy taste to it.  

Overall, the food was pretty good and I'd be willing to go back and prices are very reasonable as I paid just over $12 for a very good helping of food.
