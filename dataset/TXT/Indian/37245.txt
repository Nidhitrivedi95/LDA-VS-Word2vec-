O3tlWsT37H1JtLzje2Wmbg Located in an unassuming strip plaza and apparently under a new name, (previously known as Kashmir Palace), Flavors of India Restaurant is fantastic. All was quiet on a Friday evening with a few regulars but the place seemed steady with business between diners and takeout orders. 

Prices are fair, food is good quality, an the portions are good. 

The services was attentive, but not overly so. The staff continued to check on us, even after we had paid our bill. They made excellent recommendations, and asked pertinent questions concerning our tastes and the spice level. 

The menu is nice and has something to please carnivore and vegetarians alike. 

I would love to go back during lunch to try the buffet; I always have a hard time choosing my meal and love the idea of trying lots of things! 

I would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a good Indian meal!
