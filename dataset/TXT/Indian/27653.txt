Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Quiet little place with nice atmosphere and pleasant and knowledgeable staff. We came in for dinner and I had paneer in creamed spinach which was tasty. My husband had chicken Tikka  masala which was tender and well prepared. Portions were huge and we took most of our meals home. Although the flavor was good the sauce was too creamy and on the heavy side. 
We would like to come back and try something else.
