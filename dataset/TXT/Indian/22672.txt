GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw This establishment was recommended to me by several complete strangers, so one rainy evening three of us descended into Matagali. 

A few plates of various curries, rice and delicious garlic naan later we were full and very happy. The service was quick and pleasant and the price quite reasonable for a downtown joint, around 15 per person which included a cold beer each.

What I liked best was the intimate setting, which was reminiscent of a similar Indian restaurant I used to frequent in Montreal. These downstairs locations, when done well, are just plain cozy.

All in all, it's the best kind of place to hide out from the rain.
