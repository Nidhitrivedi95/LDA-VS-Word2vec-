ERX_Dz1prKPk_qXtFhUsAA I just ordered delivery.... I will get to the bottom of this!!!!!!!!!!

****************************************************************

Haha wrote that about a couple hours ago.  So my story and credibility goes as follows.  I live right around the corner, and have already checked out (and Yelped) about Agara, and Earth Indian Restaurants.  I am of South Asian decent, and love my Indian food, so, I thought I should give this a go... 

So, not that I expect most of you guys to be so close to also get delivery, but my experience was mildly amusing :0, in a good way, I have a sense of humour.  Ordered roughly around 610pm....food arrives, in 1 hour and 20 min! :-).  I actually called in around an hour and 10 and the guy on the phone starts laughing, says the food is ready and he will leave right now on the way!   Pretty lax way to answer that question.  But All good.  I am hungry! 

Guy gets here (yep, same guy on the phone).  So, I gotta ask the guy why it took 1 hour 20 mins to deliver right accross the road (really?).   I ask the guy, "what took you so long, you are accross the street!".  He tells me the rain, that it is sooo busy (yeah right, I know how empty the place is), then, in all honesty, he says "well, you know, small order". 

Did you just admit that you prioritized my order because it was not enough for you?  $30 order, interesting :-)

The food?  Not bad.  I still give it 3 stars, because....it is, ok.  Ordered Vindaloo Chicken (a personal favorite) as well as my favorite Vegetable Dish (Daal).

You likely won't ask for delivery, so feel free to smile at my story and ignore it :0

No, it is not too spicy (most Indian restaurants simply dumb down the spices for you).  It is just, ok. 

Would I drive more than 15 mins to go to this place?  No.  Would I choose it over Agara.  For sure.  

Will I order again?  Only because it is accross the street, and nobody else is around.

Maybe the boys at Yonge and Sheppard need to step up their game.
