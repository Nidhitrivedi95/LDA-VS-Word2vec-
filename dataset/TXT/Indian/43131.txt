RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg We tried the lunch buffet at OM last weekend and were delighted. 

OM is in a little strip mall right off the high-way. Although not impressive from the outside, once you go in, it's clean, tastefully decorated, and even has a children's area. I even thought the bathroom was tasteful. 

Our server seated us, asked if we wanted beverages, and then we headed to the buffet. On the way, we passed the kitchen where you can see the chefs actually preparing the food.

I like Indian buffets because I like to try a little of a lot of things. OM surprised us with dishes and flavors we have not see at other buffets in the area. I enjoyed the breaded and fried plantain. The tandoori chicken which is always a favorite for me, somehow had more flavor and was much juicier than usual. The flavors in the both the vindaloo and the tikka masala which are my defaults just seemed more intense and complex. Even the rice seemed particularly good. For dessert I had the gulab jamun and the kheer which again are my defaults. Again these seemed better than other buffets. The gulab jamun was bigger and lighter w/a sweeter sauce. The rice pudding was smoother and the cardamom really stood out. I was really impressed with the food. The only down-side for me, is that there were more dishes w/the bone-in, but maybe that's where the better flavor comes from.

The service was also very good at OM. They were constantly there to replenish our water. While at the buffet we were discussing what a couple of dishes might be and one of the managers overheard us and kindly explained what was in each dish.

We'll definitely go back to OM.
