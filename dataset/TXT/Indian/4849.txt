2ph-6k3mXY93TLDCteC6IQ The decor is a bit old fashion but the food speaks for itself.The kottu roti is very filling, the the portions are huge and the customer service is on point.The butter chicken is even very good.Not a big fan of string hopper but I don't have experience with this dish ,so I can't rate it.
