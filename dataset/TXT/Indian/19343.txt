f7RXwcus_-EOsR0q5ctVjw I visited Didar for dinner on a quiet Wednesday Evening.
There were a few group of people enjoying their dinner and a steady stream of take out orders coming in and out so it seemed like a good sign.

We ordered an entree of veggie pakora, Butter Chicken, Saag Lamb and a Chickpea Chana with two garlic naan bread.

Everything was hot, fresh and very well seasoned.

I will definitely be back to try other dishes!
