4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q So I was in the mood for a coffee after a short workday and wanted to go to Panera in Heartland, but then to my surprise, I saw the "now open" sign in front of Tandoori Flame.  

This got me psyched!  Apparently today was the first day they are open to the public and will have an official grand opening in three weeks.  

Tandoori Flame is like the Mandarin of Indian foods.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's like Indian food for starters.  It even has some of the same things as Mandarin (onion rings, pizza, chili chicken etc.), but it has a huge selection of curries and meats.  Butter chicken, saag paneer, chili chicken, goat curry, chicken curry, etc.  

If someone is in the mood for Indian food in your party and there are others who have never tried it, this place is a safe bet.  However, if you are very fond of Indian food and want something with a bit more taste and prepared with more care, then I'd recommend Avani which is just a block south of here on Mavis.  

So the dish I love the most, how did it fare? The butter chicken was tender but a bit bland.  Not creamy enough.  My favourite entree though was the curry chicken and the thai style fried fish.  The curry chicken was really good, but it seemed it was more Chinese than Indian.  It was even bone-in and I'm not used to that from Indian restaurants, just Chinese restaurants.  The other dish that was fairly good was the chicken biryani.  All other entrees weren't bad, just not shockingly good, which is the case for most buffets.

The star of the show was definitely the desserts and fresh fruits.  Baklava, sugar balls, ice cream with chocolate pump and sprinkles.  Fruits were so fresh!

Would I go back? Yes.  Is this my favourite Indian food in the area? No, Avani surpasses this by a mile and a 1/2, but for what Tandoori Flame is, it gets 3.5/5.
