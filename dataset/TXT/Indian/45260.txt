S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA When I travel for work, I like to eat where the locals go. Came here while visiting Chandler for work training.  When I came in there was no one there which kind of worried me. The three gentleman that were working that night all were attentive. I was quickly greeted and water brought to me. I placed all my order which included veggie samosa, chicken Marsala, garlic naan, and rice pudding. The samosa was great, just like most samosas. Their chicks. Marsala or butter chicken was also great. The food wasn't anything different than your good/great Indian food. It's what I would of expected. However what makes this place a 5 star is definitely their customer service. Also, hearing the conversation from another table, it seems like their lunch buffet is very popular and attracts more of the crowd. Overall, a great experience on a local place.
