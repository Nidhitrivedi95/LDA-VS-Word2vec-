g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ I went here on Friday night after reading many good reviews.I didn't love the stair case leading to the restaurant, but once we got inside all was forgotten. The restaurant is spacious and done in dark wood. 
The food was very tasty, though not at all spicy. The hot sauce they bring is great though. 
Everything we ordered was on the specialty section of the menu
We had:
The chicken tikka masala
Butter chicken
lamb - incredible sauce!
All were delicious.
The service was excellent every time I've been here. I ordered in once and found the portions to be huge :) I highly recommend Bukhara.
