ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Definitely my Indian restaurant of choice in Lakewood, and probably general Cleveland for that matter. The food is awesome, the atmosphere is great, and the service is superb. All dishes are served on a spiciness factor of 1-10. Be careful to get too adventurous. I have a pretty strong spicy tolerance and I usually stay at between a 4-5. Anything higher will start killing the delicious flavor or have you inhaling water. Also, the garlic naan is a must!
