-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA I came here for the lunch buffet with one other person. I was excited because I have not found any good Indian restaurants in the area. I went in and saw lots of people and good variety in the buffet. Sadly the food was not that good. First, the food was cold which made the chicken kind of hard and everything in general much less enjoyable. Plus the flavors were really mild compared to actual Indian food. The butter chicken was okay but was really watery. There was a good vegetable variety so I guess that is good for vegetarian people. The service was kind too. 
Although it wasn't a bad experience, it wasn't memorable at all. I don't think I would come back for the buffet. And especially not to order directly from the menu... never have a seen naan for $2.5 and biryani more than $15. So overpriced!
