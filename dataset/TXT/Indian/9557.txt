8PZGCtgG5MZKvz9i3B9gCA Eastern Twist is a great addition to the Bathurst/St Clair area. It's nice to have a fast-food option that isn't Pizza Pizza or Subway (or, now, Harvey's).

The restaurant offers a diverse options, with a variety of flavourful curries and seasoned meats. When I go to Eastern Twist, it's usually for a paratha wrap. My favourite tends to be the spicy beef wrap, though the BBQ chicken tikka wrap and the butter chicken wrap are both delicious too -- the butter chicken is the best bet for someone who does not like things spicy. The paratha (bread) itself is absolutely scrumptious.

Once the bread and filling are ready, you can choose which toppings you'd like to add. These include lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, and (very) spicy carrots. There are yogurt and tamarind sauces as well. Beware the carrots! They are delicious, but will be too spicy for some people's tastes.

The vegetarian samosas are cheap and delectable as well.

Everything is made to order, so you may have to wait for 10 or so minutes for it to be ready. You can call in an order to pick up, but I have had mixed results describing what I want and getting it right.

On the whole, I love having the option of grabbing a bite here rather than the standard fast-food options nearby.
