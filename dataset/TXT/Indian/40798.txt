PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g Some of the best northern (mostly) Indian food in Toronto. Inside atmosphere is elegant, but doesn't try to compete with the nouveau decor of the latest crop of top restaurants downtown. The patio is basic, but provides a great alternative for dinning outdoors on warm nights. Portions are generous, so if you want to taste many different dishes, best to go with a larger group, or be prepared for leftovers. The menu has all of the more known dishes, so you will likely find your favorites. The service is professional and courteous. The staff is knowledgeable about the various options and can help guide you, if you are unfamiliar with Indian food. Has a full bar with a well considered wine list that can withstand typical Indian spices. Not expensive, but also not bargain basement. You will feel the dinner is appropriately priced.. Located in Leaside on the Bayview strip which is filled with patios, so there are after dinner alternatives like gelato for desert or a drink at a local watering hole.
