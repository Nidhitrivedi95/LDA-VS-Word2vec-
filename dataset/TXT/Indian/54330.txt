Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I stopped by Jaipur Junction last night to see if the buffet was open, but they said they only serve a lunch buffet.  So I stopped in today for the lunch buffet per the recommendation from a co-worker.  I was not disappointed!  The food here is really good and I got to try two new dishes.

Today, I had Chicken Tikka Masala, white rice, curried peas and tofu, curried potatoes and cauliflower, and naan.  Everything was delicious!

The two new dishes I tried, well, I don't have the names of.  One was a flavorful dark sauce with beans in it.  It reminded me of good old American Baked Beans, but nowhere close in taste.  The other dish I tasted was chickpeas, small crackers, green chutney, vegetables, and yogurt.  This was a light summer dish that reminded me of ambrosia.  Basically, it was an Indian ambrosia.  It was tasty and the texture was interesting.  

I also tried a samosa, which was good when dipped in the masala sauce with the chicken.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Indian food.  I found myself longing for a spicy chutney, which was not present.  Oh well, not everything has to be spicy.  Right?
