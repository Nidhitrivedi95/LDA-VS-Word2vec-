The manager named "Hari" is just AMAZING.  For lunch buffet it is fast and dependable. The quality is consistent from day to day...which is very good. For weekend Sunday is my favorite day to go. I eat a huge pile of noodles that are "asian-indian fusion" along with Samosas, Lentil Soup and what-ever else I can before I "pop". Yummy 
UPDATE : Nov 6th just went there again today. It was great and fresh
