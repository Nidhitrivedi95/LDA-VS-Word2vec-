IO8J6QJsdFeuso1Xmp3YtA I don't often give 5 stars, however Noor has earned them. This is my go to takeaway when it comes to curry, the only better curry is from Kismot (which is a restaurant) IMO. Not only is it great curry, it is great value as the portions, particularly with the set meal, are large. I have worked my way through half the menu and am yet to find a curry which isn't fresh and tasty...

I have even bought the set meal for two occasionally, so I can eat curry for two days as the food easily tastes as good re-heated the next day. The chicken madras, vindaloo or hurri mirchi are my favourites however this is one of the few places I have enjoyed the milder creamier curries from.

In short if you fancy an Indian takeaway then Noor is highly recommended.
