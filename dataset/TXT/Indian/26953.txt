iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA This is the second time I have been there. I always love a good curry and this place has some delicious ones to choose from. When I visit from California I like to go here. Staff could be a little friendlier but the food is great. I highly recommend chicken tikka masala and the korma with of course garlic nann.
