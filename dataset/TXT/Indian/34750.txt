Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Parking sucks here, so try not to drive.

Once you get over that, then you have to find it.  It's upstairs in the Hawaiian Marketplace.  They have a lunch buffet for $15 which is dang good. usual suspects on this buffet and probably like 15 total choices of things to eat.  I've also eaten here for dinner w/ an Indian client of mine.  And when you eat there for lunch you will see Indians eating there too [great sign in my book!]

I love their Indian techno music.  They have a very nice motif, it's very clean, and the staff is on it.

You can be in and out of here [minus parking] at lunch time in 30 mins if you needed to be.
