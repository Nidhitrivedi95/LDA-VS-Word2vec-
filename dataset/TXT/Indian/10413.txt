9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g Sanjeev kapoor.. the name is huge.. and that raises your expectations to a certain level, coz you have grown up watching his recipes.
And, then there is a restuarant by that name. We traveled 2 hours to get here. That's ok, if it's worth it..Let me break this down...
Pros: Ambiance is beautiful. Highly sophisticated. It will give you a feel of a high end restuarant. Price is fine. It's the way it should be.
The food and service is quite a disappointment. We went there to celebrate my brother's birthday. 
We started by ordering tomato soup. For $6, they gave me warmed up butter chicken gravy.. I mean is this some kind of a joke? It was just warmed up sauce.
Then, we got "Aam ki khatti meethi seekh". I would highly recommend this appetizer. I have tried their other appetizers, and this one was unique and I liked it the best!
However, that didn't last long..
For the mains, we got Paneer Tikka Masala and Mushroom Hara Pyaza. 
Jeez, the size of bell peppers in paneer tikka masala was huge. You would put those size of peppers in tandoori paneer tikka, not in a gravy dish. It was really huge. And to top that the paneer pieces were really really hard. 
Mushroom hara pyaza.. it was just green peas all over the place. And it was too creamy. Too creamy!!! It had no taste at all. 
We hardly ate anything.. The naan and lachha paratha was nice though.
It is quite sad. You would expect a descent food with the name attached to the restuarant. Food was very bland. But it's very disappointing. 
Also, the wait time between appetizer and main course was around 15-20 minutes. There should be a subtle flow. 
Slow service! Over rated! Bland food!
