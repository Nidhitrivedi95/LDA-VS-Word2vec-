gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I went to Ruchi for lunch with my wife on Saturday.  We had the buffet.  It was pretty good.  Found the food to be a bit salty though.  

I am of South Indian background, and was raised on food similar to this.  I had some utthapam, dosai, and idli, along with some curries.  

My wife, who is not South Indian, liked it also.

The only thing about South Indian food for me these days is the fact that it is hard for me to want to go to a South Indian restaurant often.  I do go, but for me, I can make similar styles of food at home, and something that is definitely comparable.  My wife and I have done this.  I guess my tastes regarding South Indian, have maybe morphed into a more fusion approach, but this is not the forum to explain.  

I would definitely go back.  This time I will definitely order off the menu, and get my dosai fix.
