BLx1j_3rNdZAtdHhZrJIKw One of the many restaurants still open near the witching hour in town, I visited during and between festival shows. I had Chicken Bhuna traditional rice, garlic nan and pint of Indian brew, the rest of my party arrived after a short while. They had the more sedate portions of chicken korma.

Royal spice staff managed to supply all this within the space of 45 mins and despite it being really really busy staff did forget one portion of rice but amazingly quick to rectify. The food, the taste, not too hot or cold just right.

It was near closing and did think we were the last order of the night, but staff were professional friendly and did have the attitude of grace, or a great refined team that's been serving punters for years. Nice.
