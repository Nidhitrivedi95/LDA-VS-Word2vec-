OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ Well we were the last ones for the buffet, the time says its till 3 on Sundays but there were no refills after 2 30. 

At least we got naans as we asked for them specially.

About food, ya it was ok... Some things were very good ( chilli chicken, matar Paneer) but others subsidized the excitement (mutton, as it was very hard)...

All in all, you you can give it a try if you are hungry but don't expect too much.
