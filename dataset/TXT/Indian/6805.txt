4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw This is a re-review, I ordered delivery via campus food and was very impressed with with the quality and quantity . I ordered spice medium and it came that way with a little bit on the hot side -- just right.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala  -- large portion excellent taste. BTW MAIN dishes are 50% off on Thursday DELIVERED if you call the restaurant rather than campusfood
