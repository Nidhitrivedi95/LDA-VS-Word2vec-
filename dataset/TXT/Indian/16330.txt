DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I drove crosstown in hopes of discovering something extraordinary. What I found in this small restaurant was decent. The decor was nicer than I expected. As a "hole in the wall" kind of place, the restaurant was cozy and had a nice warm color scheme. Chairs and tables were basic and the wait staff was nice. However, nice isn't enough. There were 2 other tables besides mine and service felt incredibly slow. We ordered a lamb samosa appetizer which was probably the best dish of the evening. The meat was a little too lumpy, but the seasoning was delicious.

Then we waited for what felt like twice as long as it should have been for our entrees to arrive. And my pappadums didn't come as an appetizer but as a side dish with the entrees when I reminded our server.

Communication between the two people working front of the house seemed to be lacking. With just 2 other tables besides ours, we were asked twice at the beginning if we wanted any beverages. It just makes me wonder what they would do when they have a full house. They might be weeded with 5 tables!

I had the spinich paneer and it was a little bland but the portion was good and the dish was generous on the paneer. The chicken korma was quite flavorful though the one scoop of rice I got on a plate felt a bit chintzy. Presentation of a single scoop of white rice on a white round plate placed in front of a diner could use a little color. Even if it were a sprig of something green for decoration.

All in all, the experience was fine. If service were better, I might have given this place 4 stars. But it just goes to show, service is very important to dining out.  Though I  won't rush back to this restaurant, I hope they do well in the future.
