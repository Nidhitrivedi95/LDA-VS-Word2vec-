YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ Didn't dine in, but had a take out order for Veg Biryani, Paneer Butter Masala and Butter Naans. Had to wait longer to get the food, but the wait was worth. Taste was really good and the price was very reasonable for the quantity they served. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have good and decent Indian food.
