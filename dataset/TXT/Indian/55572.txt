x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag Really liked this place when it first opened. Stopped by this past weekend and was shocked to 
see how badly it had gone down. The couple at the next table who had arrived after us got  their soup right a way while we had been waiting 15mins. Finally I had to ask the waiter what was going on. He mentioned it was a new Chef and he was messing up. He finally brought the soup. There was a big group of Ladies celebrating a Friend's Birthday, we noticed they
had been served wrong items and they were being sent back. Finally our Food arrived, 
luke warm at best. By this time we were starving so just went ahead and ate it. The waiter 
did come back to ask if everything was ok, and I made it a point to mention the cold food. 
I give this place 1 star only for the quality and taste of food which surprisingly was still good.
Next time I will drive the extra few mins to Fredericks or Hakka King..
