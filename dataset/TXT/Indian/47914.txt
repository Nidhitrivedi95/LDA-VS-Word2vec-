TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Alright so, I'm not Indian. I don't really know what "authentic" is. But, I will say this. I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants in Vegas and California, and India Palace remains number 1 to me. This place is so. damn. good. 

Also, just to throw this out there, I work with many Indian people, and they really like this place a lot as well. Take that information as you will, but, I think it's a good thing. 

I've been coming here for a very long time and I'm friendly with the staff. They are SO polite and friendly. I have always felt very welcomed here since the beginning. 

The food, let's just talk about the food. It's amazing. My favorite being of course the chicken mahkani (butter chicken). It's easily one of my favorite things to eat, ever. They bring you naan bread to the table with an option of regular of garlic. Always go with the garlic, it's not very overwhelming. 

I also do the buffet every time I come here. I've eaten here for dinner twice and while I really do love the food, I feel their dinner portions are rather small when compared to the price. One of these times I used a Groupon and was never met with any kind of negativity, so it's weird to me that people are mentioning that. And as far as the rest of the service, I've never had issues with being neglected service or having my water filled, even when they're busy and hosting a party. 

Anyway, the buffet is great because you get a sampling of a lot of different things for a low price which is never a bad thing. 

Also, I give it a 4 star rating because as much as I love the food, I really hate driving here. It's in a not so lovely part of town and the parking here is a nightmare when they're busy.

Try it for lunch sometime, of course with a mango lassi.
