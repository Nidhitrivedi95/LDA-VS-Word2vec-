S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA I have to take back my four stars review about this fine Indian cuisine, that make me every time happier. we recently went to the buffet on the labor day weekend and, it was amazing experience. The food selection was excellent and we had few items out of the regular menu. still love the service, also the place.
