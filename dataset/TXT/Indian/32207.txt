LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg The Naan Varieties are are really delicious.
We mostly go for lunch buffets as they have more varieties served and is less expensive.
The chicken curry is really good (not the spice that I expected thou), but my favorite will always be Lamb curry at Indian Paradise.
Tandoori Chicken very well marinated is adequately juicy.
