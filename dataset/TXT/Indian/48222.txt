This is only my second different Indian restaurant I have been to. As far as selection of food and by price this is now my favorite. I am still discovering Indian cuisine and so far I really like it. 

Now for those of you that are familiar with Indian cuisine I will say that this is a buffet, so if you like spicy this is not the place for you. However if you want a nice lunch with a good selection at a good price then this place is wonderful. 

The lunch buffet Monday - Friday is only $8.95! 

I recommend here if your a beginner with Indian cuisine, for the price and selection of the buffet, and if your an expert on Indian cuisine and you you don't mind the mildness of the buffet.
