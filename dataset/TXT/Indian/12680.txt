B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Hands DOWN the best Indian cuisine in the Greater Madison area. Not just great food though -- a totally relaxing atmosphere and overly gracious waitstaff. We've only been here a handful of times and somehow every time we arrive we are greeted in a way that says "Hey, we know who you are and we are glad you came back." Singing their praises!
