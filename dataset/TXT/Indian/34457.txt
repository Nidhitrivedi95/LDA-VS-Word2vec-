Good part of this restaurant for me is that this is s vegetarian only that I prefer. Also the set up is contemporary.
Visited this place twice and had similar experience.
All platers other than Undhiyo costs $4:99. Need to buy separate rotis for these that costs $1:99 for a very small roti, that is a rip off. You need 4 rotis at a minimum for an average eater like me that brings the price for one set of roti/curry to $13 + tax which is not worth.
Also on both the visits, though I was fine, both my wife and children did complain about stomach upsets. Happened twice and that is something I will have to take it seriously
