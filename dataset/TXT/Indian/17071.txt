DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I've been on the hunt for a legit Indian restaurant by my house. This place is it!! It's a sit down style restaurant on the smaller side but very lovely. Felt very clean & inviting. The food, oh my goodness, the food! It was very delicious & flavorful. We had the samosas as an appetizer, the pastry was light & crispy, the filling was very delicious. The dipping sauces were also wonderful, it came with a mint sauce & I don't know the name of the other sauce, it was sweet but yummy. We then had the tikka masala, saag & rogan josh. Zero complaints about any of it. Also got some naan bread & peshwari naan, very delicious as well. If you are craving Indian food & your near the Tropicana & Fort Apache area do yourself a favor and stop in for dinner. You won't regret it!
