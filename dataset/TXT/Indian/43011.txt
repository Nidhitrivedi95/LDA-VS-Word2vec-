rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA Pros: 
- price for the food was relatively cheap 
- portions are big 
- kebabs were really hefty, especially for the price
------- chicken kebab was a lot better than I thought, on point 
- atmosphere was relatively clean 
- naan was pretty good, esp garlic 

Cons: 
- beef kebab meat felt really hard, either it was something in the quality of the meat or they were stale and were warmed again? 
- lamb karahi was really small, and wasnt even that good 
- no heating in the room on our side 
- servers were rude, didnt serve out plates
- at the end, they gave us aluminum foil and styrofoam packing and told us to pack the remaining food ourselves LOL 

All in all:
good food, good portions, prices are fine, not too spicy, but service is lacking
