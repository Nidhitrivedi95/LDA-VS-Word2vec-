Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg This is some good shit!!!

This is the first Indian food I've tried in Cleveland. My husband went bananas over the papri chat - totally agree with Pam C on that one!!!! We had the buttery, soft naan as well. I guess naan can't really be bad, but this was gooooood.

I had the lamb saag, which was different for me, as I usually order chicken korma or chana masala. It was great, but I actually liked the sauce more than the lamb itself. The rice was moist and delicately spiced. 

Haven't been to the restaurant, as ordered from food fetchers, but I would definitely go in a heartbeat. And I would order takeout again! There are a LOT of items to choose from.
