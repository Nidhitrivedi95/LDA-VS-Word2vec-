EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg I was a little hesitant at first when I saw the menu included pizza Chinese food and kabobs but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of my meal. Spices where very good and the quality of the ingredients where top notch. The most tender and flavorful beef kabob I have had in a very long time. The naan was great as well. All the employees where very friendly and helpful.
