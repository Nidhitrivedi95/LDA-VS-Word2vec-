- Attentive wait staff. Granted, I was one of the two customer there.

- Sugary, buttery, and most unauthentic sweet balls that I've ever tasted, and it's warm too.

Con:

- Very colorful but extremely tasteless, hardened food. It's under-salted and under-spiced. If we're not counting the color, just the flavor. Their bright red tandoori chicken and creamy yellow-orange butter chicken taste almost the same as microwaved hospital chicken.

- Disgusting ice-cream section, only 2 out of 4 buckets has ice-cream, and it looked filthy.

- After 35 minutes of dining, the waiter brought me my cheque and credit card machine, while I'm still eating.

- Small selection of food for a buffet (about half as much of selections), even less selection of deserts.

-Flies

- Quite pricey for a buffet
