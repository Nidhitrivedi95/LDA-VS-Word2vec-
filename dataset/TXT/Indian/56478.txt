xSuR0FK8cHzBLXowCV3Pyw Brar Sweets is a very popular choice for vegetarian Indian food in Mississauga. I personally am not impressed. Although this place tend to be very busy, for some reason the food does not taste fresh at all. For instance the Malai Kofta, which tends to be a very popular dish, tasted like it was at least week old. And the palak paneer also seems to be made with canned spinach or something of that like. I do not like the Samosas either, which do not have the right melody of spicy, there is just something off. Oh and just skip the pakoras which have no substance at all, and the aloo tikis are not made properly either, they are way too dry. And also if you try the chana bhatura (chickpeas with fried bread), beware that the chana are not very good, they are over masala-d or something and they put a ton of greasy carrot pickle on top. The Indian sweets are decent, but I'm not a fan so there is no motivation for me to come here. Definitely skip this as a place to try if you are looking for a suburban Indian restaurant to try. People keep on insisting that the Brampton location is better, but I don't think I will ever go to Brar on my own free will.
