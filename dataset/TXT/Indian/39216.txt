I ordered a sample platter of Greek appetizers and some Indian moong bean dip. It was all very good, and I boxed more than half of it for a next day lunch.

I also had a Greek coffee, which was great, and I loved the sweet grounds at the bottom.

The couple across from me ordered something that the waitress lit up in flames. Then they ordered a second one of those and I got to see the flames again.

Summary of items from what I can remember:
+Greek platter:
++rice-stuffed grape leaves
++meat nuggets
++spritzy yogurt sauce
++light and flaky spinach thing
++pita bread cut in dip-size
++ground chick peas and tahini
++block of feta cheese and greens
++thinly sliced meat

+Indian moong bean dip
++the dip
++crispy fried and thin, large as small plates crackers

+Greek coffee
++sweet and dark
++came in a small teacup that was actually pretty deep
++put some ice in the left over grounds for a sweet desert


I would go to see the flames again.
