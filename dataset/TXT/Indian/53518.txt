VEfzBuWTF8wa6jQub5ArMw Mmmmmm!! I give Vindaloo 5 stars for their food, ambience and service!

We ordered their buttered chicken, spinach and cheese curry and the curry scallops. The spinach and cheese dish was my favourite!! We also ordered the garlic and original naans which were equally as delicious! The garlic naan could totally be eaten on its own because it was very flavourful.

The servers were also up to par with the food. They were constantly pouring our cups with water whenever they saw them being half full!

Also a bonus star for the free masala chai drinks the waitress gave us tonight! I will definitely order that next time!
