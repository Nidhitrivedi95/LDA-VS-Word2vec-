gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A This is an extremely good Indian restaurant. The chefs certainly know their way around a spice rack. My favorite dish so far is the vegetable korma. I'd suggest ordering a side of garlic naan with your meal, since it's hands-down the best naan in town!

I highly recommend this restaurant.
