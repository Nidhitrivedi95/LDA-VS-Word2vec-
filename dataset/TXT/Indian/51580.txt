After ordering a series of dishes, it takes unusually longer than it should have. And, when we got our food, there was hair in the Chicken Tikka Masala and Rice. Yes - three hairs in each one. I was shocked and disgusted at this. We immediately inform the staff of this and receive a half-baked apology. But, they replace it with no problem. We get the food back, but now our Naan is cold. So, we ask for the Naan to be warmed or get new Naan. They oblige and we get new Naan. My friend takes a bite into his potatoes that we got and there YET AGAIN another hair. But, this one being smaller. I have never been to place that allows its cooks to leave hair in the food. It is very careless of them. 

I was expecting amazingly service, but was met with subpar service. I expected amazing food, but I was met with hair in the food. I will not be back here. Too gross to eat hair in the food. 

Foodies BEWARE!
