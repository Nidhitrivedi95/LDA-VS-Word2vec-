lBwx8insD-RNa-_lOtA3kA Yay! I'm a fan, mostly because of the young fella serving us in the rainy Tuesday evening, as he just made everything the best.

We were the only customers around 8 PM. Had chickpea dahl and naan. The guy made the naan bread, which was the best I have ever had. Chckpeas were warmed in the microwave of course and complimentary jug with water was poured to styrofoam cups. 

There are indeed plenty of Indian food classics here and what makes the decision easier, is they have many photos of the foods on the wall, so you can see what you are getting.

Service and very delicious chickpeas made us to love this place. Not a fancy, but yet clean place with not a very nice washroom though. But food is cheap and so good. Paid for our shared dinner $ 6.74, that included two naan breads and meal + water, unfortunately they had run out of salad, so no salad for us.

As much as I am a food lover I love people, and I love when they do their job with passion even in such a late hour. Respect. Recommend for tasty and cheap food. We will continue our adventures there.
