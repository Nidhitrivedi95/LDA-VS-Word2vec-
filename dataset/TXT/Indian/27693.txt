Iqu-RwRA4XfwILKQLKQZew This i believe is their fourth valley location on University Drive in Tempe.They have others in Chandler,Bell road and Scottsdale.I first discovered this place on Yelp (Bell Rd,Phoenix) while craving some chaat and puffs and haven't looked back since.

I quickly moved on to the Chandler location which has been my regular place and then yesterday i decided to try Tempe because
a.it's closer to my house.
b.Chandler location did not have chicken puffs (which i'm absolutely addicted to and eat at least twice a week).

I called them to place my order to-go
~Vijayawada Biriyani (Regular chicken dum biryiani with boneless pieces of fried chicken on top) served with Raita(yogurt) and mirchi ka salan(chilli and peanut based gravy) $12.99
~Chicken Puffs (puff pastry with a savory filling of chicken) $2.99
~Dahi Puri (fried puff shells with yogurt,onion,chana and a tangy sauce) $4.99

This place is definitely smaller than their other locations and the biriyani was similar to Chandler.The puffs however were not as fresh and they mixed the yogurt and sauces in my order of Dahi puri making it soggy and almost unedible.

Generally for a to-go order of chaats they give you the sauces/yogurt separately to be mixed just before eating.Also instead of giving me the small puffs(used for pani puri) they had given me Papdi.
Anyhow i guess being a fairly new location they haven't got the hang of it yet.The girl who took my order was clueless about the Dahi puri and i had to spell it out for her.In the end,i didn't seem to mind because what they made was a mix between Dahi puri and Sev puri which are one and the same.  

PNC has also started a new rewards program where you can redeem your points for appetizers,biriyani etc (Free Food).Don't forget to Register.

Cheers!
