VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg I am reviewing the buffet and I couldn't be more thrilled. Friday - Sunday it's unlimited Naan- just sayin! We had Lamb, Chicken, Goat, and some of the best vegetarian dishes all on the buffet - which is not common - they were all sampled and everything from texture to taste was fantastic. 

Service was amazing as well, the staff and management were quick on the drink refills and the attention was well timed yet not too much (a hard balance to strike).

Come enjoy a gem in the heart of the Mccormick Ranch stretch of Scottsdale!
