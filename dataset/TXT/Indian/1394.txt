-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Traveling in the area for business and found this gem on Yelp. The reviews were accurate, little atmosphere, but excellent quality food and well prepared. Since I wasn't familiar with this style I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers. I had the Paneer Marsala that came with white rice and small sides. I didn't like the Chapatis bread, it was too plain, but just think that was a bad choice. I have other Indian breads before and just didn't remember what I had ordered. I come though this area a couple times a year and will try again when I am back next. I would bring wine or beer with me next time.
