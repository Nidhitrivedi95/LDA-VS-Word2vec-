NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ We ordered 'Mirchi Bajji' (deep fried green chillies dipped in batter) for a party.   I guess they ran out of Indian green chillies so, they added too much red chilly in the batter, dipped a beans in that batter, deep fried it and served it.   That act was unnecessary as I like many other things they serve.  The trust factor...is now lost.
