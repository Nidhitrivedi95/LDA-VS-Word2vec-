Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw I've been to Banjara several times because the food is consistently good and the price is awesome. The butter chicken and naan are definitely worth trying. Tandoori chicken is good also, very well seasoned. The service for drinks and such can be slow, which is odd because its never usually too busy when I've been there. But the waitress is very nice when she does get around. It picks up at about three so I go before that time in order to beat the crowds. I'll be going back soon!!!
