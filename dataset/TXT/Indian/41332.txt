Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ This little place has some of the best indian food I've ever had. I'm not an expert by any means so don't think I'm qualified to pronounce on such things, but I know what I like, and this was great.

The restaurant itself is tiny and we had to be squeezed into a little two seater that should have been reserved as a coat rack, but it was busy and we were hungry. The service is very friendly and I got the impression this is a family-run business from the kitchen to the waitstaff.

I'd probably eat here again out of all the places in Yorkville if I was ever in the neighbourhood again.
