5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ Indian Bowl Cuisine is a wonderful, authentic surprise in the stressful area of the Las Vegas airport. We got lots of really good food for a great price, and they gave all 8 of us free sample mango lassis. The service was exceptional and the taste amazing. Simple, quality, and a great find. 10/10 would recommend.
