UadX71pjUtIDHaR61qTx3w From the salad to the sizzling plate to the amazing dessert, this restaurant really has the best authentic indian/pakistani food available in Montreal. The staff are very professional and the restaurant is clean with lovely interior. Be it a la carte or the buffet menu in the reception hall, the quality of the food is never compromised. My husband is very picky when it comes to a perfect butter chicken but here he was extremely satisfied! The naan is so soft that we always have to keep reordering it every time we go! 

This place is ideal for parties, wedding receptions, lunch buffet with work collegues or a nice date after a long week @ work!

P.S.  We got married in the reception hall and all our guests were super impressed with the quality of the food! :) ;)
