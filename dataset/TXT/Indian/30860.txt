KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Good was pretty good and service was the same.  My only issue is that they brought my soup with my entree - so make sure to ask for soup first if desired.

Butter chicken was nicely prepared.  It came with a side of plain rice which was a nice compliment.  I also ordered some Buttered Naan.  Good as well.

The parking lot was empty as was the restaurant.  I am not sure why.  The restaurant is a solid 3 stars.
