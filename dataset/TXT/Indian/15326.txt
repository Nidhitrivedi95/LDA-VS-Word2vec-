CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ Had a terrible experience today and won't be returning. They had a fire alarm go off for about 30 minutes and did not explain what was happening to any of the customers. 

When we asked about the alarm the waiter indicated that that "they were going through it too".  To make matters worse we had a waitress who kept returning to our table every 10 minutes to clear plates we were still using. As we were leaving we wanted a dish packed up and when we requested this she said "maam I can't pack it for you but I can give you a box and you can pack it yourself." 

The food couldn't redeem the appalling service. My fiancee who used to love eating here has vowed never to go back. Way to lose a long term customer.
