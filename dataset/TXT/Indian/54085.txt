vrAZ6qenlYwHfgzSSlmkiQ The lunch buffet is decently priced, there's a good selection although it's kind of "white people" indian food. 
Aside from being slightly racist and judgmental perhaps, this description perfectly explains the food found there. 
It's a bit flavourless to cater to more people, understandably, but less spice does not have to mean no flavour. 

That being said I like it because it's not as chaotic and packed as some of the other restaurants, it's relatively well priced and when you are not sure what you want, you just know you want some indian food, it's great because you get it all. 

Bonus: there's also ice cream for desert!
