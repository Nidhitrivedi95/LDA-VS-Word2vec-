YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA The most disgusting service I have ever experienced. Honestly, the food was alright, nothing memorable. Looks nice from the outside, but that is the only nice thing I have to say about this place. I came with a friend and we were treated like dirt. Server was extremely rude. I asked politely for some extra napkins, he threw ONE on the table. We were asked if we wanted to drink "anything other than water", politely said "no" and the other bald guy with the glasses (assuming that he was the "manager") rolled his eyes and walked away. No one was getting any sort of respectable service except for two very young indian girls who the manager creepily followed around everywhere, asking them if everything was tasting good from the buffet. No one else in the restaurant was treated with any sort of dignity except for those two girls. We asked for separate bills, waited 15 minutes then asked again and ONE was brought and the server said "15.81$" each. Despite our terrible time, we still left a 15% tip, which was followed by no thank you or anything, just silence. I have been a server for a few years and if I ever treated any customers like that I would be fired ON THE SPOT. Save yourself the hassle and go across the street, there is WAY more this street has to offer than this terrible excuse for a "restaurant". You would think at a buffet that the service wouldn't even make a difference, but that honestly had the biggest impact on our meal. I have never felt so disrespected and uncomfortable dining at a restaurant, EVER. Called to complain but all I was told was "well we're usually pretty good". Gautama has mediocre food and terrible customer service.
