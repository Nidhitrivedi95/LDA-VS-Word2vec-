LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng We love this restaurant! We have come about once a month since it opened and couldn't be happier. The staff is professional and kind, the atmosphere is cozy but chic, and of course, the food is excellent. The Masala Dosa is a must, along with the saag paneer and pistachio chicken, and the samosa chaat if you're really hungry. Our servers have always been timely and kind - they go above and beyond. It definitely our go-to for date night, groups, and just a time we need some warm comfort food. Just go!
