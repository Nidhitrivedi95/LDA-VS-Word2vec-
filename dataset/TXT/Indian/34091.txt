m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Bomb.com. Lol. I loved this place! It's a very nice restaurant with a cool interior and super friendly staff! We started with the veggie platter as an appetizer and garlic naan. The veggie platter had a samosas and some other fried goodies (pakora) there are enough to share among 4 people. The garlic naan is delicious and it comes with a choice of 3 chutneys. One had tamarind, there was an onion spicy one and another had mint? Delicious! I ordered a mango lassie and I'm glad I did! It was so smooth and perfectly sweet. Also I ordered some spicy bhuna chicken chili masala. Yum yum! I would definitely come here again!
