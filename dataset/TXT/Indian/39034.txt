OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g THE Indian place in town.. brand new, modern and stylish,  amazing food at decent prices.  A must see and eat place! They even have a sports bar type of extra room. . Bring your friends and watch the games while sampling their Indian Infused delicious Tapas dishes from mild to spicey.
I had the butter chicken.. endless helpings.. absolutely fantastic. . Came with the best freshly made Nan bread I have ever had. 
Will have dessert and mango drink next time. You will love this place!
