-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Growing up, I always ate at Indian restaurants with my family, so I have a pretty good idea of what good, fresh Indian food tastes like. I am so glad that I moved right down the street from Nandini because they bring great, delicious food to the table.

I first tried this restaurant on August 28th for dinner with my boyfriend. When we were seated we got complimentary pink lemonade and some papadum to share. We ordered the Chicken tikka masala, baingan bharta, naan, and rice. Everything came out in a timely fashion and was nice and hot. The naan tasted like it had just come out of the tandoori oven. The flavors were delicious and right on target. As we finished up, we got some complimentary gulab jamun for dessert. I walked out that night one happy girl.

Finally, on September 14th I got to come back to try the lunch buffet. They had all of the classic favorites out plus a few other dishes. Expect to see chicken tikka masala, shahi paneer, palak paneer, chicken vindaloo, dal makhani, among others. You can choose either basmati rice or vegetable biryani. They also have some desserts such as gulab jamnu, rice kheer and carrot halwa. Another plus of the buffet is that they have self-serve mango lassi and give every table garlic naan! What more could you ask for, for only $6.99 a person?!? So inexpensive for such a great deal of food and drink.

I have already been there 4 times (3 times in 2 weeks) and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The owner recognizes my boyfriend and I every time we walk in the door, he is such a nice gentleman. The wait staff are also good, keeping drinks filled and always asking if we need anything. This is definitely my new favorite lunch spot! 

Recommend to any Indian cuisine connoisseur.
