upV1mQ5v0wcKUuA2AY85WQ The last time we ordered food from India Gate I wasn't happy with the quality and cost of the food at all.  I was quite disappointed and likely wouldn't go back again.  We ordered Hariyali Chicken.  The flavour was ok, however hte chicken was over cooked an it was 12 or 13 or 5 small pieces of chicken which was the equivalent of a chicken breast.  I felt that was too expensive for the portion they were offering
