H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ Friendly attentive service, but buffet choices are nothing special. Tandoori chicken dry, as in left-out-overnight-and-then-warmed dry...

--fruit custard is refreshingly and simply cool with bits of pineapple
--naan basket is fresh and just the right mix of soft and crispy, but bland
## rice wafer with potato filling not hot, and potato mix tastes of dishwasher rinse liquid
## star anise not removed from chicken biryani. Wow that's a powerful spice when tasted in the raw! FYI, I don't want to bite into a bouquet garni either!
## dental warnings should be given on donut-hole desserts... rock hard

Good value for buffet but wishing they would try a bit harder.
