RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg first thing you notice about the blue taj is, its rich ambience. a great hangout for both western and indian crowd.

well, its the first indian restaurant ive visited after coming to the united states. thoroughly impressed. ive been here so many times, mainly because of the tempting main course

i am a vegan, so i dig on naan and all the fewer vegetarian curries listed on the menu. they are all very delicious.

the disadvantage for a vegan here is , all the appetizers are bad and the blue taj does not serve biryani. there is nothng great about the desserts too.

on the whole a great restaurant for yummy indian bread and delicious gravies.
