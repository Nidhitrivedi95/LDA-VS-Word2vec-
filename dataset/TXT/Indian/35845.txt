Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg Great little place on queen street. The staff was attentive and the food was delish. If you are new or a veteran, you won't be disappointed. As an American from south Florida, the chicken tikka masala is my favorite. Here in Toronto the closest thing would be the butter chicken , but it's not quite as spicy. If you want them to bring the heat go with the lamb vindaloo. 

We met great new friends at the table behind us.  If you are in Florida and are looking for a place to live check out www.mangroverealty.com.
