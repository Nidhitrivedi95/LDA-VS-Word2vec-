RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I have been here twice now and I would go back again.  The food is great!  The chili chicken appetizer has awesome flavor and a good kick.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala both times and was not disappointed either time.  The chicken itself is tender and flavorful, but the sauce is unbelievable!

The service is somewhat interesting, and the only drawback.  The first time, I went with a female friend and was basically ignored.  She had superb service, but it was as if I wasn't even at the table.  She had to basically order for me!  I am just gonna chalk that up to my dinner guests distracting beauty.
The next time I went, I was not ignored at all, and the wait service was adequate, a little slow with the check but overall friendly and helpful.  The strange part of the second visit was the wait to be seated.  We went on a Friday and had no reservation, but I counted literally 15+ open tables that remained open the entire 20 minute wait time to be seated AND the entire time my guest and I were actually eating.  I can understand waiting and can be patient if there are no tables open, or if there are actually a lot of people coming in with reservations, but come on, 15+ tables that remained empty the entire hour and a half including WAIT TIME?

The food is worth the hassle of the service, I just hope maybe they read this and do something about the problem.  I definitely will be visiting again though.
