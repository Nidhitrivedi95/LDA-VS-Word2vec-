-CQokjildrY7UZezXCdEBw I was super torn on 4 or 5 stars for this place. We had the rajah masala (MUST TRY) and it was absolutely stellar: cold spicy marinated peanuts with homemade chips. Super duper flavorful and really unique. We also had the Asian persuasion burger - I wasn't a fan of the sesame seed bun but my boyfriend loved it - and the Indian chop suey, which was essentially noodles fried crispy-hard with sautéed veggies and it was very, very spicy but still flavorful. If this wasn't so far for us I would definitely come back to try other dishes. Honestly the only reason I'm giving them 4 stars is the location. I'm no stranger to a good dive bar but this bar is honestly just outdated and a bit boring. Wish there was a little more unique atmosphere and drinks to match the truly unique food.
