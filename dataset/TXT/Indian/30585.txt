kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw 3.5 stars overall. It seems like a small, cute little chain restaurant. We decided to grab takeout and ordered chicken pad thai and the masamang curry with tofu.

The chicken pad thai was very disappointing (not authentic at all) with a strong tomato flavor. If you don't think of the dish as pad thai, it's fine. I probably will not order this again though.

The curry portion was very decent. The flavor of the curry milk itself was very good and the zucchini in it and the tofu was very good. The rice was really dry and disappointing, but not a deal breaker. 

Overall, I would stop by again for the reasonably priced curry for a quick meal. Nothing close to authentic Thai food, but I commend them for creating a fast-food model business.
