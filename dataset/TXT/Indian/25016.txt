H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ We went for dinner here. While they took the order without much delay, it took more than 30 mins for them to serve the food although the order was only for fried rice. There was also a big scene with a bunch of families walking out due to chicken served in their vegetarian food, which made us scary. After the families walked out, when we were talking waiting for food, the chef came out, voluntarily sat down in our table and started talking about that even though we clearly showed in our face that we would rather be left alone. He finally left after we didn't speak at all. Food was only ok, have had better food at other places. Would not go back again,
