gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I've been here for dinner about three times. The food takes a while to come out because it's made fresh from scratch. I'm not Indian BUT I have eaten food in many places; Bay area, Montreal, Calgary, Vancouver, London, So Cal, Australia...and this place ranks up there with the best. Lunch buffet may not be so impressive because the menu is "predictable" for those that aren't adventurous. Don't evern THINK about going to Bollywood over this place...EVER. That place is bad.
