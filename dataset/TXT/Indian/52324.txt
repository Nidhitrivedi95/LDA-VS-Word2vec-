UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Garlic Naan - YES PLEASE 

Before you get rice, try the naan with your food first. You'll see a delicious basket of fresh glistening garlic naan and you'll regret getting full from rice. 

Tikka Masala is just amazing, so much flavors. If you go for the buffet make sure you go to the second one. There's a Vegetarian Masala and one with chicken. (the veggie one lacks flavor) this is the dish I mainly go for 

Mixed Pickles - A little sour but must have when you eat the food 

Everything at the buffet is worth trying. Keep your mind open and enjoy the food!
