I live right across the street from here and was excited to try it out but was extremely disappointed.

The waitress did not take our orders down properly and asked twice - then gave us the wrong dish in the end. And proceeds to give us attitude by saying "that's why I asked you twice". It was a table of two, we ordered two of the SAME lamb dishes, so I'm not sure how any normal server could mess this up. 
Then she goes back to the cash and starts whispering and laughing with the other waitress and never checked up on us until we asked for the bill.

Quality of food: also bad. We shared a samosa as an appetizer - and it was soggy like it was microwaved. Our main dishes seemed watered down with the curry sauce (bonus, I asked for Indian spicy and my meal was barely tangy).

Will not be returning here again and would not recommend to anyone. There's another middle eastern restaurant, Paramount, across the street with much better service and food.
