TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Always a favorite when it comes to Lunch Buffet! This time we were served by Manny and Roy. They were very attentive, polite and professional while serving the family. Thanks for keeping up your standards. The bathroom was spotless! The only thing I need to bring up is the high chair. It needs new buckle. Please send this suggestion to the management. I appreciate it.
