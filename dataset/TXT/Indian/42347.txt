Not the best kababs I've had. I'm not a fan of onions in salad/kabab rolls either. Nothing was bad and nothing was that good. If you do get the kababs then I'd recommend the chicken ones instead of beef. I did like the Afghani chicken because it had that nice smoked taste to it but if that's your thing then a Turkish/Afghan restaurant is probably better. The naans weren't bad at all and I won't comment on the curries since I don't really like those but others thought they were okay. If you wanna play it safe then stick with the "tandoori corner" part of their menu.

The prices were reasonable, you can get more than enough food in their family of 4 combo for $35. Living in MIssissauga, I won't go out of the way to go here repeatedly but if you live in Brampton/Etobicoke then this is one of the better South Asian options.
