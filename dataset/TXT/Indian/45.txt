-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Love this place! It's halal too so the meat is even better quality. I recommend the Chicken Tiki Marshalla. It's a bit over salty for my exact tastes but still great. Rice is bomb and fresh, Naan is perfect. Mango lassi a great choice. Service is so sweet and attentive. Over all love it
