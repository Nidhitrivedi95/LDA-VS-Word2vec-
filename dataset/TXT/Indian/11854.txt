AsPW2a72MNVuV8LTDDNyDQ Overall not great! Here's what we ordered. 

1. Butter chicken poutine- this was quite tasty but needed more cheese to be considered a poutine. It was more like a bowl of fries with a serving of butter chicken sauce on top.  It lacked both cheese and a good amount of chicken!  Otherwise the flavour was tasty and priced more reasonably compared to other things we tried on the menu. (3.5/5) 

2. Beef Vindaloo - basically a beef stew. The was a good portion of beef in this dish but it was tough and not rich in flavours like I would expect from an Indian dish! This is really nothing special and definitely not worth paying $20 for. (3/5)

3. Palak Paneer - I love paneer and can't help but order it whenever I eat Indian. This was however a HUGE disappointment. Especially for $20 dollars, there was hardly any paneer and what was there was tough and over cooked. The palak sauce was incredibly salty, I barely touched it and still has to drink three glasses of water. Definitely would not recommend their paneer at all!! Big upset!! (1/5) 

I also want to note that with our two mains we got one naan, cut into 4 quarters (measly serving!). Sad to say that this was probably the best tasting part of the mains and I presume they were store bought as they resembled the ones you can now get from loblaws. I  felt for the money we were paying, I'd expect more naan, paneer and less rice as a filler (although you'd probably need it with that all that salt!) 

Overall I wouldn't recommend coming here. There are way better places for Indian food in the city which will get you far more for your money (in taste and value!). 

Also to be upfront, we tried to use a Groupon and found out at the end of our meal that it couldn't be used during summerlicious. This was obviously a bummer given the quality of the meal, but also want to give everyone a heads up to read the fine print! (Boo!)
