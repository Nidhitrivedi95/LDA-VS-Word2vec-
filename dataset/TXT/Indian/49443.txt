tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA We were very excited to find a buffet for dinner, in our experience we have not found very many Indian buffets around. Indian Oven did not disappoint. The food is delicious and I was surprised to find saag, my all time favorite. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal at a very reasonable price.
