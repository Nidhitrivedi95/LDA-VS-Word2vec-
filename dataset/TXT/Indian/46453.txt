SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A The very basics: We went during dinner time. The restaurant location looks sketchy, but the service was excellent. However, the decor and atmosphere are a little lacking. Buuut, our food was great...I guess it evens out in some way. 

I don't know if it was complimentary or because it was included with our dinners, but to start, we were served PAPADUM with two kinds of chutney (mint and sweet & sour). I've never had this before, but it resembled a thin taco shell. It sort of had a fishy aftertaste, but it was pretty good with the dipping sauces! I ordered the PALAK PANEER, which is my typical favorite Indian dish - pureed spinach and cheese, whipped up with a bunch of herbs and spices. So good! It came with RICE and a sizable NAAN that I shared with my boyfriend. He ordered the CHICKEN CURRY a la carte, which didn't include the former two. He wasn't really a big fan of his dish, though - He said he's had better chicken. Our server was attentive, and one of the owners even checked up on us once. 

The portions look small, but they're very filling. Indian food is so rich, piquant, with its blend of spices. Needless to say, we had leftovers to take home with us. (My palak paneer was still good reheated, a couple days later.)
