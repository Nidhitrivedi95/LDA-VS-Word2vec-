JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ This is consistently a delicious restaurant. Yes, it is in a strange location, but this is by far one of the best places to go to if you are eating with vegetarians.

The buffet is my personal favorite option because they have SO many choices and everything is fresh. 

Take a Vegetarian here. He/She will love you forever.
