biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg I visited this place today.. I saw no pieces in the Hyderabadi Dhum Mutton Biryani.. They could have named it Just Biryani  Rice instead.. The manager over there was a lady.. When we told her about that, she was like we can't maintain a even balance between the rice and the pieces.. Lol.. Then why do u maintain a restaurant.. Dumb lady..it's not the way you treat you're customers..
