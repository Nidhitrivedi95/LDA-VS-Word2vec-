DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Horrendous service. Service is practically non existent. They don't ask you for any preferences, nor check on anything. The manager couldn't split the check 3 ways and made up some lame reasons about taxes for not being able to  split it. The food is alright but nothing great. The service sucks.
