jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw We enjoyed this restaurant immensely. The service and food were excellent - best Indian food we've had in a long time! We ordered the Chicken Tikki Masala, Goat Biryani, Goat Curry, all excellent & spiced to order. The Buttered Naan was noteworthy because it was fresh but not too doughy. Priced reasonably for the quality, the restaurant setting was charming & clean. The table next to us ordered the Lazeez Beef Burger, and told us that's their favorite (they frequent this restaurant). Highly recommend!
