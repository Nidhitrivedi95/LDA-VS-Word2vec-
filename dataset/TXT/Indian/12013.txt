auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Love this restaurant! I feel like the servers do a great job of reading the customers, they aren't constantly bothering your conversations but they do ensure that you have everything you need.

I've had both their lunch buffet and their dinner menu multiple times, and there are pros and cons to both. You definitely get more of a bang for your buck if you do the buffet option, however if you like your food spicy like I do, I would recommend waiting until dinner.

My faves are their samosas and the saag. Stop by if you're in the area!
