J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I recently went to Little India to try their daily lunch buffet.  I had been to the restaurant one other time a few years ago and remember liking it.  Given the low price for an all you can eat lunch buffet, you get your money's worth.  

My favorite items in the buffet were the saag paneer, the pakoras and the curry shrimp.  They have a good selection of vegetarian options. 

The food alone, it is not spectacular, but in general it is tasty and there is a lot of variety.  The service is also notable which increases the star value.  The multiple waiters that checked up on my friend and I while we were there were friendly and warm.  When my friend accidently left his hat at the place, one of the employees came running out to give it to us, much appreciated : ) ... good, cozy place worth checking out.

price: $12.95 for the lunch buffet
