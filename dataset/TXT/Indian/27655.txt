Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Holy mackerel... This place is AMAZING. It may be my new favorite in Charlotte. As someone who doesn't eat a ton of Indian food normally, I cannot get enough of it.

I've only ever ordered the chicken tikka masala because every time after I eat I can't stop thinking about delicious it was. The naan bread is fantastic--buttery and heavenly. The rice is great with some jasmine seasoning and then the sauces are phenomenal. 

The owner and all the wait staff are so attentive and welcoming. They go out of their way to make you feel at home and better understand the menu or try something new. 

I want to bring everyone I know and love here because it's so good that I want to share it.


If you like Indian food, go here... You won't be disappointed.
