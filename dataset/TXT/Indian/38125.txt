ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I had never eaten Indian food before but it was a great place to dip my toes into the complexity of the Indian cuisine. Both times I've gone was for their lunch buffet and I qualified for a discount on it for being UNLV student which was great. 
Attentive staff, lovely atmosphere, and delicious food!
