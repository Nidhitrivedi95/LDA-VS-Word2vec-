auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I recommend this place to everybody who likes to try different types of food. My husband and I went to the lunch buffet. Everything was fresh hot and delicious. The naan bread amazing. We tried a little bit of everything and loves it all. That is our number 1 spot for Indian food. Next time we will come back for dinner. The atmosphere is great. Very traditionally decorated. The service was excellent. All the servers were very prompt and polite. We got water and bread right away. 5 stars all across.
