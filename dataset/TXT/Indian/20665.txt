They have a remixes of English and Indian music which was great and reflects their take on the dishes. 

The washrooms were clean but not well-lit. The garbage was overflowing however. 

I ordered the Veggie Thali. Beautiful presentation although I asked for spicy and they put a bunch of green chillies on each of the veggie dishes. This comes with rice and 4 pieces of naan bread. The rice seemed to ruin the experience. I would have been happy had they just given me naan alone - and more than 4 prices which was NOT enough. I asked for more and they brought me HOT FRESH naan bread - so delish!! 

Your hands get pretty dirty so it would be great if they had those hand wipe alcohol swab things. 

So they don't tell you how to eat this but in case you aren't sure: start from the left and work your way to the right:
1. Chana (chickpeas)
2. Daal (lentils curry) which is to be used with the second last one being Achar (south Asian marinated pickles)
3. Paneer curry (cheese in curry) 
4. Saag Paneer (Spinach and cheese curry)
5. Next is the Raita which is used for your rice 
6. Then the achar as previously mentioned
7. The last dish is your Gulab Jamun - your dessert.

All in all, a great experience. I went around 2 or 3 on a Wednesday so it wasn't busy at all and I got decent service!
