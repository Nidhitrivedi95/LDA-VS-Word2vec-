c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Amazing kebabs this side of the world - the most authentic bihari kebabs, not greasy and touristy stuff they serve on Gerrard St. Their deserts are amazing too. Curries are ok, you really want to come here for the kebabs and tandoori chicken is good too. Friendly, decent service, dont be scared by the men with the long Muslim beards and caps :)
