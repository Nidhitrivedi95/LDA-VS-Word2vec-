oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q A nice, reasonable hakka Chinese place. As someone who's frequents Chilli Chicken House, I would have to say that Eddie's puts up a decent effort.
Went with a group of friends and ordered the chicken lollipop to start off with - not what I was expecting; it was like fried chicken - no sauce, nothing on it.
We got veggie chow mein, veggie fried rice - both excellent. Singapore chow mein - bland.
Chilli chicken, Manchurian fish and veg Manchurian - all pretty good, though the flavour profile for the chilli chicken was very boring - not spicy enough, no tang. 
You don't get the quantity for what you are paying. 
I would say its definitely worth trying out and its more probably in the top 3 or so best hakka places in Mississauga/Brampton.
