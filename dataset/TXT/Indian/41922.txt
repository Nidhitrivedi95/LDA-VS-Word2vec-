qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA I went here with friends one night looking for food, which was a mistake because their "fries with cheese" (although cheap), didn't exactly turn out to be the smothered gooey potato sticks I'd hoped they be.

Instead they were hunks of hard potato with half melted cheese bit on them. Pretty awful.

And the place was dark! It wasn't a red room at all. It was a friggin' DARK room. And the service is pretty bad too (short staffed more than anything, to be fair).

Would I go back. Yes. But I would go back only if I was thirsty, not hungry.
