gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A After having a first bad experience with Indian food many years ago, I was a little hesitant to try Indian food again.  When my family came into town, they were craving Indian food.  As driving around the neighborhood, we happen to come across Mount Everest. This was my first trip to an Indian restaurant in Vegas since living here. Upon arriving, we were greeted with quick and prompt service. All the workers there were very kind, and quickly assisted us with whatever we needed.  We tried out their lunch buffet.  My family knew what they wanted to eat, I, on the other hand, was taking my time as to not knowing what I was eating nor I didn't know half of what the dishes were.  So, I kept it plain and simple and had the chicken tendoori, basmati rice, and also tried their stew.  All was good.  My family enjoyed each dish they got and loved every meal they ate.

I came back again the second time around this time with a friend.  We actually both enjoyed our meals.  I kept it simple again, ordering the usual, the tendoori chicken with basmati rice.  My friend ordered some chicken curry dish also with rice.  We both had the plain naan and it was very good.  My friend and I would come back again to Mount Everest and perhaps try other dishes that they have to offer.
