5HAv0eKeid0MIEAr-IqYkw Please avoid this restaurant at all cost. These guys are a big ripoff. The food is mediocre at best and its super expensive but the people are horrible. When we went in we wanted to order one entree but the waiter told us that we wont be served until we order two entrees which was extremely weird. But it didn't stop there. At the time of payment, the waiter stood on top of me and told me that by law everyone needs to pay 15% tip. When I inquired more he started beating about the bush but still kept on intimidating. Please save your self a trip AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!
