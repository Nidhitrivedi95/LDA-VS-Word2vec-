ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA I really enjoy the lunch buffet. There is a nice selection of food i can not pronounce or spell. The food has great flavor.  I tried to get pictures but they did not like that so something curry. Lunch parking is terrible and dinner time is not much better. Plan on the parking deck and walking.  Prices at lunch are fine but high at dinner compared to the portion size.
