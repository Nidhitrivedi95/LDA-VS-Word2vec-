Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag I haven't been to their other restaurants (Saffron and Curry Leaf), however, I will definitely be making more trips to Curry Leaf since it's so close to home. Anyway, all of their menus are slightly different and Turmeric is a little more adventurous as its not your traditional Indian fare.

House-cured Salmon ($12) with green pea relish, potato chaat, cress, and puffed rice. Delicious salmon paired with great Indian spices. A light start to your meal.

Aaloo Papdi Chaat ($10): Spiced potato, garbanzo, wheat crisps, cilantro, tamarind, and yogurt chutney. One of their tasty salad options; again, light and a great combination of flavors.

Lamb Rogan Josh ($16): Kashmir-style lamb curry with brown onions, ginger, fennel, and spices; served with basmati rice and roasted vegetables. This is, hands down, one of my favorite Indian dishes! Extremely flavorful! I loved eating it with the rice and naan.

Black Lentil ($8): Slow-cooked black lentils with tomato and fenugreek. Perfectly hearty with great flavor! Great side or even a main dish.

Garlic Naan ($3): I love an affinity for all breads and naan is one of my favorites. Slightly chewy, lightly crispy on the exterior from the tandoor, and garlic, flavorful!

Stuffed Naan ($5): We opted for Paneer (a type of cheese) and again, tasty. I loved using this one to eat the Lamb since the flavor of the naan was mellow.

Berries and Ginger Crumbles ($11): Mixed berry compote and ginger crumble with vanilla ice cream. Very much like a cobbler, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The compote was delicious and I loved the ginger crumbles. Fantastic dessert!

I'm not in DTLV often, however, this is a great option if you're in the area and if you want a little different take on your usual Indian food. Service was wonderful and they have a really cool rooftop bar with views of Fremont Street.
