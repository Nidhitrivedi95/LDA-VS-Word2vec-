0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ My go-to place in Mississauga! The food is always so fresh, delicious, and flavourful. There isn't a whole lot of seating, so it's best to come before or after busy times as the restaurant is quite popular. The service is always prompt, and you get so much food for what you pay for. I always have leftovers, and having it the next day only makes me crave for it even more!

My favourite dishes are: chili chicken (with gravy), chili garlic shrimp, and green beans. The sauce on the 2 meat dishes goes great with the complimentary rice. The green beans are always a staple veggie dish as I could never possibly make it with that much skill. Cant wait to be back!
