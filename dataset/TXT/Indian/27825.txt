iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w We caught the chef as she just came back from India so she wasn't serving dine-in, but she made an exception for us and let us in. Ancila is so kind and thoughtful in her cooking and can custom your dish to the meat you like and specific spice level.

We got the Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Karahi, with some garlic & butter naan and rice. The dishes feel very authentic and are cooked to perfection. The meat is incredibly tender, juicy and works well with the sauce. You can call the chef ahead so she can take the time to prepare your custom dish. It feels very homey and how an Indian mom would make it!

I would highly recommend this place and it's well worth the drive from the city of your don't live in Mississauga! Ancila also does large party catering and take out, which can be all ordered ahead.
