VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg Food was okay, but I was quite disappointed to see that they gave something else than what we ordered. I am pretty sure they understand the meaning of biryani, I hope at least they will soon. We ordered 3 different biryanis but none of them tasted like a biryani but they were like pulav ( which is a total different dish). 
Please change the names in your menu or I would appreciate if you can get to know what exactly biryani means and make it. 
And forgot to mention about the appetizers not really good, you better don't ask them what they do best. 
Finally if you're looking for nice and authentic Indian food or biryani, I don't recommend this place.
