U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw We have been looking for a Indian restaurant and this Is one is our favorite hands down! It's a small, very cute little restuarant with delicious food. I had the Chicken Korma and it was amazing! The cilantro gave it an excellent flavor. My mother in law ordered  the grilled talapia and that was also excellent. It was crunchy on the outside, but incredibly tender on the inside. The owner was very accommodating and very nice throughout the evening. Excellent service! This is now our go to spot for Indian food!
