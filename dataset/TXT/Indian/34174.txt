md76WC4GX1y1MthgihPVjA Amazing!! We went here last night for dinner because I was craving butter chicken and some yummy naan. I told myself that I wouldn't get all-you-can-eat because it can get expensive. 

Anyway - we walked in to an almost empty restaurant (except 3 tables). The place was pretty big and the server asked us if we wanted to do buffet or menu. I said menu to look at the prices (most main courses are about $12.99. Then I moseyed around to the buffet to see what's on the table. I was blown away - usual items such as tandoori chicken, butter chicken, dal makhani, chickenpea curry, snacks like pakoras, etc. 

Then, the unusual - lamb curry, goat curry!! I couldn't believe it and then we said we wanted to do the buffet instead. It was only $14.99pp. Anyway - in the end, I can definitely say that it was totally worth it. Everything was great. They brought out fresh naan for us and refilled water frequently. I ate so much and everything was great. I really like the paneer makhani too! The paneer (cottage cheese) was soft and yummy - so good. 

I highly recommend and it's a great place for a large party too. I'm surprised it doesn't have any reviews! (WOO - first review!)
