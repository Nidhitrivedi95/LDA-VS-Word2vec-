tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA We went for Valentines day and they were very busy, and trying to make sure everyone was happy. For a very busy night, service was pretty good. The food is what matters most, and it was good too (we had the buffet). The best was the Chicken Tikki Masala and Lamb Vindaloo, in addition to the Pakoras. There was some other chicken dish that was good but I forget the name, I hadn't heard of it before. It was in more of a broth vs. a creamy sauce. There were some vegetarian options but not tons. Samosas and naan weren't the best I've had, but not bad. I'd like to go again.
