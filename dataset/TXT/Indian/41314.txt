Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ I love Utsav. Well-spiced food. What more could I want? Their butter chicken is flavourful. It tastes great and they are able to do a sweet and spicy version. mmm! The veggie pakoras are yummy. Love the garlic naan. Bland dishes don't exist here. They keep our usual order on file so it's quick & easy.

They have only ever let me down once. I headed there with some colleagues for lunch. When we asked for some takeaway containers the waitress brought dirty containers. It looked as though someone had spilled some food on the lids. Sigh. Sooo embarrassing. If the food wasn't so yummy that would have been it for me, but yummmm so good!
