F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw We were there on a Saturday night with a group of 14 people. We made reservations. I was surprised at how quickly everything came out!!! Really awesome service even though the restaurant itself was super busy. Our waiter/waitress were really attentive and picked away plates quickly as well between the appetizers and the main course. Really delicious food! We ordered 3 rice dishes, 4 types of chicken, and 3 soups. My favorite chicken was the chili chicken. Overall very impressed with the service and food. We're still wishing we could have this the next day. Wish we had something like this down in Maryland!!
