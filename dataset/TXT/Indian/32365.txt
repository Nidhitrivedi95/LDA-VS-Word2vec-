LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw I really like this place. I have gone there several times and the food on the restaurant side of the store is always fresh and good. The last time there I had the hummus (best in the burg) and spinach pie. Also had the chick pea salad , yummm! In the past I have had the chicken kabab, and kind of a chickpea stew served over rice. It is done steam table style so you can look over the food before you buy so you can try different things. Try the goat meat it's really good. The decor is like a cafeteria, so fancy it's not. The prices aren't fancy either. Two can eat for about $20, including a piece of baklava for dessert..
If just rating the food I would give it 5 stars
