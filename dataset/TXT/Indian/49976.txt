u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw I have never had African food before, so I was interested in checking this place out for the first time. It is primarily a takeout or catering service, but there are two small tables you can sit at to eat. No real plates or cutlery, but the paper boats and plastic cutlery do an adequate job. The cashier/waiter/runner/receptionist was extremely helpful, explaining the different options and even recommending how to switch up our order to get a more diverse experience. We settled on splitting a snack pack and the 1lb of chicken mishkaki between two people.

The snack pack came with samosas, mogos, and kebabs. I am officially a fan of their samosas!! Much better than the ones I've tasted in the past because they didn't use any potatoes as filler. Their vegetables samosas are only stuffed with chunks of sauteed veggies, while their beef ones are stuffed full of meat. The chicken mishkaki was uniquely seasoned, char marked on the outside but tender and moist inside. Each large chunk of meat carried a very smokey flavor that made it extra delicious. Also, there were also three different types of chutneys for us to mix and match with different bites. A great place to be informally introduced to a new cuisine!
