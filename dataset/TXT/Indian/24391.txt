h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ I guess it was a good thing that it was rather cold and rainy when I came here for a little buffet lunch UYE with Rand H, Mike C and Arlin B.  I enjoyed the food but be aware that heat level of the most of the food was medium to medium hot - which I like, but might be a bit daunting for some people. I particularly enjoyed the chicken curry, the egg masala and the lentil dish, and found the other dishes to be quite good. The server was very attentive, and the crispy dosas she brought to our table was a nice addition to our meal. At about 10 bucks, the price of the lunch buffet is about the same as most other Indian buffets in the city, but the spacious, sparkly clean setting brings this place a tad above the rest for me.
