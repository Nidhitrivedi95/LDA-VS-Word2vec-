But I believe that's what went wrong here, They take over previous mgmt but didn't update Yelp business name
The new owner is under Punjab and I happen to be there as we were looking for Indian food in this area
Buffett was good, Food was delicious but server was very reactive and had worse reactions for any questions / feedback

I might try again if I happen to be around but not a must place to go
