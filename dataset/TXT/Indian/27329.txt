ikUSTcW7AL4nKsBjx5co0w Love this place! The decor is inviting and elegant, and the service is friendly, attentive, and quick. The dishes were flavourful, not at all overwhelming, with just the right amount of spice. The food was fresh and steaming and ready to be devoured! The host made sure my daughter, who has a nut allergy, was well taken care of and accommodated. The fried bananas are absolutely amazing and the lemongrass ice cream is out of this world, a must have! We will definitely become regulars!
