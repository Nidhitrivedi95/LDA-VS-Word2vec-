ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Sad in Charlotte... Copper restaurant Chlt nc. ..So I go to the hospital to give blood, can't get out till 2. I look on google maps.. Indian cuisine..yum open till 2:30.  I haven't had any Indian food for a year...seriously don't live near any restaurants.  Really looking forward to this. Would be hard to disappoint me right.....I get there 2:45. Yes made it. Walk in door.  We are closed. I said its 2:25. Yes but we are closed. I said google n ur sign say 2:30. No our chef leaves at 2:15. So I say.. Really the owner put 2:30 on google and the door n ur chef walks out at 2:15.  He says well I can give you something to go. Ok... What choice do I hv... Do u have buriani?  No. Really?  Yep. Ok what do u hv... Lunch specials. Ok tikka masala - I've never had it, but this is a 4 star Rstrnt I'm sure I'll like. Ok I'll have lamb.  Ok. So I stand n wait at the front door till the bar tender has mercy on me n seats me at the bar... Not a table... Mind u there are 3 tables still eating in the restaurant.  Drink? I'll hv water to go evidently.  Ok bartender says.  Here comes matre de again .. No lamb. Really? Is this place Indian?  Ok I'll hv chicken.  Here come the bag. U need a plate... Yes n napkins etc. Ok. All in bag I pay n leave. Mind u all 3 tables still sitting in restaurant. I get to the car to hopefully enjoy my no lamb no biriani food... Napkins on top of bag are bathroom napkins. Fork knife salt pepper pkg has old splattered food (not wet-dried on).  Ok I'll get my extra fork out of the glove box... I break open flat bread pkg.  Cooked on 1 side other side doughy  tastes sweet.    Soup with bits of bread is great - is like a tomato soup on steroids. Yum. Ok. I drink that cause I don't hv a clean spoon.  Basmati rice yummy has little seeds in it.. I'm sure u foodies know what .. Very good. Ok looking up...  Tikka, open it up pour on some rice.  1 couple leaves restaurant. 2 tables still left inside. Taste. Eh where is the medium high heat?  Is creamy but not very flavorful .   I cut into chicken, having t hold the Togo plate so it all doesn't spill n it is that opaque white, almost punk but not, chicken color .   Can't eat my tikka till I get hm t warm it up. They had a rating of 94... I guess I will just hv t throw it away.  Still no Indian cuisine ... 1 yr n counting.   Sad in Charlotte.
