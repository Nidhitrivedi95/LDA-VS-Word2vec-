cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg Eh? Yelp?

Unless the dinner here is amazing (and based on the lunch/left-overs, I don't entirely feel it would be), I don't know why it's a 4-star rating. I came here for lunch buffet, and it was a solid 3-star that might get 2 stars from customers picky on service.

Was the food bad? No. It was Indian food done decently. But if you've ever been to Trimurti or Little Indian on Queen West, you will know what a $12 lunch buffet can buy you in terms of quality and service. And this did not rank especially high for either.

I might come back if I'm starving in the area and want cheap, decent Indian food. But only because Queen West is a challenging walk on an empty stomach.
