iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I'm not an Indian food expert but I love it, and marigold has the best Indian dish ive ever had (mutter paneer). 

That being said, everything I've ever had from here is incredible.

When I have company that is not particularly cultured, this is a great place/food to impress them with and to open them up to new foods in a non threatening manner. 

Seriously, incredible food.
