Overall, the place is pretty okay. The service is attentive. Someone came by to offer naan and refill water constantly, we never had to flag them down. There were a lot of food options, which is definitely a plus. Several meat (chicken, fish, goat) and vegetarian dishes, a decent salad bar, fruits, dessert, and ice cream. The price is more than reasonable for the selections available. My points are a bit low just because I didn't think the food was that great. The taste was okay, but it wasn't very flavourful -- mostly it was just very salty.
