GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA My boyfriend and I have eaten here twice and have loved it both times. I got the punjabi lamb handi and omg its amazing. The meat is so incredibly tender it just falls apart. The people were also really friendly and helpful. We never had Indian food before and our server made excellent suggestions and was very knowledgeable about the menu. We both loved the food and the service was good. The prices are very reasonable and our food came out pretty fast. We plan on bringing friends here and im pretty sure we are going to be regulars.
