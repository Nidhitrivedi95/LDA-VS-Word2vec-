DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I went for afternoon buffet. This time it was somewhat average kind of experience. I truly enjoyed the exotic Sambhar,Pongal, Medu vadas, Idli and Dosa. Mint chutney and raita were too sour. Plus I didn't like the idea of ice cubes in chutney. It did not give me the best possible experience. Also the dosas were not crisp enough.
