WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA I've been craving a chicken roti.  There was a long line-up where I usually go so I headed to Bacchus Roti Shop today for lunch.

I ordered a chicken roti and a Diet Coke.  It was just okay.  The chunks of chicken were tender and tasty.  It seemed like the potatoes were mashed rather than chunky.  Overall I wasn't crazy about this style of roti.

Dick Bacchus, the owner, was taking the orders and serving the food.  It would have been nice if he had been friendly ... he wasn't welcoming at all.
