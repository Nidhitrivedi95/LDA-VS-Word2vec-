0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg My girlfriend (a vegetarian) and I eat out in Charlotte several times a month. We keep a list of delicious restuarants with acceptable service. This restaurant is DEFINITELY going on our good list! 

It's a casual, order at the counter / bus your own table kinda place but you get real dishes and silverware. Decor is cute and welcoming.  Also, we were greeted and sat like it was a much more formal place.  The food is OUTSTANDING.  I had chicken Tikka Masala and she had the paneer. I had the garlic Naan -- DELISH.

It's funny because we stumbled on the place by accident because we left an Italian place not far away that seemed expensive and boring. We actually spent more for lunch than we would've there (around $15) but didn't resent one dime. 

It's hidden next to bi lo behind Starbucks. I definitely recommend this place for a laid back delicious lunch!!
