A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ My wife and I wanted to have Indian since a long time. After much googling and reviews on Yelp, our cravings finally brought us to Desi Spice. I would only hope my review would add to the many accolades Desi spice has recieved, because the food was delumptious. They had an extensive menu which is a Happy news for your yummy tummy. The ladies in black were awesome and very friendly. Overall experience was great with good pricing too. Would definitely recommend to all Indian cuisine lovers.
