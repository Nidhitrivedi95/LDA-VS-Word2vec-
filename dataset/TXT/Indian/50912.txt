UmcOChw3fm-GgbpK2o_t5w 10 of us went for a meal a couple of weeks ago, wasn't sure what to expect as hadn't been beforebut was pleasantly surprised. It was a saturday night and the place was full, there were people also waiting to collect take aways. We all had a starter and a main and several drinks (some had more than others lol) We were there for approximately 3 hourswe weren't rushed along like in some places. After the meal we each got a complimentary drink. We worked the food out to be £15 each which for what we had was brilliant..it was gorgeous, if a little slow to come out..but it was worth the wait though! The staff were very pleasant and the hot towels and minty chocolates after were very welcome indeed. A really pleasant experience and will definately be returning. I did hear the toliets were a little scary? but as I didn't venture downstairs myself I can't really comment.
