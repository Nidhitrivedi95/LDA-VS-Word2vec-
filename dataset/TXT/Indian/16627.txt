DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg the lunch buffet is the way to go. it is all vegetarian, and there are numerous vegan options. for 12 bucks, it's 7 hours later and we are still full. 

be careful about piling the rice high...you will get full quick! go easy on the rice and instead, load up on all the other curries and things. each item (i had seconds of everything) tastes amazing. nothing is too spicy hot, but there area  few items that require a sip or two of ice water. the sauces at the start of the buffet are a cool way to get a variety of tastes for chutney. there are even some delectable desserts (rice pudding, chai tea, pistachio ice cream) so save room for that as well. 

service is friendly and prompt. 

always a favorite.
