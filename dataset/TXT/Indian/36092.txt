NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw Very slow service, expensive for the small amount of food you receive and the older woman serving is just the most miserable and unaccommodating  person you will meet in a supposedly "fine" dining restaurant.
The place is so small you could hardly swing a cat in the place, I would not advise any person from out of the area to make a special visit to dine here it would be a wasted journey and a waste of your hard earned money. Just go to Any restaurant on Gerrard it will be a lot more enjoyable and you'll actually receive decent portions with decent food. Oh and one last thing check your bill carefully before you leave you wouldn't want to be hammered with the infamous discreet 20% service fee  and add a tip on top of it.
