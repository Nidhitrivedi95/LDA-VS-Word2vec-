3quopZyL8WuqVFfsCi0z2A Went on a quiet Sunday afternoon and the experience was v nice. We had Tandoori Mixed Grill, Chicken kadhai, they were all flavorful. Their mint green chutney was v fresh n added to the overall taste. Naan was nicely buttered n soft. However the lachcha paratha was bit more crispier to my liking, cud have been less baked. 
Overall good meal in Scarborough. They say they are busy on weekends evening, hoping the qualilty of food and service are as good.
