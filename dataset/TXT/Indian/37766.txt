Oh_mShbdmaoRX8iZVdE0vw My boyfriend and I decided to try out Persian king. We were drawn to it through their Groupon and made the trip from Tempe to Paradise Valley. It's a nice place with a lot of potential. The room is spacious and the decor is not so bad. 
The food was disappointing. We ordered tadigh with ghormeh sabzi. The waitress told me that there might not be any which I found weird because most places make rice daily and usually have an abundance of tadigh left over. After a few minutes we received the tadigh which was soft. Tadigh is supposed to be hard and the stew is supposed to make it softer. This was not the case since the stew wasn't even on it yet. The ghormeh sabzi was over seasoned and had two different types of beans. Usually it's either one or the other, but even so it was not terrible. 
Next we got the kabobs. My boyfriend ordered a chicken barg which looked more like joojoo kabob and I ordered koobideh. The koobideh was under seasoned to say to least. My boyfriend said the chicken kabob was good though. 
The service was decent. They checked on us a few times and made sure we were okay. Granted there were only 2 tables including us, but none the less attentive. 
I probably will not be going back. I'd rather go a few miles up the road to Persian room in Scottsdale, but it is a bit more pricey.
