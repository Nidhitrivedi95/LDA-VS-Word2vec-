TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw I love this place. After some convincing by my boyfriend to eat @ Namaste instead of Lotus of Siam (Thai food next door). I was way more impressed by the service here and very shocked that we were the only two people eating in the restaurant. After seeing the effort and passion of the owner/chef/and even entertainer to go above and beyond to give us great service, I'd soooo rather eat here than next door in a crowded restaurant where we wait 10 minutes for our drinks. The food was sooo good and I'm not even that ecstatic about Indian food. You should all try Namaste.
