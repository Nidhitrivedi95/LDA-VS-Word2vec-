o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw Delicious food! Hands down the best Indian food we've had in Phoenix. Go try it! We tried a variety of appetizers- samosas, paneer pakora, and pani puri- and all were delightful. The main dishes we tried were the  goan fish, coconut curry shrimp, and hakka noodles. Everything was amazing, but we especially loved the fish. Excellent naan too. They were also happy to make things less spicy so that our small kiddos could try everything too. We will definitely be back!
