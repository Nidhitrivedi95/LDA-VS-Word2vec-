DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ No matter what day of the week, or what time of the day you come in to eat, you get the best, highest quality, and least expensive Indian food in the GTA. 

I've been coming here for years, and their food is consistently delicious every time.  Their butter chicken is one of the best and creamiest I've had, and I travel the world and I can tell you this one is to die for. They have samosas that are mouth watering, and will even sell you frozen ones for you to bring home at a very reasonable price. 

After being established in Malton for the last 30 ish years, they are renovating their establishment to accommodate more people and be more technologically advanced.  

The owner has become a good friend over the last 6 years of me coming here, and there is not another place that I would ever recommend more than here.

Sweet India represents Indian food at its best.
