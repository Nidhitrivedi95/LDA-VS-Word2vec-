OOBSQF72cl3jBBpLQWhyzw Finally went here for lunch after hearing about it for months. The waiters were the most cordial I had ever seen. It wasn't crowded when we walked in but go fairly busy as we were sitting down. We ordered the chicken biryani and the mutton sukku dish. I expected the chicken biryani to blow my mind,  as it was recommended to me by countless people. It was good, but I can't say it was the best I've ever had. The mutton dish on the other hand...amazing!!! 

You can tell that all of the ingredients that they use are of high quality (they specify that their chicken is organic), and they put the utmost care into food preparation, which I find rare in South Asian restaurants in the suburbs. I really value that. I want to go back and try the poutine :).
