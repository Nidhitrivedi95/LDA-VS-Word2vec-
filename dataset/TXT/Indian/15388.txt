ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ I am not Indian so it is really hard for me to compare for other very good Indian restaurants on mom's cooking.. but their food was very reasonable. We enjoyed the chicken and the kofta (i think this is how you call it). the nan and the rice were also ok. overall a reasonable restaurant, nothing fancy, not to expensive. an OK experience if you are around and you want some Indian food. 

PS: it does take them a bit too long to cook and serve the food and the restaurant werent full when we got there, so consider it if you are in a rush
