tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg I eat anything, I eat anything that are spicy and I eat where there's Lunch Specials. 

Pak Centre Halal Restaurant has lunch Special Thali for $6.99. I don't even care what in that lunch Thali.. I just walked in and say lunch specials...and just sat down and waiting to be feed! 

I was surprise how clean and nicely decorated Pak Centre is. My Yelp friend was nice to me, didn't send me to some seedy runned down places that have sticky floors... 

The nice waitress warned me that the green sauce is really spicy..the next thing she saw me was I was draining my rice with that.. and smiling at her.. 

Naan bread was freshly made.. a little doughy but nice and soft... 

Chicken pea, Potato and Beef all hot and tasty. I though not too crazy about the dessert that comes with it.. 

For $6.99, you can get a complete meal from Pak Centre: Carbs (naan and rice), Veggie (Salad) , protein and even sugary sweets! 

The waitress here was so nice, kept asking me if I want more of any of the items on my plate... gee, I can barely finish those! And I suppose to be on a diet...?
