cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w I've been to this restaurant multiple times and it's our go too restaurant , every dish is delicious the decor is warm and inviting the service is excellent my favourite dishes are the cauliflower and the eggplant fries for appetizer and for main the butter chicken ,the qorma, the chicken tikka masala which is mouth watering as well as the lamb chops . I've tried almost every dish there and it's just delicious  and I also recommend the delicious bread that comes with your meal and after all that delicious food  you have amazing desserts to choose from (highly recommended)everyone I see I tell them to check it out and it's becomes there go too as well I've always had the best experience and I can't wait to go back
