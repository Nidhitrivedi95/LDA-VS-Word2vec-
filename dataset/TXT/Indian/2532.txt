02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Not a bad place, great service.. Went for the lunch buffet, They can use a little more selection, tikka masala was good chicken was tender, couple vegetarian dishes, chicken kabob was dry. Naan is fresh made to order, I personally like the garlic naan. One good thing is that the buffet is open till 430pm..
