Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I'm obsessed. I love this place. So many vegetarian options. The portions are pretty big, and if I wasn't such a glutton for this place it probably would last me two meals. The naan is sensational- we particularly like the garlic naan.  Don't pass up the samosas so delicious!  

This place is also a great takeout option.
