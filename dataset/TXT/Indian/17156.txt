DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew First of all, I understand that there were just a few bad reviews.... IGNORE THAT!  I've been to quite a few Indian Restaurants and this place is definitely in my top 3 if not first!  (taste wise) 

The FOOD was DELICIOUS!!  This is what we ordered...
*Malai Kofta
*Baingan Bharta
*Gobi Manchurian 
*Garlic Naan
*Plain Rice

Everything we ordered and portion wise was just PERFECT.  This was actually an order for just two people, with a little bit of left overs.  My boyfriend wanted to stand up and applaud every time he took a Gobi bite.

Regarding the SERVICE...
Our waiter Elmer was OUTSTANDING!  We asked questions about the menu and he was very knowledgeable and attentive while taking our order.  Sometimes waiters make you feel rushed but Elmer was on point!  I know service can throw a review off but don't get it twisted... the food was amazing!!  We all know service can be a crap shoot sometimes but if you're willing to gamble in exchange for good food... COME HERE!
