OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This is our first time trying Urban turban. We had the lunch buffet. Slightly different flavor profile than every other place I've tried. Still very good though. Everything tasted super fresh for a buffet. Our server was really friendly. Really personable. She answered our random questions. There's jazz music playing. Kinda odd. Decent atmosphere. I'd come back and try dinner. We're local and just don't come near the strip area often. This place was pretty easy to get in and out of though. Far enough away from it where is not crazy busy.
