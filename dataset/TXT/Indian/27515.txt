Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Definitely my favorite Indian restaurant. It's very clean, the wait staff is always helpful and professional, and Bhim, the chef, regularly comes out to talk to customers--we even talked about moving to Matthews and he gave us real estate advice!! If you try any Indian place in the Charlotte area, try Tamarind.
