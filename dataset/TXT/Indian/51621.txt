UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This is the best place in vegas! We love the food, the staff, and the lunch buffet. We eat the lunch buffet on a regular basis and love getting to enjoy a good meal and talk with the staff. We go all the time... curry addicts! 

Great options for all kind of diets and special needs. Vegan, vegetarian, meat lovers, etc.
