grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg This place is great! I've been getting food here for so many years. Food has always been great. The staff is good at letting you know what's in the food. The portions are good for the price, quality is on point. There can be a line up because lots of people know of this gem but it's worth the little line up. 110% worth it. If you like Indian food & are in the east end you have to check this place out.
