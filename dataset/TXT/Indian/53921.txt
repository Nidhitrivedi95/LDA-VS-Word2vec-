VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ The food is pretty good, but the atmosphere isn't my favorite. I love the tikka masala, vindaloo, cauliflower and curry dishes. The buffet is great because they let you buy takeout boxes! I don't like how they charge $8 for sauce only though. I like to order tikka masala sauce, but it's just not worth it because I'd have to pay for rice too.
