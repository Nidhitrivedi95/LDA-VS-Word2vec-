pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Delicious food at moderate prices.  I don't go to Taj Mahal often enough.  I took my mom to Taj Mahal to warm up on a cold evening.  We had a delicious dinner of Lamb Vindaloo and Chicken Tiki Masala.  The naan was delicious and well made.  The portions were very generous, and while the service was somewhat awkward, they were very nice.  They ask how spicy you prefer your food (important with older moms in tow), and it was prepared perfectly.  It was obvious that the staff knew several of the repeat customers.  Honestly, this is the best Indian food in Pittsburgh.  I need to remember this when I can't decide where to eat!
