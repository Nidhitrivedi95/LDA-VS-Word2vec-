CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ Nice place a step or two past the last restaurant I reviewed. They actually serve a fair smoubt if food for the money.  Its nice and spicy but not overly done. My biggest question is does Indians actually own this place? I have eaten this food all my life but some of the dishes I have never heard of or in some cases have a hard time identifying. It's not just me, I have been here twice and even some of the indians have questions.  Anytime you need to explain your menu to everyone, you might want to rethink it. The reason I didn't rate it higher was the blaring hip-hop playing. Now I listen to my fair share of music but it has its place. This restaurant is not it. Save for the club and concentrate on educating your customers on the ridiculous menu board.
