We ordered several dishes and just shared it among ourselves. From what I remember, we had two dinner servings of biryani, chicken vindaloo, tiki masala, and plenty of naan bread. All dishes had plenty of spices and with all four of us, there were still some more food leftover. The portions were very generous and I could not have asked for anything more. 

If you're looking for really good Indian food, come to this local spot. Make sure you also try their Mango Lassi, it's the best!
