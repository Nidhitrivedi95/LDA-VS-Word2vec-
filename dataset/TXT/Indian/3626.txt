0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Really great food. Portion size and quality for price was very fair. I had the chili chicken dinner special, dry with hakka noodles which were so delicious and a spring roll. We didn't have to wait too long for the food. You could tell it was fresh. The chicken was spicy but not unbearable.. If you want more spice you have two sauces they give you to add but unless you like your mouth on fire I wouldn't recommend them. I'm only taking off one star because it was my first visit and I only had the one dish but will amend my review once I try a couple other dishes and can see the food quality is consistent.
