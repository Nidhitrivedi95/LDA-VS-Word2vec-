DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA Our friends heard about this place, and told me and my husband about it; the four of us decided to try it out-we all love Indian food, spicy stuff, and trying new restaurants.  It was incredibly delicious, all of it....we split several appetizers and entrees.  I ordered the chicken tikka, tandoori style; my husband got some kind of lamb meat, and our friends got Boti kebab.  All of the meat was just perfect-tender, flavorful, spicy.  One of the apps we shared was cauliflower cooked in spices and sauce (gobi)-I was skeptical, not being a veggie type of gal, but it was delicious.  I mean really, really fantastic.  Our server, Kenya, was helpful and patient, and did a great job.  My only critique would be that the establishment is very dark, with an empty stage and no music for ambience; if they had some nice Indian music playing, or perhaps a performer on the stage with a sitar or hand drum, it would be a perfect setting.  But for the quality of the food and the great service, I highly recommend King of Spicy.
