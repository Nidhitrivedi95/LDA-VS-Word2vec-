RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg I've been here for the buffet twice now and it is a perfectly decent buffet.  The buffet dishes are definitely as mild as Indian food can come, and next time I am going to ask for a little dish of chili oil or some other spice to punch it up.  That said, the naan is delicious and plentiful, the servers nice, and the buffet variety good (multiple chicken and vegetarian dishes both times, no lamb), so if you are in the mood for Indian buffet, this is a solid choice.
