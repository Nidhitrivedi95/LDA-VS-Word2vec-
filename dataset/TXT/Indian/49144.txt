tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I have always driven past here and heard of how good it is. Boy were they right. The Chicken Tika Masala was my favorite with rice and all wrapped in a piece of the unlimited supply of garlic naan. There is a type of mango drink that reminds me of naked juice more than anything else, it is fantastic. The desserts leave something to be desired, which is the only reason im not giving a 5 star. The syrup bread balls are a little soggy, but the mango pudding was my favorite of the desserts.
