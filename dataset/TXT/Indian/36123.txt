NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw I really like this restaurant.
It's cozy and intimate ... a good date restaurant. It's not a great choice for a larger party as the restaurant is very small. There's maybe 10 tables (in the summer, they have a few tables on the front patio).
It's a simple layout - you can see the chef cooking away in the kitchen at the back of the restaurant.
I feel bad though, it's usually empty - which certainly doesn't reflect the food quality, which is simply delicious and fresh.
It's one of the best Indian meals I've had in the City. We ordered all the favourites - Chana Masala, Beef Tikka, Nan, Butter Chicken. Everything was spectacular. I was really impressed with the rich flavours.
It was a bit on the pricey side - but I find Indian food restaurants, generally speaking, all have this flaw.
The one female server was very sweet and accommodating.
I would definitely eat here again.
