PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ I'm going to start out by admitting that I was scared to death to try this type of food. I'm a very picky eater and ambiance helps me feel comfortable. This place has zero ambiance to speak of. None. Zero.

You walk in and there is a tiny room that maybe seats 6 people, they take you behind a door to a larger dining room that is cramped but jam packed. If the place is jam packed its a good sign to me.

The waiter noticed our hesitation (we were 8 girls, first time for 7 of us) and he basically gave us what I call a "white girl sampler". He asked what our preference was for meat and how much spice we could handle and then brought an assortment of dishes and sauces to the table.

Everything was DELICIOUS. The spices wren't too over powering the flavors were all very good and the service was great. We had a funny waiter who loved to interact and talk with us. 

My only issue was I had googled Indian food prior to going to get an idea of the menu and their somaos were very different than any I had seen online. It was still delicious but I hadn't seen others smothered in sauce.... (and don't tell anyone but I wanted that sauce on EVERYTHING!) 

I would go back again but in a few months. I don't think I can handle too much of that food too often. 

Oh and its bring your own wine which is great. Google told me Pinot Gris goes great with Indian food and I can't lie, it went down smooth!
