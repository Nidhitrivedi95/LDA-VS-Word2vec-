llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g India Palace has an authentic atmosphere that never feels too loud or cramped. The food is fantastic, portion appropriate and deliciousness renditions of all types of cuisine from India. Though it is a simple gesture, I absolutely love getting complimentary papadom and sauces with every meal, and then their rice is amazing (I don't even like rice) with a refreshing touch of cumin. 

The staff and hostess are always incredibly friendly and personable.
