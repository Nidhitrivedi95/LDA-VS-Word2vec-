I've ordered a large number of both the Greek and Indian dishes.  Some dishes are good and some dishes are very good.  I most recently had the roasted kasseri chicken entree.  The sauce was great and the two large pieces of chicken were well cooked.  Overall the dish was very rich.  The Indian food is tasty - not my favorite Indian food, but good.  I've eaten the butter chicken, pakoras, and samosas and have left satisfied.   You can order the Indian entrees here on a 1-7 spice scale.  The chutney has a reasonable amount of spice and a level 6 entree is actually spicy.  I had some of the baklava ice cream for dessert and thought that the baklava could have been a little better.  

Portion sizes here are generous.  The waiter seemed fairly new, but he was very friendly and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.
