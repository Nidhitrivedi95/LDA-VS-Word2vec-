A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA We came to Udupi Palace for a ladies' brunch and I couldn't be more impressed.  I love Indian food in all its forms but I realized that I had never tried a dosa before.  This was also a good opportunity for me to be schooled by my friend in the differences of North and South Indian food.

We were seated right away and I noticed that the decor was very minimal.  It reminded me a lot of the langar hall in a gurdwara at a Sikh temple I visited last year which could only mean comfort and good food to come.

We started our meal with the sev poori chaat ($4.95) and steaming hot mugs of chai ($2.45).  I would have been happy to eat just chaat as my meal.  Each bite was crispy, salty, sweet and savoury all at once.

Next, an appetizer order of the chilli paneer ($5.25).  It was okay, albeit on the small side.  And then the mains - I ordered the Udupi Special ($9.95) which came with my choice of dosa and some extra sides (sambar, vada and idli).  I chose the Onion Masala Dosa.  We also ordered the Paneer Masala Dosa ($8.55), Vegetable Uthapam ($6.65) and the Rava Masala Dosa ($8.55).

Once the food arrived, it was a non-stop feeding frenzy as we sampled each dish.  I was not disappointed with anything and couldn't stop scooping the coconut chutney directly into my mouth.  Portion sizes were pretty huge and we left completely stuffed and happy.

Service was efficient and adequate, even as the busy room filled with hungry diners.

Udupi Palace is heaven for vegetarians and I also recommend it as a change of pace for carnivores and butter chicken/tandoori chicken lovers.  Very thankful to find this place and will return with friends who live in the East end.
