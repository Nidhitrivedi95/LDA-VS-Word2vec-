H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ My new fave Indian place in my 10-mile radius!  Anyone who remembers the fried cauliflower from the long-gone Taj Mahal may be happy to know it exists at Karaikudi.  It's actually not on the menu, but when we tried to order another cauliflower dish, we were told of the "Chef's Choice" appetizer.  Our eyes lit up as if we had just seen freakin' Santa Claus when the dish arrived and it was fried cauliflower in a spicy chile sauce.  The paneer pakora tasted bland in comparison.

Dosa, which is nothing more than a big crepe, was new to me.  The masala dosa is a meal in itself.  Maybe it's meant to be.  I've only ordered chicken dishes from the menu, Makhani and Khorma and both were flavorful and most importantly, devoid of all non-edible, non-discernable chicken parts.  The medium spice level does seem to really be "medium," but even my husband's "hot" lamb vindaloo was tolerable.

The only time we ordered the buffet was Mother's Day, and that was all that was offered.  It had quite a large selection including lamb chops.  Not sure how much variety is on the standard buffet, but I would like to try it sometime.

And not to be forgotten, the garlic naan was toasty and garlicky.  What else can I say?  I'm a fan.
