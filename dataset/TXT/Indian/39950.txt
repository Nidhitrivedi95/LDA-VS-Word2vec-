pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw i cut hair for a living and my clientele is 50 percent Indian. I always talk about Indian food with them because I LOVE it, and ask where they think the best place to go is.  They always mention Taj Mahal.  I finally went there after a disappointing meal from Mintt, and Indian food took on a whole new meaning.  Everything was FRESH FRESH FRESH and the service was great and friendly.  The inside is cheerful and the prices were super reasonable.  Flavor was complex and interesting; quality cuts of chicken; papadam and vegetables good and portions were good.  I have heard the buffet is great -- I think they only have that on weekends for lunch, but don't quote me on that.  Definitely the best Indian in Pittsburgh, despite the fact that it is on (horrible) McKnight Road -- only drawback.  I used Waze to take me there and it didn't know the exact location -- it is on the same side of the street and a few doors away from Mad Mex.  Also, all my Indian clientele say their desserts are fantastic and authentic, not like the other restaurants. I don't eat sugar/gluten so can't speak for it, but wanted to pass that info along.
