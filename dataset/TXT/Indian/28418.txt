J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I love Indian food(and basically any spicy food in general). The interior is very nice(i think this is an important component of any restaurant). I had palak paneer and tandori chicken(which I felt was a little too rich). Please keep in mind, they dont take debit and is a bit noisy at times. All in all, I would say its a nice place just nothing to rave about.
