The momo (dumplings) are delicious; the vegetable biryani is delicious; the veggie Nepali dish is delicious. Raita and lassi are also great. The menu lists "Indian tea," which is code for chai--it's great. Also for some reason the prices are from like 1995. It's nuts.

Service is extremely solicitous and sweet and friendly, from some very nice guys who also seem to work in the kitchen and don't speak especially strong English. Expect to wait a few minutes for them to come out and help you, but if you wave them over they're happy to help immediately.

My parents and I went to a few fancy well-known restaurants around Pittsburgh and our best meal by a wide margin was at the divey, homey, very inexpensive, crazily delicious Subba.
