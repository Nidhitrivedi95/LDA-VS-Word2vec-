yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug India Masala is an Indian restaurant near UNLV's campus on Flamingo.  The parking lot does get filled because a combination of India Masala, the various business around, and the small parking lot. I'm impressed with the interior, it is very nice and a huge improvement from what was there, only a few years ago.  That being said it is very nice inside but how does the rest stack up?

Well I came here with my usual large group of co-workers and they were more than accomendating.  We all did the lunch buffet which was only $9.99, the same price as Mt. Everest.  In comparison buffet wise, I do perfer Mt. Everest a lot more because they had more selection, flavor, and better quality in the non-salad and non-dessert items but India Masala is an ok substitute. So they don't have a large selection on their buffet. Their rice dish wasn't mixed well, large patches of non-mixed rice was found throughout. The curry dishes were very running, if they weren't meant to be running. But their desserts, the free mango lassi after check-in and yogurt/tapioca/pudding looking things with fruits were all very delicious. Their meat dishes and regular/garlic naans were about the same. Customer service was excellent, when a few of us decided to use our free lassi check-in offers and they gave more than enough it became awesome.

There are better Indian restaurants in the area. The food in the buffet were alright but not good enough for me to be a fan of. Maybe I'll come back for dinner or not do the buffet. They do have a happy hour from 3pm-6pm for with a drink list and 50% off selected appetizers.
