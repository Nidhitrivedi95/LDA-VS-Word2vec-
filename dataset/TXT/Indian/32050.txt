ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg Worst food! Nothing great about this place. The staff looks pretty new in this kind of business and the food is not authentic at all. Way to high prices in terms of the quantity and quality.Avoid this place and go somewhere else on the street. Worst they do not accept credit cards.
