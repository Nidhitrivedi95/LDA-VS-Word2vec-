UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA The employees have a rude attitude towards the customers and they show the look of frustration towards the customer. Apparently, one cannot add to the order he/she already has because it may trouble the job of the employee (sarcasm). That ruined the entire mood of the day for me. The food is good, though. They employees treat the customers horribly. It felt discriminatory! Unless you are starving and have no other option, I would not at all recommend this at all! Their service is pathetic!
