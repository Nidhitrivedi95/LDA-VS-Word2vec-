MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ Terrible restaurant. Ordered $80 worth of food through Foodora and was extremely disappointed, you could not feed 3 people with this amount. The methi chicken tikka is $17 and you get 7 pieces of toonie sized chicken. The butter chicken was the same problem, the container was filled with sauce and had maybe 10 pieces of chicken the size of a quarter. The saag included maybe five chunks of paneer. When I called the restaurant immediately after delivery the response was "those are our prices". There was NO attempt to provide any customer service or resolution. When I asked for a manager I was told "there isn't one here right now".
Avoid this place at all costs, not worth the prices and they care nothing for the customers spending money there.
