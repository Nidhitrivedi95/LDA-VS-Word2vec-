OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We decided to try this place out because of the reviews we read on here and we weren't disappointed. 

We arrived at lunchtime, when they only serve the buffet, but our server Tina was more than happy to offer us the option to order off of their full menu. 

We tried the Paneer Tikka, Samosa Chaat, Masala Cup Corn, Egg Curry, and Pav Bhaji. Everything was delicious and the presentation of the food was beautiful. We ended our meal with the Paan Shots and those were amazing as well! 

The prices are reasonable for a restaurant that is located near the strip, and Tina went above and beyond to provide us excellent service. We highly recommend you give this place a shot (pun intended); you won't be disappointed!
