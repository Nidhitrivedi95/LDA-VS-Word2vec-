I2mnA_OCnIdua0FhW03cUw Worst Indian food I've ever eaten. Had Lamb Korma and Lamb Vindaloo. Both dishes were served with super tough lamb and the flavors were just not good. The garlic naan was stale and some pieces were rock hard. Spent $50 on a meal and ended up throwing it away and eating popcorn for dinner. This place is a joke. Go somewhere else if you're craving Indian.
