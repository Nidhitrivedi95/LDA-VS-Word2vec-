BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ The foods are delicious but what I like even more is the friendliness of the staff. I have come in here with friends for lunch and have also ordered delivery and the staff are always accommodating and full of smiles. Sometimes, in a busy city like Toronto, some people forget how to be nice to other humans so it's always refreshing when this is the case. At Jaipur, you get good food, great atmosphere and friendly staff. What's not to love?
