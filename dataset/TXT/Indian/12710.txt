B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Having recently moved here from a big city, I was incredibly surprised at the quality and taste of Dhaba's food. It mixes authentic favors with classic dishes but adds modern technique. It's a very clean and welcoming environment with a really lovely staff. 

I'm a huge fan of fish fries and was impressed with their fish pakora (lightly breaded and spiced fish) -- it's flaky, moist and arguably one of the best "fish fries" I've had in Madison. Highly recommend.
