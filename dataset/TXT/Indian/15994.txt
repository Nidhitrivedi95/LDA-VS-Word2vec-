dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q Ventured there because of a Groupon. It was not a Groupon wasted! The food was good and so was the service.

I have to agree with everyone, the naan was extremely delicious. However at the time we went, there wasn't much naan available. We arrived about 8pm; it was a late dinner. The buffet selection was rather tiny, but all the staples in Indian Cuisine were available. There was Butter chicken, Tandoori chicken, Biriyani Rice etc... It is good if you're not looking to try all the different Indian dishes. The salad/dessert section was rather small, and not much of a selection. Just a deep Freeze with Ice Cream and off the hot section was rice pudding, Julab Jamun and not too much more. 

The décor, was a little less than what I would expect from an Indian restaurant on Church. The colors were dull, and poorly put together. I was expecting bright vibrant colors, that of the Indian culture, but walked into a dimly lit room with dull wall colors and table setting.

But the food is definitely something to go for. I would go back just for the food.
