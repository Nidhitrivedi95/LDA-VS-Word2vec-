DrdhxvpwlZGhwF5vTR_QnA The calling card of this restaurant is the food quality.   If you have discerning taste for foods made with high quality cuts of meat and spices, then this is a restaurant for you.   The chefs put a high amount of effort into their offerings.

I've had the chicken jalfrazi, chicken tikka masala, vegetable aloo gobi, lamb biryani and spinach saag aloo.    All were excellent choices that I look forward to having again in the future.  The flavours of the spices and the dishes were well balanced and delicious.

The extra dollar or two that you may pay for the dishes here are more than made up for in quality.
