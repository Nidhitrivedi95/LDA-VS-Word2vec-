h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Ordered via Grubhub and had a positive experience with customer service. They delivered super fast, and were friendly, but the food was so-so. We ordered Saag paneer and Veggie korma (vegetable combo special, which includes naan and rice for only 22 bucks, not too bad!) and while the portion sizes were generous, the curries were very soup-y. The saag had no spices whatsoever, and somehow tasted reminiscent of chicken? While the veggie korma had somewhat better flavor, veggies were scarce and it was mostly sauce. We also had samosas  I think we would order again for convenience on a busy weeknight, but hoping that the chefs step up their game a bit.
