-This past Saturday was my first time at the restaurant and it is worthy of placing it on my regular "take out" list.
-The other reviews were pretty mixed; however, we tried it based on a friend's reference and I am glad we did.

-Ambiance is Quick Serve Indian
-Nice Interior
-We chose take out but eating in would be fine.  The only negative would be room noise but it is similar to a Chipotle
-The order was 100% correct
-The portion size was large
-Fresh and lighter tasting. Was not heavy like we have had at other Indian restaurants.
-We asked for mild and it was a definite medium.  We will make sure to ask for Extra Mild next time :-)

-They have buy one get one and half off specials on Tuesdays and Wednesdays

Yum.
