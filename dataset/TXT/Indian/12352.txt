auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Got a to go order. Extra charge for rice which surprised me it didn't come with my curry. My butter chicken was so greasy it got all over the other containers and was almost inedible. I tried eating it anyway and got about 5 bones. Very poor quality for the price. I paid $30 for curry, rice, naan, and papadom for 1 person. I would never go back.
