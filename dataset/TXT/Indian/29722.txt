jxl1GXU0MI6DJSbh9907sg I came here for lunch during the week. Not only is it beautifully decorated the serve was right on point. He was very professional.  The garlic naan was hot as well as the food. I had the samosas and the spinach with cheese. All of which tasted great. Perfect amount of spice. The atmosphere is romantic and classy and you leaving full and happy. Amazing! Next time I am in Scottsdale I will definitely go back.
