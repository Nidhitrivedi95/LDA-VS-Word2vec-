If you love Indian food you are going to be disappointed the butter chicken tastes nothing like butter chicken 

The Manchurian beef was too salty it could give you a heart attack. Plus they will tell you it's chilli. The realty it's not even 1/10 chilli

Very disappointing experience plus our bill was 25 for two meals, one of them only had rice, no drinks. Also over priced
