TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA I'm really not sure why this place gets such bad reviews - maybe the quality of the food has gone down over the years, or maybe people are comparing it to some of the more fancy/expensive dosa places in the area. 

 I thought the Chana Bhatura & the Dosa that I ordered were delicious and I'm a complete sucker for Sambar. For the price and the quick service, I thought it was a great alternative to some of the other choices in the area.
