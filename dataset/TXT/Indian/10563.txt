A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Gluten-free review:

This place is completely vegetarian and has a mountain of gluten-free and vegan options. They have a number of gluten-free dosas and curries to choose from. If you've never had a dosa before, you can't go wrong with a masala dosa. Make sure you specify that you want a gluten-free version since the batter they use is different than their regular dosas. 

I also highly recommend the lassi. I usually get the sweet lassi but if you're parched then get the salt lassi. It's not super salty, don't worry.

My only issue with this place is the service. People are friendly but the wait staff are so disorganized. Instead of assigning waiters to different zones, they all seem to try to tag team each other, which they often fail at. So if you're ready to order and stop someone walking by they will go try to get the official order taker (who sometimes takes the order for all the tables in the restaurant, and there are a lot of tables!) so you end up spending way more time than you should just having to place an order. The last time I was there I needed a to-go box and I kid you not, I had to ask at least 5 different people before I got one. The rest would say ok, go into the kitchen and never return. So weird...and annoying. 

My advice: don't come here if you're in a rush. If you have time to kill then kick back and enjoy the food.

TL;DR lots of gluten-free options, get the masala dosa, staff are disorganized and waste time
