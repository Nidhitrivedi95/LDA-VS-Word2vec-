CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ We wanted to try this place for a long time and finally got the chance try it! Good thing we did! Nothing bad to say about the place; service is excellent and super friendly, food is fresh good and authentic, very clean and the kids couldn't stop eating the naan's bread since it was all you can eat during lunch time. Will go back for sure!
