Qfn9qbWKPsfkFZDQzw7kCQ Hands down one of the best Indian places I've been to.

When it comes to restaurants, I'm more of a food-over-service kind of girl. The service, decor and ambiance don't really matter to me so much as a good meal does.

This place is nothing to look at. I think it was a fried chicken shack before Tandoori Village took over it- and it still looks like it. The waiters are teenagers du jour and are acceptable, but you might have to flag one down to get your chai or water refilled. But like I said, that hardly matters when my 5-star review is all about the food.

To start, order hot chai. It will come unsweetened and very hot- but stir and stir with sugar while you wait for your meal. You'll find yourself strangely addicted to a second cup, even if you don't like whole milk (I detest it and this is the only time I drink it.)

The naan basket is fantastic- a variety of flavored naans, onion, garlic, potato. Also fantastic is the papadum- it's like a flat crispy cracker flavored with Indian spices. Try it with the two chutneys- the green one is mint and hot, the other is sweeter and earthier. Also try mixing them!

I love the palak paneer- a spinach dish made with Indian cheese- and the basmati rice. The vindaloo is also amazing. Their curries and "sauce dishes" will share a little easier than their tandoori or grilled dishes- get a variety of sauces and meats and trade around the table for a little sample of everything. I always leave a little high on spice and very satisfied. 

It's nothing special to look at, but it really depends on what you go in wanting. If you want a "slice of India" complete with belly-dancers and ornate carpets, you might want to try somewhere else. But for fantastic food at reasonable prices...this is your place!
