Apparently you're supposed to grab a slip by the water cooler and mark down what you want and then hand it to the women cooking in the back. I sat around for like 15 minutes before I went on Yelp and figured out what to do. The food itself was really good, but a bit on the spicy side for my taste. If you like hot food, this place is for you. It was definitely not lacking in flavor. The samosas are excellent as well. I was a little irritated that they don't take debit/credit card for purchases under $10, as the food is very cheap. I had to buy a Cadbury chocolate bar off the shelf in order to make my purchase over $10. Overall, I'd give the food 4 stars, but the service 2 stars. 3 stars on average. Good, but there are better places to go in Tempe.
