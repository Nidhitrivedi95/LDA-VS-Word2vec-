SjmtOnyHgdKFDUkAuyPcMw Fantastic! Very high quality food (you can tell that the ingredients are fresh and of high quality), pure vegetarian, huge selection of Western & Indian dishes, pure vegetarian (most items are vegan), very reasonable prices, and Soul-music playing in the background. What is not to like? We have already been there repeatedly - anytime we are now near the Toronto airport, we'll be frequenting Veggie Flames.
