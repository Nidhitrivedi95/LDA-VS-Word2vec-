v4ZVAIDgE9ZXhMcpx8tctw Atmosphere, Service, Food - the run down.

Atmosphere:  Allo Inde has operated on Stanley St. for well over two decades.  The furniture, unfortunately, is probably the original stock brought in at opening!  Although the tattered state of the decor is not the ultimate let-down, the place is dimly lit and somewhat airless.  The dinning experience is acceptable if the place is not overly busy; it usually isn't

Service: Service at Allo Inde is passable.  Waiters are not very attentive, and if you require some advice on what to order, you'll often simply get a blazing recitation of the menu - thereby leaving you more confused then ever.  Waiters seem to expect patrons to know what to order.

Food: The food at Allo Inde seems to aim for mediocracy and in fact seems to be made to conform to the tourists' ideals of Indian / Pakistani food rather than actually being Indian / Pakistani food.  Adding insult to injury, prices are not compatible with the food's quality and restaurants service.

The place could be so much more.
