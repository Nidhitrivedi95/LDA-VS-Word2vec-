-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw My favorite is "Thali combo" $8.99. You can chose 3 types of curry. I love eggplant and feta cheese curry. It has rice and nan. Cost performance is great and delicious enough amount of meek makes my stomach happy. Highly recommend for casual quick meal. *They have  tables in the place as well.( ^^ )
