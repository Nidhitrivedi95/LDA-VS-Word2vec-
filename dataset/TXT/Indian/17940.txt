Located on Markham Road with plenty of parking in the plaza, this place has a 'around the corner in Chennai' vibe. Walls are painted dull yellow and tables n chairs are pretty old fashioned.

Their sambhar and rasam is the best I've had so far. Idli's are super soft and vada's are crisp n fresh. We get the Idli dipped in copious amount of sambhar and garnish it with chopped onions and coriander. Can't say how happy that makes me.

The lunch buffet over the weekends is pretty decent too. But why no medu vadas?

The service leaves a lot to be desired. Although the staff is amicable but there seems to be a language barrier. Now only if I was from South India or Sri Lanka I guess.

They are also pretty strict about timings. Reached at 9pm on a weekday with my parents who are visiting us but were told if you can finish your food by 9.30, you can sit. Or? I didn't want or wait to hear the rest of it.

We'll be back for food's sake though. Sigh!!!
