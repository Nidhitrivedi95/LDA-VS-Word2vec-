MDiH8mNfMCRV_UHGZ3VXxQ Maybe not the best Indian,but whenever my craving for chicken Korma hits and I'm near here,this us where I come. So far,so good; the food has always been piping hot and tasty. I would however,appreciate more salad than starch with starch..... potatoes AND rice on the plate. Overall though,pretty good for fast food.
