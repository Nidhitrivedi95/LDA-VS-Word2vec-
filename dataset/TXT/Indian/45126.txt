Overall very tasty with a good variety including several different biryani options and they do bring out fresh naan, including a garlic option in case you are concerned about vampires or do not like your dinning companions. 

Will have to try for dinner to explore to explore some of the lamb options.  Owner brought out a sample of their home made ice cream with some pistachios on top which hit the spot. 

Currently they are awaiting their liquor license but hopeful they will stock some local craft brew options like Santan Devil Ale which would go great with a spicy vindaloo.
