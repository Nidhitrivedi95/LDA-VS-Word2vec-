eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Oh my freaking gawd. My husband and I stumbled across this place on our way back from an errand we ran nearby, and I'm so glad we did. This buffet is massive. It's like a typical Indian buffet took a bunch of steroids and landed in Brampton. Not only is the buffet sizable, the food is actually good! I came in here and DESTROYED this buffet like Godzilla DESTROYED Tokyo. Seriously. Everything was delicious: huge chunks of tasty paneer; perfectly squishy and savory malai kofta; and my favorite, the warm gulab jamun! And real scoopable ice cream (not that soft serve frozen yogurt stuff you find at buffets these days). The food was so good I forgot that there wasn't any meat. Plus free sodas! Yay!  

We came in at around 2:15 and there wasn't any wait. Best of all, lunch for two that left us stuffed to the gills was only $24! Score! 

I only wish this place were closer. Or, maybe I don't. I don't want to have to invest in a wheelbarrow in which I'd have to be brought home every time I had a meal here. Yum. Burp. Nap. Zzz.
