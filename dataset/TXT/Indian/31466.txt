KtNPcK6x9Dxj3aYGis5wgg I love how close it is to my place. 

I've ordered a few times and have never been disappointed in my selection. I recently introduced my friend to this place and Indian food in general and she also enjoyed. 

The chicken tikka and butter chicken are absolutely delicious! The veggie korma was pretty tasty too. Portions are generous, we even had enough leftover for lunch the next day! But the one thing on the menu that you absolutely need to order is the garlic naan. Your taste buds will thank me. Use that delicious bread to sop up all that yummy sauce
