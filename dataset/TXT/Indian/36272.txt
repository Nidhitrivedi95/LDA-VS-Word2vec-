NwLIEaqEz-9kcHkseLsfiQ LOVE their food!!!!

Super tasty, chef is from Pakistan and his wife makes such delis Items!!!

This Restaurant is a Dhaba. Mostly Taxi drivers come here as its open 24-7.

Location is shady bc its on church st and lots of prostitutes and hobos around the area.

Definitely not a family restaurant unless you go in the morning lol

Make sure you get their Chana masala and Butter Chicken Yumm
