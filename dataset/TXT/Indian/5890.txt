3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Worst experience ever!  They make you pay extra for rice, what kind of joke is that... I have never been to an Indian place that doesn't serve basmati rice with almost every dish.  For the prices, the portions are terrible. The chickpea roti was burnt.  Delivery was over 40 minutes later than what I was told. I get it's an estimate, but when your food shows up barely warm, what the heck. I knew I should have just went and picked it up because then I could have known I wasn't going to get rice either. Don't waste your money here!
