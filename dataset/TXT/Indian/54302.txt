Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A Mmm, some good Indian food. A bit of a drive for those of us who live downtown, but it's good.

We had a meeting there at 7pm on a Monday night and was able to get a table, without a problem. Located in a random strip mall (I almost passed it, but slammed on my brakes right in time), it's decently busy, but not super full on a weekday.

We ordered a medley of different foods- the chicken makhani, paneer tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and mastani palek to name a few. They were all good and tasty. Not to spicy with a lot of spices though. Overall, pretty good. I'm not Indian so I can't really determine if it was authentic, but in my opinion of Indian places, I thought it was good. Not the best I've had, but very good.

The service was kind of slow and the waiter didn't really hear my order, but we had a large group of 6, so I guess that's always hard. Overall though, pretty good Indian food!
