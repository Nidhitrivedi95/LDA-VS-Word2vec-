h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ I am giving one star because i am really disappointed with their service..very spicy food even after asking for no spice in any of the items but all items had high spice not even mild...In kids meal i have asked for cheese uttapam but they have packed cheese dosai and instead of cheese it was too oily for any kid...so for next time i will not go to this place.
