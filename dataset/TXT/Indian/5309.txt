2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Living within a 15-20 min drive from here ever since I was a kid. Love when my dad would pick up some samosas especially for an afternoon snack. Still $1 for 5 today which is amazing, because of how crispy and delicious they are. They aren't small and they don't skimp out on the filling (potatoes, peas) either! Even after the drive home, they are still super crispy! Their roti is okay, and pakoras can be more fresh. Other than that, this is my go-to spot for great tasting samosas that are a bang for your buck!
