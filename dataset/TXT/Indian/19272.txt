F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w Stopped here for dinner on the 4th of July. The place was pretty empty and there were more tables waiting to be bussed than had people in them. Not a good sign, but the one woman working the front was pleasant enough even though she seemed to be responsible for everything.

We ordered the samosa appetizer to start and plain naan, saag paneer, and a curry dish with pakora for dinner. There were two samosas in the $3.50 order and they were big. They weren't very flavorful though. Just big blobs of potato and peas (mostly potato) in a not-so-crispy crust. The tamarind chutney that they were served with was tasty & rescued the boringness of the samosas somewhat.

The naan was naan, nothing exciting to report there. Neither of us were terribly pleased with our main dishes though. I ordered mine medium and the saag was ordered hot. Neither dish was much more than mildly spiced. Both were boring. The bright spot was the paneer in the saag, which had been fried. That was an interesting treat & something we'd never seen before in the dish. Too bad the rest of the dish was so dull.

The server was friendly and prompt and by the time we left there were more tables with diners than tables waiting to be bussed, but only because more people arrived. The tables covered in dirty dishes never did get cleaned up. I won't go back.

Also, the place is BYOB. A nice touch, but no fun if you don't know in advance.
