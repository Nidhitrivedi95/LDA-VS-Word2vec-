z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA The food here is quite good, and each time I come here, I order a different take on a lamb dish.  I've never had their chicken, fish, or veggie offerings, just lamb.

The service is attentive, and the place is dark and nice.

My favorite is the cheese and garlic naan.  This probably isn't a real, traditional Indian side order, but it is nonetheless very delicious.  

For their lamb dishes, I always order a 5-level spiciness, and even at that level, I find it to be rather non-spicy.  That's ok though, because I am really ordering it for the lamb.

There is however one BIG COMPLAINT I have about this restaurant:  The servers always, always upsell.  What I mean is, they always ask if you want to order more, an appetizer? dessert?  alcohol?  I KNOW this is a common practice to get a higher bill, but seriously, I am an adult, and I know what my caloric intake should be.  I suppose white America is all about excess, and ordering tons of food.  Anyway, stop upselling!  I can afford to eat out a lot, I just don't like wasting food.
