-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Are you here for the ambiance?  No.  Are you here for the sparkling repartee with the wait staff?  No...get over yourself!  You are here for the best Indian food you can get anywhere near Pittsburgh.  So cheap, so delicious, and so unforgettable your out-of-town friends will beg you to take them here when they visit.  

We always start with the chili pakora--spicy, but so flavorful I don't mind a few moments of burning.  Try it!  Then get a dosa to share.  It doesn't matter which one you choose; just make sure you use the coconut chutney that comes with it.  Over many visits, we've tried almost every dish on the menu and can safely say that, even if you close your eyes and point randomly at an entree when ordering, you won't be disappointed.  Udipi's raita is fabulous.  Drizzle a bit of it on almost any dish to magically enhance what was in no need of enhancement in the first place.  And please indulge in the bhatura!  

Do you remember those old cartoons in which characters would, literally, be lifted off their feet by a delicious aroma, carried through the air toward an irresistible feast?  That's how I feel every time I park in front of Udipi.  After your first visit, you will, too.
