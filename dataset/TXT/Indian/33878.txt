LZWXP-D4YPlzsFjVx6b9XA I went here for dinner the other night.  When we walked up half the staff was sitting outside on the deck which was a little awkward for us.  

We were asked to seat ourselves as the place was pretty much empty.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend had a vegetable curry.  Both dishes were pretty good but the whole situation with ordering, etc was just awkward.  

The prices here are very comparable to the Blue Taj down the road in Ballantyne.  We both agreed that we would probably stick to the Taj in this area for Indian dining going forward.
