KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA I have no words to express my satisfaction and praise this restaurant for the food and the service (the owner was the nicest person ever, he comes to every table personally to suggest/help you out with your order and inquires about the service multiple times)...Only I could say is it was like I was back in Karachi...anything they serve is top notch from naan to all the dishes...all my Pakistani/Indian friends I recommended this restaurant to went there twice in a span of two weekends just cuz they couldnt decide what to order and what not to cuz every dish was delicious..Enough said!
