OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A We're visiting Montreal from NYC for my girlfriends birthday and Jazzfest. We came to Darbar for her birthday dinner and were not disappointed. We love Indian food, and this was some of the best we've ever had. The flavors were on point - and the garlic naan was truly the best I've ever tasted! Plus they have 3 Indian beers on tap! Friendly, quick service and a beautiful atmosphere. Can't go wrong with this great restaurant.
