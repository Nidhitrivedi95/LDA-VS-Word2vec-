uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA I think this place was awesome. It was my first time trying Indian food (besides Gulab Jamun) and wow! The Butter Chicken was fantastic. My friends all knew what was what, so they helped me pick. The service was great. A little slow bringing me my hot tea but it's ok, still a 5 star experience. I live in west Phoenix but I definitely believe it's worth the drive. Thank you!!
