DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ A little caveat before we dive into this review....I haven't had a lot of Indian food in my life.  I do like it, it's just not (for unknown reasons) one of the first options that pops into my head when I think about going to a restaurant.  

That being said...I liked Sangam and everything we had there.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was very good.  A little too spicy for me, but I am a total sissy (and I'm sure I was asked how spicy I wanted and I stupidly answered "however he ordered it").  I also tried a few other dishes, I just can't keep my fork to myself, and they were all very good.  We had a bottle or two of wine with dinner, they have a good wine list.  

Our server was great.  She was friendly and attentive and put up with our shenanigans.  What more can you ask for?  

Definitely a great option if you're looking for some good Indian food in the Lake Norman area.
