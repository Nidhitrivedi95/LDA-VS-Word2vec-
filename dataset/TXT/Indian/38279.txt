oKDzHRuV3bYNE3LUAXuv5w My flatmates and I visitited Tikka Mahal shortly after it first opened during the summer last year.  The menu looked entising and relatively cheap from the outside so we decided to give it a go.  The decor inside was pretty nice with newly painted yellow walls shiny mirrors.  It's intended to be a takeaway as well a restaurant and probably does equal trade through both.  We decided to sit in and we all ordered a curry with rice and a naan.  I opted for the chicken rogan josh which didn't take too long to arrive and tasted great when it did.  The portions were also excellent and the meal only cost us about £7 each.  
My only criticism is that at that time we were probably some of their first customers and they were keen to see what our reactions were to the food, so it felt like we were being constantly watched whilst trying to eat which was irritating.  I doubt you'd have that problem if you went now though, and Tikka Mahal is a well-priced Indian with great food.
