P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag As someone who has been to India and grew up near the US's largest Indian diaspora in New Jersey, I think I can say that All India has to be one of the best venues for Indian food in the country. A dish of mughlai lamb was served at the right level of spiciness with expert flavor, the naan was perfectly charred, and the condiments were clearly prepared in house. The ubiquitous green chutney served at Indian restaurants had a serious depth of flavor - maybe All India has a secret coriander connection, maybe they grow it themselves, but that chutney is worth the whole meal right there. I thought moving from the east coast to Pittsburgh meant giving up on finding expert expressions of the cuisines of certain countries, but with the discovery of All India I am happy to cross the sub continent off that list.
