02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I used to love this place, food was fresh and tasty, staff were friendly and attentive, but I don't know if the sell the place maybe? . Sadly This is NOT definitely what it used to be.

Salad was really old, vegetables were not crunchy anymore, same with fruits, the red chicken..I don't remember the name..was dry and over cooked, the waiter totally ignore us, and the restaurant was not really busy when we visited... We got water once, and he literally disappeared , not even visible to call him back, we also usually get naan twice, not this time for same reasons...

I'm disappointed visiting this restaurant used to be a very pleasant experience, I doubt to visit again...if I need to "beg" for service and "tip" after all...and visiting this business again, well something is wrong with me.
