tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g I have eaten before here once and was really impressed by the taste of the paneer curry and the tandoori chicken. The portions were nice and were good value for the money. 

We went again to celebrate an occasion and were very disappointed with the experience. The portion sizes were reduced by half and the food was very spicy (I can handle spice very well). The biryani was just average.  Too bad.
