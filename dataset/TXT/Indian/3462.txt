I arrived in Toronto at 1h30PM, and I was very hungry. I ordered 2 half dozen of them, 1 set of spinach and cheese samosas, and one set of steak and potatoes, with a side of spicy mango chutney and a coriander yoghurt sauce.

The sauces were solid, the spicy mango wasn't so spicy, although it has a sweet and tangy taste to it. The Yoghurt sauce was spicy, albeit a bit too runny.

The spinach and cheese fell flat of our expectation, lacking the spices that are usually associated with South Asian street food, and lacked flavour overall. The fact that the Yoghurt sauce couldn' stick to it play heavily against it.

However, the steak one was spicy, filling and tasty. Full of flavour, it matched perfectly with the minimal sauce that could hold on to it. It was very good.
