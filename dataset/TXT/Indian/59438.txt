z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA I love the food here!

I have tried many dishes here and everything has been solid.  My favorites being the vindaloo, korma, and palak paneer.  The rice is perfectly seasoned and everything tastes fresh.

I usually get the food to go.  It takes a while but I prefer that everything is made fresh, so I don't mind.  They always give you plenty of rice and will not hold back on heat so be careful what you ask for.

This is my Indian spot!  I drive 25 minutes for take out and do not seek closer Indian restaurants because I doubt I will find one I like as much as Bombay.
