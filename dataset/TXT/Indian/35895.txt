Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg We have ordered from Trimurti for 5 years. I still love their food but I won't be ordering from them again. 

They didn't deliver my rice that I paid for this evening. When I called to let them know the manager refused to send someone with the rice and would only say he would comp rice on my next order. Unacceptable.
