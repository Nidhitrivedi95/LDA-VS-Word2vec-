nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Awesome culinary experience!  Great value, presentation, and quality.  I tried to come in late the night before but they had sold out of food as they prepare everything fresh each day.  I came back the next night (early) and had a great experience.  It started pouring rain at the end of my dinner and they gave me an umbrella to walk back to my hotel.  I can't help but feel I got more than my moneys worth.  $25 for a 3 course gourmet meal and a free umbrella!
