iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw What's with the birds? I felt like everywhere I looked there was some sort of bird. The decor is a little too funky for my taste. 

I had the butter chicken and naan. Which was alright. I didn't feel like it was something to rave about. 

Definitely overpriced. Between one app, two entrees and water spend a little over 50. I'll stick to other Indian resturants closer to home.
