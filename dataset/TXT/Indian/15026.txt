We love the Veg. and Non-Veg. dinners for two, but be sure to sub out the chicken pakora for the veg. pakora.  My wife and I like spicy Indian, so this place is great for us. They also have a decent AYCE lunch buffet. The only problem is that we usually end up fighting over who gets the last of the Tikka Masla.
