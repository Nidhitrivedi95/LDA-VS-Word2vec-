auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ For some reason, Las Vegas has always felt a little thin on quality Indian restaurants. I tend to be a harsh grader so I think Taj is a 3-3.5* on the food, but I'm rounding up because there just aren't that many options and IMO the Henderson area is lucky to have Taj Palace.

To me, the standout dishes are the jalfrezi and the haryali, the latter of which I usually get with tilapia. The biryani is also cooked well here. All their lentil dishes I've tried are good (soup, daal makhani, and yellow daal), and I usually have the aloo gobhi and bhindi masala in my rotation of dishes. When I'm feeling like something more on the creamy side, the korma is pretty delectable too.

The lunch buffet is also an excellent value; just be aware that some of the offerings are not as high quality as they are at dinner (especially the tandoori chicken, which isn't nearly as well cooked at the buffet lunch). Given the low cost though, I don't hold this against them. It works the other way too - if you've only done the lunch buffet, know that some items are much higher quality when ordered at dinner.
