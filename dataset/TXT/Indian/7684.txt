The place was much nicer than the exterior would lead us to believe. The waiter seemed to be a bit uneasy, but was very nice. And I liked the Bollywood songs that were playing ^_^.
The food itself was awesome. Everything was tasty. The sauces with that dry bread, the chicken I had, the rice, the naan, the desert... Oh and the mango juice mixed with yogurt ? Yup, tasty again. 
Nothing seemed  

It wasn't perfect, but I can definitely say that this experience was way above average for me. Everybody should go there once, see if they like it.
