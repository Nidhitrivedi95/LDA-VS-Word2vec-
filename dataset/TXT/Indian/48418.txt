TlWXWTycakYiPeRc4d3yTQ Reviews aren't looking so hot for his place but I don't know...I always seem to leave with some pretty good tasting food <U+200D>

It's actually a go-to place for my co-workers and I. Whenever we decide to get together, we order a bunch of items in advance and have someone pick it up. But..sometimes they don't have it ready so there's still a waiting time. Another but...food has always been good! 

I feel like they probably treat regular customers differently than they would a walk-in and really depends on who's working. I don't think I go there often enough for them to know who I am but I've got a couple times with just my sister and service has been horrible

I would still give it a 4 star though cuz it's still a go-to place for my coworkers and I, and they haven't disappointed yet.
