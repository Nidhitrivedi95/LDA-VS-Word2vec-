G_5zQbGAFYYKD7vBEoWByg Beef, oh glorious beef. Ginger Express knows how to cook a good flank steak. The grilled beef pho and vermicelli are both delicious and flavourful, you can tell they know the key is tossing in cornstarch to pick up all the marinade. Although the pho broth wasn't particularly special, it does win points for not being salty! Saag paneer spring rolls are like eating pillows of spinach and cheese, everything is tasty when it's in a wrapper. There needs to be more Indian curries wrapped in phyllo, it should be a requirement!
