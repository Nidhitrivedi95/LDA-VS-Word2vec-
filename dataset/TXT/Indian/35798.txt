 I live nearly 8 miles away but this is my Indian Restaurant of choice, even if it's just for a takeaway. It's easily good enough to justify nearly 16 miles of driving.


 As the previous reviewer has said, it can be VERY busy & I've been left waiting for my takeaway at a cold and draughty doorway at the busiest times. Despite this, I really didn't mind as I'm always happy with the overall experience and in particular the food.


 Again, as the previous reviewer said, the staff and manager are all very friendly and attentive.


 Recommended dishes:
Chana Puri (starter)
Jaipuri Chicken
Lamb Shapla


 Food always seems to be prepared with fresh ingredients and I've yet to have a less than totally satisfactory meal.


 Go there, try it and have a few drinks in one of the locals before of after. They're generally very welcoming places and the small-town atmosphere is refreshing.


 Actually, I think I'll get something there tonight!
