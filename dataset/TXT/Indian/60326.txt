ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I don't get it when people complain about not having a lot of meat in their $9 buffet? If you want cheap dirty food, not fresh delicious food, then just go to a $9 chinese buffet where they have a lot of "meat" for you. Or how about be fancy like me, spend only $2 more and get the chicken chettinad. It has a lot of chicken meat and can literally feed 2 people. Hands down the best curry dish I've had, I am very satisfied, 5/5. Chicken is tender and soft, not tough to chew. The curry, oh boy, is so finger licking good. First time I had it, my eyes were closed the entire time while my wife was spoon feeding me. It felt like I just spent a million dollars on this dish for it to be this delicious. It is spicy enough to kick up your taste bud, then a lil bit of sourness kicks in, after that it leaves you with a hint of fresh curry leaves and tomatoes puree. The complexity of this dish, in terms of taste, is unbelievable.
