cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA 5th Elementt has a terrible sign.

Their sign screams "Hole in the was shwarma counter place".  Not the sort of place you would go for a nice dinner.  However, contrary to what their sign outside would have you think, this is a really lovely Indian restaurant with modern takes on Indian cuisine (not your standard curry house.)

We've been here twice now, once with a daily-deal coupon (where we received excellent service despite the coupon - not something you always get) and once where we tried their regular prix-fixe menu (also an excellent value.)  The decor and ambiance are really nice, the service attentive without being annoying, and the food is tasty.  A great date-night restaurant.  

But they should really do something about that sign.
