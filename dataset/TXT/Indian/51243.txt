uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg We heard about Fast Biryani when we moved to the east side of Madison a few months back. I have wanted to try it but kept putting it off. Today I took the plunge and got a chili chicken wrap to go. Absolutely outstanding! The FAST in the name stand for Falvorful Aromatic Spicy Tasteful and it was all of those. A generous portion of spicy chili chicken in a naan with veggies and cilantro, a great lunch. They also have a lunch buffet that I intend to try. I gave them 4 stars because of this was only one meal, but the lunch wrap itself I would give 5 stars.
