6gPcuK1mTlJDb3SG7d0q7A I recently took my father to 6flavors and I noticed that their food is a bit spicier than the Americanized Indian restaurants I'm used to.  The default level of spice in most of the dishes is along the lines of a jalapeno. You can add some of the red chutney to increase the heat, but I don't need it and neither did my dad. The selection of chicken and vegetable dishes was very good.  I was impressed with the selection and the flavors. Too bad they don't offer a dinner buffet.

The chicken tikka masala was delicious as were the other dishes, which I do not recall the names of.  I will definitely be back.  Loved it!
