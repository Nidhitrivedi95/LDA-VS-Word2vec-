IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Ordered delivery from here last night and we are super happy with the food, value, and service! The food came within (actually early) their estimated delivery time, and there was no charge for delivery. We ordered butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and the fried eggplant (vegetarian) -  great value and HUGE portion sizes. We were shocked! Also, most of their entrées, although already modestly priced for the huge portion size, include naan or rice with the order! 

Highly recommend and will definitely order again for our next Indian fix.
