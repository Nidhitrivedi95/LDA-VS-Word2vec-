RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Great for dining in or takeout. Clean, spacious, indoor and covered patio, great friendly staff, who make you feel like family. The managers all try to get to know you, and really embrace the regulars. Great menu with large, fresh, piping hot portions. They have a good "heat scale" so all dishes can be made to your tolerance for Indian spices. Takeout is very easy and always well packaged. Parking is tough due to construction on ramp, but Blue Taj is well worth the short walk.
