nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ So I went there again today for dinner with 3 of my friends and I would like to add more:

The bread was better than most of the fancy restaurants - it is served warm, and with tasty sauce (not plain butter), and has almonds in it.

The mussels are fresh and perfect in the tomato soup. Dan put fried sweet potato slices on it - which is a very healthy choice and looks quite nice.

All our entrees had very healthy ingredients: green peas mash instead of potato mash in the Chicken Supreme, lots of asparagus in the penne, at least 3 kinds of mushrooms in my mushroom risotto - they are not expensive or fancy but all very fresh. The portions are so large none of us could finish our entree.

Dan recognized me immediately and didn't charge me extra for the added chicken in my risotto. Then he offered us tiramisu on the house - which is not too sweet and enjoyed by us all.

I would definitely become a regular here. Eager to try out some sandwiches and the chef's choice!
