KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA We had long planned to try them out, and drove all the way from Mississauga to try them. We were 7, and ordered one and a half full lamb karahi, half chicken peshawari karahi, and bihari kebabs. The lamb karahi' was the best so far that I have had in canada. The chicken karahi seemed to be a complete mistake, and finally bihari kebabs that certainly compete with the best in Canada at Cafe D Khan. Raita (mixed yogurt), salad without onions (should have onions), and rotis were good. A star less for the chicken karahi, and the space. Overall it was a great experience, and will go again to try out other items on the menu, but in addition to lamb karahi.
