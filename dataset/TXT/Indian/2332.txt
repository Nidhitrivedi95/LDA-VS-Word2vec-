_PKXarw3GjlbwbXhjdpUMA This is my favourite restaurant for a quick and bang for our buck takeout!  Normally, we like to order the hot and sour soup, chicken pakora, fried rice, chicken and beef dish.  For two people, this is enough for dinner and plenty for the next day. If you're not use to spicy, you can ask for milder spice.  Whenever we don't feel like cooking, we think about this restaurant. It's affordable and the staff here are always nice.
