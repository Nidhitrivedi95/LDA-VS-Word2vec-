eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg We have been going to flavors of India for about fifteen years.  It almost always is a very pleasant experience.  We went during July of 2016 for a family celebration dinner. The rest of the family had chicken dishes and they said they were delicious.  Even my incredibly picky and spice phobic son found their chicken Tikka Masala was good. Not chicken mcnuggets but good.  My daughter really loved the Mango chicken.  They made up a special vegan jalfrezi for me and my wife had the chicken vindaloo.  

Don't be afraid of it being too spicy.  They wouldn't have been in business this long if they didn't know how to cater to all pallets.  I actually thought mine was mild and they had to bring chili chutney. 

The atmosphere is pleasant and the prices are fair.  A family dinner for four with tip and no alcohol but with lots of happy tummies was under only $80 as of this writing.  That is absolutely everything including the tip.
