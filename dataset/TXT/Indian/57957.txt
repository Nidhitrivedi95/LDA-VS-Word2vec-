yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Ambiance provides the right feel for Indian cuisine, including the copper rimmed tableware that I like.  Several lunch specials that include salad, soup, rice, entree, and naan were priced reasonably.  Service was pleasant.  Food was middle of the road.  Soup size was a little small. Naan was dense, thin, and chewy.  Not bad overall, but could be better.  Owner contacted me regarding my experience and I have good assurance it will be better next time, and I'll certainly return.  Great to see proprietors that truly care.
