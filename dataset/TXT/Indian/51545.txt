UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA We went for a sit down dinner, and I was completely satisfied with my experience. Ordered the malai kofta and the chicken tikka masala which both tasted very good. The naan was also very good, maybe a little fluffier in shape as opposed to flat like I am used to, but delicious. This is the best indian food I have had in town so far. Also, the interior of the place is beatiful, lit romantically and well decorated. I will go back for the lunch buffet next time. The service was good and we did not have to wait long to get our food. Dinner portions might be small to some people, i thought it was plenty of food though.
