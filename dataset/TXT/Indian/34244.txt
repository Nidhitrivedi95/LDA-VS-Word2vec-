MgsOZpYSntKSCzNROiWgYQ DON'T GO! Don't make the same mistake we did. We love the Scarborough location so we bought 2 vouchers ($12 for $25) to use at the downtown location, expecting it to be better/classier. Food was meh. Nothing special, not for the prices. Waiter was rude and slow (and had b.o. :-S ). The coupon  said u are was allowed to use two vouchers PER TABLE, which is what we planned to do. He refused us, and was adamant that we cannot use 2. We explained in detail what the voucher said, but he blamed it on Teambuy. He just repeatedly keep saying rudely, "sorry sir, one voucher per table". After a good ten minutes we just walked to the cash and were ready to pay our bill fairly with both vouchers. He still refused and said $30 extra. We then refused and told him, do whatever u want, call the police, but we are only paying what is fairly owed. So we left the two vouchers and paid $15. Obviously no tip.
