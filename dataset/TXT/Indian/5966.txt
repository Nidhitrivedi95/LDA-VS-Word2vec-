3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I've been looking for a really excellent Indian restaurant in Vegas for a while now, and this totally exceeded my expectations. This was my first time here, and they gave me complimentary rice with my (some type of curry? Alas, I forgot) dish. My significant other ordered a lamb-curry dealio and couldn't rave enough about it. This was his first time trying Indian food ever, so this was a pretty epic moment. There is a plethora of vegetarian options, of course, and the naan tasted uber hot and fresh and is friggin' delightful. 10/10 would Delhi again
