We tried the Samosas for an appetizer (delicious, with excellent dipping sauces) and the Vegetable Kurma, a wonderful mix of vegetables in a spicy, almost-cheese-like sauce.  The Naan (try Onion Naan) is delicious as well.

Portions are large (consider splitting an entreé and an appetizer with a friend or date).
