YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA I wouldn't have known this place was any good until I bought a couple deal vouchers online, but I'm glad I took the chance. I pass by this restaurant all the time and never really noticed it, but now I've been there a few times and it's safe to say that this is my favourite Indian restaurant. 

The decor isn't to be desired but it does have a homey kind of feel to it. One complaint is that it gets pretty cold in the winter time, but the spiciness of Indian food can help that :) 
The service is great, everyone is so nice and very accommodating with the various levels of spiciness for each dish that you order. You get complimentary poppadoms with sauce at the beginning of the meal, and I even got complimentary rice pudding one time - I guess they were very excited with my reactions to their food :P

I'm not sure if the food is absolutely authentic, but it's great. Ordering the mango lassi, vegetable pakoras, and garlic naan every time is a must. I try to order new entrees every time I go, and I am never disappointed. Everything I've ordered so far on the menu has been amazing. The portions are quite big even though its usually shared, but I always take left overs home to enjoy the next day. With an appetizer, extra garlic naan, mango lassis, and 2 shared entrees may sound pricey, but the bill came up to around $40!

Every time I eat the food here, I get so happy - it gets pretty ridiculous at times. I can't stop telling my friends about this place and I would not want this restaurant to go unnoticed. Go check it out!
