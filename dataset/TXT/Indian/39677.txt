P4h8kgy_48oE9vCHJc4BCQ Ordered take out from this place.
1 Nihari
1 Butter Chicken
1 Seekh Kabob
2 Pieces Chicken Tikka
4 Nan.

Restaurant is clean. Folks behind the counter are welcoming. 
food is laden with spices, extra spicy that can succumb you the next day or two. 
Had to wait 20  minutes for 4 naans, naans are not that good.
We were over charged on all items except naan, so be aware. Menu flyers had different prices than what we were charged.

all in all this is ok place to go to for a quick take out, if you can handle spices.
