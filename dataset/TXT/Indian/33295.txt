llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I used to like this place but unfortunately India Palace has slowly gone down hill. Waaaay down hill. Plus as I  learned, they have zero loyalty to their customers who eat there fairly regularly. Last night was the last straw. In fact my meal was like chewing straw and inedible. I ordered the Bhindi Masala which is a vegetable okra dish. I have had this several times before but tonight the okra was so tough that if I were to actually swallow it (rather than spit it out in my napkin-sorry gross but true) I guarantee my throat would have been scratched. Also our Roti bread was burned.Not once did anyone check to see how our meals were. When the waitress offered me a box for the uneaten meal at the end , I declined and explained the situation: I have had this dish before but it was like chewing wood shavings (explained it nicer than that) and she just said ok and brought us the bill with no offer to either replace it with another item or take it off the bill like 99.9% of establishments would do. So, they have lost our business and managed  to tick off a yelper over a VERY simple customer service issue.
