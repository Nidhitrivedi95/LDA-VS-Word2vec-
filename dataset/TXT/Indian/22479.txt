gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Even though there was another South Indian vegetarian restaurant right up the road from our hotel, it lacked a liquor license so we drove 10 miles to Ruchi on the basis of uniformly good reviews. We're glad we did, because the food was outstanding (and the beer & wine were welcome). We're not all that familiar with southern Indian cuisine, but the owner was very friendly and helped us make complementary selections from the extensive menu, and we enjoyed pakora appetizers, spinach dosai, mushroom & cauliflower curry, and tamarind rice. Portions were generous and left us enough for the next day's lunch. It was a bit disconcerting that we were the only customers along with one other solitary diner, but we arrived just after they opened on a Sunday evening. We hope that lack of patronage doesn't adversely affect their business, because we look forward to eating there again the next time we're in the area.
