UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I liked the simple decor and that this place had an amazing menu with entrees from all over India as some of my favorite dishes are south India! 

Sadly they were busy and understaffed and caused my friend and I to almost miss our flight, we spent over 2 hours here. When we first arrived there was only one other party within an hour the place was packed. Lucky restaurant apparently bad for us.

Things we dined on

Garlic Naan 4/5
A little too crispy for dipping in my entree broth but still good.

Veggie Kofta 3/5
Lacking flavor although the kofta had the right texture.

Plain Dosa 4/5
Massive in size check out my photos. Dosa tasted great but the coconut chutney was probably the worst i've tasted. 

Saag paneer 1/5
Lacking more flavor then the kofta, do they not season the food at all?...

Lime Soda 1/5
Suppose to be fresh squeezed limes, you could clearly taste that it was not.

Rose Lassi 2/5
Never tried a rose lassi before although I love mango and mint lassi's and I love rose ice cream and yogurt. Not what I was expecting.

Service was terrible took 45 minutes to get us our drinks alone then our order was taken add another 40 mins. No I am not kidding, I remember this like yesterday although it was almost 3 weeks ago. This was a very stressful dining experience for my friend and I. A not so pleasant way for us to spend our last few hours in Vegas.  I will not be returning when back in Vegas.
