KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ This is a total lie. I with my wife was there at 11:50 am. I asked u if buffet was ready u said yes or ur rude employee. You just trying to cover for him. I did not ask for roti which I came last time and asked and paid $2. 99 for it. I will attach have the copy of the receipt also. Your waiter has the biggest attitude problem and when I asked him about food and he says there are other Indian restaurant.  If he does not know customer service so please don't cover for him.  You are totally lieing right now. Please if guys don't know customer service please do something else
