9AnvV8V-UvA_rFhMCr_Dlw Food is great,very fresh and very clean.
There is a good verity even for vegan and that's awesome! Owner(I think is the owner) always there, guiding the team and point them what to fix sims like he is really care-that's probably the main reason why the food is great. I give 4 stars and not 5 only because we came at 2pm for the buffet and there wasn't  salad any more,only few left overs from the lettuce (not even for one person),
So if I pay $15 a person I am expecting to have it all.
