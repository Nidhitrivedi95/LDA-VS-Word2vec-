V7vrXl_1-8dCwNXP7tua1Q Totally useless business. Was on a trip to Toronto city and found this place. I was so excited to try sugarcane juice after a long time but had horrible experience. I Went inside to pay and by the time came out the juice was given to me in a cup. It felt impossible to make one glass juice in less than a minute. I asked the girl outside if the juice was fresh and she said that she just squeezed it.  Well it didn't taste fresh. Went back and returned the juice. The owner had courage to say that it was fresh (he was sitting inside) and didn't even offer any apology or courtesy to change it. Just trashed the juice in front of him and walked away. Too bad..I would not even give 1 star to this place
