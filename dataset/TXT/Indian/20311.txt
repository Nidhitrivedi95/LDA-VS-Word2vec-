FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA This place has probably the best Indian food I've ever eaten!! We stopped by while passing through Charlotte and tried the buffet- awesome decision. The staff were the nicest people ever and the food was perfectly spiced, with a huge variety of options. My boyfriend isn't even a vegetarian and he said it was the best Indian he'd ever had too. So if you want AMAZING food served by really cool people definitely stop by Madras. P.s. The mango lassi was great too!
