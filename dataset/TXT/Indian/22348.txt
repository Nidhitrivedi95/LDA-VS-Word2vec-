gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA I went there yesterday with a friend. We had samosas, which were very tasty and original. However, we were very disappointed with the Vegetarian Thali. Only the naan and the raita were good, the chick peas, spinach and the other dish all tasted badly. I had the feeling that it was just warmed up processed food. I am used to better Indian food, even in cheaper restaurants.
