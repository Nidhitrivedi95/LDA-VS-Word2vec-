kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA I hadn't been in a decade but wanted to show my partner the place I used to frequent when I lived here. It didn't disappoint at all! Still the same amazing lunch buffet for a decent price. 

There were three dishes, rice, pakora, naan, salad and sauces for you to enjoy. Dessert was £1 so we skipped it as we were already full anyway. The food was delicious. My partner didn't think much of it when I was describing it to her and how this was where we used to go for lunch meetings. But she was sold after her first bite. 

I'm not even a vegetarian and I love this place. They're so creative with the dishes too. If you're looking for standard dishes you know like spinach paneer or something, you'll be disappointed. But if you're open minded and want the chefs in the back to surprise you, come give it a try! Today's most unique thing was the lotus leaf dish. It was sweet and sour with a bit of heat to it. I thought it was weird but in a good way so I had a few pieces. 

The chai was also delicious. I loved how the sugar and cream/milk was on the side so you could make it to your liking.

We might come back one more time before we leave town.
