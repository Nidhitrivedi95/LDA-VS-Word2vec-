UmcOChw3fm-GgbpK2o_t5w Major points for being perhaps the only place in Scarborough open til MIDNIGHT!

PLUS:
* delicious food-- we recommend the lamb with chickpeas (or okra), the chicken tikka (dry), the spinach-potatoe side.
* nice atmosphere, Indian (not pop/disco) music on the sound system
* clean bathrooms (as mentioned by another reviewer)
* complimentary mini after-dinner drinks served with the bill(!)
* if you are REALLY hungry, the meals for 2 are a good value-- 2 entrees, 2 starters, a side, naan & rice for only 23. Would have been too much food for us; we had same but no starters and total was under 18 before drinks!
* very friendly service; felt very welcome and never rushed, despite arriving around 11pm and being the last diners to leave. 

SUGGESTIONS:
* lose the green food coloring included in some dishes (the garlic naan & the yogurt lassi dressing served with salad garnish)
* indicate which dishes are spicy, or that you could request some dishes more spicy.
