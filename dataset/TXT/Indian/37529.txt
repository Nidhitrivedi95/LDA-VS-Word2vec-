OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A This is my 2nd time here and both times ive tried the thalli plate. Everything ive eaten here is delicious and easy to digest. The staff/owners are friendly, the resto is small but very close to everything and not expensive. We are now regulars for life. I just ended my meal and already cant wait for next time!
