TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Finally went here for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed.  Great service, liked the decor and most importantly the food was great.  And you cannot beat the price of $9.99!  Another Indian lunch buffet that I like is Tandoori but this place is equivalent and cheaper.  Thanks Namaste!
