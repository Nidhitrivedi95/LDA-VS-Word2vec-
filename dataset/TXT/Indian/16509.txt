DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA This review is based on the lunch buffet only.  This place has easily one of the top 3 Indian buffets in Cleveland!

They have a huge selection of Indian and Indo-Chinese food to pick from on the buffet.  Everything from the typical warm, fluffy naan, vegetable fritters, Tandoori Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Chicken Briyani to Szechuan Lamb, Mongolian chicken, Chili Pepper Chicken, and these fried fish things.  They also have soup, and bread pudding, kheer (rice pudding), fruit custard, and fresh fruit for dessert.   The buffet includes a dosa station where you have your choice or 6 or so dosa varieties that are made right in front of you!  Dosas are a large, thin crepe rolled up with savory ingredients like paneer, curry potatoes, masala, or a number of other fillings that I have yet to try.  They offer two kinds of dipping sauces to accompany your dosa.

Although Tadka is a chain restaurant, it really is good and the variety of dishes offered on the buffet can't be beat!  Each time I've gone, the place has been filled with Indian customers, so you KNOW it's a good place! :P

Service is great in that they clear your plates and refill your water quickly.  The decor is really snazzy and modern looking and the restaurant is very clean.  The weekend lunch buffet is a bit more than other Indian buffets around Cleveland at $15, (used to be $13) but the variety of dishes makes it worth it! 

I'm glad I don't live closer, or I'd come here more often and start packing on the pounds rather quickly!
