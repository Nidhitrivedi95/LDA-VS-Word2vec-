V65Ffj_EDwOn75WcknbUdg Food court location that has some seating inside as well. Food is okay. Had the butter chicken which is about $10 and my friend had the chicken tikka masala. To be honest, they both kinda tasted the same. 

The first couple of bits were good, but for some reason there was water collecting at the bottom of the bowl. Maybe the rice had too much residual water or the butter chicken sauce broke.
