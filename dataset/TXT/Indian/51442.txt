UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Surprising good for an inexpensive lunch buffet (was $10.50 before taxes and tips). Food choice was limited but tasty. They cook your bread to order (included) and my buttered naan was appropriately fresh, hot, a soft and tasty. Soup, salads, entrees and dessert were all quite good and it's no surprise I guess that a good part of the crowds were Indians! I ordered a masala chai (supplement) that was also very nice.
