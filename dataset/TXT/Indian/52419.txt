UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg In town on a business trip and wanted something vegetarian not too far from hotel.  It is generally easier to eat vegetarian looking at Thai or Indian food and this place came up.  Not great reviews but surprisingly few options for a large city.
Called ahead for the Channa Masala and garlic naan.  Guy was a little hard to understand but very friendly.
The lady helping me was also very friendly and, when I told her I needed a plastic spoon because I was staying in hotel, she hurried back and got me utensils, plate and extra napkins.
The Channa was very spicy (like I requested) and tasty.  A little too much oil but overall good.  Naan was very good (with fresh Cilantro) but it was only one smallish piece.
3.5 stars for food, 4.5 for service.
