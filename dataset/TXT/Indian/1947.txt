-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ Every nice family restaurant. I had sweet lassi,  muttar paneer and chicken tikka kabab. The lassi was good, the muttar paneer was okay and the chicken tikka could have been better. The service was really good and efficient. The sweet were over priced and no guarantee how old they are.
