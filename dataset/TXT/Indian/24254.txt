gXLiBVCHIqoPEw2CaP3QmQ I went to this restaurant last week to check out what specials this place can offer..As soon as we entered, my friend spotted mutton paya on the today's special board. I could not stop myself as I am a big lover of goat and lamb meat. We ordered dosas and chicken biriyani along the paya
First came dosas with roti pachadi and coconut chutney.. roti pachadi was so yummy that we finished off half of our dosas before he could get the sambar and paya.. seriously guys roti pachadi was worth selling in a jar..
Then the paya.. delicious.. right amount of spice and heat.. good proportion.. I had a big smile on my face when I finished off my dosa with it
Then came the biriyani. It was not bad but not the best in town
