yD2jmBrBPbLJ2yN3lQQHjw Thinking we were having Chinese food it turned out to be Hakka.  Service was very slow we had to ask for water and utensils. Food was ok. I have had better. Would I go back?? Not really. 
The manchurian fish was the best. The lamb did not taste like lamb. So God knows what it was.
