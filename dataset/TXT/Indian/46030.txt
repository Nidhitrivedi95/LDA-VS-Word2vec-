SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg Fast-casual Indian food that unfortunately totally missed the mark the night we tried it...overall a disappointing experience, and I had such high hopes after a few glowing reviews from friends who had been there.

The naan we ordered was taken out of a tray and reheated on a flattop giving it a somewhat soggy/chewy consistency instead of that charred/crisp outside you'd normally expect.

The samosa we tried was baked (not fried) so it was kind of mushy, but the potato and spice filling was tasty.

Our Paneer Tikka roll with Palak (Spinach) Masala was tasty and is something I might try again.  The chicken Tikka Masala was okay, sauce was not as flavorful as I expected (too much rice in the bowl relative to the meat and sauce combination).  The lamb meatballs with Palak Masala and yogurt riata was the best dish of those we sampled, although it had a distinct Greek (not Indian) flair to it.

I'm pretty sure I'll give this spot another try as I really want this place to succeed, given the lack of interesting (and diverse) eating spots around town.
