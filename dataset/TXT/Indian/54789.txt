wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw My wife, daughter and I were looking for a great Indian Restaurant in Scottsdale. And find it we did.  Atmosphere, location and ambiance were all great.  Even had Ballywood on the screen over the bar.  There is a variety of seating which is nice for different sized groups.  The food is truly 5 stars.  We had plain naan, veggie samosas, raita, panir masala and veggie kofta.  The service was good, and the owner and staff were all very nice.  It was great to find such a nice place in downtown!
