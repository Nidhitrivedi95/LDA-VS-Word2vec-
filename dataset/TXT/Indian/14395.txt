C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I was so lucky I walked into Kalendar when I did last night. After waiting 20 minutes in the rain for a southbound Bathurst streetcar that never came, my husband and I decided to change plans and have him come north to College. I walked west looking for a good place to dry off and grab a glass of wine. I skipped over Negroni, just not in a sandwich mood, and fortunately found Kalendar.

There were lots of seats at the bar, so I grabbed two and was instantly greeted by my friendly bartender. I perused the wine menu and he offered me tastes of as many wines as I wanted before choosing a bottle. He was truly a gem, and warmed my heart with his kindness.

When the husband did arrive, he was soaked. Turns out the northbound streetcars were also nonexistent and he had walked from King! What a trooper! Our lovely bartender and I ensured he had some red wine to warm him. All that was left was to decide on the food.

The menu has a lot of good choices. The naan bread appetizers looked really good, as did the crepe roti dishes. A few people near us were eating them, and I was sorely tempted. Instead we opted for some mussels in a deliciously spicy sauce (I had to opt out of some of those jalepenos, though!) and a warm mushroom salad. All the food was delicious.

This place gets crowded. After I had secured the bar seats, people just started streaming in. No one seemed to wait too long for a table, but be prepared, just in case. Kalendar is a popular place and now I know why
