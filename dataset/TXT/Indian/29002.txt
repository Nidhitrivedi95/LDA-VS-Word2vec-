jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q I wouldn't recommend this Indian restaurant.. I knew it they don't know how to cook meat dishes but friend of mine wants to try.. worse lamb gosh and lamb karahi I never had before.. worst place wasting money on meat dishes. I believe they use same spices and recipes for every single meat dishes all I have to say just don't waste your money on meat dishes.. lamb karahi just boiled meat and big piece of tomato and onions and excat same dish lamb josh and you never find out about both dishes what you eating lamb josh or lamb karahi.
