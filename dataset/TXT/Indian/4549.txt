1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg Funny, always thought about this place as Briyani House, and not Suski Briyani House.  All good...  I'm yelping about the same place that I've gone to several times.

Was there again today, and again enjoyed the same thing I always get there: their vegetarian thali.  For $5.99, you could get a choice of 3 veg curries, plain basmati rice or naan, rice pudding, and some lentil dhal.  Portions (for someone with a heavy appetite) could have been larger, but for the average person, people seemed satisfied with portion sizes.  

The quality of the curries was good  - hit the spot!  You can't go wrong for $5.99.  ($6.99 for non-veg.  Hubby had one of those and was pretty happy).

Service was fast.  We had a commitment later this afternoon.  Eating here, saved us on some sweet time.

O.k.  About to say something unofficially racist here (but positive) - saw several others of South Asian decent, eat here.  From different social circles.  Just saying, if it's good enough for people who grew up with this culture, it's good enough for me, too!
