gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I relied on yelp reviews and made a trip to this place all the way from Las Vegas strip.. It's not that far.. It took me just 10 mins by cab ($16).. I came in for lunch buffet and I didn't like what I saw so I asked if I can order ala carte but sadly that don't allow that. I arrive bit early and the food labels on the buffet were wrong. Samosa was good and so was the naan but rest of the stuff was disappointing. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
