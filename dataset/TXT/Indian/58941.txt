YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A I ordered the vegan: dal makhani, aloo gobi (cauliflower potato), pakoras and baingan bharta (eggplant). I got all mild, but I would've called it "medium" since the heat overtook any subtler flavours there may have been. 

I've had Indian food in little India, India, and gourmet Indian like Dawat in NYC. Honestly, I don't think any Indian food in Toronto is that great. 

I liked that the peas were fresh-ish in the eggplant, and that you could taste fresh ginger, but it was all very oily. My fave item was probably the pakoras, though I'd prefer them air-fried. I do tend to prefer South Indian cuisine, but this place was ok. They could work on subtler, complex flavours, less oil and adding even more fresh stuff to the dishes -- top the dal with chopped tomato and cilantro (and add some coriander seed, like, way more to the dal, it was bland!). 

Portions for takeaway I found huge.
