VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw I figured since they added a buffet today, I might as well write an update.

As you might gather from my earlier review, I don't particularly care for the Indian buffet.  As such, I was a little concerned when we walked into Taj Mahal today and they told us the lunch buffet would be available for the first time today.  We decided, what the heck, we'll give it a try.

The first thing I noticed is they did not have a whole lot of selection at the buffet.  A positive sign!  They had rice, a chicken dish, a potato and cauliflower dish, Tandoori chicken, a lentil soup, some deep fried vegetables, chutney, rice pudding, yogurt, and maybe one or two other options (they bring the naan directly to your table).  I loaded up my plate with some of everything.

It became clear to me as I was eating that the buffet food did not lose any of the attention they place on the old lunch specials (which I'm not sure if they still offer).  The chicken dish had a delicious sauce, which holds its own against the old lunch specials.  The tandoori chicken was the best I've had; the flavors permeated all the way down to the bone.

I'm not sure I like it better than the old lunch specials... I really could've used some of their awesome chicken korma (I mentioned to my coworker that if they had the korma lunch special today, I just might have to order two).  I did leave thinking it was the best Indian buffet I've had, and I hope for their sake this move pays off.
