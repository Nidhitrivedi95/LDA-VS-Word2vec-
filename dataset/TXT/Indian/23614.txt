gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Lunch buffet was good - can't say it was the best indian food i ever had -But good. We got there around 1 saturday afternoon-  waited for a table just a few minutes. Every thing was good - is it possible foods were heavier than other indian restaurants? I thought the foods were heavier. They did not serve garlic nan - just regular nan - disappointed a little bit. I would recommend this place  - good place for something different  - but i don't think i would come back soon.
