aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q I don't think I have much to add. It's small and you'd probably pass this place a billion times and not notice unless you were a careful student of Yelp. You'd probably also assume it specialized in subs. But inexpensive, no nonsense burritos are its forte. I had one chicken and one beef burrito (medium spicy... you get to pick). Each was under $4. The chicken I favor over the beef. They use ground beef vs pulled. But all 'n ' all both were a nice size for a nice price. My only gripe was it was -14c the day I went and the place did not appear to have any heat on. Maybe their grill was the establishment's only source of heat. It was damn cold. But you can't beat the price.
