scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Delicious flavor and very friendly service! It's always the same 2 gentleman working there. They are on top of refilling water and taking away dirty plates. We always go for the lunch buffet. I'm a vegetarian and they always have at least 3 vegetarian main dishes available each time we've gone(some are listed as vegan too). There is always 1 plain naan and a specialty naan(spinach, coconut) at the buffet. Lots of natural light & high ceilings. You don't leave there smelling like Indian spices. The lunch buffet is $9.95 but pay cash and get 10% off.
