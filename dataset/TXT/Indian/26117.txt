Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw My boyfriend brought some Indian food the other night and it was so good we wanted to have some again the very next day. So I Yelped for another place in our neighbourhood to try and decided to try Banajara. We ordered the same exact dishes we had the previous night. Despite our appetites whet for our food to arrive, we were really disappointed at the difference in quality compared to the first place we ordered food from. It just wasn't the same. Big womp. I might try their lunch buffet for the price, but for what we paid for dinner I highly recommend Marigold instead. Same neighbourhood, same price range, big difference.
