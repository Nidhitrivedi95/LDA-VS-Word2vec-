xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I thought it was quite good. Los Angeles has almost every type of food, but fry bread is hard to find. The bread did not look or taste overly greasy. I got the green chili bowl and my dad got the red chili bowl. Both were flavorful and pretty spicy. The beef in both chilis was very lean and tender. The red chili had more meat but maybe it's because that's basically the only visible ingredient. The green chili had other ingredients such as strips of green chili and onions, etc. The bowls looked small but by the time we finished them, along with 1.5 pieces of fry bread each, we were stuffed.
