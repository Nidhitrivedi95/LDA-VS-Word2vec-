yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw We have returned to the Dhaba several times since my 1 star review and I'm a bit embarrassed to discover that I have not updated my review until now.  Restaurants can have bad days and after visiting Dhaba on multiple occasions since my last review, I'm convinced I caught them on an "off night". food and service in our subsequent visits has brought as back to Dhaba as regular customers and we would recommend this Indian restaurant to anyone looking for a place to call their favorite! 
The past several times we've been here, the food has been great and the staff is friendly and helpful.  We love the papadum with the trio of chutneys that are served complimentary while deciding what to order.  The korma is wonderful as are the tandoori and vegetarian dishes we've had.  The Indian spices are spot on and the naan is so good that we always need another order.   We like our food spicy, but for those of you who like a more mild dish, Dhaba will customize your order to please.  Dhaba has become our favorite Indian restaurant in the valley and we dine her regularly.
