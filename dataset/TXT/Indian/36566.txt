NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Tried some takeout recently.  The aesthetics of the restaurant and website really impressed me.  I appreciate the spacious, uncluttered feel of the dining area, and I really like that the online menu has a photo of every item.  I would have given 4 stars if they had the prices and descriptions to go along with the photos.

I tried the veggie croquette meal (rice, wheat naan, tikka masala soup), and had mixed feelings.  The soup, naan, and sauces were all really good, but the main dish itself was pretty blah.  My meal came with several sauces, and I ended up dumping most of them on my rice.  I don't know which one was hot, but one of them was really, really hot.  My husband loved his chicken sandwich, but said he didn't think it was worth the price (I think about $6-7, but I'm not sure since the website doesn't give prices).  The samosas were decent, but not life changing.
