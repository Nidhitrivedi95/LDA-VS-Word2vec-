Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ I'm not sure why this place hasn't gotten more reviews. This was my first Indian restaurant in Montreal and was hesitant because I'm wasn't sure how it would turn out. The food was really good. We asked for it spicy and boy was it spicy! Usually b Indian restaurant cater to their demographic audience but Singh made sure it was authentic. The service was phenomenal and took care of you. I had an issue with the meter and the guy as the front came out and explained it to me. Only knocking it one star because their service size was on the smaller size but was still plenty. Their naans were really small though. My family and I, at other Indian restaurants only order 3 naan and we will be stuffed, here we had to order 5. Both overall, the service was good, decor was decent and food was tasty. If you had to choose between this restaurant and darbar down the street, go with Singh's. Darbar was garbage and the owner was unprofessional.
