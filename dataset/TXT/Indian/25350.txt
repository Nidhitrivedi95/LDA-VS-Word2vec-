HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A I had the lunch buffet today and really curved my craving for good Indian food.  The people complaining about the staff must have been here before the management corrected it.  Even though I had the self serve buffet, the staff was attentive to clear used plates and refill beverages at all the tables.  The food was tasty and I look forward to the full dinner menu.
