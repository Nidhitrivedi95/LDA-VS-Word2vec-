YS4RsAaaw_KYYjnHnLD3OA Very attentive service by our waiter and checked up on us constantly to fill out water, checked if everything was good, and gave us freshly made naan. Food wise I can't handle spicy foods well, so I wouldn't be able to vouch for the authenticity of it, but I enjoyed it. The number of items for the buffet were on the lower side but it's still a great deal for dinner at $14.99 per person. The whole buffet area as well as the dining area was clean. I would definitely come back again.
