jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Love this place!! Me and my home girl decided to check this place out since we havent seen each other since high school.... the food was great and i got the mango lasees which I always have to have.... when our food came I wasn't expecting it to be alot so of course too it home ..

Later after we ate... we sat outside at their patio tables outside the resturant because it was a beautiful day.... then the owner came to greet us and informed us about some feature dishes.... (oh FYI  try there red house sauce... its bomb!) .... me and my friend kept chatting away and she let us try their chai tea.... which love chai tea not that bootleg kind from starbucks.... definitely will come back and try the other dishes...
