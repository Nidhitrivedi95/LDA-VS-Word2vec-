The service is quick, though they tend to serve everything you've ordered all at once, so be prepared to wait if you've made a large order.

We have a habit of ordering way too much food. We got the salmon and chicken tikka, the lentils, the eggplant, the okra, the fish and prawn masala, and the chicken methi complete with garlic naan, plain naan, and rice. All of the dishes are served in deceptively small bowls that hold quite sizeable portions. The prawn masala, for example, came with around 10 prawns, which is quite generous! The chicken methi was also a highlight of the meal, with quite a unique flavour thanks to the herbs that they use.

You'll want to make a reservation at this place, as there were several parties waiting at the door throughout the evening.
