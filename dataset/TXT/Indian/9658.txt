8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw For super quick and super cheap Indian, this is it.

Best thing: it's $5. I don't mean $5, plus tax. I mean you hand them a $5 bill, take your trough of Indian food, and go on your merry way.

Here's the deal:
Option One: chicken + one vegan side
Option Two: three vegan sides
All options come with rice and bread (would call it a "fluffy" version of naan)

They also have treats like samosas and byrani rice once in a while.  I guess it's on some sort of set schedule, but I can't remember it (besides, that isn't as fun as walking in to see what they have made that day!)

I'm no vegan, but their vegan dishes are amazing (and spicy!)

Tomato lentils is by far my favorite
