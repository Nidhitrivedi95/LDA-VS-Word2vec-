S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA If you want to feel utterly stuffed, check out this lunch buffet! They have so many delicious items, you can't help but try them all. The service was fabulous, the man working there was super nice. They have my favorite Indian dessert (the rice pudding...yum!). I only wish some of their curries were spicier (but I understand that's not the nature of the buffet, I'll have to return for dinner).  I'd definitely recommend this place for their lunch buffet!
