O6RnkQnuVyRTXk4e_tADPw With it's swanky lago, clean and crisp interior and the odd incense stick burning away on the counter, The Curry Leaf is a refreshing alternative to your usual take-away curry. Out of ideas and with little patience to cook for myself I've opted for The Curry Leaf's classic lamb rogan josh on many occasion, followed by their light and fluffy naan breads.

The classic dishes are inexpensive and with a home delivery service I see no reason to claim that The Curry Leaf offers everything you could possibly want from a Indian take-away service. 

Top stuff.
