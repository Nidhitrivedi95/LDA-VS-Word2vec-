B688h3t2vq78EjGxt799fw Authentic Indian food ! 5/5 for taste great dishes like butter chicken, and chicken curries korma and vindaloo (very spicy). Yummy white chicken breast meat and generous portions for very decent prices! We went before closing and the food and naan was very fresh tasting! 
Service was good, friendly !
Took some time to prepare the food but given how yummmy it was I didn't mind! Left some time for conversation with company which is always good! 

Give it a try! 
Ps more of a fast food feel, many customers come in for take out, heard a lot of phone orders! Give it a try you won't be disappointed !
