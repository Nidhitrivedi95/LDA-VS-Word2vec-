Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I read the reviews of this place before coming and found it interesting that there was such a spread of opinions.  My experience with yelp reviews has been that they tend to clump together around a mutually-agreed upon rating but this one had people who loved it and people who hated it.  My fellow diner and I agreed that 3.5 stars is just about the correct rating though.

Impressions: The place is nicely decorated with low light and soft music.  It is upstairs in a a grim looking food court in the back of a low-rent outdoor shopping center.  It has a nice ambiance once inside though.  We went for the lunch buffet.  

Pros: Very friendly and attentive staff.  My water glass never reached the half-way empty mark.  
Plenty of vegetarian selections in the buffet
The chicken tikka masala and a paneer curry (I missed the name) were both very good

Cons: the daal was overly salty
Some dishes were just okay and not spectacular

Overall we had a nice lunch here but I've had better Indian buffets in the Bay Area.  In the midst of a sea of burgers and undercooked pizza slices however this is a welcomed change.
