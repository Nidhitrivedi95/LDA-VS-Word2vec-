jjkreMAvH3DWtk7mvASmEw There must have been some misunderstanding at the cash last time. I remember paying less for the meal I got last time & getting 2 pieces of naan instead of 1. The business owner, a very nice man who was handling the cash last night, helped clarify the deal for me: $7.99 + tax for veggie platter with the choice of 1 naan OR two roti (to add any meat it's $8.50). There must have been a mix-up before & maybe I got an extra naan on the house...

For now, I'm not too pleased with the quality, the quantity & the preparation of the veggie platter I bought yesterday (tasteless, not fresh, less food). I'm also not pleased with constantly being asked to pay extra for everything (buy a samosa, pay extra for chutney..buy a pizza slice, pay extra for sauce). Some prices I consider a bit too high relative to what is being offered ($3.25 + tax for a pepperoni pizza slice plus you have to pay extra for dip, $8.99 + tax walk-in "special?" is not exactly a great deal for a large pizza with only ONE topping - 3 months ago it was $7.99 https://www.zomato.com/toronto/student-pizza-and-curry-north-york-gta/menu). 

There are other small things that have irritated me too like not keeping their fridge stocked with cold pop, in which place, you need to either cancel, choose something different or wait for them to go in the back & grab you a warm can. It's a tiny inconvenience but it still adds up over time. When there's other businesses around the corner that offer Indian cuisine and fast food, it's not in your best interest to inconvenience your patrons. When I finally go back to try the Indian food options I'll make sure to go during the day when things are fresher & also request to make the onions in the salad smaller or leave them out.

P.S. Sorry for all these #firstworldproblems but a review is a review. Hoping they can work on these things in order to provide a better overall customer experience.
