eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg When I lived in the area, I would come by here for dinner, and occasionally lunch.

The buffet at lunch is ok.  Nothing stands out and grabs you and says "THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER TASTED", but by far none of it is bland.  It is a buffet so my bar is not incredibly high.

For dinner, I have never been disapointed.  The curry is spicy, the masala is sweet and delicious.

My only true complaint about the place is the decor and the music.  I have come in on a few occassions and the place looks dirty, or the Bollywood Best is cranked up to the point of annoying.
