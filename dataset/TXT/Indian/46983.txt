t4Keeuv3zkLShSgYSRYmdw I have lived on the street for two years and always passed this place. I finally decided to stop by for lunch. 

Ordered the boneless chicken roti. It was fast and had decent sized portions. There was a woman complaining that hers was not properly cooked. Mine had a darker pink colour but it was definitely fully cooked.  I assume it is just from using dark meat. Nothing special to be honest but its cheap. Probably won't be back any time soon.
