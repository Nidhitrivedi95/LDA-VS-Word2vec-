LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA The best dosa spot! 
But on top of that, the absolute best family run business! 

So before I review the food and place, let me start by saying that my family has been Guru Lukhsmi customers for over 10+ years. Originally, this couple had a small shop on Dundas (basement style) surrounded by commercial shops. You would get your food, and bring it out and eat at the 4-5 seats they had setup. Forward a few years, they moved to an Erin Mills location with a proper sit down area and they started to get bigger. The lines started to get longer, but the business was still family run and cooked- and food never changed a taste. 

Forward another few years, and now you have this good size restaurant in the heart of Derry Plaza, which easily runs an hour long wait on evenings and gathers large crowds of People during the toasty summer nights. 

Well, let me tell you- the restaurant is STILL family run, in house cooked, and still phenomenal.

It is well worth the 45 minute wait, however you can make reservations now so you could skip that crowd if you plan ahead. 

What to eat: if you haven't tried it yet, the pao Bhaji dosa is a must. It's extremely heavy and can be shared among 2 people. But it is delicious. Also love the Mysore masala dosa, which is your regular potato stuffed dosa with spices. 
My parents love their idlis as an appetizer,which they say are extremely soft and they cannot get that texture when making it at home. 
They do have some serious quirky takes on dosa as well, and I've had the opportunity to try the paneer dosa, but I love the authentics. 

Restaurant: started from the bottom now they here! Literally, they have come a long way and now the restaurant has a beautiful well setup seating area sizzling with South Indian aromas and warmth from the moment you step in. 

If you haven't been yet, go check it out as you won't get this good food unless you find yourself in the South of India :)
