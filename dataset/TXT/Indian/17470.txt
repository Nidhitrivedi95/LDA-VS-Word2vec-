DPsbhgdHty--Jegj_yNaUQ I've eaten way too much Indian and Thai food for one lifetime, but I ain't slowing down. Nice staff; large but comfy seating, tasty lassis.
Sometimes their pakoras are a bit dry but baingon bhurta, malai kofta, saag paneer? Super yummy!!
Wish their chai was a liiiittle bit thicker/creamier like in India :)
