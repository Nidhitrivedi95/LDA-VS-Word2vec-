zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Oh my, could there be Afghan grandma's in the back cooking up all that food? Home-cooking ain't got nothing on this place... unless the cook(s) here are in your home kitchen.

We had a table for 7 and everyone was beyond satisfied. Kabobs, fried fish, veggies and more were had by all. Recommend the Uzbeki Pulao *wink, wink*

Came here visiting family, and so sad that we're not in the state regularly enough to be their sole source of income lol
