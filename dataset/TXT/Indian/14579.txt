C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw A great find on Queen Street!  Excellent flavor in both the chicken kothu-roti and chicken tikka masala.  The owner was very helpful in explaining the menu and making sure to make the order mild.  I was apprehensive from other reviews to go for medium.   However, for me, mild was too mild.  Will order medium next time, for an extra kick in flavor and heat!
