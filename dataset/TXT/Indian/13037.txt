b4LxjVnFdOCqRKxfweaTqw Delicious food and quality service every time. Options for the whole family, but my husband and I do come sometimes on our own when we start craving the food!  My favorites are the chicken mugalai and the biryani. Wait staff is very gracious, explain choices and keep you apprised of food status. Manager/owner always visits tables to ensure everything is as expected. Restaurant is fresh and clean.
