BmFStvt6hs77XmYR7zmHtQ The menu is very confusing. Rice is consider as a main item.  The food was okay but there is no consistency with items on the menu.  I had an eggplant masala once and never seen it on the menu again.  I asked about it  and the owner said that eggplant was too expensive to buy from the supermarket so they stopped making it.  

Naan bread was pretty good but expensive individually. Chicken curry was a bit too greasy.
