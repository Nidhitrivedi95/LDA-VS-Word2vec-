GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg This is the weirdest review footer me to write.

We ordered three items.

None of them tasted as they should. None seemed authentic Pakistani.

One item labeled spicy was not. Another labeled mild was quite spicy.

Yet we still liked the food! It may not be authentic by south Asian standards but putting that aside it was good food.

Also no washrooms!
