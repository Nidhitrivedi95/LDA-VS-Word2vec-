UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I've ordered from here before and always had a pretty good experience which is why I decided to try it again. The biggest disappointment was that our food took two hours to be delivered...and this is after calling at the 1 1/2 hour mark to inquire where it was, so it took yet another half an hour after that. The food was warm, not hot. The rice (saffron) was nasty and almost had a chemical taste to it. I ordered all dishes to be made with medium spice and it all came obviously mild and bland...yes, this Indian food was bland. I didn't know that was even possible. Anyways, never again. I'll stick to my local Indian place that unfortunately doesn't deliver, but is worth the effort to get quality food and service.
