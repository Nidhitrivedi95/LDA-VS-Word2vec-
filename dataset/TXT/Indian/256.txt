-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g This is BY FAR the best Indian food restaurant in Tempe. The Tandoori Chicken Saag is my ultimate favorite but their Lamb Saag is great as well as their Lamb Korma, Lamb Rogan Josh, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala ... ok, I could go on but, I'll spare you. 

For appetizers - try their Samosa Chaat - it's so fresh and flavorful. 

I saw someone else comment that their tomato soup wasn't good and I highly disagree! It too is super fresh and flavorful. It's definitely on the spicy side so that may be why it wasn't up their alley.

I've been frequenting Nandini since it was Royal Taj (so for about 3 years now) and I've never been disappointed in the food or service (both are just wonderful). I've tried other Indian restaurants in the area and not one holds a candle to Nandini's level of cuisine. I started out being afraid of spice and have moved up to preferring my dishes "Indian Spicy." Thanks, Nandini!
