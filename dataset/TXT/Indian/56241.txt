xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA I went to check out this place after I saw it said halal on yelp. 

I went around dinner time to do a takeout and the place was decently busy. The owner at the till was very friendly and helpful in taking the order and informing us about their product and spice levels. 

Once you check in on yelp there is offer of doubles for free with your order. Although the offer was done but the owner gave it us. The restaurant itself was clean and the seating arrangement was nice.

I ordered the chicken roti, Jerk chicken dinner and the free double. The roti was nice and filled up properly and the jerk chicken was ok as I have had better spiced up jerk chicken but the portion was very good it came with rice and coleslaw. The doubles was roti filled with chickpeas. People beware for the spice level mild is medium and medium is hot and I found it the hard way.

On the halal note - They have a sign on their door, plus I inquired the owner and he stated that he buys halal meat.
