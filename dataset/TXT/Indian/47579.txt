TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw We went there on Christmas evening and just to be be precise just spoiled the dinner.
Simply unprofessional and rude. The place was dirty, people were coming and eating and food was scattered under the tables and they don't care about it. 

Had to ask 3 times to get water and silverware.
They asked to go for buffet as there was rush and order will take a lot of time. The food was cold in buffet and not refilled properly and food was not something to have 4 start rating inspite of the yucky service

I have never seen such unprofessional people and place with 4 start review in yelp.

Printing photos with celebrities on the wall doesn't make the place nice!
It needs food and service too!
