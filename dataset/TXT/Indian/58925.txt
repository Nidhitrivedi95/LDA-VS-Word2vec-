YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A A-OK pretty much sums up our experience at Bindia. 

Post Christmas Market, cold and hungry, we stumbled into Bindia after a few other restaurants on the strip rejected us because of lack of reservations. The hostess hemmed and hawed about letting us in, but eventually after a bit of a wait we did get a table - strangely enough it was the table that was empty pretty much since we got there.... 

The food at Bindia is decent! They have a large (but not overwhelming) menu, and while the prices are a bit higher than I'd like (I'm used to Brampton / suburban Indian pricing), overall I did enjoy my meal. Four of us split three mains (the palak paneer was great!), some garlic naan, and a few apps including their shrimp (which was quite good!). 

Here's an interesting fact I learned at Bindia - most Indian food is gluten free! So if you're stuck trying to figure out where to bring a GF friend, you'll have plenty of options at Bindia. They were very informed about what was GF which was very convenient!

We did get rushed out at the end of our dining experience, we lingered a bit too long and were asked to leave the table. While annoying, it was fair enough and they did offer us coupons for our next visit. Will that visit ever happen? I'm not convinced.
