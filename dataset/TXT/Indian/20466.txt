Service is left to be desired, this place is packed at lunch time, and we were placed at the end of the  restaurant where there is a cash register, and lots of hustle and bustle. The  waiter also served me and my friends food at different times, that were far apart.

Overall I was satisfied with this as a cheap non authentic Chinese restaurant.
