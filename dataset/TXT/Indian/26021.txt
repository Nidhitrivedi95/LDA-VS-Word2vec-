I3YOFwPRQB_bSY3NDUyJNw Got a taste of their food at the Bollywood Mashup at Mississauga Celebration Square.
The Masala Dosa was excellent! I don't do well with spice, but I ate the entire thing (which was a huge serving btw)
Also tried the faloota & it was good too. A bit warm, but that might have been from being in a cooler outside for the entire day.
The line up for their booth was extremely long but they burned through it pretty quickly! I was really impressed with the service; they were extremely friendly despite having 1001 people demanding food from them.
10/10 would recommend to a friend, if you're ever craving dosa go check them out!
