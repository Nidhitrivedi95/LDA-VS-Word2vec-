They have an incredible selection of rices, vegetable curries and meat curres.  The food is always hot and fresh. There's a ton of people working there, and the line ups are always so long- but the smell, taste, experience is all worth it. And can't leave out how cheap it is!!! For $10- I can eat like a Queen!
