tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g They screwed up on the spice level. My boss had ordered the spice level "7" (out of 10) and the dish was not even "-1"!! My dish was at "5" even though I order the spice level of "9"! Also, my boss' samosa was cold. Very disappointing visit!!! The service is very slow. It took almost 30+ minutes for our food to arrive (I guess they warn you about that in the fine prints on their menu!!).
