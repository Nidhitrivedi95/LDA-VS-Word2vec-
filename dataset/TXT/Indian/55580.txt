x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag This is the 2nd location of China Cottage. It is in the plaza of Walmart Super Centre.

The interior is really nice, chic and modern! 4 Stars for decoation.

The services here is so attentive and friendly! 4 Stars for that!

The food, a little disappointed. The Pepper Chicken ($9.25) as appetitzer which the waiter highly recommended is a huge disappointment! It is over cooked and dry. It  is so dry that it hurt the inside of the mouth! The waiter cannot get over that we did not enjoy this....

The Shrimp Hakka Noodle Munbai Style ($8.25) is sizable. But the taste is kind of bland. For sure not spicy. It is ok, but I am not sure I will order it again.

Food 2 stars!

They do have lunch specials for $6.75 with a lot of choices that includes a pop or spring roll or daily soup.

Accepts Visa and Mastercard.

I might give China Cottage another chance in the future. But not in a rush to go and eat there again!
