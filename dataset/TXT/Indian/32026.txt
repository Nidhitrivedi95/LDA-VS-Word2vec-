ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg Came here as part of the UYE Little India crawl.  It was a great choice!  They had mostly snacks, but any one of them could have counted as a meal.  The veggie pakora was very good and filling, but my favourite was the paneer.  Not sure the exact name, but they were like cute little fried paneer squares, and with 8 pieces for only 6 bucks!  The Dahi Bhalla was also good...and large.  It was served cold though, which surprised me (although this is common for yogurt dishes).  Fantastic flavour here for sure.

I also ordered the mouth-watering kulfi, which was served in a little rowboat and full of ice cream, noodles, creamy stuff, rose flavour, pistachios, and lots of other tasty things.  It was kind of like a rice pudding texture.  So sweet, and a perfect end to the crawl.
Luckily they have illustrated pamphlets, so you know what you're getting, and you can also specify how hot you'd like it.  

And if the mood strikes you, they also have hundreds, or perhaps thousands of Bollywood DVD's for sale!
