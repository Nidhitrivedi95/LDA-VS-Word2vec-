gJliACNKY4rK30BTMIzwsQ We made a special trip to Kismot because of how well reviewed it is, and it didn't disappoint. On our long walk there, we grabbed a few bottles of wine, and when we arrived we were seated immediately. The staff were constantly smiling as were the patrons. We ordered the garlic naan (huge), the aubergine, the sag paneer, the chicken tikka, a salad, and the pickle appetizer. The sides are each about 2 cups of food, and the chicken dish was about 3 cups. The salad was larger, composed primarily of iceberg lettuce - fine with us, we just wanted some raw vegetables. The chicken was delectably moist and the sauce was perfect. The naan came out warm and fresh. The only thing I wouldn't order again is the pickle app, which had two different kinds of pickle-based sauces (more like a tapanade), one of which was quite bitter, a delicious marmalade type spread, and something else I can't remember. It only cost 4 pounds or so, but we left most of it - being too pickle-y for us - but if you do really enjoy pickles you would probably really like it. Overall, I think our bill for two was around 35 pounds, which is completely reasonable for home cooked Indian food, served up by a local family business.
