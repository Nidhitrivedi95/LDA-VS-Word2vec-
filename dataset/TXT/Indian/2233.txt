For appetizers, we tried the Samosa Sampler and Chicken Kebab.  Both tasted great and had a unique presentation.  

For main, we tried the Rack of Lamb and Gobhi Masala accompanied with Saffron Rice, Chana Pindi and Garlic Nan. The Lamb was excellent, tender and flavorful. The Gobhi was OK. We took a chance on the Chana Pindi and unfortunately didn't like it. Comparatively, we prefer the cousin dish that is tomato-based, Chana Masala. Rice and Nan were also good. 

Service was very friendly and top of it.  You could see the open kitchen through a glass window, which we thought was cool.  To us, that meant "nothing to hide".

Overall food and experience was great, but the price point was a bit high.  You are paying more for the service and atmosphere.  I've had comparable food in less fancier places.
