kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A This is probably my third visit and all of them have been before these apps came along. Secondly on the New Years Day at 11:30ish the group of us consisting of 27 of us including kids landed on this restaurant to have our brunch buffet. It became crowded after we started and people at UMC had set up and open a section for the additional crowd. 

Tons of choice for the all vegetarian South Indian cuisine buffet. Idlis, Medu Wadas, Dosas, Goli Bhajias (fritters), Upma, Pongal, Sheeera, Curd Rice, Sambhar, Rasam, Bisi Bele Bhath.... so much and more. 

Most of the dishes I tasted were done well. The dosas Crispy, the pooris freshly fried, the rices dishes well seasoned, the sambhar little thin for my taste, the rasam tangy and spicy at the same time. The channa Masala was a surprise-unlike the Punjabi version this tasted great with different spices and a good one not to miss. 

Idlis you should miss. Were too grainy and not soft. The coffee as well which is a marquee for any South Indian restaurant was a 0.5/5 stars. 

Would come back for sure if buffets were my thing.
