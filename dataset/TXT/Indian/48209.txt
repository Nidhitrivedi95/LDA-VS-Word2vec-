TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA We went here on Saturday evening and I wanted to order Kara dosa which they did not have. We ordered mix veg dosa and tomato onion uttapam and requested they make it in ghee which they refused.We had previously come here and they had made our dosas in ghee.The sambhar was cold and when we asked for another one that was cold too.Worst sarvanna bhavan in the world.I have been to Dubai and London locations which are much better than here and have more variety of dosas.
