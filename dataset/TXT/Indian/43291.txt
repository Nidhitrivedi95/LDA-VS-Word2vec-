RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg The food at Royal India Bristo was great. But the one thing that can ruin a good meal is bad service. My wife and I were one of 3 tables and the service was still bad. Once we receive our food we pretty much didn't see out server except in passing and when it came time for the bill. I was there for dinner. I probably would have had a better experience if I would have had the lunch buffet.
