tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Wow was this a find. My girlfriend was in the mood for Indian food and found this place on Yelp so I met her there for dinner. Small little Mom and Pop place. Everyone who works there is really nice. The inside is really nice. Although it doesn't look like much on the outside but some of the best places don't. For $9 or $10 for all you can eat it is a great deal. They also have Indian beers that are not IPAs. I'm not a big fan of IPAs so for them to have something else was great. I don't remember the name of it but I would drink it again.
The buffet is great with a lot of different things to pick from. Of course we had to try the Tikka Masala which was really good. So was the garlic naan bread that they bring to the table.
We only made two trips to the buffet before we were full but it was so good you didn't want to stop eating. We will definitely be back. This goes to the top of the list as my favorite place to go for Indian food.
