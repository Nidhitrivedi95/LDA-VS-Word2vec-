jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw Walking into this place I was super confused as to wether someone is supposed to seat me or if I go to the counter or really how to even place an order. I saw no one around anywhere for at least a good minute or two. Finally a worker came out and I let her know I'd like to place a take out order. The worker who helped me along with another worker who completed my payment were not super friendly or talkative.. maybe they're not used to walk in orders.

I ended up ordering the falafel wrap with fries. The portion size was huge which I always love, but the falafel itself was just alright to me. I felt like it needed to be a bit spicer or maybe just a bit more spice in general. I also would have liked more sauce since there was barely any. (3/5) The fries weren't really anything special either, just basic steak fries. 

I think if I ever tried anything else here I'd just get delivery since the whole resturant was like a sad ghost town and super confusing.
