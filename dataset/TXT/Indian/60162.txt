To give you the true experience of India they do not have air conditioning (or at least not turned on).  30 degree celsius temperatures, 80% humidity and Indian food do not make for a comfortable dining experience.  Service was also very slow.  I had somosas and curried lamb.  If it wasn't for the delicious food they would have gotten 1 star.
