xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw A local HIT!  It was a delightful "hole in the wall" restaurant, like finding a hidden treasure  We noticed a lot of locals, so knew that was a plus!  Ordered the Indian Taco, Red Chili Taco, and the Green Chile Stew.  The fried bread tasted like a savory funnel cake.  So word to the wise, do not order when you are super hungry...my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach.  The portion is huge, so I think one taco wouldve satisfied my hunger.  One thing I regret was not making room for a dessert one.  However, I did peep out someone else's order and it looked amazing!
