KCxdy3cm7H0jXnDhhPvBYw This was my first time eating here, although I pass it all the time going to class. I got the chicken tikka masala and didn't realize how large it was going to be. Good Indian food for a good price. The people working are very nice, always a plus! I'll definitely be coming back here again to try something else.
