jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ The Jolly Diners landed at Namaste Veg Kitchen tonight.  For appetizers we had Samosa, and Kutchi Dabeli. Both were very good.  The entrees consisted of Bhatura Sabzi, Paneer Curry & Bhatura, and Aloo Paratha. We requested that all were made mild in terms of spiciness.  This establishment is mainly for take out as proved by plastic plates,  plastic cutlery(not including any knives),  and plastic water cups. One orders at the front desk. This is not really a cozy spot for a date or for a quiet family meal with good service to give mom a break.   What Namaste Veg Kitchen is however is a no frills clean place with great tasting Indian cuisine.The Jolly Diners gave a rating of 4.6 stars based soley on the food.
