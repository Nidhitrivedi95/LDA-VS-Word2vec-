XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw I am unable to determine if the current name is "taste of india" or if that is the previous name - both signs are shining together.

On the odd chance that the waitress heard my 4 year old daughter farting almost continuously the entire time we were here, the service is explainable. We had to wait an unusual amount of time for our appetizer and drinks which followed it. I kind of felt like they were avoiding the dining room or maybe could see from afar that I was suffocating.

The food was overly greasy, as though the fryer were running at half the required temperature, just like the dining room (61ish degrees. Kelvin.). It was good though. The veg biryani that my wife invariably orders all 250 times we have gotten Indian food was rather unique - totally lacking any cardamom, no smoky or spicy seasoning we have come to expect. It was more of a sweet and spicy recipe that had a great deal of large squash and mushrooms, kind of like a hibachi biryani. I preferred this recipe, wife preferred the other 249 varieties.

I ordered my eggplant "hot and spicy". I believe they took this to be an arithmetic sum, and did both hot... and spicy. Typically I wait until after my meal comes back out to write about it, as it gives me time to reflect and refine my opinion. However in this case I may not survive to tell the story, so I am writing it in the parking lot along with my will.

For the money, I was less than satisfied, but not disappointed. Will probably not return.
