tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g It is my third visit to this place and I am fairly disappointed with the service especially at night after 9pm. My friends regularly visit this place but for some reason at night the service is poor and servers try to avoid the customers because they are in a hurry for closing the restaurant. Today I had a friend visit me from columbus and I took him here but the attitude of the servers was a disappointment in itself and I really felt embarrassed. Moreover there was a thread of hair found in my friends dish which further insinuated the bad experience. No compensation was provided for the incident and even before my friend completed his food the server came in with the bill. We don't expect much but in a great place as such one should not compromise on customer service. It is very annoying for a regular customer to be treated this way at your restaurant.
