YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A Went here on a Saturday evening between shows with a group of 7. The service and food were great. The mushroom tikka masala special was really good. Everyone enjoyed their dishes.
The ambience is also very nice. Good cocktail and decent wine selection. If in the area, I would definitely eat here again.
