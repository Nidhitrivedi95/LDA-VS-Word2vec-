N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg Great addition to the food court at the Venetian. Menu is good, and will hit the spot if you are craving Indian and happen to be nearby. But not a place you would make a trip too. I had the Chicken Tikki Masala. The flavor was there, but the chicken breast was the driest I've ever had in this dish. It was white meat but it was dark in color and way too dry. Lead me to believe it is old or just really over cooked. I would probably give it another shot but it's nothing to write home about.
