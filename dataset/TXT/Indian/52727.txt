Uyw1pJ03kt-I1B_tkA3aFg On my first visit I called my order in and still had a 25 min wait once I arrived. I only stuck around because I was set on Indian food. Glad I waited because the mixed veggies and naan were great. 2nd visit, called it in and still had a 15 min wait. I ordered the same dish and it was nothing like what I had the first time. For the mixed veggies they used totally different vegetables which included broccoli and cauliflower, not good because they cooked it too long and the veggies turned mushy and the dish was much smaller. I won't be going back.
