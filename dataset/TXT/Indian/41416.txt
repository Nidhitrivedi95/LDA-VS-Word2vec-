Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w I have had great experiences at this restaurant. I have only been for dinner and have not tried the lunch buffet.

My husband and I have been here four or five times since January, and the staff always greet us happily and provide excellent service. The restaurant also serves halal meat

Some of our favorite dishes are the tandoori mushroom appetizer and the palak kofta. We've also enjoyed the lamb dishes- including a recent lamb chop special that was delicious. I like the masala chai very much (and they frequently offer refills!) We also love the chutney appetizer that is always provided before dinner. 

One warning is that the food is very spicy. I am sensitive to spice but can tolerate the "medium" spice level at most restaurants. The "medium" level at Maharaja is too hot for me. In fact, the first time I visited I ordered a medium vegetable curry but could hardly eat it. The waiter saw my eyes watering and re made the dish for me as mild. I always get mild now!
