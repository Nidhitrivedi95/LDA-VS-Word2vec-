kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Very mediocre food.  I get it's trying to cater to the indian food novice, but really, what's the point?  Authentic flavors refined?  C'mon, you don't need to go overboard on the garam masala and ghee but the lack of "bombay spice" was very evident.  There are far better indian places that offer quality food for the same price or less.
