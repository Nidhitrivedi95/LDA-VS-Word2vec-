86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ We went on Saturday night, after reading reviews on Yelp and in the Toronto Star.  We ordered the garlic balls, dal, chana masala, and chicken tikka masala.  The garlic balls were amazing.  They tasted kind of like a pakora that had been rolled in a delicious sauce.  The dal and chana were very well seasoned, and pleasantly spicy (nice heat, but you could still taste the flavours).  I did not try the chicken, but my husband felt that the chicken was fine, but that the vegetarian dishes were standouts.

Service was very attentive, and very friendly.  We had a ton of food, and took home enough leftovers fro two big lunches, and the bill was less than $50.  We will definetly be returning!
