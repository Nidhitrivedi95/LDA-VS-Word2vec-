LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg I have to admit, i've been staring at Tuk Tuk for AGES. Finally, we found ourselves in the area, looking for food before a Fringe show, and I took the opportunity to rush towards Tuk Tuk. Turns out everyone else had the same idea too, and the place was heaving. However, we were promised a table in 10mins, and ushered to the 'bar' area. Bemusedly, we were shown into what appeared to be a storage area full of tins of chickpeas and other dry goods, and a spare chair. Sitting down, the SR leaned over, suggesting 'this may take longer than 10mins' as we stared out into the busy dining area. 

keeping myself amused, I started to check out the goods around me, thinking idly it would be very easy to nip out with a tin of chick peas and mango puree, when my gaze dropped to the floor. As I am a crazy hamster owner, my brain started to wonder why there were hamster poops all over the floor, then logic kicked in.... and we shot straight out of dodge. 

I guess - it's one thing for a restuarant to be infested with mice and you don't see it - it's another to be surrounded by it. This definitely goes under the header 'Avoid'.
