5mG8NptNZtvOJv1wriHCCA 'Spice Cafe' was the very first restaurant I've been to, after getting hitched and moving to Charlotte. Some very good memories in here. Can't help it, if I'm being a bit baised.. :)

On a serious note, we were in Charlotte for about five months and the best 'Chicken Biryani' I've ever tasted is here. If you are in Charlotte, craving for some good Biryani then this is the place to be.
The buffet on the weekends is great too.They have a wide variety of both Veg/Non-Veg dishes on the menu. 

The serving people(waiters) are usually university students working part time and they are a bit amateur, otherwise the staff is very hospitable and the service is good.
 The 'Chef' occasionally hops out of the kitchen to interact with the diners, only during the non-busy hours though.That was cool.

After moving from Charlotte, we've been to several other restaurants and I can still vouch for the best 'Chicken Biryani' here. Definitely worth it!!
