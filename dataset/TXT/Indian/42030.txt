uhh...I THINK NOT!!!

If i could give a 0 i would.

My friend and I ordered take out for dinner yesterday. We ordered the Dhal soup, Saag Paneer, Mutter Paneer, 2 plain naans and pulao. There was only 1 group in the restaurant. 

-food at the buffet was not fresh
-the guy taking our order was rude
-ripped us off! my friend's bill was suppose to come up to max $17, but he charged over $20
-some stuff on the menu wasn't even spelt properly (c'mon...even I know the spelling, jeeze)
-when we ordered the Dhal soup, he took it from the buffet and just warmed it up instead of making it fresh
-$3.99 FOR RICE!?!?!?!?!? WHAT THE HECK!?!?!?!?!?!?!? how can that be way more expensive then the veggie samosas!?!?!? C'MON...RICE!?!?!?!!?
-Dhal soup was not even soup! it was SO thick!!
-Saag paneer and mutter paneer was CRAP! paneer was too firm
-the only thing good was the naan
-ohh and get this...when we ordered, he asked us "would you like it not spicy or indian spicy. we answered....indian spicy...we like our food very spicy....the result....NOT EVEN THE LITTLEST HINT OF SPICINESS!!

-honestly, me and my friend agreed it was like eating BABY FOOD. everything was basically MUSH!

-Bill came up to $35...NOT WORTH IT!!! 

WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE..
