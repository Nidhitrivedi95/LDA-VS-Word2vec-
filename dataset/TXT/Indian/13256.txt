BA13Ogw1hQV8hx376j-B-w Pleasantly surprised.  There was a chicken place in here, then another Hakka place called Hakka tonight which was not so good.  We went in very hesitant and tried the Dry Chilli Chicken and the Chicken and Shrimp Chow Mein.  

We went back and had the Manchurian Chicken (wet) and the Crispy Beef.  Exceptional good quality for such an unassuming place.

It's a mom and pop operation but the food really was exceptional for the price they charge.  Full of flavour and taste.

Decor is lacking a bit of ambience but hopefully that changes as they get more successful.

If they keep the quality and taste up I can see this place being a regular for us.
