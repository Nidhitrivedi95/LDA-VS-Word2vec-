Good service
VERY fresh food. In our butter chicken and vindaloo dish, the chicken was SOOO scrumptious, tender and juicy. This is how you know it was made to order and cooke to perfection. At a lot of indian restaurants the chicken is an afterthought. 

Crispy delicious fresh naan here as well to go with thei bomb diggity butter chicken. Highly recommended!
