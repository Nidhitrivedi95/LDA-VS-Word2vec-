1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg I've been to dinner, and taken out dinner from this location dozens of times in the time I lived in Toronto. The food is invariably great tasting, the value is great, and the service is very charming in its brusque way. 

It remains one of my favourite restaurants of all time, and I look forward to coming here whenever I return to Toronto.
