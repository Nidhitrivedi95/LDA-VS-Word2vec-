gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA I was pleasantly surprised!  After a long morning of shopping, we started getting hungry.  The other restaurants in the food court seemed questionable and so we decided to take a chance here and I'm happy we did.  The butter chicken curry was DELiCIoUS.  Perfectly seasoned with just the right consistency, it was actually better than a lot of the other Indian restaurants I've been too!  
The naan and rice were a great complement to the curry and it left me wanting more.  I'll be back.
