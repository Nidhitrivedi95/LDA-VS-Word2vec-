rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I love this place. Just down the street from us, my family and friends have all enjoyed the food, service, and ambiance of this place. I did find some of the dishes a little high on saltiness, which I like, but I probably shouldn't. 

Price is very reasonable. 

This review comes after a half dozen consistently terrific meals. My wife and I like to get in for the early bird prix fixe special, from which I always bring home leftovers. 

Their wine list is great, but I still find red wine and Indian to be a weird pairing, and prefer a beer with this food.

Enjoy!
