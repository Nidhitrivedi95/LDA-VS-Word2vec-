DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I was really feeling like having some samosas, so I thought of trying the Samosa factory. It was the most horrible experience of my life at a restaurant. We went there for lunch and the lunch menu looked OK. We saw the "no separate checks" sign on the wall, so we asked the server if he can get each of us a different entre' and give the bill individually. To that he replied very rudely asking us to leave and go across the street for the buffet. I have spread the word in my community and I for sure am never going there again. The waiter/server was down right rude. Being in the restaurant business and that too an Indian restaurant you should know how to treat people. We have a saying in India "Atithi Devo Bhava" which means that guest is like God and must be treated with utmost courtesy. I am pretty sure the server at the restaurant has little if any knowledge of that. There are way too many better options to have authentic Indian Food in the city and if you want to try real Indian Food, I would reccoment Taj Palace, India masal/Mint Bistro/Ranis...
