OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g The food and service were superb. The chef was very accommodating. He made a special vegan dish for me and a hot drink, at my request, with no milk. The super fresh food did not take long at all to come to our table. The whole staff was very kind and joyful. It made our visit to Vegas very special. Kudos to the new Master Chef from India.
