xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Fry bread is amazing.  We all know that and this place does not fail to deliver fantastic fry bread.  I had the ultimate green chili fried taco and it is as good as it sounds.  The place is very small but we had no problem finding seating around lunch time.  The price was a bit expensive.  For a ultimate fry bread taco and a med drink was just over $10.  Chips and salsa are $3.75 so I had to pass on those.  Otherwise this is a great place to bring some co workers and chow down on some lunch and dessert fry bread.
