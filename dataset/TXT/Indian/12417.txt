aXGVV7OiKjajjJWd5gZCIQ I wasn't that impressed.  I haven't actually eaten in the restaurant (only take-out) but for what we paid I expected more.  Not more food, just better quality and taste.  It was fine, and they will probably do well since they're the only Indian place in Fairlawn.  I would rather drive the extra 15 minutes to go to the Saffron Patch though.
