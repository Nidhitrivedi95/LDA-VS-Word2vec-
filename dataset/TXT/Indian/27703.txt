Iqu-RwRA4XfwILKQLKQZew My coworkers took me to this spot and I was instantly hooked! I loved the chicken biryani so much that I brought my family back here the following week. Upon our return we tried the tandoori pizza and WOW it was amazing! The pizza takes a while to make but it is totally worth it. The decor and cleanliness are on point here as well. If there is any room for improvement I'd say maybe answering the phone, I've tried calling in an order multiple times and the phone never works. We will DEFINITELY be back!
