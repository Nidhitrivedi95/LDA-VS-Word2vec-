q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw I went here with a groupon.  I was very dissapointed with the food.  We ordered sweet and sour chicken and curry chicken.  The food was served in a small soup crock.  The S and S chicken had a very very small amount of meat, it was mostly bones mixed into a broth which was actually not even safe since you had to hunt for the bone to not eat one by accident.  The dish was 13.00 and worth about 1.00 at best.  I would not eat here again even with a groupon.
