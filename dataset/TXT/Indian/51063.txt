UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Haven't even gotten my food yet and the place is already pretty shitty and poorly run.  Ok so the food has arrived..... It's good, small portions I guess but still pretty good- nothing crazy about it but acceptable by my standards. While not my favorite Indian place in the city, actually maybe my least favorite, it gets the job done.  Oh, and the place is filthy
