They do have some take out options as well but guess they've started reducing the quantity these days .. I used to take out chola-bhatura some times but now the taste of their cholas is not as good and even the size of bhaturas have been reduced to a small circle. Same goes with their veg thali. It leaves a lot to be desired. Their chaats and sweets are still good though.
