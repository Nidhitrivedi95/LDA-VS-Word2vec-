C_chktl5jFeRqu1C0rmScA Ordered the fish cooked in banana leaf, biryani and a plain dosa. This is the first time I've had a dosa and I was very impressed. It's a very thin crepe, good on its own but even better with the dips that came with it. I'll be in pursuit of more dosas in the future.

The fish had good flavours but I didn't like the fish itself, maybe if it's another type of meat... the biryani, again, had very good spices and flavours.
