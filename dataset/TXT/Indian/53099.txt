vCx6uieEF0W0mKFK4sT3Yg Terrible service. The four of us ordered one appetizer, then waited for almost an hour for only two of the entrees. The waitress didn't bring out the other entrees until we complained nearly 20 mins later. After which she failed to bring water for the table. The food was just okay.
