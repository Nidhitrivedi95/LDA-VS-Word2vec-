TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw **THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BUFFET ONLY**

After reading the reviews of this place, I was lead to believe it is the best Indian place in Vegas.  After eating here my thoughts are:

1) This is the only Indian place in Vegas--not likely
2) People in Vegas have never had good Indian food
3) People in Vegas don't know what good Indian food is.

My thinking is either 2 or 3.

The food:  An assortment of curries which all lack that usual tasteful magicness found in Indian cuisine.  The consistency was fine (I've been to some places that have real watery curries) but the blending of spices came out bland and not good.  The naan although fluffy tasted like burnt popcorn.  I have to say the one saving grace was the rice pudding (kheer) was actually quite good...I went back for seconds.

The atmosphere:  typical for an Indian restaurant.  My water glass was filled at appropriate times, they had pleasant light music playing (as opposed to obnoxious Bollywood videos), and the decor is fine.  I have to say I did not venture into the bathroom as I was afraid for my life.

The next time I am in Vegas I will skip this one.
