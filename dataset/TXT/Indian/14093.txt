BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ Vegetarian appetizer platter ($9.95) was soggy and generally too salty. 
Chicken vindaloo ($14.95) was flavourful and moderately spicy. 
Lamb rogan josh ($15.95) had more subtle flavour. 
Garlic naan ($2.95) was fresh. 
Serving staff was polite and efficient. 
The portion size was small considering the price. 
All in all, it was a good experience and I would try again when I'm in the mood for indian food.
