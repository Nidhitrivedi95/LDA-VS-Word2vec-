nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Stopped by here on a Wednesday night before heading to AGO and there was no lineup. We were greeted nicely by the hostess who showed us to the table and explained the menu items to us. Meals here are offered as a prix-fixed menu at $25 for a 3 course meal all year long. She warned us that dishes are made to order to expect to wait a little. I wasn't bothered by that since it meant fresh meals. 

I ordered the calamari, seafood special and espresso panna cotta. Calamari was okay but that "meh" vibe was quickly masked by how good the seafood special was. It came as a seafood mix (shrimp, calamari, blue crab) with a nice stock base. Very seafoody so it may not be for those who aren't a fan of fishiness. However, for those who are, it's bomb. The portions were surprisingly filling (maybe because I also drank all the soup... #hangrymodeon) I had little to no room for the dessert. From the few tastes I had, it was refreshing and light, overall nicely made.
