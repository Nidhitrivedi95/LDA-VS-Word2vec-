PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q I mainly come here to get my fix of Bollywood music videos. I'm also fascinated by those little metal cups that they serve water in.

The food's not bad either. Not superb, but not bad. The naan, on the other hand, is purty darn good. IG is definitely one of the better dining options in Oakland. Make sure to stop by for their lunch buffet or in the evening for the 1/2 off special to catch great deals.

Parking generally blows, but it's Oakland...what's new?
