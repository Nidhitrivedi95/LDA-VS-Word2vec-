fagmJeecurJfXGAxbgMv8Q I had heard amazing things about The Cholas and when myself and a friend were looking for somewhere to go we passed this place and I thought why not! It was empty apart from one other table. The waiter was very friendly and polite but was hard to hear as he talked quite low. I went for the Chicken Masala Dosa as I wanted to try something different and had heard so much about dosas. Although the place was empty it seemed to take a long time for the food to come out which I didn't necessarily mind but my friend had to catch the last bus home. I also found it a bit cold in the restaurant. While we were waiting we were given free poppadoms and then onion bhaji which was unexpected and very nice. The dosa was great and I'm glad I tried it out. I had a chai tea at the end which wasn't very flavoursome. I like mine to have a bit more punch to it. 

I was a little disappointed by the overall experience when I had heard so much good things about this place so I'll definitely have to go back again to hopefully change my opinion.
