OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w A friend and I went for dinner. He ordered the Dum Biryani and I had the Lamb dish. Both of them were delicious. The place was empty. But, it was Monday. The service needs improvement. Only 4 occupied tables, no one came to enquire how the food was, or we needed more water. I still give it a 5 star. Hope they improve their service and show customers that they care.
