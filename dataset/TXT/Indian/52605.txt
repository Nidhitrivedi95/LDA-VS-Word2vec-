UXEqtEXs92COE3UiaSx4oA I love this Indian buffet! It's cheap, quick, and delicious. Whenever my friends crave Indian food, I take them here. Everything I've tried is good. They have something for everyone, from butter chicken, to pakora, to tandoori, to salads, to ice cream for dessert. They are constantly replenishing the buffet, so they never run out of anything. The naan is made fresh when you sit down and goes great with all the saucy foods. The server we usually get is friendly and efficient and happy to chat with us when it's not busy. He also tells us what something is when we aren't sure and reassures us that it's tasty and it usually is. It's something like $11 I $12 for dinner, which is pretty darn good considering how full you leave the restaurant.
