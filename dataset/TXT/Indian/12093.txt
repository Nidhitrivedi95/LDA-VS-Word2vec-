auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ FOOD POISON. Came here for their lunch buffet, went home and had a severe case of food poison. My symptoms were excruciating and painful. Had to nurse myself back to homeostatic state. Being a healthcare provider, I know for sure, the food poison was from this restaurant. 

I will not return. This was the place I would get my Indian food fix, but after my food poison incident yday, I will not step my foot in this restaurant. It's a shame!
