7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg Best Indian food in a restaurant I have ever had!!!

I grew up having a bunch of moms cook me amazing Indian food so my standards are really high.  This food was beyond amazing!  We had to force ourselves to stop eating.  I highly recommend the vegetarian items on the menu that are starred.  They were all amazing.

But the service.......  It was pretty bad.  My tea was brought out wrong twice.  We were left at the table without water for such long periods of time we considered getting up and finding the pitcher ourselves.  Come here with patience!  I would come back but maybe etch out more time to do it
