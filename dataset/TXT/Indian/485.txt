-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g This restaurant is super chic, has great service and (best of all) delicious food. I love Indian food and am a vegetarian, while my boyfriend is most definitely a meat eater, and we both left with nothing but great things to say. We ordered naan, chicken biryani, the butter tikka masala, and gulab jamun and it was all super tasty. Even the cinnamon cocktail and masala chai we ordered was delicious. All of the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was very enjoyable. I've already recommended it to a friend, and will certainly be going back.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that they gave me an extra, full container of rice to bring home with my leftovers (without me asking for it) so I basically had an an entire meal left over. Thanks!
