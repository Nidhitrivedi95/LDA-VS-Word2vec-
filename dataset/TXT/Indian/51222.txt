utC9M5BetVY6GECRyZeLEw I had been hearing about Maharaja's from friends for months. One big win for them is that they deliver to Sun Prairie. Sun Prairie peeps, good news for us! 

We stopped in a for a mid-week lunch buffet. The food was good, the prices were right on par with other Indian buffets. 

On the top of the list for yumminess for me was the breaded fried Paneer cheese and the "general tso's" of indian food - tandoori chicken. The cheese had a great texture and what's not to like about cheese! It was tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. The tandoori chicken was creamy and had a flavor to it that I haven't found before in tandoori chicken. Very flavorful. 

Plus, on an extra note, they let my 20 month old eat off the buffet for free. Yes, he only ate grapes and mango ice cream, but hey, he loved it! :) I've been to some buffets that charge for one year and up when they only are going to eat grapes and mango ice cream.
