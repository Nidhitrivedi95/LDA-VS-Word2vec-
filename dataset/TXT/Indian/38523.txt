OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I had dinner with two friends here last night and we ordered several appetizers and three main courses to try many different things.  We were first brought three papadum with mint and mango chutneys.  I liked both.  The mint had a good amount of heat to it unlike what I've had before.  

Next up were:  dry fruit whole wheat bread, Samosa chat, lamb kheema pav, and paneeer tikka and pav bhaji.  There were two winners here--the lamb kheema and the paneer tikka.  I really enjoyed the grilled flavor of the paneer and the lamb had good texture ingredients.  The lamb was served with bun halves that you could make a slider if you wanted.  I chose to use it as a base for the meat.  One real miss here was the dry fruit whole wheat.  I thought it was garlic naan.  I could not tell that there was any stuffing of nuts or raisins in the bread.  

For the mains, we got two curries and the five herb noodles recommended to us by the owner as his favorite dish.  The curries were good with a small amount of meat in each one.  I expect that's why the curries are bottomless.  The five herb noodles were my favorite of the night.  Really good seasonings and something quite different.

For dessert, we each got a paan shot (highly recommended) and we ordered a chocolate samosa.  It reminded me of a dessert in a Mexican restaurant with fried dough and ice cream with chocolate drizzled over the dough and the ice cream.

The restaurant is very nicely done.  It's a modern room with wood tables and lights hanging from the ceiling.  Service was OK.  One must do is to take a photo of someone in your party in the rickshaw.
