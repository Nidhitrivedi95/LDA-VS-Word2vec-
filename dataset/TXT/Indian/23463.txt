gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Mt. Everest's food is good. It covers Indian cuisine from different parts of India, which is nice. The lunch buffet is HUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGE! Like waaaaaaay tons of options. I like that they have sweet rice, because that makes me think of my mom's sweet rice, and well nostalgia makes everything taste better. They have a nice selection of meats too. I've NEVER seen a lunch buffet serve goat meat. Gotta give the props on that one. The naan is fresh and fluffy. I like that they give you both plain and garlic naan. Their roti is decent. Overall, it's a good option when home-cooked Indian food isn't happening.
