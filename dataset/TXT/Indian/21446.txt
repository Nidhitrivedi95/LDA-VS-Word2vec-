GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I didn't have a bad experience and enjoyed the Afghan Chicken with Garlic Nan. I'd eat it again too but the wait for the meal was really long and when you have a lunch break they need to move a bit faster on the food. We had to scarf it down and couldn't finish because of time. It took us nearly 30 min to get our meal and it wasn't packed when we ordered it as we were the first to arrive. If the service had been better I could give them a 4 star review but it wasn't. I'd still try it again though, just don't know when with other curry places in the city.
