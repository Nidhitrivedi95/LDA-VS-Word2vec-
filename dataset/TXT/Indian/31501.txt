KvRh-exPg_KegOM_HXeskw This place has such awesome food. They have  a special menu item called Kerala Parotta and that was so good. Spicy and super flavorful. 
You have to try their Tikka fries too. They also have a great assortment of Indian ice cream flavors along with regular flavors.
Eat spicy food and then eat ice cream! Great combination.
