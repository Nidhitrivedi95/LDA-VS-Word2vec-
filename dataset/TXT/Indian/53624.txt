vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w It's a little embarrassing how often I'm here. In any case, this place carried me through several years of (broke) vegetarianism and has continued to be my favourite Indian joint in the city. I'm convinced that if you buy a delicious samosa or Indian sweet in this city, it likely comes from Pushap.

I love this place so much that even the waitress, that I'm convinced hates me with every fiber of her being, is endearing.

You gotta try it.
