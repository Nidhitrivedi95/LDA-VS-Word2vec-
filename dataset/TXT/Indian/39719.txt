P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA Went for the $10.99 lunch buffet today. Lots of choices -- 4 veggie dishes and 6 meat dishes (shrimp, chicken, beef and lamb).

Compared to Little India right next door (literally), Palace uses more spice, so the dishes have more zing and hotness. And I loved every bite.

Very nice ambiance and all the food seemed to be high quality, so I would definitely recommend India Palace.
