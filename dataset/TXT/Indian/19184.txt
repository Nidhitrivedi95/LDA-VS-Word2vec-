f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg I and my friend had a craving for Indian food especially Indian bread ie. Naan and kababs..Zafran served us one of the best naans i had till date. Such food can be found only in the most authentic restaurents in India and Pakistan.. 


The serving size of the peshawari naan is huge..very few can eat more than one even though it is so tasty..the paneer tikka masala also scored a lot of points.

The restaurent can work on scaling up their menu with vegetarian food..

Waiting to go back to zafaran at the next earliest opportunity...
