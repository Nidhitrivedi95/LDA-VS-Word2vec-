1q-0v6rg3X-K6qMj81wt-Q I'm not gonna knock a star off just yet, but the roti at CinaH have gone a bit down hill recently... their thali dishes are still excellent, but I'm a bit disappointed.

They're so conveniently located I'm sure to return, but I'm less psyched (especially now that I've experienced the glories of Mother India).  

I will say this:  the man who runs this place is an incredibly nice, affable guy.  Maybe that's partly why I'm still "a fan"!
