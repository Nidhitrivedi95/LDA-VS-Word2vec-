d6XiEFppPRpj5AZk_VzWZA Was in the neighbourhood and wanted a light lunch. Instead of going to Tims near it we went in at Radica's. The restaurant is some tables and is fairly clean and staff making efforts to keep it. 

The ordering was simple as we ordered a large Aloo Channa Roti to be shared between the two of us. We ordered mild and a side of spicy sauce for me. 

The Roti arrived and size is LARGE. Enough if you are super hungry. The Roti soft and stuffed daal. The fillings of Channa (Chickpeas) was packed. Very little Aloo (potatoes) though. The spiciness a bit for her but when I added the extra sauce, it tasted amazing. Even without the sauce, it had great flavour. 

To eat is a bit messy, but nevertheless leaving you to want to eat more!!!

Hopefully we are in the neighbourhood soon.
