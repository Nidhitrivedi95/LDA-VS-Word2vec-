FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I didn't change my number of stars, but I had to update an experience: Maharani just hosted my birthday party and it went swimmingly. They gave us their back room, which was so warm and inviting for my guests. Everyone's order was right and they served our drinks, appetizers, and entrees at the perfect time. And on top of that, the head waitress (she is always there, kicking ass) saved the day when we forgot birthday candles by just happening to have some behind the counter! Afterwards, everyone came up to tell me how full and happy they were. It was the perfect night. Thank you!
