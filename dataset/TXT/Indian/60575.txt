zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Came here on a recommendation. Not very impressive but not disappointed either. Takes you back on the streets of Afghanistan or to a bazaar in Peshawar. Feels like u r experiencing the eastern culture. The food is better than most Indian/Pakistani restaurants. If you want some real authentic food go for a nihari and the combo platter. Don't choose typical Pakistani stuff like biryani, karahi, wraps etc bcoz this is not the place. Afghani food however is delicious. Went there quite a few times only for nihari. It's a family owned business and we support them for this. The young guy who's on reception is so nice to talk with. My only reservation is that if u r just couple of minutes late from 8.00 pm they won't seat you even they close at 9.00pm and leave right away at 9.00 if you are late for pick up. One day we arrived at 9.03 pm and they were literally out with our order which they handed us on road. They don't even care for their regular customers. They won't listen n understand your problem. They must have to raise their standard for good customer service otherwise there are many other better places.
