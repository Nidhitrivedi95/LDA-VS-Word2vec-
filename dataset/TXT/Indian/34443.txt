MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g I have been waiting for such a restaurant in Phoenix area. After passing by several times, I finally went inside this time. I was amazed to see the ambient inside. They have huge space for dining. Being a vegetarian, I believe that they have the best and longest menu than any other restaurant in town. A quick lunch costed me about $6 that was incredibly tasty and nutritious at such a price. Above all, they have a wide variety of ready to pick fresh Indian snack and sweets item that were never available in shops. 
I will be updating my review after visiting there several times. Definitely recommending to try, you would love it!!
