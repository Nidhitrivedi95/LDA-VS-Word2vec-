Uyw1pJ03kt-I1B_tkA3aFg Quite possibly the slowest restaurant in Matthews. Waited half an hour for my Goat Haleem. To make things even worse, the Goat Haleem sounds great on paper, what the menu description conveniently leaves out is that all ingredients are puréed together. It's like a tiny bowl of mushy meat and vegetables cereal! And way too expensive for the portion size.
