Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ I think this is the first Indian restaurant I'm reviewing, I could be wrong but it's def my fave. 

I've been to a couple, none were worth reviewing except this one. I've been here a few times. I normally don't like Indian food to begin with but this place has made me less stubborn. 

The portions are huge so you can def share with up to 3-4 people or have leftovers for a full portion dinner the next day too ( better if you share with less tho; that way you have more deliciousness for you and company of 1 more haha ) 

We ordered: 

Matar Paneer - $10
Cottage cheese and green peas cooked in butter flavoured onion and tomato gravy

Chicken Vindaloo - $14
Chicken cooked with herbs and spices in special hot spicy and tangy sauce with potatoes

Vegetable Biryani -$10
Saffron flavoured basmati rice cooked with vegetables, spices and nuts. 

Nan -$2 
Leavened bread

Gulab Jamun -$5 
Condensed milk balls in sugary syrup 

This is a wonderful spot, anyone looking for authentic Indian food, this is the place to go. They deliver as well and it's pretty quick. 

Enjoy :)
