02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ Do yourself a favor...NEVER EVER GO THIS PLACE. If you are indian you will regret it. If you are not indian and trying indian food for first time then you will never try indian food in your entire life. I took chicken biriyani to go. It was worst biriyani I ever had. I drove 20 mins keeping the biriyani in passenger seat. Didn't smell anything like biriyani.  It WAS YELLOW RICE WITH SOME BOILED CHICKEN SOME SLICED JALAPEÑO  AND TOMATO SLICE. Biriyani was $12. They charged  $3 for raita. First time I saw biriyani doesn't come with raita. They gave green and red chutney with the biriyani.  Who the hell eat green chutney with biriyani.  I HAD TO CALL THE RESTAURANT SUGGESTING THE CHEF TO WATCH COUPLE OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS HOW TO MAKE BIRIYANI. Please please don't go this place.
