ImFTARxxeD-nVZMje1Ckew I have been ordering delivery (as well as the occasional sit down dinner) from Mirchi almost every week for over a year and a half and their consistency and quality are always welcome!

I always order the Tandoori chicken (which comes with rice and vegetables included) that is always very well seasoned, juicy, and delicious.

The offer real mirchi pakora (fried green chiles) that are great if you love the spicy stuff!

Some of their dishes can be on the sweeter side, but they are very receptive to special orders or requests.

Given that there are so many choices in Montreal, a year and a half of satisfaction should be reason enough to pick up the phone (or go down to the restaurant) and order!!!
