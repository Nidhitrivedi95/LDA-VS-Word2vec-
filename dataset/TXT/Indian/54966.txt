wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw I've been here a few times. Their chaat is absolutely delish ($6.99)...must try! I love the thick yogurt, mint and tamarind on top of the chaat and potatoes. Also they add a few pomegranates which I've never seen before. Overall yummy! Also their chicken kebab with soft buttery roti is delicious...small portion sizes though for the price ($11.99). Their kadhai chicken special was a miss..it was just ok...service is slow
