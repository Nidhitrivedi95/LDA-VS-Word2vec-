Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g don't let the area fool you! it looks a little rough- mimico.It's more gem* *than gem!!
Imagine you start with vegetable bariani !It is Lush and spiced like a homemade masterful! you weren't keen in the past of Vegetable Samosas but you try Everest and it is generous and a lovely flavour!! The appetizers from Naan to complementary stik and homemade soups!! Need I say more?
I also tried many of their Entrees Lamb or Beef Curry?? delicious!!! My mother has twice loved their Chicken Bariani! Courteous and  Delightful Service and a some?how perfect ambiance!
