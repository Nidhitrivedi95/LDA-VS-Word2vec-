7KKugTC6WXZpypifkf9i7Q Easily the best Hakka food in the city. I tried all other 'top' Hakka spots and none were even close.

The portions are large and the price is good. Food is ready in under 10 minutes usually.

The place is always very clean. Staff is friendly.

Try the crispy ginger chicken, Bombay chicken, chilli chicken, mango chicken, chicken pakora.
