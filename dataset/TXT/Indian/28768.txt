jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q This was the first time we visited Pure and we were very impressed.
The restaurant looks out at the airport, so the view of planes landing
makes for a beautiful sight.  The food was delicious.  We had the
chicken jalfrezzi and the lamb vindaloo.   Both the chicken and lamb
were as tender as I can remember at an Indian restaurant and the
sauces were also excellently prepared.  The garlic naan and the
basmati rice (which comes with the entree) were also very
flavorful.   Go there.  You won't be disappointed.
