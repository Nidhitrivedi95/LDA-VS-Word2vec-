yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg This is the best Indian buffet in the valley. I love the paneer masala here, but all the food is top quality. A lot of buffets sacrifice flavor and quality for their lunch buffets but not here! We've come here several times and we love how consistent it is.
The service is also great. The only reason why it gets 4 stars is because the restaurant isn't super clean
