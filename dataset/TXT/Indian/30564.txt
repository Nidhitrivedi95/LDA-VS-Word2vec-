kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I enjoy this place. It's quick easy and I think the food tastes good! I've had the pannag curry and the squash curry. You can get either white or brown rice. Staff is very nice. Place seems clean. Check it out and decide for yourself but this is definitely a regular place I go on my lunch.
