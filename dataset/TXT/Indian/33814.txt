   -  Good and tasty food.
   -  Nice Ambience.

Cons
   - Very slow service.
   - Expensive for the quantity
   - No lunch Buffet
   
Worst Con
    - Really bad packaging when you place togo/pickup orders. Especially when you are spending so much you at least expect better containers than styrofoam.
