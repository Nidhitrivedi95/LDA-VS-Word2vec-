XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw The food here is excellent!  I have only had it delivered so I cannot speak for the actual location. 

That being said, in two orders in the last 4 days... we have had the butter chicken with rice...spice level "medium" which the first time was seasoned to perfection...the right amount of heat without being too hot! The second time ordering was a little on the mild side but still delicious!  Recommendation would be "medium to medium spicy". I also had the mutter paneer roti which was good, but not the greatest. It was a little too potato heavy..so if I was to reorder I would definitely add extra paneer and "easy on the potatoes" The chicken Tikka was also very good. But again...slightly on the mild side...so perhaps order up a spice level (If you like medium order "medium spicy" if you like spicy get "extra spicy" etc. 

The Show Stopper: SAAG PANEER (dish) Omg!  AMAZING! !! I have never had such amazing saag paneer.  I ordered it mild, expecting bland...but it was spice-ful without the heat...and so creamy and delicious!!! I was sad when it was finished. Will order again and again!!!
