sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Had this place recommended by a friend and read the reviews so we thought we'd give it a try for lunch. Ordered the palaak paneer roti and split it for lunch. We had it medium, which was pretty mild for me but my partner felt it was plenty spicy. 

Overall a pretty decent cheap meal. Total came to slightly less than $12 after tax and it was a light lunch for two people. It would have been huge for one of us. It is hard to call it a really great deal though because there were tons of signs for lunch specials at round the same price point on the walk down Queen. I thought that paneer was nicely done but the roti itself just wasn't really my thing. I've never seen these in the us before (at least not that aren't Caribbean) so maybe this is what a rot is supposed to be like. Anyway, rather than being soft and delicious like Indian bread tends to be, this was much more like a tortilla shell, crisp and fried on the grill. It mostly just diffused the flavors and added more calories.

They had a good number of chutneys and lassis and the like. These sides were all rather expensive and would have significantly increased the price of the meal. They seemed like relatively bad value.

Overall, a good and  interesting experience and somewhere I'd eat at a bit if I worked near it, but not a destination for me.
