Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg A quaint and cozy Indian restaurant in a fairly spacious strip mall location. Parking should never be a problem here.

I visited on a Friday around 5:30p. I was seated immediately and did not wait long to place my order. First, I should not be eating this food due to dietary restrictions...but there are places I frequented in Chicago that I just really miss. An Indian restaurant is one of them. This will be my first time dining at an Indian restaurant in Charlotte and it did not disappoint. 

I started with Somosa and Apricot Naan. Amazing! Good portion on both dishes. For my entree I went with the recommendation of Methi Chicken. Similar to Tikki Masala except simmered in a creamy fenugreek sauce. Served with a side of basmati rice. Excellent! Bursting with flavor and perfectly spiced to my liking. It was more than enough food for me. I ended up taking home leftovers and ordered naan to go.

Despite dietary restrictions, this is another place I will sneak meals from. If you know and appreciate real Indian Cuisine, then you will enjoy eating here. I'm sure some may feel the menu is not so large, but it does have the well known dishes that people tend to favor most. 

Overall, it was a great dining experience. Food is truly delicious. Servers are attentive. Owner is engaged and checks on each table. He takes pride in this place and it shows. 

The place is authentic and that matters most to me!
