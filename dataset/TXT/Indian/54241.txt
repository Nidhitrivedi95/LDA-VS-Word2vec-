VvZnozdEpjw0e7Dg-kKIxg I didn't enjoy the food and I also did not receive what I ordered via delivery. They sent the wrong soup, no rice, and ignored my request to send utensils/plates/napkins. Big buzzkill when you're in a hotel room eating Indian food with your fingers. Ordered several different vegetarian dishes but really didn't enjoy them - too greasy and not flavorful.
