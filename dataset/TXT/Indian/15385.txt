ConRV9cNFKbqlIUknjDDsQ Note - this review is based upon delivery from orderit.ca

I found Biryani House's food on the boring side.  The seekh kebab tasted quite similar to a hot dog.  Usually if there is going to be a down fall for a kebab, it is that its greasy.  Never have I had one taste like a hot dog.  

The channa masala looked very much like a can of baked beans.  It was lacking in flavour.  The heat seemed a bit out of place for the channa, like it was trying to compensate for the lack of flavour.

The only highlight was the whole wheat tandoori roti.  It had great texture and flavour.

If you are thinking of ordering Indian from orderit.ca - pass on Biryanai House
