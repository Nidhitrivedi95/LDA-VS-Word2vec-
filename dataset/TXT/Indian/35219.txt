MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Had a dinner party and made Indian Food but didn't want to make the samosas!!!  Nice variety of veggie fillings:  Paneer tikka masala, saag paneer and potato with peas.

Fillings were very tasty. The sauces were not.  The batter isn't too oily so that's a bonus.  I still prefer besan flour (chickpea flour) in the wrapper but I haven't had one like that in a long, long time.

Anyhow for the price and variety, just buy your own sauce.  It's very good especially if you're watching your fried oily intake as these are less oily than most.
