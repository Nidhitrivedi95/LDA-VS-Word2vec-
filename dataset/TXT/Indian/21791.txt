gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw The staff were extremely friendly and the food was killer. We had the lamb super gyros and they were flavorful and filling. The lamb was tender and plentiful and the price was just right. It is a little hole in the wall downtown but if you need a quick bite, don't pass it up!
