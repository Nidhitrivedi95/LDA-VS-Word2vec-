OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g The buffet was really great. The best food I had till now in US.  Makes you feel at home. Owner was helpful in every way possible. We arrived 30 minutes before the closing time and he made everything from scratch. Really great restaurant. Awesome hospitality. Great chef. Do try this if you want best food in Vegas.
