This place is very unassuming, your not staying here for dinner. In fact, initial impressions I got were that they weren't finished " doing up" the place. Regardless, I didn't come here for the decor. I came for the food.

The lunch specials are quite good, and during the lunch hour you will find people getting take-out, with the odd few sitting at what tables they do have.

My favorite food at this place bar none, is the Manchuarian Veggie. I have eaten at many Indian-chinese restaurants across the city, and let me tell you this item on the menu caught my by surprise. It was very fresh. They also have other excellent items such as the noodles, and of course chilli chicken.

I was told by a friend that this place serves indian-chinese the " delhi" way, coupled with the delhi flavour and taste. I must admit, I did taste a difference from other Indo-chinese places.

Nevertheless. The food here is very good. Again, don't plan an evening out with family to this place, but do get take-out.
