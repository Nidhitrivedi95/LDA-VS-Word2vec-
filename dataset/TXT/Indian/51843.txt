UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Stepped in Mint Indian bistro on a Monday night with my friend and ordered some food that was good. However, the service was not as good as the food was. Servers were in hurry to take the order, give the check, and see us out of the restaurant. 
And one should not ask a question on how the food was when you don't intend on listening to the answer of your costumers. 
It would have been a great experience at this restaurant if only the staffs were a bit more attentive on service.
