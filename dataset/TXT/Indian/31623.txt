KVwV03I-APnUlAWmnz__gw Was pretty excited and had high hopes for this chat place after I had BHEL puri which I felt was pretty good and better than the one at lotus market. But the hopes did nt last that long as I started ordering other items from the menu. For ex. pani puri - puri's were so small and the pani I think came right from the refrigerator, cost is too high for the number of puri's that you get. Gobi Manchurian was way too expensive (10$) for a place like this and taste didn't do any justice for the price. One samosa is close to 2$.

 I feel the owner has not tested the existing market at what price point other chat places like little India and lotus are selling their food. If you have a high price point then you need to increase your quantity. Other places have been here for many years so it makes sense for a new guy to see what others have to offer and analyze what can I do different which can pull the crowd away from those places. We are not walking into a fine dining place to get a small quantity for a higher price.
