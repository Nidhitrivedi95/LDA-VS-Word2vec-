OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg This has been one of my favourite Indian restaurants for long long time. I have been coming years almost 10 years ago, then somehow forgot about it and now I'm back. The food here is really good. All the dishes I have tried are absolutely flavourful and good. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like Indian food. The dishes are not too spicy, not oily, and the staff is very friendly and nice. My favourite dishes here have always been Butter Chicken, Saag Paneer and Navratan Korma.
