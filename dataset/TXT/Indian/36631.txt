NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Choolaah is going to be a national hit. I love coming here for a quick lunch. We are vegan and can find one thing on the menu to eat. I wish they had a few more options. My kids love the lentil soup and naan. 
I don't doubt that this has the potential to be the next chipotle. I wish it was a little less noisy.
