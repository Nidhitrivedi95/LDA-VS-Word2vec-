0NDbUCHi9YsRwgG3iZO8Kg We've been going to Cafe Tandoor (in Aurora) for about 10 years.  It's always a good experience with excellent service and good food.

The pakora appetizers are a winner and their curries are very good.  I usually get it Indian Hot and it never disappoints.  

They also have a nice variety of vegetarian dishes and excellent selection of breads. 

Try the gulab jamun desert (sponge-cake like balls in syrup).  

Some nice beer selections as well.
