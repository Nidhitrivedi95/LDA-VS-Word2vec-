h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA What a horrible experience!  While my Malai Kofta was acceptable, it tasted reheated (read: slightly dried out and over-cooked.)  Also everyone else in my party who ordered the buffet was disappointed.  Six patrons plus me... all very unhappy.  I chose this restaurant on a recent trip to Tempe to reunite with friends, and I chose it because of the high reviews on yelp.  Is everyone crazy??  The food was just ok, though not remarkable.  What was truly terrible was the service and the ambience.  The server was rude and only checked on us once.  The buffet was not refreshed in the two hours we sat there mingling and nibbling.  The soda that my friends ordered was almost out of syrup, so it was a very light brown and had virtually no flavor.  I am so embarassed!  I chose this place, and everyone was unhappy.  Food was also wasted, which I don't feel good about.  Clean the place up, keep the food fresh and put out a friendly vibe!!!  That's what this place needs to stay in business.  I would NEVER come here again.  What a disappointment!
