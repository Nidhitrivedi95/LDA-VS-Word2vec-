ZqmUmrXkwihgPFjMCYh_Mg This place is absolutely great. We order or dine in at least once a week. Food is delicious, service could be better but not going to hold it against them. Food however is good, we usually get the boneless chicken biriyani, butter chicken and chicken lollipops. We are happy that this place exists in Phoenix.
