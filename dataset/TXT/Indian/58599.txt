yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ I stopped by for lunch on a Wednesday during the summer. Campus is fairly empty, but Casablanca was still pretty busy. I ordered the lamb makhani roll to go with a bottle of diet Pepsi. The total was nearly $12 (the roll was $8.99 on its own), so lunch isn't cheap.

The roll was made up of a large piece of freshly made naan filled with grilled lamb chunks (perhaps 5), a creamy sauce that had some heat, grilled onions and green peppers, also chunked, and lettuce. The lamb did not have any particular flavor (it could have been almost any kind of red meat), the sauce had no spicing except for the heat, and the green peppers were cut too large and undercooked. The lettuce had gone limp with heat and added nothing to the flavor; it detracted from texture. The naan was decent (chewy, warm), but had little flavor. 

A really good piece of naan should have a smoky / toasted flavor on the outside while remaining soft and chewy on the inside. A really good makhani begins with meat marinated overnight in yoghurt  and a harmonious blend of spices and aromatics that can include Garam Masala, ginger, garlic paste, lemon or lime, pepper, coriander, cumin, turmeric.This tenderizes the meat and infuses it with flavor -- I would bet my bottom dollar that was not done here. At least the sauce resembled its traditional base of tomato puree, ghee, and yoghurt. 

The small order of fries that came with the roll was good -- flavorful and crispy. 

I waited around 20 minutes for the carry out. The gentleman taking the orders was abrupt through most of our interactions. For example, he ordered me to sit down because, he said, "it's going to take a long time." Way to sell the experience. But I could give these things a pass if the food were good. It was filling. But it was not good.
