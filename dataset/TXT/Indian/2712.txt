07ZateHZK5iqMxNs3g3r6Q Sara F. what restaurant did you go to?!??! 

This place is as great, lunch or dinner buffet, you name it is good. I would like to consider myself a bit of an expert on Indian food, especially buffets. I grew up eating Indian food and I love my parents for it!

I loved that they have goat and lamb! Not many Indian buffets have either of those meats, or only have them on special occasions. Not Indus Village! I have been to lunch many times and they always have the chicken curry, I always skip the chicken though, the sauce is so so YUM!

They seem to have the same main dishes and change out a few other ones. But personally I have found a place where they have dishes I love, so I hope they have the same few dishes every time I'm there! 

This place doesn't disappoint!
