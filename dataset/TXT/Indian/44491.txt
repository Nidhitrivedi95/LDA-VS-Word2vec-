rwuMWGqt7L5l5lDsOYv1dw I love the fact that you can grab the food and go. I walk to class, home,  a friends place or the store and have a satiating meal- its the perfect meal on the go (cheap, fast, and great tasting).  Plus, I can grab a beer with my meal and afford to come back for another helping of something different the same day.  

I'm a frequent diner there because of the diverse and inexpensive menu choices. If you're feeling adventurous be sure and try the Mango Lassi, it's the perfect compliment to any spicy food or just a treat when you need a smoothie like fix.  The Indian Chai is super yummy too- I'd never go to Starbucks again for this and on a cold day, it's better than hot chocolate! 

If you're new to campus or town, its definitely a must have- the food, the service, the unique atmosphere can't compare to any other place I've ever been.  This place is like "Central Perk"  on Friends and "MacLaren's Bar" from How I Met Your Mother!
