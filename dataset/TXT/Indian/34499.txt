After a fortuitous suggestion by my Wife to stop off, we were treated to some of the best food I've had in ages. Patty got a dish combining the merits of a spicy-sweet onion curry, along with okra fries, something I'm looking forward to getting more of! I got a breakfast combo of a wonderful Greek-style omelette wrapped in a home-made pita that was absolutely fabulous. Along with that, got a side of a spicy onion/cauliflower/coconut dish that was amazing, and you should try their spnakopita,  it makes a great treat as well. 

I have also heard tell of a mystical combo of something that sounds...amazing; A BELGIAN BAKLAVA WAFFLE BREAKFAST PLATTER...served all day:) 

The restaurant is small and intimate, but good for a family meal and the staff are great folks who really try to make you feel welcome. There's ample parking across the street in a common lot and the prices are really reasonable. They are mostly a breakfast/lunch place, closing at 4 pm most days, and 2 pm on Sunday, but I have heard tell that soon, they will be doing delivery within a 3 mile radius, so order in! 

So, if you're in Cleveland Heights, stop by the Greedy Girl (cause they're most generous with good food and great service:)
