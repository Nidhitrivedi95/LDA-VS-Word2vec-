DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I miss this place sooooo much! It's honestly deliciousness in the best way! The Kashmiri naan filled with dates cannot be rivaled! And the veggie dishes are ridiculous! I'm so happy to see this place thriving! It's quaint atmosphere and mood lighting on a Friday night is perfect! And I'm excited to enjoy this wonderful place again!
