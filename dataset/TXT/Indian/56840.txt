xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Here is the paradox of the Fry Bread House. You want to eat your fry bread while it's sizzling hot and freshly puffed, at which point it is light, airy, and gently crisp -- a superlative fry bread that leaves many other fry breads deflated with shame at not measuring up to its texture. At the same time, eating in is likely to harsh your buzz, as the restaurant has the eerie dive-iness of a place that's kept scrupulously clean but that's too big to be properly lit and decorated on the available budget.

My suggestion would be to stop by before a show at the nearby Rhythm Room, get your fry bread "to go," hustle back to the venue at top speed, and eat your piping hot fry bread on the picnic tables before the doors open. 

I ordered mine with beans and cheese, and these are fine beans. Now I'm torn between wanting another savory round with many things heaped on it (bring on the chorizo!) and wanting to try 'em with sweet toppings.
