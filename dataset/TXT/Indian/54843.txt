WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA This the the Host restaurant that your friends have been talking about. It is one of the better Indian restaurants in the GTA. It's in the category of one of the few indian restaurants that I will actually eat at and the only one in the Markham/Richmond Hill area at that. Their food is standard pretty good. I know I can expect decent food every time I visit. I typically do the buffet as with my most recent visit and it lived up to my expectations. As far as I know it is the best in the area, but saying that what a caveat that it is only *good* indian food. Don't expect awesome. Also, don't forget to have the Gulaab jaman!
