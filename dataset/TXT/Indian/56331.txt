XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Last Sunday, I went down to Tibet Kitchen, a place I have only been once before when I first started trying different Tibetan places down in Parkdale. I must admit that other than the outside that I have passed by many times, nothing about the restaurant seemed familiar. It seemed rather plain inside, although there were pictures and paintings on the walls, and very low-energy (except for my server who was fine). But everything was very clean and organized, so I don't want to deter anyone from visiting. Perhaps it has changed inside or perhaps I just don't remember my previous visit properly. I did recall meeting by chance someone I used to work with, and I also recall enjoying the food, which is the most important thing.

As for my meal, I had the Shaptak beef, which is small pieces of beef spiced with ginger and scallions with a bowl of rice, and Ting Mo steamed buns. The beef was very good, spicy but not too much; the scallions in particular had nice flavour. This was the first time I have had steamed buns instead of momos, and they were larger than I expected, but still soft and warm enough to absorb some of the Shaptak sauce. The only downside of the meal was that they were out of butter tea by the time I was finished eating.

Overall, a very good and filling meal for only $20, and certainly another good option for Tibetan food in the area.
