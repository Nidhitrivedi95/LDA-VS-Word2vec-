C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Came here during taste of little Italy with a friend of mine and was very impressed! On a busy night for them, the service was still quick and friendly! The good was great and the portion sizes were a solid amount for your money's worth. We were lucky that it was a beautiful night and could enjoy the nice patio there which was the icing on the cake making this an awesome outing.
