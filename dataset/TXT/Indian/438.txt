-aKf_aT5vnmF2XcNKfb0eA This review is for the seafood kothu roti.  We ordered in advance.  It was ready when we came to pick it up.  Lots of shrimp, perfect roti, and good spice.  I can't eat kothu roti anywhere else.
The staff are really friendly and nice.  We tried the other food there and though it was good, it is the kothu roti that takes the prize.
