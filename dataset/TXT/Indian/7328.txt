5mG8NptNZtvOJv1wriHCCA I would appreciate these guys for doing a Unlimited Dosa night - it's a bold move . I went early evening and was served with close to 5 dosas , I was unable to finish all of them though , sides were awesome , especially the red chutney ( tomato) .
Plain Dosa - good 
Paneer Dosa - not so good as panner was plain could have added some masala n some salt .
Kal Dosa - pretty big , for unlimited dosa 
Uthappam - was not so cooked on the middle, but was good .(big one )
They took sometime to serve dosa .

My advise to chef - please don't serve chutneys right from fridge , doesnot taste good . Otherwise you are doing a good job .
Please advertise this dosa night more , so that everyone get to try them !  ( good strategy needs good marketing too ) , will come again sometime next month for more dosas . 

For anyone who does not what dosa is - it's rice crepe , it's crispy and yummy served with different sides - sambar , chutneys and podi . Masala dosa is stuffed wih mash potatoes (Indian style)
