There were four of us and we ordered an appetizer/starter (samosa chatt), the tandoori sizzler, chicken vindaloo, chicken tika masala, rice and garlic naan. The food was all wonderful and service was good too. The only two things I didn't like is that our waiter didn't like the fact that we didn't order one entree per person ("you realize these dishes are meant to be for one person"), and the prices. I can get the same foods at many other Indian restaurants for less, larger portions and that have a better taste. I'm glad I went and tried it, but probably won't be back.
