KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ So I got butter chicken, palak paneer (spinach and Indian cottage cheese) and chhole chicken.

Let me start by saying that the choice they have is enormous. Butter chicken was so sweet that I couldn't eat it. Butter chicken is from India, and the original recipe doesn't have any sweetness. I don't know who came up with the idea. 

Palak paneer and chhole were not bad. Naan was mediocre. Service was nothing to write home about. Prices at least 10% higher than what other Indian Pakistani restaurants charge. 

So given a choice of rather go to Gerard Street for Pakistani food.
