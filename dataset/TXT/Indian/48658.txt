tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg Halwa Puri review:

- 3 puris (good size)
- Halwa
- Chana  (you can have it with aloo instead if you want)
- piece of mango achar

The puris and chana were fine.  The halwa tasted very artificial. Paid $3 plus tax.  (take out) . I prefer quality over quantity and didn't like the taste of the halwa. For $3 try it for yourself and see what you think.
