sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I'm late to the party, but I've finally jumped on the "Indian-roti" wagon. So good. Soo good. Finger-licking 'licious good! 

We ordered the mild butter chicken and medium chicken tikka masala roti for pickup, and 15 mins and $28 later, we were relishing on these rotis.

What I liked:
1) Packed with flavor
2) Stick to spiciness level; a mild is a true, no-spice affair; and a medium kicks up the spice level a few notches
3) Sufficient for the very-hungry
4) Quick and affordable 

So what's not to like?
