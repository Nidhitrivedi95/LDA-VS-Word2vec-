bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Super greasy hakka food. Came here for dinner; it was quite busy. Ordered fried rice, beef with broccoli, and shrimp pakoras. Beef dish was quite salty, fried rice was greasy, but pakoras were perfect. Had a good amount of jalapenos in them, so beware if you arent into super spicy food.
