rwuMWGqt7L5l5lDsOYv1dw I braved the Green Street At Lunchtime During the School Year-crowds to go to Zyggyz.  Mind you, I'm more of a "F--k paying money to deal with lots of people, I'm eating free lunch at my desk"-type, so this was a big deal.

Hungry Undergrad-dazed, I stepped into Zyggyz.  My two friends and I were the only people there.  Bad for Zyggyz, good for us.  I ordered a combo plate of Saag Paneer and Coconut Curry Chicken (a combo which made my heart explode with glee).  I paid something like $6 for what was a dinner-sized plate of food.  That completely rules.  The currry was very good, but the saag (incredibly sadly) fell short.  It was a little bland.  It wasn't bad per se, just not up to my admittedly high expectations for Saag-anything.

I felt like it took a long time for the food to come out (given that we were the only people there), but I could've just been impatient for delicious Indian food.  After all, my tummy can't tell time.
