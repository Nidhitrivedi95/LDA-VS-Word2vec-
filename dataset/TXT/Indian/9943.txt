9coZa838egYONxSdTe-wUg My husband and I left in agreement -- this was one of the worst places either of us has ever eaten. The restaurant was completely empty and silent when we arrived around 1pm to have lunch. We ordered tea, vegetarian mo-mo dumplings, and two curry dishes. The tea and dumplings were fine but definitely a bit over spiced. Then the two main dishes were utterly inedible. Flavorless. Lumpy. With ingredients that could not have been fresh. Totally gross.
