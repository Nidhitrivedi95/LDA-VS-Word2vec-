Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ I've always been to the Monroeville location and the food is great! I am not much of a reviewer but I thought people should benefit from my review and eat here at least once to know how good it is. The naan is out of this world and chicken tikka masala is great. The service is great too - just the seating and interiors, I'm not really fond of but that's fine I guess. With so little good Indian food options in Pittsburgh, this is a must go place!
