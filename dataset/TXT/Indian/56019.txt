XH46cVevXAwApGLVuZ3fqw Indian food is by far my favorite and honestly getting good Indian food usually means learning to prepare it yourself. Not the case with Raj! This place has some of the best Indian sauces and dishes I have ever tasted. I love their food so much that when I was pregnant with my first child it was all I craved! (Mostly at breakfast time so I purchased a meal the night before and found that even microwaves couldn't remove the amazing flavors!
