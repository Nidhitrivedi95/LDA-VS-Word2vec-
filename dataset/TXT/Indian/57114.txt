XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw Update of the old review-- saag paneer roti was back to its deliciousness tonight!

2012: i am sorry to give Mother India only three stars. i found the place a few years ago on Yelp and fell in love with the saag paneer roti. i think they have a new chef. the dish is still "okay" but it has lost the deep, richness that kept me coming back.
