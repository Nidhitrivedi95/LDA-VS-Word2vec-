8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I'm not an expert on Indian food, but I really enjoyed the food at Sitara. It was absolutely delicious. I had the lamb vindaloo. The lamb was tender and tasty. The menu says it's spicy, but I didn't think it was spicy. I do like spicy food though, but I thought it was very manageable. I also had the garlic naan and oooh my goodness!!!! It is SOOOO good!!!! You have to try the garlic naan! I will be getting the garlic naan every time I come here. 

The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I thought the portions were too small for the price. I still got full from my meal, but I still think the portions should be bigger for the price.
