YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw Came here w a large group on a Friday night. The evening started off smoothly enough - our waiter was friendly and quick to bring waters for everyone. The meal took a turn for the worse at that point. The waiter disappeared for 45 mins while we waited to place our order. When he got around to us he kept ducking out while we ordered to take care of other patrons. The food took nearly another 40 mins to arrive, so do not come here if you are starving when you sit down as I was. 

The food - to preface this I have eaten Persis catered food at many an event and have usually enjoyed it. However the waiter was not clear on spice levels so you have been warned - don't order above a mild (#2) unless you want to be crying in pain during your meal! I am of south Asian descent and I ordered medium spice goat biryani. It was nearly inedible.  Not to mention they had cooked the goat in way too many cloves. Chili paneer app was delicious, as was gobi manchurian, although gobi was again quite spicy. Fellow companions enjoyed their more mildly spiced lamb vindaloo. 

Now reaching the end of this epic meal, our waiter disappeared once again and the bill took 30+ mins to arrive after two companions chased him down twice. Once we got our bills we were told the credit card machine was broken and the waiter had to hand write (!) my number down to charge me later. So yet another warning - bring cash. 

My thoughts - if you have a craving for biryani or manchurian style (Indian Chinese) food, place a takeout order. But I cannot recommend sitting down for a meal.
