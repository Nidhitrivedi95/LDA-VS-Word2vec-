MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g So I love dining out and would love eating outside almost at most of the places. Sometimes the thing I don't like about some of the Indian restaurants(and I'm not generalizing anything here) is that they just take it for granted that Indians will visit a restaurant like this and it does affect in a way how they provide service thereby. 

I was told that they can't split the bill as there are a lot of people waiting in the queue. I mean, what? Ofcourse I didn't act right then but didn't feel happy at all. The food overall was okay there are a lot of factors which determine a restaurant's quality.
