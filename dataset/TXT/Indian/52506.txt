Lots of folks have wrote a lot of details, so I'll keep mine very short - AWESOME! Love the chicken dishes and desert choices. Also, on Fri-Sun, there's always something special available -- once there was Pav Bhaji w/buns and another time there was Chole Bhatura. Outstanding!

I've been there on their opening and several times since. Very consistent quality. Service is good too, in terms of bringing out naans and dosas. 

Keep it up guys!
