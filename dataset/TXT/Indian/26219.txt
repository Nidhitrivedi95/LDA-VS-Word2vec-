IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA Not knowing until the other day that this Indian restaurant is just around the corner from work, we decided to check it out for a carry-out order.

The young lady working that night was very friendly and had our food bagged and ready to go shortly after arrival.  Carry-out was quick and simple.

As for the food, it's pretty darn good.  The chicken saag I had was full of flavor (though it could have been a tad spicier).  The vegetarian aloo dish we ordered was extremely good as well.  The naan was also quite tasty.

For the two of us, we dropped an easy $30 without drinks (wish it were a tad more affordable) but overall we liked the place.
