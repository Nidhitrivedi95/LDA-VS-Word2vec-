Me and my wife visited this restaurant for dinner on a Monday evening. We are vegetarians but am sure my non-vegetarian friends would have cursed more than am doing now. 

Every dish was either toooooo oily or toooooo buttery ... the taste was same ranging from veg pakora to channa chat to malai kofta to Vegetable kuruma and even palak panneer was tasting the same... 

The best i liked was raita and achar (pickle)... it was atleast edible and i enjoyed my raita rice towards the end of my main  course... 

You would be surprised to hear from me, mango pudding was 200% thicker version of Mango lassi served in any Indian restaurant in US. And the jamun was probably prepared when my granny passed away 10 years back... 

The restaurant is cramped and not enough space to walk around either.. In all, i really feel sad that Americans living here in Pittsburgh are tasting a false face of Indian cuisine... People please dont conclude this is Indian food.. write to me if you really want to try some good indian food.. I will suggest you good places...
