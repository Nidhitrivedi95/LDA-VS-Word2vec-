MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw I must say, the etiquette of the food is on point. It's not common to find food with such fines in a place like Richmond Hill. I was quite satisfied with the portions and knew very well that I was paying for upscale dining (so I anticipated smaller portions), but this was great. The restaurant itself, had a nice ambience; however, I would have appreciated some candles and lower lighting. The washrooms were gross, they definitely need to upgrade that. Finally, the services was rather mediocre. I wasn't impressed by my waiters and the service was slow. All-in-all, great food, great portions, great ambience; nice waiters and very friendly, they just need to be a  little on their A-game.
