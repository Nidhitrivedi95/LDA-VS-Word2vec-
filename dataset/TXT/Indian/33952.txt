m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew Just walking in, my mouth watered from the smell.

Clean place, lovely staff, $18 taxes in

Bathroom is too far of a walk lol

Dessert selection is aweful. Just ice cream.

But everything is super delis, 

Im not ashamed to say i had 3 plates full of carbs, totally worth the food baby.

For sure going back,
