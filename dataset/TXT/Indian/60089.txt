zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw Damn, I thought this place was a secret. 

This place is what Yelp was made for. If you did not know - you would probably would not bother. 

This place is no secret to folks who love decent curries. Lots of regulars from the local Indian community to be found here and always some student newbies, occasionally with American accents. 

Mister Khan is really nice fellow and his friends in the back make tremendous curries. You could just wander in here and get a kebab or some pakora. However, the folks who know will sit in the back, get yourself a lovely beverage (no alcohol served - like all of the best Indian restaurants) and enjoy the fabulous curries. The portions are immense and the curries and breads are always well made.  

Finally, when you leave the price will startle you. It is stupidly low priced. 

Wouldn't it be great if all of the places that looked Kebab Mahal were this good. A nasty looking off-license with a security screen had some lovely Chimay or Gambrinus in the beer chiller? Or a cheap cafe that served the greatest breakfast ever? 

So, I told you - yeah it is great - now don't spoil it.
