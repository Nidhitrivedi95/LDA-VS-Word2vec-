A little on the hot/spicy side.  The naan was really good and service was really good.  We didn't wait long, and they kept an eye on the table.  The downside?  They played football on the big screen in the main dining room.  I like football, but if I wanted to watch a game, I would have picked my dinner up or ordered pizza.  I asked them to turn it down, which they did not.  There were only a few people in the restaurant, none of which even glanced at the screen.  Basically, the guys that worked there were watching the game.  It was loud and ruined the whole Indian dining experience.  Even worse, they could have played it low in the bar section and it would have been just fine.  The restaurant itself was beautiful.  So....if you want to go to watch a game while you eat - this is the place for you!
