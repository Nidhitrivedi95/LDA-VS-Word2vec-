aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ My first time with my friends. The decor is amazing with some Bollywood touch to it. It reminds you of Indian streets. Ordered butter chicken and chicken tikka kathi roll. Enjoyed butter chicken. Initially wanted shammi kabab roll but the owner/ manager said they didn't have lamb meat. They also have a bar, and a cocktail pitcher for $8.99 but again were told they didn't know how to prepare it as the bar tender was not there. Was a little disappointed because it was a Friday night and you would think all this would be available. Overall food was good hence a 4 star rating.
