Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg I am finally reviewing Trimurti after eating there several times in the past year. I absolutely love their chicken biryani (yes, there is more to Indian food than butter chicken). They manage to get a lot of flavour in their dishes unlike some other Indian restaurants in the city. I have gone in for their lunch buffet a few times and the food has been finger licking delicious every time. I have also taken my coworkers, friends many times and they all seem to like it. 

They have a really good buffet menu with a lot of meat/seafood options...goat curry (hard to get in GTA), shrimp or fish curry, chicken tandoori and of course the butter chicken. They also have the biryani sometimes in the buffet. The desserts are also nice with mostly fresh fruits, Gulab Jamun, ice creams which most people seem to miss as they are located opposite to the buffet station. They have a few western desserts too. 

The owner is quite friendly and the service is not bad. The place can get busy on weekends so be sure to call in for reservations. Try this place, you won't be disappointed as this is the best Indian lunch buffet I could find in Toronto.
