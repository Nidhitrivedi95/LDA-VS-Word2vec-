J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Namaste butter chicken haven. You want authentic Delhi Butter Chicken - sweetish, red in color as opposed to the orange-ish North American variant, fresh? This resraurant will serve you it and more with soft white rice and let's not forget to order the fluffy naans. And I've never had better. This is coming from someone who has lived in Delhi, so take my word for it.

For an Indian food first timer, I highly suggest opting for the meat combo ($16.95 for one/ $31.95 for two). It's a platter of Tandoori chicken (think dry bbq chicken), Reshmi Kebab (soft kebabs), Lamb Tikka, Tandoori prawn (dry), Butter Chicken (the best, you'll want more), pulao rice, vegetable curry, and naan bread. My boyfriend and I ordered "for one" since we weren't too hungry and I'll tell ya this, it was quite the feast. He wanted to try some different types of Indian food, hence the order. Else, I'd just order rice, naan and a large portion of butter chicken. 

Apart from the food, the restaurant is small but immaculate and classy in appearance. The prices are hard to beat. It's perfect for a affordable romantic dinner. As for a verdict, I am totally coming back; although I'd like to try the two restaurants adjacent to it as well, both Indian, Trimurti and India Palace.
