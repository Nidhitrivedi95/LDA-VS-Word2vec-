qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA This is a really strange but cool place, it seems they can't make up their mind on whether they want to be a pub or indian or chinese or thai or asian fusion or a bunch of other stuff, it's just a mish mash of a whole bunch of random foods but it actually works!

The decor is also really random but adds character to the place, and you can't complain about the cheap food with good portions. You'll see a lot of artsy and musician types here and they also have a bunch of vegetarian options as well. Whether you're looking for just a pub to kick back a few beers or are looking for some cheap good food to fill you up and you can't decide on what type of restaurant to go to just head over here and you'll get some good food!
