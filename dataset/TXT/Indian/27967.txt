IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Persian Cuisine has a special place in my belly.  I love middle eastern food when it is done right.

Tasty Kabob is a paradise for vegetarians and carnivores, and I often visit this place in the unnatural company of each.  

It is a sit-down restaurant, the service is good, and they have take out if you are staying in.

All three of their stews are fantastic, and everything I have ever eaten there has been a delight.
