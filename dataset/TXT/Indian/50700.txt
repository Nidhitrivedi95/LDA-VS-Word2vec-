UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Indian food is funny. It always insights three major decisions: 

1. F I'm white, I forgot to tell them "hey, I'm not white on the inside." 
2. Naan or rice? No, naan and rice, but damnit I hate the bill when I see it charged. 
3. How come in Indian food terms... two entrees is never enough? It's always two meats & a side entree to share. It always turns out perfect, which is why I hold it too a higher level in my dining out than the ol' Canadian (New) of single entrees and fried appetizers. 

The passing of entrees... the sharing of left overs. The eating with hands with shared naan. It takes on its own/better way of dining. 

Damn do I dislike tablecloths and rooms without music, and that's what we have here. I'll never get over how much I don't like it and I'll never get over how anywhere I've traveled with an Indian restaurant comes this. 

And ghee, this food is heavy. The standard three entree situation is not necessary. Leftovers can happen with two, and one entree with naan is honestly enough food. If there's one entree to get... it's mater paneer. Or, maybe, the lamb vindaloo. Okay, just get both. The butter chicken is like biting a stick of butter like a candy bar. Don't do it. 

I blew their minds with asking for ice with the masala chai. They brought out a bowl of ice with a spoon. Once they witnessed my genius on this hot day, they brought out more. Thank you.
