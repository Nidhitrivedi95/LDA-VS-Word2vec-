CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Came here for dinner with a medium-sized group.  I'm don't know authenticity of Indian food, but I've been to a few Indian restaurants.  The naan was great, main dishes were mainly pretty good.  Service was pretty awful though.  Nothing outright offensive, but it really seemed like they didn't care at all.  It took half an hour after the first people were seated to get our glasses filled with water, and it wasn't like they were under-staffed.  The ladies' bathroom was not maintained, and the floors were super greasy.  The decor is alright, but it was too dim.  We ate moderately and the bill came to $30/person, after everything.
