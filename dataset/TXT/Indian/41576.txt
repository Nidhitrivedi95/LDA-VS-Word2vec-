q0oPX1DXW86QytTvvrD9MA We were on a weekend trip from Detroit and of the many things we wanted to do is eat Sri Lankan. 

We should have called first, like one of the other Yelpers. This place was closed for anything but advanced reservations/catering, according to the sign on the door. Sad times.

Instead, I used my spidey sense to locate other Sri Lankan stores and one of the owners pointed us to the gigantic Sri Lankan grocery store and take away place on the other side of the parking lot. The vadai were hot and fresh, but we had to search elsewhere for a dine in restaurant.

The Yelp gods that be, please push the more recent reviews higher so we can all avoid this kind of disappointment! Or someone post about how good they are at catering ;)
