zR12ySz1Ew1qAP-yPJDHAQ In general I'm against eating at places with the word Factory in the name. It seems wrong, so this place should change their name, because they're pretty good.

Their Chicken Vindaloo was perfectly balanced hot and sour and the paneer, on it's own as an appetizer, was scrumptious. They didn't have samosas or mutter paneer, which are admittedly white people Indian food, but I hey, I'm a small white girl and sometimes those just hit the spot. Others were all about the Butter Chicken, and it was definitely decent. 

The service was slow, but I'm not going to go into detail about it, because it really didn't ruin the evening whatsoever.

PEPPER PROPS: To Chris P for organizing a fab evening. It was a cornucopia of flavors and jest. 

PEPPER'S PISSED: Cash or Visa only. No debit. 4 blocks to the gas station. Not cool.
