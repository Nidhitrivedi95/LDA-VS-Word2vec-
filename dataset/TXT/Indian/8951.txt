8-4EI1VyBQsMEvScE4LEJw I think I've finally found my go-to place for Indian food. There are a lot of Indian restaurants in the Yonge and Eglinton area, but unfortunately they are all very average. I was glad when I found out about this place because it was just a 10 minute drive away.

The restaurant is small and cozy. The waiters and staff are all very pleasant. Our waiter, SIngh, was very patient with all of our questions about the menu. We ordered two appetizers, two main dishes and some wine. Their samosas were huge, and the garlic vegetable balls were one of the best things I've ever tried. You MUST try them!

The main courses are very reasonably priced. The service is quick and prompt; the waiter always made sure our glasses were full. The food was outstanding and on par with some of the 'high-end' Indian restaurants I've tried in the past. 

The restaurant did get busy around 7:30. There are limited seats, so if you have a large group (4 or more) you are safer by making a reservation. 

I am definitely going back to this place very soon.
