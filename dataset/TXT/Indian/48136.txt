TFDT0ueZ3b3uyyMzhJFHTA Loved the Delhi Sarvanna Bhavan so was here to give this place a try.. not sure if buffet time was worse time to try the food but my rating is for the buffet food.

Ambience: 4/5 (on any other day would have given 5/5, only issue it's a little small place to have a buffet)
Service: n/a since it was a buffet I wouldn't rate the service coz there were a lot of people and food delays were natural
Quality: 2.5/5 (food was average, not what I had expected and in comparison to what I have had)
Quantity:5/5(since it was buffet)
Overall, it was a 3/5 for me, deserts were too sweet food was cold. I will definitely give them a try but not on a buffet day
