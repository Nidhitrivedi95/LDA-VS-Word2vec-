auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Ordered take out the other night. We asked the guy taking the order what their best chicken dish was and he suggested karahi chicken. Ended up ordering karahi chicken, palak paneer, dal makhani,naan and roti for our guests.
When we brought home the order, we realized they had given us shahi or karahi paneer instead of the chicken. I called back and the guy was apologetic and offered to deliver the chicken to us. SInce the order had taken over 40 minutes and it was a busy saturday night, we offered to come and pick it up.
4 points for customer service as they compensated by giving us a complimentary pulao rice, and some achar relish and corrected the order.
2 points for the food however:

dal makhani-was extra creamy but tasted the best of the lot.
palak paneer-was ok
chicken karahi-which they claimed was the best chicken option was flavorless and pretty tasteless.
pulao-was not bad, pretty decent.
naan and roti were well made.
they let us keep the paneer karahi as well, but unfortunately that was pretty tasteless too.

I usually love leftover food the next day but this I was happy to get rid off.

I will try them again as this may have been a freak day since they were busy, but it was disappointing considering our guests were looking forward to a nice indian meal and price wise the place is not cheap! I guess I will stick to the buffet for this one, as somehow the buffet experience has been ok every time but have not had the same luck with take out orders.
