LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Guru Lukshmi's rave reviews are definitely accurate. The place is massive so at 12:10 pm on a Sunday we were seated within minutes. The menu is extensive, literally every variety of dosa including dessert! As a traditionalist I went for aloo masala dosa. Make sure you say crispy thin if you want it to be made that way. The dosa came with 3 chutneys and sambar. They were delicious! The potato masala was perfect with the perfect amount of spice. Next we ordered madras filter coffee for a true South Indian experience. It was good. For my son I ordered a kids dosa which was smaller and not too spicy.My little one saw the candy dosa on the kids menu so we finished off with that. It was essentially a crepe with a thin layer of chocolate topped with powdered sugar. Overall the place was very clean, lovely decor and well organized and wait staff were attentive. I loved it and definitely will be back!
