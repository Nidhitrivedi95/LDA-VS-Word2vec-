g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ A hidden gem in the Bloor West Village area, located right below the Pizza Pizza. In fact, it seems a bit sketchy at first going down and there was no one to greet us at the door, but we were seated quickly and offered water and crunchy deliciousness.

The decor looks like a mix of European bar meets a basement wine cellar...it has a rustic, cavernous, and yet romantic sort of feel...a great place for a date if you like quiet and actually being able to hear the person sitting across from you.

We had the prawn pakoras which were succulent with just a hint of spice -- best I've had...I was very happy that they did not overcook the prawns, which I find is the type of thing that restaurants tend to do often.

Chicken jalfrezi and lamb vindaloo with a side of saffron rice and plain naan...incredibly full by the end of our meal, to the point that my innie may have become an outie (and I was hoping for a kulfi for dessert, but there is always next time).

Pretty close to the best Indian I've had in Toronto...the chicken was just a touch dry, but the lamb was incredibly tender. Great service as far as refilling our waters and checking on how we were enjoying the food. Wish we could have eaten more...we'll need to fast next time to make sure everything fits in our bellies ;-)
