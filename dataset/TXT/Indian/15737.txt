CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ We went to this place today after searching for a best restaurant in Mississauga. This place came on the top and i was doubtful if it will be like a take away place. However we thought of taking a chance. Dono how we missed this place for last 9 months. Everything we ordered was amazing. Tandoori chicken, chili chicken and  afghan chicken were outstanding.we will definitely come back frequently to this place. If you live around, don't miss this place, you will regret.

Update: I missed to say about the service, service was excellent too.
