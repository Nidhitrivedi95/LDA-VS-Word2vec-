Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I had the Pa-lak Paneer and it was alright. It didnt have much flavor to it but I did get filled with the portion and it was spicy. If I was basing this review on my dish alone I would probably rate this place 3 stars but my girl absolutely loved their salad, vegetable soup and papadum. She says she wants to come here everyday from now on. I want to come back during their buffet hours to see if I might like this spot more. The dinner prices are sort of high even with the 15 percent discount we were given cause we almost left with just a menu but the discount kept us there. I don't like how the rice is sold separately. My dish without the rice was about 13 bucks and the rice was another $3. Thats pretty pricey for a dish that didn't taste that great. I like how the papadum is free and is already ready to go next to the sauces. We will be coming back. I'm sure I'll like it more next time.
