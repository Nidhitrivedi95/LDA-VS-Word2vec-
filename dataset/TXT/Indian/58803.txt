YPHUfRvUo44LvsaXRTg4fw I was happy to see that there was a new Indian restaurant in town. 
I wasn't sure what to expect but we were very pleasantly surprised. The food was fabulous. Super tasty and my boyfriend who is new to Indian food loved it too. The service was good -a bit on the slow side but I think that was because everything was made so fresh. We loved that the chef came and delivered the food too. 
We would definitely recommend this place and will be returning soon. Yum!!
