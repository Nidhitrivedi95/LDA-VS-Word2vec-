Mwam4l5sMY3EPkJIKYxPFA After eating here several times, actually several days in a row, Peacock Express has become my new fav Indian takeout/resto.. They are not that big in size but they do have comfy seating and enough area if you want to dine in. I have to say that everything I tried there is really good, I mean the kind of good that makes you want to come back again the next day, which is exactly what I did.

One of my favourite dishes is the Butter Chicken that you can get with naan or rice (the naan is amazing btw, you can eat that stuff by itself). The Butter Chicken is tender and moist, the sauce is just the right amount of creamy and spices, hence my 4 day in a row visit. Another dish that is worth mentioning is their paneer, which is a combination of rich sauce with peas and some kind of cheese, much like a thicker ricotta. When you order it freshly made, the peas just go pop in your mouth. They sometimes use spinach instead of peas. I definitely will keep this place on my list of regular restos to frequent.
