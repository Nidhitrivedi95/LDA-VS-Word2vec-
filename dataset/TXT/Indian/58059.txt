- No qualms about the entrees. Really good food - always rich and flavorful . 

Negatives : 
- Salad has a bitter taste & would be great if they are at least flexible in replacing the salad with lassi - so that people get to enjoy the better things Dhaba has to offer
- Customer service - the lady at the entrance is extremely disinterested and never friendly
