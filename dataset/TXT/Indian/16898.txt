DnjcJblNc5MxwmGNQBg03Q Indian in the sense they serve Indian food.  I don't think they taste their food, because it's not very good.  Indian should be an excellent celebration of spices and veg and rice.  And if you are two blocks south of Little India, you had better get your ducks in a row.  This place, had little going for it.

For a place that boasts a chef with 20 years experience in England, I honestly wonder if he really gets it.  English curries were never really that good though.  I chase Indian around the planet, and this place isn't remarkable outside of how common it is.  Having the kitchen open and hearing the microwave beep, is not "Traditional Indian".  

Chef, if you read this, be proud of what you deliver.  You're not doing anybody any favours with what you have now.
