hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw After an emergency room visit, there's nothing like good Indian food to life the spirits. This place is tucked away in a strip mall- in the back corner even. I've had left overs for 3 days now and am totally lovin' it.

The Paleek Paneer was awesome and they were very generous on the big cubes of cheese. I also had the Lamb Mantra which I'll happily order again.

I only wish the prices were a little less and they were so far OUT west!
