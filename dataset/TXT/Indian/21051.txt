GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Visited on 11/14/2014 for the first time. Restaurant has a modern look inside and fast serves even though they were short staffed that evening. We ordered the following:

Tikka Masalsa fries $ 5 (Appetizer)  excellent flavors... loved the cheese and crispy fries.
TIkka Masala  Shrimp  $ 9 : Served with rice or naan bread  served with a couple of shrimp only but the flavors were good 

Traditional Curry Chicken  served with rice or naan bread /// delicious chicken

Cheese Naan  - MUST TRY Delicious !!  
Garlic Naan- very tasty

Bill came out to $28 loved the food would come back AGAIN !!  :D
