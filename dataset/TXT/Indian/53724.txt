ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA I ordered delivery since e it was a cold raining evening in Las Vegas.  it arrived on time as promised and hot. The tikka chicken was delicious, just the right amount of spice.  The nann was cooked great, nice and fluffy.  The only disappointment was the vegetable samosas. They were very heavy and greasy.   I can't wait to dine there in person.
