9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A I went to this place a couple of years ago...I think I may have gone twice it was so good. Not sure what's happened but it's gone downhill. The Aloo Ghobi was the worst I've ever had..not flavour at all. And the rest of the meal was just meh. Service was decent though. The decor is also worn down quite a bit. This place needs a total refresh.
