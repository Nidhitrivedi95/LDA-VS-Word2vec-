Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I am staying at a hotel off strip and so I tried two off strip Indian restaurants and Tamba on the strip, all for lunch buffet. Food at Tamba was hands down the best, even though the most expensive, but not by much. All vegetarian dishes were very flavorful. Decor also improved from 2 years ago when I last visted them. It was also the only restaurant of the three where I saw Indian customers, for what is worth.
