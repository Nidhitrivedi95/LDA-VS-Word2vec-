h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ Do not go to this place for lunch buffet. You feel like you are standing in line at a soup kitchen as the food is kept in a corner with virtually limited access. It will take you up to 15 minutes to get some food on the buffet line depending upon the day of the week. By the time you reach the food you realize that half of it is empty.  I wonder if this is by design since you end up eating a very limited amount of food. You might be lucky if you are able to get one full plate of food on Fridays. I would rather go to Mayuri palace or Karaikudi palace for a lunch buffet than this place especially on Fridays. Food here is spicier than the other places so I enjoy it but that's up to you.
