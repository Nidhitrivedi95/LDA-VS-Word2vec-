The tiffin was a well-priced combo where you can have rice, one meat dish and one vegetarian dish for $6.99 plus tax. You have the choice of rice vs. spinach rice. I'm not sure why there's a choice because the spinach is pretty lacking and doesn't add much but whatever. 

I got the butter chicken because I find that's a good place to start when summing up a new Indian place. The chicken itself was fine but I found the texture of the sauce to be a bit pasty and yeah, not so flavourFULL. 

I also ordered a brand spankin' new dish- the spicy lentils- and there was some nice spice going on! However, I could not make out the actual lentils for it was all mush and the pasty after-texture made a second appearance. 

I know Veda wants to be healthy but it does come at the expense some taste and texture. It's a nice alternative to fast food come lunch time.
