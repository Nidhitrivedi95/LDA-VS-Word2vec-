I was admittedly a tad concerned when through the glass window a not so Indian atmosphere. To late to back out now without wife wrath. The venue lacked...about everything, but it was clean and the food on the various tables looked wonderful. Our server was very helpful and offered plenty of help. We had decided (before we even got there) on garlic naan which became a delicious garlic cheese naan. Safron's tikka masala was probably the very best ever delicately seasoned that you could clearly taste the savory Indian spices, none overpowering another; and served with a choice of rice. We selected basmati which was excellent and neither over or under cooked. Done just right. We also had an Indian Chinese Fusion dish, Hakka Noodles which was a moderately spicy noodle dish sauteed with chicken. Wonderful blend of spices, onion and red and green peppers. Oh, and the serving sizes are quite generous. 

Safron has been open for about 4 years. Had it not been for this coupon we would have never known about it. We also were told that they have a weekday AYCE buffet from 11-2. Check with them for details. We both gave Safron 2 thumbs up as already looking forward to our return. Maybe we'll see you there. If so, wave and say "Hey Howard!"
