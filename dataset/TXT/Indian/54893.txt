WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA Having had a bad experience at my last lunchtme buffet visit i thought to try again

My wife was anxious to have indian for dinner and we decided to try them at dinner time due to the warm ambiance of their place and it being less noisy than some other places we go to

Well I must say its quite a different experience in the evening. Warm and attentive service and the place was busy with Indian families and several birthday parties.

With focus on seafood based dishes and the mandatory Burtha I can say the food was very very good and the dinner service excellent.

They rock out the naan and pickles like everyone else but being a fussy seafood eater I enjoyed the dishes. It takes extra effort to rock out a fish dish and with extra effort in quality makes for a tasty meal.

I mentioned to the server that i was disappointed with the lunch buffet and the owner came by and assured me that they had some changes in the kitchen staff and with menu selection changes for the lunch buffet that i can be assured of a good meal at lunch.

Pricing is the norm with generous portions
