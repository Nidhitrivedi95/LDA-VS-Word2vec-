First off, Toronto Pearson Airport is very tech savvy as you order from an iPad and you get to see pictures of the food you are interested in. The whole family ordered Chicken Biryani because we are familiar with it and it did not disappoint as it was very flavorful and had only a mild kick. Other dishes looked good as well but we were strapped on time and wanted to go for the sure thing. The portion is decent sized and will leave you satisfied. Definitely recommend trying if you are in the international terminal.
