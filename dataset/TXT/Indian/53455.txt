VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg I am not a fan of spicy Indian food but decided to give it a try and started with place everybody was excited about.
Atmosphere of the place was nice, restaurant was spaceous, I love sthe tablecloths and attentive service. Food was good and fresh but not all that zesty or exotic. House salad was made with discounted cucumbers and spiced up with paprica and dressed with oil and vinegar. Chicken was bright orange but still tasted just like regular roasted drumbsticks. I constantly had a feeling I could whip up such a dinner at home given a right recipe.
The rest of the food was averagely good. Alcohol drinks also felt somewhat discounted but would get you drunk I guess. 
Prices were outrageous. Over $100 for dinner for two (shuld have at least included man with a snake or swallowing the fire show).
Definetely didnt feel like trip to India.
