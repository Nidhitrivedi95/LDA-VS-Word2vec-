I got the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious and creamy. I wish it was a little spicy though. Garlic naan was amazing. Lots of garlic and flavor and bread was very soft. One thing I liked about this place was they give you rice without asking! Some places you have to ask for rice and they charge you but this place did not! Rice was fluffy. One plus about this place was when we were done with our food the server got a comb and brushed all the crumbs off of our table. I've never seen that done at a Indian restaurant here. :)
