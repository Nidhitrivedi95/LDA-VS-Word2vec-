llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Hi, today we have been there as a team of 14 people & the food tasted excellent.

Service took bit late & tables jumbled around, because of the huge inflow of people, which did not bother us as the food was excellent, well re-filled the buffet as quickly as it needs. Veg was a lot fresh tasting. The Chutney's were not stale/frozen like the other indian restaurants.

The owner himself was running around to make arrangements for the guest.
