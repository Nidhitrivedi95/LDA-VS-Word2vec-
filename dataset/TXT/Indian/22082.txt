GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I was very disappointed with this place. My boyfriend and I went on a Thursday night and the place was almost empty. There were only 4 other tables besides us. When we walked in there was a sign saying to wait to be seated, so we waited, and waited. Finally after about 4 minutes, one of the staff looked up from something behind the bar and noticed us. He instructed us to "sit wherever". We chose a table by a window on the North side of the restaurant(apparently a bad choice) . After another 5 minutes we were given menus. Another 5 minutes later we were brought some water. We placed our order. We had Samosas for an appetizer. They tasted ok but were very dry. They were served with "Tamarind chutney" rather than a tamarind sauce. The chutney was mostly garbanzo beans with some fresh onion and cilantro and a tiny drizzle of tamarind sauce. We ordered Lamb Biryani and Chicken Korma plus rice and Naan. The Naan was very good and the Korma was ok. The Biryani was not good. The lamb was very dry and the dish really just tasted like bell peppers. The Raita was very watery and didn't add any flavor. 

During the meal we were ignored by the waitstaff. There were 2 people working and they checked on the 2 tables on the West side of the restaurant 3 times each while we were trying to flag them down for more water. Both of them hung out behind the bar. One was reading the other seemed to be on the internet. We finally got more water after about 15 minutes. Then we were ignored again while the waitstaff continued to cater to the other tables. We had to flag them down again for our bill, and again to get them to take the money. 

Never again.
