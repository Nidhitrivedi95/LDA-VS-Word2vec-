yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ I was completely disappointed with my last visit to Casablanca. As soon as my group walked in, we were met by a waitress that did not smile or greet us but merely slapped a few menus on the table and walked away. She proceeded to be rude and inattentive for the entire dinner, spending more time on her cellphone then serving us. She even messed up on our check twice (and they were not split checks either). In addition to this, I thought the food was average at best. The chicken tikka masala was a bit sour and the portions could have been bigger. The only reason I am giving them two stars instead of one is because my previous experience with them was not nearly as bad.
