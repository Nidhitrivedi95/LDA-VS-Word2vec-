muInTkijds_uH2uFzNMaNw What a pleasant surprise. Strolled in here with a hungry friend at 9 pm on a Friday night. The place was empty but we were greeted by a very friendly man. We ordered:

2 Samosas
1 Butter chicken
1 Naan
1 Plain rice
1 Chicken Biryani

The food came within reasonable time and it was full of flavour and freshly made. I don't like butter chicken normally but I tried my friend's dish and it was divine. The samosas were nothing to write home about. The naan was fresh and the rice had just the right amount of heat (though you could get it even hotter).  I would definitely come here again. I am happy that they also do deliveries. I'll be ordering from here again.

p.s. We both had leftovers for lunch the next day. It was great!
