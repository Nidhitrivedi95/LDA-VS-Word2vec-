OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I was solo-traveling through Montreal and decided to drop by this place, while the restaurant was packed they placed me in the bar area, where customers usually didn't sit but I was thoroughly amused. I got to see all the action of the waitresses and waiters, and the chatter and busy buzzing of the place was what made it fun. I saw some people sit on the floor to eat so that was pretty cool! All in all for the price, my Thali plate was excellent and the service was attentive.
