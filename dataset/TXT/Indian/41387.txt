Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Maharaja was one of the first restaurants I came to when I first moved to Madison from Long Beach/Artesia CA (where some of the best indian restaurants in the country are) and maharaja shot up to the top of my list. Wonderful buffet, predictably good, wonderful wait staff. I highly recommend Maharaja!
