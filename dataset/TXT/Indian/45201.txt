S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA My sister was visiting from California and we were looking for a good Indian restaurant.  We found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  We walked in 15 minutes before the restaurant actually opened.  We warmly welcomed and seated promptly.  A young gentleman quickly came over and welcomed us again.  He took our drink order and offered nan bread with our choice of flavor.  A few minutes later we were told the buffet was ready and we were invited to serve ourselves.  Everything in the buffet looked freshly prepared.  We sat down with our plate and upon our first bite we were hooked.

The food is delicious and the customer service is beyond great.  The two brothers who run this restaurant are constantly aware of customers needs and always willing to answer any questions about the food.  We will definitely return soon.
