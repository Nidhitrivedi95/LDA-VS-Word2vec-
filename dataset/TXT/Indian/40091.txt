pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw If you like Indian food, this is a must go in the Pittsburgh area, buffet is always great, and the owners are awesome!!! My sister flys in from Phoenix she has to come here every trip. When Taj Mahal was under construction and was only doing take out we went and the owners recognized my sister, set up 2 tables, and prepared a feast! There is no other Indian restaurant that comes close.
