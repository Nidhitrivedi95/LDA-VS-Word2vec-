After waiting almost an hour for our food, I got a call from a number I didn't recognize but figured I should probably answer just in case it involved our dinner.

It did.

It was our delivery guy complaining that he didn't want to park outside the building because he was afraid he'd get a ticket. And that's my problem how, exactly? He wanted me to come down and pick up the food, and I refused. I feel like this is a scam he pulls on every apartment he goes to because if you can avoid the hassle of actually delivering the food to the customer's door, why wouldn't you? I guess, anyway. I don't really know what he was thinking.

Anyway, I called his bluff and he delivered our food. (He kind of shoved it at me when I opened the door but whatever.)

So we ordered three things:

Vegetable Samosa ("A flour pastry crust stuffed with spiced potatoes, onions, green peas, lentils"): These are fine, I guess. They're well made and the ingredients seemed good, but they're awfully bland. They do come with a tangy, sweet sauce, and that certainly helped.

Lamb Vindaloo ("A fiery spicy curry from western india, cooked with spices, fresh ginger and kashmiri red chillies") and Beef Masala ("Tender chunks of beef tenderloin cooked with bell peppers, onions and garlic"): These are both decent dishes, and I especially enjoyed the Vindaloo. It was quite hot and flavorful. But the problem was virtually every bite contained something inedible, whether it was a bad piece of meat or a crunchy spice of some sort. It was actually pretty frustrating.

Between the bad service and odd assortment of inedible bits, I really can't see myself ever ordering Copper Chimney again.
