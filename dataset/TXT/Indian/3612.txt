0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Came based off of the Yelp reviews. Highly recommended dishes by others include the dry chili chicken and crispy beef. I ordered both and they were both different and delicious. I cant recommend one over the other so order both like I did! You wont be disappointed! food comes hot, fresh, and fast, lots of parking, but tiny hole in the wall spot that fills quickly! You will find all types of people eating here. Check it out
