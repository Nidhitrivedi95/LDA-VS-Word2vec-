scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Exceeded expectations!  The colorful decor and 2 walls of windows set the stage for a show of amazing food.  I'm not an Indian food expert, so my perspective may not be the widest, but this place rocks.  My dining partner is vegetarian,  and had the vegetables on curry (spiced 3 out of 6), and said it was among the best meals he's had.  I had the tandoori mixed grill, which is plenty for 2, (spiced 1 out of 6) and it was awesome, too.  We shared papadams for app, and a side of garlic naan.
On a Tuesday night,  the 2 waiters kept the moderate crowd well under control.
I will definitely be back.
