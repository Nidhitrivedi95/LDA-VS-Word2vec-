It is a bit of a turn off at first, until you turn the corner and see the amazing Sweets Display and take in the smell of lovely Indian spices cooking away.  I stood there for probably 5 minutes just salivating and taking in all the deliciousness in my view.  I was tempted to order one of everything but refrained.  

The cashier seemed impatient, clearly used to her regular customers who know what they want (ie. not me).  It was my first visit, so I was basing what I ordered by her recommendation.  She stated "just order the take-away box and the server at the counter will help you".  Sounds good to me.  She then told me the total.  I took out my $20 ready to fork it over.  "It'll be $7.90 please".  WHAT?!  Sweet!!!!!!!

When I went over to the counter, the 2nd lady was somewhat friendly and offered her recommendations.  I ordered exactly what she recommended, and my girl didn't let me down.  It was so good.  She even offered to make fresh Naan for me if I didn't mind waiting.  Needless to say, it was way worth the wait.  My only criticism is the food was only luke-warm; could have been a bit hotter (temperature wise).

Overall, if it weren't for the smelly carpet as my first impression, I would give 5+ stars.  Unfortunately first impressions are important to me and I'm a tad shallow so I can't forgive this one aspect.  

Would recommend for authentic Indian food only if you are willing to take away and not sit there to absorb the stinky carpets.
