gNhxs9nPUSkVBSSIRQOgaA We came here once, while on a five day vacation to Vegas, and we just continued to come here for almost all meals. I loved the vegetarian thali, chole bhaturas, chicken biryani, seekh kababs. Sweet lassi and mango lassi are not that great. But chai is good. Prices are decent as compared to what you have to pay for everything at Vegas. Location is also great as the fashion mall is quite close to all hotels at the strip! For a fast food place, it really was above our expectations.
