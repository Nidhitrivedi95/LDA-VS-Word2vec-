9MayJXMBLipjf8B_lEb6fA Well finally I have my first one star review. Rand H. and myself had lunch here today  and all the food on the buffet was cold to lukewarm. When we told the owner that the food was cold , he told us we were wrong , and that the food was hot and just cooked. Well I know the difference between hot and cold and no one should ever question or call their customer a liar. He did not even check to see if the food was actually hot. (one star). I will not return.
