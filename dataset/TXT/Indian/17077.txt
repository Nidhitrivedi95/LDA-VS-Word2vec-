DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I love this place, their food is all really excellent. I should qualify this by saying, I am new to Indian Food but their butter chicken is sooooooo good. OMNOMNOMNOM. I eat from here every chance I get. Our first visit the service was a little slow, and the butter chicken was a little bland but they fixed it immediately and we've never had issues since.
