tcclqqE4T8XbgS-02vsl6A A joke. An hour after opening and things still arent up and running. The food selection is more pathetic than your standard indian buffet and you have to buy food coupons in $20 packs. No cash allowed. Almost none of the exhibitors are present.

Just try the local restaurants and save your money
