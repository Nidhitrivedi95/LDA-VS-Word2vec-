J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I finally came here during non-buffet hours for dinner. Originally, I've given Little India Restaurant 5 stars, but it lost one star due to my dinner experience here.

Dinner time: The place was clean and the service was great as always. However, I wasn't too impressed with the food, it was okay. I tried the saag chicken (spinach with chicken) with naan bread, mango lassi (mango and yogurt drink) and their rasmalai for dessert (sweet cheese balls in sugary milk). The portions for everything were small, and the price was okay. The spinach in my saag chicken was spiced perfectly and tasted great, but the chicken was a tad bit dry. My mango lassi had too much ice in it. I never had a lassi with ice; it just waters it down and doesn't taste the same. The naan bread could use a little butter, it was a little stiff, but tasted alright. The rasmalai was delicious! The sweet cheese balls were topped off with crushed pistachio and the milk wasn't milky, it was very creamy and perfect.

Also, the lights in the restaurant were too dimmed while it was dark out. Thankfully I had a table by the window, the street lights from outside allowed me to see the food on the table. 

The dinner experience wasn't horrible, but I've had better. I think I'll stick to the amazing buffet this restaurant offers earlier in the day.
