PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA My fiancé tried to get me to come here months ago, but I stuck my nose up in disgust. Disgust from the memories of the first time I ever ate Indian food. It was a buffet in Columbus and I told myself I will never eat Indian food again. 
Well, I finally gave in and here I am writing a five star review. Our waitress was the most adorable little Indian lady who so happily greeted us at the door. She suggested the garlic naan and samosas for starters, which were AMAZING! When you come here I was told tandoori anything is a must, so I settled for the tandoori chicken which came out sizzling to perfection. And was so tender it fell right off of the bone. He ordered lamb korma and gave me the thumbs up sign as he chewed his first bite. We also ordered the sabzi curry as a side dish, I couldn't help myself but go back for seconds and thirds and fourths of the sabzi curry! We will be returning, and I have a new found love for Indian food.
