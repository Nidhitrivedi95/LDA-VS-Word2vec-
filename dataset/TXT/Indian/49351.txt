tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Indian oven has a great Buffett and staff that is so friendly! My friends and I enjoyed two plus plates and the Naan bread. 
They have a non vegetarian section, a vegetarian section, salad section and deserts. The flavors are so good. Some spice and some sweet. Everything is very fresh.
Go for lunch if your feeling for some variety!!
