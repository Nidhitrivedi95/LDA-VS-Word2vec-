W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg I found out about this place from the owner of the indian grocery that I shop at. Went there for the lunch buffet on a weekday and for the price it was good. More meat options than vegetarian, but still enough vegetarian food to fill me up. The vegetarian options included Jerra Aloo, palak paneer, and a black channa. All tasty with the complimentary dosas.  Only reason why I didn't give it five stars was because they didn't have my favorite chutney and the buffet prices were a mystery until we paid. The layout is L shaped and a little awkward but the people are friendly and the food was good. We will most likely go back in a few months.
