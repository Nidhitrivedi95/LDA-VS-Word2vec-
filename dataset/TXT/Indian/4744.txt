2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg I'm a person who goes to buffet on every weekend and I've been to almost all the restaurants including Indian Paradise 2, which was Mayuri's earlier name. I dont know where to start - The stale starters, the tasteless curries, lots of water poured into sambar just to increase the quantity, the chicken biryani which was smelling awfully horrible, not to mention the insipid, overly colored Gajar halwa (I thought they mixed Henna in it). And, as expected, food poisoning at the end of the day. To make matters worse, the owner said that this is mayuri's STANDARD and you can leave if you would like to. The food, the customer service, the owner's attitude sucks to the core- I wish there was a 0 star here.
