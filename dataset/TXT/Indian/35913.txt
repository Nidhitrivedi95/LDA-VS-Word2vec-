Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg The food here is very, very good. I definitely agree with the review that mentioned how fresh their Nan bread is. The atmosphere is cozy and the service we got was pleasant and attentive without being intrusive. For dinner I had the Gosht Rogan Josh Lamb with some extra spice requested - the portion size was decent and the quality of the meat was great (not fatty and chewy). We also ordered the Tarka Dal which was very nicely flavoured with a very subtle smokiness. If you are crawling along Queen St. you will pass a few other Indian options but this one is definitely worth a visit.
