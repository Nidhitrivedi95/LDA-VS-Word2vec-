pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA One of the best places to go for dosa. I've been to most of south India n have a great tastebuds for south indian food. They serve the best sambar n coconut chutney.

I would suggest to try their idlis dipped in sambar. Had those after a pretty long time abd they are a must for me to take everytime i visit this place.

Mysore masala dosa n uttapam are great. 

Bonus:- they serve buffet in dinner 
Not so bonus:- buffet is limited and can be expanded. 

Suggestion to store:- please start preparing rava dosa too as there are (i hope so) lot of rava fans craving for some nice dosas.
