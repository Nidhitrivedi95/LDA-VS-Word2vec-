0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Theres not much more to be said other than that this restaurant is my go to hakka chinese food and is a fan favourite for all my friends and family. 

I always order the manchurian gobi, its fried cauliflower covered in amazing spices and never dissapoints. I also recommend the spice and pepper wings and manchurian fried rice, these two items come in large portions big enough for a family of four. 

I'd also recommend order take out and paying in cash as theres a 10% cash discount. In addition, weekend dinner time can get super busy, pick up times can go up to 45 minutes!
