KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA Wow, this hit the spot. I am from Pakistani origin so I am a big critic when it comes to Pakistani food and this place ranked very high.

Me and my work buddies went in by lunch time to check this place out. I booked mark it on yelp when we were driving back from another place. 

The service was quite good, the server was helpful in explaining the menu and portion size of the dishes. They have a sign stating their will be a wait of about 15 to 20 mins as they cook everything fresh and Wow it was fresh and hot!.

So I ordered their Chicken Tikka Masala. The dish was hot and cooked to perfect, the portion size and pieces of boneless chicken were the right size and the naan just came out of the tandoor so it was fresh as well. The dishes also came with rita and some onions...

Over all very exciting menu, I will be back to try more.

For my Muslim peeps! This area is common to serve halal meat and They serve halal meat at this location mentioned in the store and on their menu.
