4ChWAqNuzhsYB14_BCPbEw Customer service is awful. Called to place an order and was asked to wait 2 mins which led to the person hanging up. Called right after and they didn't answer. Called for a 3rd time only to be asked to hold again for 5 mins. After 10 mins, they ask to call back in 3 hours instead of just taking the order and asked me to take the business elsewhere...

Food may be good but attitude needs some checking. Will not be going there.
