fHqJZK0D9E91ltD62SwzSw Gandi's is possibly my favourite Indian restaurant in Edinburgh.  It always offers delicious food in filling portions and great service to match.  As soon as we walked in the friendly waiters greeted us with a pleasant welcome, and even recognised us after having only been in once before.  The place has a really nice ambiance with all the decor making you feel right at home.
The menu has an comprehensive range of authentic Indian dishes from the classic curries to tandoori kebabs and pakoras.  I went for the lamb dansak which had tender chunks of meat in a rich sauce with lentils.  My mate went for the chicken tandoori kebabs which were seriously spicy and just about blew his head off!
All told our meals came to about £10 each and we'll hopefully be coming here again soon.
