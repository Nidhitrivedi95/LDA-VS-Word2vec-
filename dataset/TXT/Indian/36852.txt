nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Give it a 4 star considering the healthiness and surprise of the place!  Was a great meal that wasn't overseasoned/salted and def high quality food.  Salmon was just OK but everything else was good and i don't feel like crap after.  Affordable set price and definitely  a must-go place!
