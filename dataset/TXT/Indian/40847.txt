PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g Made a reservation over a month ago for 17 people. 1 week before the event we doublechecked the reservation to make sure everything was ready and they backed out of hosting the event and tried to charge us an extra $200 just for service. We ended up choosing a backup location for the event. Very unhappy with their poor communication skills.
