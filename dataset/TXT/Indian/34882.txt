Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg My friend was looking for a place to fit her new diet for a girls night out on the strip, and this is what she found. I had never really been into Indian food before, but not trying it and having other places, this place is pretty good. The service is good if you're a bunch of girls...haha. There are a couple of waiters that the girls lust over, so they definitely pay attention to us when we come in. The service has been delayed in that regard, but only delayed with us getting the check. 

 I've been there for the buffet and I've ordered individual dishes. I love every dish I've had with chicken in it. I don't usually like curry to much, but I love the curry dishes here. I usually get 7-10 on the spice level as well. There are also a lamb dish that is amazing, which is best spicy. I think most things are best spicy. 

This is a great place to go on the strip for Indian food, and if you have a large group. They also have a back room that people seem to use quite frequently for large parties.
