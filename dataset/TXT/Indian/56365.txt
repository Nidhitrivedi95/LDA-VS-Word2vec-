XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw This would be the 4th time I've been there - it took me a little bit since it's the first Tibetan foodspot I tried - I like it.

My first impression was - wow, it's just like "asian food" except...different? I'm not sure what it is, but it definitely looks very similar. Tastes a little blander but I like it that way - you can actually taste the food, and not just the seasoning.

I got a dish with 3 types of meat + veggies + noodles.I didn't think the proportion was that big until i started eating it- I definitely didn't get to finish the dish or the fried dumplings we ordered. The stuffing in the dumplings were just the way I like it - beef and chives with bits of onion. AWESOME.

The fried dumpling was simply delicious - as was the food - so much so that I took the rest of it home. The next day, it was STILL delicious!!!!

The service was also very good- I think she may have been psychic, because every time i thought , "Oh I need ...." she was RIGHT there with a big smile with whatever it was my mind thought it needed.

For the amount of satisfaction and food you get here - the price is pretty cheap - in fact, I'd go as far to say that it's a SMASHING deal.

WARNING: THE CANDY THEY GIVE YOU AFTER IS TAMARIND FLAVA.
I love tamarind, but this is not the candy for me. Still, if you feel adventurous, go nuts....
