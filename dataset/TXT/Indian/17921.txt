ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ We wanted to try their buffet, heard pretty good things about it from friends. So finally got to go there on Sunday. It was as good as they said.
Though the place was a little crowded but we didn't have to wait too long for our table.The décor was awesome. It had a typical south Indian atmosphere, with all the wall hangings and idols. 
Overall atmosphere and ambiance was desi and nice though crowded. The tables were so closely arranged to maximise their seating space, that it was difficult getting in and out for a serving at the buffet table, without bumping into someone! 
The service was good. There was a waitress who went around every table (buffet-eaters) serving hot dosas and puris. Special mention to their soft idli, extra crispy dosa, delicious channa masala. (I was so full, that I couldn't try their dessert!). We ordered coffee as well, but it was not so impressive. 
Its was nearly an hour and a half of travel for us, but we would definitely go there again. Would recommend this place for anyone who craves a good South Indian meal !
