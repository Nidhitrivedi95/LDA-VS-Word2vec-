FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw We got take out from this restaurant and ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Shrimp Korma that was recommended by Sarah.  We also ordered some bread recommended by the restaurant to go with this dish.
They were friendly on the phone and pleasant at the time of pickup.  The restaurant is extremely clean from what I can tell from my brief first impression.   Everything looked orderly and well organized.
They asked us what level of spice we wanted.  I chose medium expecting the food to be mild in spice as so many restaurants tone down their spice for the American palate.   I was happy to find the spice was indeed medium to my taste.  So if too hot is too hot for you expect a true approach to heat level by this restaurant.
Both dishes were very good.  The chicken sauce was the better in flavor to my taste.  
The rice came out of the box loose and cooked perfectly.  Nice job.
We can't give this 5 stars as we have not eaten in house but for take out they did a terrific job and we will be going back.
