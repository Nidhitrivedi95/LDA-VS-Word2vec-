MRoTUJyR2TVpvDdbOAtBlQ We go here all the time the food is great and the service is even better. Owner/Cook always greets us and remembers our faces very kind and has alot of patience.  

They did hire an ass of a waiter at one point but he's no longer there. thankfully! Food is great chicken pakoras are so so good.  

Try it out!
