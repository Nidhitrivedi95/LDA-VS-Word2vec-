ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA I am from chennai, South India. I had a buffet few months back and the food was excellent. Worth the money. Also went for a dinner yesterday, was my wife's birthday. Once I looked into the menu I immediately thought to have masala Dosai, with the dream of at least match our South Indian style. Dosai served along with sambhar and coconut chatni. Was not good enough. Could not eat a full Dosai. Sambhar wasn't good. In case you wanna Dosai with South Indian style, need to double or triple think before ordering.
