LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw This review is for their dinner. 

I was hankering for Indian food, like it was a day ending in -day. Jaipur happened to be on my route home that day (thanks Yelp!), so I decided to give it a try. I called my order in and the man who picked up was very polite and very nice, and answered my questions with some good suggestions on their dishes. I know my popular Indian dishes, but I always like to try something new. 

The place is super easy to find. It's in one of those big shopping plazas, but their sign is huge and glowing - hard to miss. Bonus is that parking is a total breeze. So I rode that breeze right on in and was greeted immediately. My order was ready right on time, and they were very careful to wrap and place everything so nothing would spill. 

On to the food...
Naan was awesome. Perfect mix of light and dense with this bread. Nobody likes a super dense naan. It should be fluffy and easy to tear with one hand if you're eating properly!

The dishes were wonderful. The meat was cooked perfectly and fall-off-the-bone tender, in the case of the goat curry that I ordered. I'm not a fan of goat, unless it's cooked Indian-style. Then suddenly goat is the top of my food wants. The sauces were 3/5. I would have liked to see (and taste) more spices in the food, but it was more than acceptable. I think I was most impressed by the abundance of food in the sauce. There are few things more disappointing than a bowl brimming with tikka masala only to have like 5 pieces of meat in it. I was very happy with the portion sizes here. Definitely worth the money!

Besides the spices, the one thing Jaipur could improve on is to have brown rice as an option. I know that's not typical for restaurants, but a few of the other places in Charlotte do offer brown rice. hint hint...  Otherwise, for their dishes alone, I would not hesitate to come back.
