We started with the sampler platter for an appetizer. There were a lot of different tastes on the plate, but there was only one of each variety. It was a good thing the three of us were good friends, because that made sharing a little awkward. Everything was tasty though! 

When we each got our meals, mine had plenty of chicken and was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend ordered something with lamb and, sadly, there were only 3-4 small chunks of lamb and the rest was a stew/sauce. Needless to say, it wasn't enough for him and he ended up snacking later in the night. 

The location is behind the Michaels in a  weird, small strip mall that looks forgotten about. The decor inside was lacking and the service, well, you definitely weren't rushed. It's not a bad place, but also not an over the top amazing place.
