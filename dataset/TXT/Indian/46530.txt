Aside from that Tandoori is a great place to go for Indian. The Lamb Curry was delicious and perfectly spicy at medium temp. The Chicken Shahikorma had nice chunks of bell peppers and was also perfectly spicy at medium. The one issue we had was the Chicken Shahikorma was lacking in sauce. Honestly though, the service was great and we look forward to going back to Tandoori House.
