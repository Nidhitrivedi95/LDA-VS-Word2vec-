gJliACNKY4rK30BTMIzwsQ For my money this is the best curry house in Edinburgh and would not look out of place up against the better ones in my home town of Glasgow.


 You can taste the individual spices and the fresh herbs in their cooking. They even know how to do decent pakora which is a rarity on the east coast.


 The head waiter (who is the son of the family) was very friendly without being overbearing and was very accommodating when it came to requests for the strength of one of the curries to be toned down.


 BYOB is great and really makes this a good value night out. The home delivery service is just as good.
