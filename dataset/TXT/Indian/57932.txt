yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw delicious, authentic.... but altogether a bit pricey! 

the husband and i were glad to find a delicious punjabi restaurant near our new place in tempe; we will obviously be back... however the prices will probably keep us from becoming regulars. 

there's an indian-style "chips and salsa" type deal they bring out at the beginning with 3 different sauce/dips. one is fire-burning hottttt, one is a green cilantro dip with a little zip, and the other an amazing tamarind sauce. the "chips" are crispy sesame flatbread type crackers that are amazing. 

as always, chicken tikka masala is a good standby... the rogan josh was also delish here... oh, who am i kidding? it was all good! i loved the ambiance and the authentic dishes the food was served in. 

just a pity it's a little pricey.
