kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I've had curry and vindaloo but I've never really had Indian food beyond that and I never been to an Indian restaurant. All I have to say is I'm going nvm because now I have to eat one of everything on their menu. It was delightful. The ambiance Id perfect and the experience is one that feels authentic. I'm definitely coming back this restaurant for more Indian food.
