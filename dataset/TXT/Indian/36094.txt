NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw Finally found a spot that serves true Mughlai food. The chef is from Delhi(which is the capital of india and also was the capital of Mughal India) The tandoori chicken was amazing, that meT was definitely marinated the right way so that rhe meat was infused with flavour. Loved how they served the Dum Biryani - clay pot covered with naan bread to give it the steam cooking that locks in the flavor. Will definitely be going back and trying more dishes.
