Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag My boyfriend and I are locals and we finally tried this place out after hearing such great things about it. We only had a taste (drinks and an appetizer) but we were certainly impressed with our brief visit.

Honestly at first we were a little put off by the blasting house music... it felt like we were coming up on a night club as we walked up the street towards the building. But after we entered and went to the bottom floor bar/restaurant area the music was much more mild and the ambiance was a lot more relaxed. 

Decor is simple and modern and there is a beautiful open window area for people watching. Container park is across the street so you might just get to see the praying mantis dragon spew some fire! 

Our drinks and our Gobi were really good and the service was awesome. Will definitely come back for a proper lunch/dinner sometime soon as they have TONS of vegan options that I'm dying to try.
