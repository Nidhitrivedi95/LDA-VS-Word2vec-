-z_DR7omzpcR__l7MbDu0A So I am judging by the experiences of having been to Bangalore several times in the past two years...and the verdict is that this is certainly authentic and the food is very flavorful. 

The restaurant is very clean and only 4 months old. It's kind of small with not more than a dozen tables. We went for the Saturday lunch buffet. There was enough choices to try along with few salad and dessert selections. 

Service was good and the owner was nice and didn't charge our two girls 5 and 7 years old as they were still new to Indian food.
