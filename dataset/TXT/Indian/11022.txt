We had a wonderful lunch buffet at Desi. The ambiance was nice and modern. The food was great, and there were extensive options at the buffet table. Everything was delicious. The butter chicken and chicken tikka masala are personal favorites, as well as gulab jamun for dessert. The weekday lunch buffet was $11.

Highly recommend!
