Small ethnic restaurants are not always attractive, comfortable, or even clean, but Khyber excels in all of these areas.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  The menu is varied but not so large as to make you suspicious about how much frozen food is served - I believe everything here is freshly prepared.  The portions are large, the prices are low, and the food is nearly as good as it gets for this type of establishment.  So how could Khyber be better?: Well, I wish they were located in my neighborhood, and the food could be spiced a little more heavily, particularly as regards salt.  Other than that ... well I gave it five stars.

I can particularly recommend the Mantoo, a kind of ravioli dish with meat-stuffed dumplings in a surprisingly good beef-yogurt sauce.  The "Salad" (for under $2) is a large portion of a cucumber-tomato-onion chopped salad, and is a perfect relish for the Mantoo.  There are a number of vegitarian dishes served with Nan.  We had the Bamya (okra) which needed salt but was otherwise perfectly prepared.  The Nan here is thick, like a thick-crust pizza, and they give you enough to make a meal of on its own.  If you have room for dessert, I can recommend the Phirni - a pudding whose ingredients we were told are secret, but it tastes like a cross between rice pudding and custard and is superb.

I have to return to try the kebabs and some of the other specialties.  The pictures on the menu and the website are helpful and accurate, so you really know what you are getting.

Maybe I shouldn't raise your expectations too much only to have you disappointed.  See for yourself.  What are you risking? -- For two people, we had two delicious somasas for an appetiser, two main courses, a huge plate of Afghan rice, a side salad, and a dessert for $33 including tax and tip.  I've paid much more for much less.
