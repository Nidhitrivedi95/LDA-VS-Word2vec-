First of all ...the restaurant itself is hard to locate..it is in a little plaza by Marcs and K-mart! When you first walk in ..you can smell the fresh air of indian food and the comfortability of the atmosphere. Then you are greeted by friendly staff that smiles and seats me and my finance. The server seems as though she does not speak english fluently but she does know what kind of food to suggest and also the their martini are delicious. One of the first thing I feel in love with is their condiments that come with their appetizers. Their vegetable pokras and shrimp pokras are delicious with the red chutney. Their main dishes butter chicken and rogan josh and also aloo gobi is way beyond flavorful. And i LOVE LOVE Their Bread. Garlic nan to aloo paratha. Overall I believe this is the best best indian food you can find in OHIO !!! and the atmosphere is very relaxing and the staffs care about what they do and are very friendly.
