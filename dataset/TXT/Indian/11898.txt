auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I ate at Taj Palace for my 7 year year anniversary and the food was outstanding. I ate samosas, garlic naan bread ,basmati rice and chicken tikka masala for my main course. I also drank a mango lassi for desert.  The service was excellent, the prices were reasonable, and the food was delicious.
