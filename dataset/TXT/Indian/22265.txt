GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw We just came back from Vegas, we had lunch there today, well, for Vegas, this is considered too small for a buffet, they had two kinds of rice, fresh out of the tandoor naan, and about eight to ten options of both meat and vegetarian dishes (apart from a salad, a soup, few chutneys and the two deserts), the quality was great, teh seating atmosphere was very comfortable, the price was right, the service was extremely attentive, the waiter actually came and offered to explain about the dishes, but, since we are Indian food veterans, we didn't needs his explanation., There was no lines, and we didn't have to walk half a mile through the casino to get to the buffet, you can't go wrong here, we will definetely come back when we visit Vegas.
