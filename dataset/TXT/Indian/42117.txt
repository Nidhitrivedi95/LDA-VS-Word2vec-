qGW6A2w5E0rfQV-0f5jrVQ Im a bit of a Indian food snob. I don't usually like Indian food in restaurants, but I absolutely love the food here. Be sure to try the aloo paratha! Food is appropriately priced, the staff is really friendly, and the ambiance is fantastic.  They're also on uber Eats, close to the strip, and open 24/7!
