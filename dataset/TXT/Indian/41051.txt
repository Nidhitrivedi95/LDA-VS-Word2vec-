PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q We used to go there for the half price menu after 9pm! I am from India, and the food is pretty authentic, tasty and reasonably priced. We tried almost everything on their menu. We will not get the Biryani again, just because it was ordinary, not bad. Everything else was good!
