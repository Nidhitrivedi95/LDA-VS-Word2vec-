5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q 5 stars for 1) Excellent and friendly service 2) Clean and quiet setting 3) Unabashed dish recommendations and last but not least and most importantly 4) Flavorful food.

We had the samosa chat as an appetizer and both with a bit of embarrassment said the same thing to each other, which is we could lick the bowl.  All the other appetizer dishes looked good as well and will be tried on the next visits.

The Paneer and Vegetable Skewer was also tasty and with a good portion, not over the top.

Lastly, we had the Classic Chicken Curry which was also a perfect portion, good texture, and mix of flavors.

Some may argue for more choices, but it seems quantity in portion size and menu offerings sometimes overshadows quality.  The menu here is not cluttered, simple to choose from, and seems to stress the quality of each dish.
