-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw Thali Cuisine Indienne is a cozy family run restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and isn't on a trendy street, but the interior is quite nice, the service was good and friendly, the food was excellent and very inexpensive for the quality. We paid about $12 each for Thali for dinner. I highly recommend.
