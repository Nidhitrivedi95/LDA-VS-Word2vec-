TBHpa0OX9WnWdlrti-KBxQ Finally got to try the lunch buffet here today.  I'm no authority on Indian food but everything tasted good and fresh.  The service was pretty indifferent.  The spice level left me with that nice warm glow in my middle that I remember from my lunches in Little India in Singapore.
