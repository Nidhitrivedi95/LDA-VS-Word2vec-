BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ I went to this restaurant with some other people since we had a Groupon deal. The regular prices are similar to many other Indian restaurants in Toronto (and perhaps slightly better) so having the groupon was a great deal.

We ordered a variety of dishes such as the chicken tandoori, fish massala, butter chicken, lamb curry and some more. All were well-executed. We did not try any desserts because we were so full from the regular meal.

I thought that the food quality was good as in any other Indian-style restaurants I have been to in Toronto (such as Lahore Tikka House for example). I recommend going here especially if you can get a groupon deal.
