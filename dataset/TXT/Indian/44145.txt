RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w HEALTH HAZARD! ENDED UP AT THE HOSPITAL! BROKEN FOOT!
The place is unsafe, the pavement is uneven and the manager is rude. We went to dine here on the night of July 13th and I was seriously injured by a pot hole in the patio floor -- ended up spending the night at the hospital. The hole had been covered with by a rug so I was unable to see it. I tripped over it and fell into the hole which had dirty water in it. The manager was more concerned about the legal rights of the restaurant rather than my personal safety, she was even trying to force me to sign a waiver. Not to mention that she was well aware of the hole being covered with by a rug and was giving me attitude as we were trying to discuss the situation. I ended up being taken to the hospital for my leg as my injury was quite severe. Furthermore, the restaurant is unsanitary as there is one kitchen that is outside--- its an open kitchen, posing the question as to how sanitary the food is. Most of all the customer service is absolutely horrible, never in my life have I been so insulted by a manager - the night ended off with her telling us to never come back and we will NEVER be coming back. Dine there at your own risk, I don't understand how the patio area passed inspection or how the restaurant is still open with all the food and safety violations. I have and will continue to complain to the city as this is absolutely absurd and dangerous not only to me but to the safety and health of the public.
