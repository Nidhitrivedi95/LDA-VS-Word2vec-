Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I used to visit this place a lot a few years ago not necessarily by choice (this was the only game in town). The decor grew old on me and the quality of food nose-dived. 

After a few years away, I ended up in JJ last weekend. To my surprise, the decor and layout has improved (no more direct view of the Restroom from the Dining Room and no more graffiti wall). The guy at the register greeted me with a broad, toothy smile that warmed my heart. I soon forgot about the stinky trash bins right up at the entrance. 

The buffet spread was limited but visually very appealing. The Naans were soft and steaming and Daal just right on the spice scale. The sauce in Mutter Paneer could have been a touch more creamier. The Kheer was exquisite.

Stepping in the right direction. But still some ways to go.
