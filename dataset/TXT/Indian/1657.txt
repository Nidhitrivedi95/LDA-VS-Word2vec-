-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA OH-EMM-GEE!  My daughter and I went here for the lunch buffet on Sunday, and the food was absolutely amazing!  I don't know enough about Indian food to tell you about all of the individual dishes, but everything I tasted (which was just about everything offered in the buffet) was DELISH!  The servers were attentive, and the owner was very friendly.  The cost is $10.95 per person, which seems pretty standard to me, given the number of choices and the quality of the food.  I'll be back!
