G_5zQbGAFYYKD7vBEoWByg Mediocre. Ordered on Uber Eats and was really disappointed. 

Veggie rolls tasted like old oil and had bland filling, plus the picture was of cold rolls and these were fried.

Naan looked like it came from grocery store or was stale.

Cauliflower and potato was fine, cauliflower was slightly under cooked.

Will def not be ordering from here again.
