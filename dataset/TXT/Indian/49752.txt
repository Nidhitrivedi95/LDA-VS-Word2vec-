One night after work, I had a craving for some Mexican food and stumbled upon California Burrito.  Coming from California myself, I had to give this place a try.  But what I didn't realize was that California Burrito apparently is on California time and was closed before 8 on a weeknight.  LAME!

So I decided to give A1 Sweets a try.  Like other reviewers mentioned, there are about 8-10 cafeteria bins of vegetarian Indian food.  I chose the Paneer Tikki Masala (nuclear orange colored - like butter chicken but w/ cheese) and the Aloo Gobi (orange potato-y stew - spicy potatoes and cauliflower).  Both were super tasty and had more that home cooked quality that results from cooking in smaller quantities.  
Entree came with rice and roti and was more than plenty of food for a single person, I think the Thali plate could probably feed two.

Oh yeah, can any Yelpers here take a camera pic and label the entrees for the rest of us?  That would be amazing!
