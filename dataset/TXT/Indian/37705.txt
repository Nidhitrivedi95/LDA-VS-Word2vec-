OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg Not cheap by any means (I racked up $38 by myself with no alcohol), but definitely delicious.  Much better than Indian food I've had at similar places (in terms of service and dining experience).  Everything is a la carte which is different from most places that offer rice or nan with the entrees...and I got both.  And the mango lassi was also excellent with the lamb curry.  I plan to go back, probably hit their lunch buffet too.  Great place but a little overpriced even for its quality, the service was friendly but leaved something to be desired, and the layout is a bit weird.  Overall I strongly recommend it for Indian food in the area.
