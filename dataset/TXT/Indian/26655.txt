iDCAMAg7XPBx2g-82AIsgg Saw this place near our badminton place and decided to check it out. After we went in - the first impression was not good. They were a few tables where the customers ate and left and the tables were not cleaned up.

We then proceeded to order. They did have a good selection of food and they were all on display - kinda like fast food style. I ordered the Kashmiri chicken. Came with two Naan and I decided to substitute rice with it.

The food was so so. Was good but nothing special. For the price $11.99 probably not worth it as as there are other Indian restaurants you can go to that can provide you better food for the price.
