ZBF80rNCePZyv9HbmaRBNQ Went for dinner based on positive reviews that I saw from the Indian crowd. Was disappointed. I ordered plain Dosa where the batter was not cooked through so Dosa kept sticking to my teeth. My friends had ordered chicken lollipop which was also not flavourful and was under cooked. The goat curry lacked salt and the meat wasn't juicy but was rubbery. The only positive was sambar which was really good. Quantity on the goat curry does not match 13.95 price tag on it.
