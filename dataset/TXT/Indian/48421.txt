tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g First of all the waiters here are very bad mannered... one of them was a girl.  She is rude and arrogant. Even her tone of talking with customer was offensive... didnt even come back and ask us once whether the food was ok or not... even when we were leaving, no one came and thanked. These are normal etiquette of any resturant. I dont know how they got job. 
We asked for one bhuna ghost and one shrimp. Both of them were supposed to be served with basmati rice. But they served only one rice. Taste was ok. Little overpriced. But the two waiters specially the lady messed up entire charm of dinner. Who wants to be treated poorly in a resturant where you are paying from your pocket...
