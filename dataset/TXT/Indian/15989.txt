dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q I love this place. It offers both a buffet and individual meals.

Me and me friend were both not too hungry so we opted to just get one dish each and split it. I got the chicken vindaloo with a side of rice and he got the butter chicken with a side of garlic naan.

The vindaloo was deliciously spicy and flavourful, my mouth waters at the thought of it. The butter chicken was good too, but to me paled in comparison to the vindaloo. 

The funny thing was that our bills both came to around just under $20, which ended up costing more than the buffet. 

I can't wait to revisit this restaurant for the lunch buffer and just eat for hours.
