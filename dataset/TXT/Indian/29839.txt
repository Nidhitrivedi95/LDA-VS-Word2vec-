I had the swarma lamb plate.boy was it good. my wife ordered the chili chicken.she liked it but it kept her up the entire night[very rich and spicy} so for her she won't order again.place was nice and clean inside.had a great waitress. prices were very resonable $11.99 and $12.99.we will be going back.my wife will order something with out tomatoes in it. we told our daughter to give this place a try.
