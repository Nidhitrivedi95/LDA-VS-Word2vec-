IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Bad service. Cold food. Not even a smile from the servant or the owner lady. We asked her to warm the food for us and she started complaining about our request saying "don't you see how hot it is?" OH HELLO it doesn't matter, coz we didn't like the way it feels when you provided it. Finally we had to wait for 15 minutes for the check even though we asked for it. The the ugly servant came with the check and just dropped it on the table without even being polite to some extends. 
Totally not recommended restaurant. You could find a better place for the price you gonna pay here with bad service.
Waste of mood. Waste of time. Waste of money.
