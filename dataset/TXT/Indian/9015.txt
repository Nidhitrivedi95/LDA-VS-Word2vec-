82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA Wow surpised I havent written a review for this place. I went to Le Taj a while back before during their lunch buffet special. The place and atmosphere really won me over. They have a nice open wine celler and the place was really nice and clean. I loved how they beautifully fusioned traditional with modern decor and the ambiance just perfectly hit the notch to be okay for both a group of friends/coworkers/couples etc. The service was nice, servers attentive, prompt, and most importantly courteous. Seemed like the people running the place has a lot of skills. Anyway Everything was good I just dont know why I cant seem to giving the place a 5 star. Probably because the food wasnt as impressive. I remeber trying their nan some vegetable curry, butter chicken, and some karahi dish. I recall their butter chicken having a lot of gluten as I had only a little bit and was full immediately. Drinks are good, and the dishes edible but not memorable. 

Overall I'd say this place this great for nice get togethers with friends and family if you want to try Indian in a nice environment. 

Price definitely not overpriced. I tried buffet style but even then most of the things on the menu are well priced for restaurant in heart of downtown. You certainly wont be disappointed, so dont hesitate to drop in.
