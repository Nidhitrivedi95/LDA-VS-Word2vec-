Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg Samosa chaat in appetizer is a must try if you love spicy food. Its a combination of chick peas and Samosa. Out of the world taste and really loved it. Highly recommended. Butter chicken in main course was good but i was expecting it to be little more spicy and strong i.e. Authentic punjabi style.  Place lives up to its name. The way seating has been planned is also interesting.
