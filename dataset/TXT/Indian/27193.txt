iIFcMHXGNDz8jbx_4H-xVQ While the ambiance may be bare and the service may be mediocre, I can honestly say, taste wise, this has to be one of the best Hakka (Indian style Chinese) restaurants in Toronto. My favorite dish here is the chilli paneer - and for those of you paneer lovers who order it a lot at various restaurants, you will obviously know that you are usually skimped and often just given 5 or 6 pieces. WELL NOT HERE - you get a plate full of paneer! The flavor of the chilli sauce is to die for so I'm sure the chilli chicken or beef will be just as good (I have not tried it as I am a vegetarian). For those of you who are Muslims, this place is Halal.
