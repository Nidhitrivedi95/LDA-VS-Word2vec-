pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I rarely write reviews but just had to give one for taj.  I like ordering for pick ups for days I don't want to cook. They have an option to order online for pick-up and you can even choose the time you want to pick it up.  I like this option since I don't have to pronounce or spell out the dishes over the phone which I think can lead to order mix ups.  My orders were ready on time, and the owners are awesome and even gave me a complimentary biryani.  I love their saag!  I can't comment on their dine in service but for people living in the north hill areas, this is a great pick up/ take out place and you'll prevent the food smell sticking to your clothes which are hard to avoid.
