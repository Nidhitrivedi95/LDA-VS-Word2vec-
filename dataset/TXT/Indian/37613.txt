OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A With so many Indian restaurants serving similar tasting fare this place serves uniquely flavored dishes. The Seekh Kabob appetizer is superb. The Butter Chicken sauce is delightful. I am not an epicure just someone who knows what they like and I like this restaurant. Great service and friendly service in the family run place. Parking is easy to find even during festival season. If you enjoy Indian food then you must give them a taste. I have visited them three times already this year.
