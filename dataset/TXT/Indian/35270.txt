MsVb9bO8WG3BGeAys4-Waw Have been here few times. Love to go here for the spicy food. The outlook of the place needs a little (I mean a lot of) work. There is a big rice dish that they make as a special during the weekends. It is awesome.

The drop in stars are due to the venue rather than their food.
