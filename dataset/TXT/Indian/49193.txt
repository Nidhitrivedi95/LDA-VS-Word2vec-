tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Incredible Indian buffet! Fabulous food, lots of choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians. The waiters even walk around offering you plates of tandoori chicken. They have several delicious items on the dessert section of the buffet. AND the buffet includes a mango lassi dispenser! And hot chai tea! Omg, so great.
