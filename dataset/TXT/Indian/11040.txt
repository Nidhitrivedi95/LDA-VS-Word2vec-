a8o8OMGhWg4JwbuMMnVOHQ What a pleasant surprise. I did not expect a halal establishment to come through with amazing steaks and bbq food. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because they were understaffed so things took slightly longer but still no complaints. The server was fantastic. The food, well let me tell you about the food. 

Their Jalapeno poppers are one of the best I have eaten.
I ordered the 12oz AAA NY strip(medium) was slightly close to medium well but still good and I topped it with their shrimp add-on. Amazing combo. The quality is top notch and comparable to most high priced fine dining restaurants. The pricing is also very fair. 

My wife ordered the chicken clubhouse sandwich and damn it was good. Definitely going to be a regular patron there. We need more halal establishments like these.

The restaurant was clean and well kept and the decor was modern and contemporary. 

I highly recommend you try it if you have any doubts. I was going to read reviews and then try it but my wife suggested we go in blind and just give it a shot. 

Hats off to the owner and I'll see you guys again very soon.
