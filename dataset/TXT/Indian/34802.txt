Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Great tasting indian food and excellent service. There were 5 of us and we had butter chicken, goat curry, black daal and kadai chicken the first time and had lunch buffet the next. Kadai Chicken was the best. The place is neat and clean. The service is good. Would come back for sure.
