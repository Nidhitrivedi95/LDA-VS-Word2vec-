kTJEf56gjzBSpi9X14X54Q Amazing place with great owners. Extremely friendly and make you feel at home. Its a family run restaurant that provide extremely high quality, authentic south Indian food at a very very reasonable price. Our all time favorites are masala dosa, obattu, filter coffee, paddu, mint rice, and gulab jamun. This week was our 5th visit to this place and we will be coming here for more very soon.
