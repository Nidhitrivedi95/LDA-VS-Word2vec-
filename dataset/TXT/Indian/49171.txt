tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Great buffet!  The food was excellent.  I loved the Paneer Tikka Masala and the Chicken Tikka Masala.  The Shrimp Biryani was also excellent.  They also bring you Garlic Naan and Tandoori Chicken as well.  The chicken was very good, however I thought the Garlic Naan was over cooked and tasted a little burnt.  We also indulged in dessert.  We tried the Mango Custard, Rice Pudding, and (I think, but I'm not totally sure) the Indian Cheesecake.  The cheesecake was my favorite followed by the mango custard.  The rice pudding was good, but I've never been a fan of it anywhere I've been.  My friend loved the rice pudding though. The staff was very attentive and nice, and the restaurant seemed clean and organized inside.  Definitely going back!
