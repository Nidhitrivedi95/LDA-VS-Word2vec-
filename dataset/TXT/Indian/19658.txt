My husband and I happened to pass Zaidi's one day and stopped in for lunch the next time we wanted Indian food.  Typical unassuming, sparsely decorated strip mall location.  But nothing typical about the food!

We started with the Pakora (thinly sliced strands of veggies battered and fried), served with a delicious green chutney.  This dish was supposedly named "best appetizer" somewhere, and I can see why.  However, it had an odd flavor that didn't seem to be coming from the spices in the dish, but rather the oil used for frying.  Perhaps it was too old??  This is the only reason I won't bump to 4 stars.

For my entree, I went with Chicken Qorma, my staple when going somewhere new since I know that I like it generally.  And this I did love.  Probably the most flavorful Qorma I've had with incredible depth of flavor.  The only thing I did not love is the bone-in aspect.  Keep in mind, this is not just bone-in chicken, it's chopped with the bone, so there will be lots of spitting out the inedibles.  Maybe this is more traditional or adds to the flavor, but I do prefer boneless.

The owner came out to chat when he did not recognize us.  Although he's successfully catered for many years, he disclosed the restaurant is struggling a bit due to location, and they will be adjusting the menu to a more multi-cultural approach (burgers, tacos, etc) at lunch.  While many of the Pakistani and Indian dishes will be staples on the menu, some items such as goat will be restricted to dinner due to the length of time required for cooking.  I think I'll stick with original dishes, though.
