MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw So on a Friday night my husband decided to surprise me and took me to this gem straight from his office. He heard great reviews from his colleagues and I must say they were all right! We started with karari bhindi (crispy fried baby okra with onions green peppers and chaat masala) as a starter. It was soooo tasty and crispy. The best starter I hv ever had in any Indian restaurant in Toronto. The size of each fried okra was less thn 3cm which I never found in any grocery shops here. Thn our main course was typical paneer tikka sabji with garlic naan. The quantity was enough to feed 2 ppl easily. It was creamy,flavourful and so fresh. Both items from the menu were awesome. Thn we thought of trying a Parda Biryani. it was not as good as the two previous dishes but not bad at all... It had all flavours of an ideal veg biryanis but I found it little bit less salty... It was more on a sweeter side I would say... I would definitely travel every week from Brampton to Richmond just for their karari bhindi..Must try if u love nice authentic Indian food...
