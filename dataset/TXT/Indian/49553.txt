tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This is my dad and I's go-to lunch spot, we've been coming here for a couple months now, and it's amazing every time. 

Lunch buffet is the best! The food is fresh and delicious, and theres a big selection to pick from (I still have a lot to try). My favorite are the lamb dishes, the meat is tender and flavorful.

Excellent service - there're always a handful of servers available nearby to refill drinks or take plates out of the way.

The price per person for the buffet is only about $10, which for an all you can eat is really good.

Haven't been disappointed yet! I definitely recommend!
