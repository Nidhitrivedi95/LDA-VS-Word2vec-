B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg I stopped at Dhaba for the first time this week.  On the good side, the restaurant looks very good and the staff is courteous and efficient.  Also, our naan bread was delicious.  On the bad side, the very bad side, the lamb vindaloo was inedible.  It appeared to be canned tomato soup, slightly spiced and heated with some lamb dropped in.  Terrible!  The chicken tikka masala was barely passable.  I think the sauce also came from a jar, at least it tasted like it.  

I cannot recommend this restaurant for anything other than naan.  If you want Indian, any other Indian restaurant in town would be better.
