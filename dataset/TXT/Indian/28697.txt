jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ The place is nice clean and the location is good too. One paneer dish was tasty and paranthas were good too. Paneer Frankie was a joke little paneer more onions, tiny portion, we also ordered poori aloo, aloo was good it cam with 3 poori, not how they decided on this figure. Pooris were tiny. They could have made them bigger and 2 else smaller then the count shud have been 4. 
With such smaller portions which were overpriced it honestly does not work for us. It also does not work in this market where Om, pastries and chaat and the likes are doing very well by serving good portions at right price.
