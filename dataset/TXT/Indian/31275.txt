KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Went on the Saturday and to make it short and sweet, I had the Pataka Wings that were just amazing. I fell in love with the Ras Malai Cheesecake Samosa. 

Met Rick himself, very humble and attentive to his customers.

Overall amazing experience from the service to the food.

Definitely recommend checking it out
