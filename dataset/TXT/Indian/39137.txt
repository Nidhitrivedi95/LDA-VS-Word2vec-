OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w This was my first experience ordering a buffet lunch without actually walking up to a buffet--how's that for convenience?!  We dined here recently for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't very busy, but I can imagine they must be packed at peak hours. I strongly recommend you come here with an appetite, because the food is delicious and you won't want to miss out. I have no major criticisms of this place, but the service was just a bit slow, given that we were among the few patrons in the restaurant.
