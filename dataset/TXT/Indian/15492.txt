CsQbzxZ275CXkndSo8gryQ Yelp says they open at 11:00am today. Their website says they open at 1:00pm today. I got there around 1:30pm. I walked in, and there were already two other tables seated. The server looked sort of surprised we were there, and when I told him it was a party of two, he stopped, thought for a bit, and finally said, "we're not open yet." Um, excuse me? He then said it would be at least another twenty minutes. No. Just no.
