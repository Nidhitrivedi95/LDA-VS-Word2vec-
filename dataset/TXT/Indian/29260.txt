jpYAApi_w1bR50EJ71LBHg Def an excellent Sri Lankan restaurant. Fantastic biryanis and kottu roti. (Traditional Sri Lankan food a mix of roti, veggies, spices, meats). The mutton biryani was actually quite good. I was a little surprised. Very busy. Try an order in. Took off a star cuz they barely ever pick up the phone and the service is 3/5. Good but not excellent. Also great little appetizers. The sambhar is actually better than most South Indian restaurants around.
