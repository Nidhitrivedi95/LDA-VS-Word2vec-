wjMD2d5UmiugPmU2cOVqzg Disappointing, I don't know how the two previous reviews were so generous. I was looking forward to having a lovely curry and what I got was a lesson in bland. I ordered a chicken tikka masala which was so yellow in colour I could have mistaken it for korma, and it was like eating korma, sweet, bland and mediocre. No hint of a kick whatsoever, in fact the Lemon rice I got to go with it probably had more flavour. When the menu states "mild" what they really mean is beyond mild, to suit the palate of someone who doesn't do spice at all. The Paratha was a thick rubbery disc that was pretty much inedible, probably would make a good frisbee but I threw it in the bin instead. The best bit about my order was the Peshwari Naan and I can only describe that as adequate, nothing special. All that for just over £16 including delivery charge. I wish I'd got a burger from my local instead.
