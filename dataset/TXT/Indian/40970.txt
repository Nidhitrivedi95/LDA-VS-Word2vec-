PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA Butter Chicken!

Hmm. What to make of this place. It's Indian food. In a food court. In a strip hotel. OK so it's the Riviera, but still.

Cutting to the chase, the Butter Chicken was yummy. It had bell peppers in it, which stood out for some reason. Maybe because there usually aren't bell peppers in Butter Chicken? IDK. I liked what they brought to the party. The plate comes with a good amount of Basmati Rice, and a ginormous piece of Naan. In my book, it doesn't get much better than savoring some delicious Butter Chicken sauce with some Naan.

So the food was good, but back to the place. The fact that we even have Indian food in a food court in this town makes me happy. The down side is that you're paying more for it. Like I said, it's in a strip hotel, albeit the Riviera. They're probably paying a lot for that location, so their prices are naturally higher. I mean, $12 for a plate of Butter Chicken isn't insane, but it just feels weird because you're in a freakin' food court.

In any case, I left satisfied. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again, but I'd consider it if I'm ever back in the Riviera. Like the next time I watch some roller derby!

p.s. I pretty much always order Mango Lassi if they offer it. I've had better, but it was pretty good.
