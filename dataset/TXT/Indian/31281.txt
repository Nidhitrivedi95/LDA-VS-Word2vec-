KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw I came here for lunch and it was shortly after 12, but there was already a pretty long lineup. I was willing to wait it out because of the good reviews. I can't say the lineup moved super quick, but it wasn't unbearably slow. You order at the counter and then find a seat after your order.

They call out your name when your order is ready and they need to massively improve this system. First of all, one of the ladies calling out names was so quiet that none of us could hear her. Another lady calling out names mispronounced every name, even seemingly simple names. E.g. she called out "Alissa", so a Melissa had gone up, and the name was actually "Alicia". Maybe stick to order numbers instead.

I ordered the punjabi burger (no cheese) with bacon, masala fries, and a butter chicken samosa. This food was gloriously good. I was just shoving it into my mouth so quickly. 

The punjabi burger was a heavily seasoned burger patty that was topped with very flavourful sauces. This is not a burger for burger purists or people who don't like much spice or seasoning. The butter chicken samosa was crispy on the outside and luscious on the inside. Everything was divine. You will not be disappointed. Unless your name is Alicia.
