nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA Christmas. Two Jews. One refuses to eat Chinese (WHAT?) and every sushi place is closed or doesn't do delivery (WHAT?). So we went down the slightly less traditional route and found that Maroli delivers on Christmas. We deem this a Christmas miracle.

We ordered butter paneer and butter chicken, both of which are good. The rice was INCREDIBLE, the raita was good, and the roti tasted like Moroccan m'semen, which is good but I wish we could have ordered naan. My friend inhaled his samosas.

If this were under circumstances, I think I would have given the meal four stars because it was good (although the rice alone is worth five), but they really did save our Christmas.

The service, however, was impeccable. When I called to see if they deliver, no one picked up, but a moment later they called me back to say hello! And the woman on the phone was careful with all of the information and the delivery man was wonderfully friendly.

Thank you, Maroli!
