gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I used to work at the bank across the street and came here many times during lunch. 

I usually get there right when they open. The food was obviously fresh and just out of the kitchen, so I got the benefit of not having buffet food that has been sitting there.

The service was always quick and fresh hot naan brought right away. The place is not one of the newer ones I have been to.

Some of the Lunch Buffet items are
Palak Paneer, Vegetable Samosa, Yellow Dal, Aloo Baingan, Raita, Chili Chicken,
Goat Curry, Tandoori Chicken, Malai Kofta
Yellow Dal, Chicken Tikka Masala.
Gajar Halwa and Kheer for deserts.

Lunch buffet is $11.99

The Tandoori Chicken and Goat curry were solid and well spiced and the Chicken Tikka Masala was very good, with a nice little kick, and all your other standard-fair Indian buffet options were tasty. The rice, which of course is an important element of any indian meal was fluffy, warm and flavorful. 

They also do buffet takeout, you get a box, naan and a cup for your soup.
