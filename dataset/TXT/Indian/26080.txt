Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw I am not a fan.

Service was terrible. We went for buffet and all the time we were there buffet never had enough food. 

There was a time when there were no plates for 15 minutes. There were no nans until just before we were done.

There was only one wait staff and that poor girl was struggling to keep up.

Food was not bad however service just gave us bad taste and the whole experience was not pleasant
