I ordered some chicken samosas and I was greatly disappointed with what I received. While they were pretty cheap at $2 for 1, I guess you get what you pay for. The chicken had a slightly "off" smell to them and almost tasted undercooked. I wasn't given any of the proper accompaniments since they apparently ran out. Regardless of this, service was okay; what you'd expect from a place like this and nothing more. I might go back to try some of their sweets, but in terms of their samosas I would stay away.
