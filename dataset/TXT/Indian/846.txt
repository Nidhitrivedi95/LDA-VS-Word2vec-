-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw The BEST Indian grocery store in Las Vegas! Great prices; expansive selection of spices, lentils, rice and cookies! I found a cast iron wok in several sizes; without the aluminum coating is the better selection of the two. I cooked in it and used it as a serving dish. It keeps food hot for a longer period and I LOVE my food HOT! The naan is the best I've yet to find not only here in Vegas but in the PNW.
