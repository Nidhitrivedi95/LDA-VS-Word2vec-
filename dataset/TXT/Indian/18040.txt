ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ I've been hearing how great people's is from friends, so decided to check them out. I went for the lunch buffet. I arrived around 1pm when it ends at 2:30pm. There was still fresh food on the buffet. They refilled while I was there. As a vegan I appreciate Indian food & had many options. Usually my gauge for any Indian place it the Chana masala, my favorite dish. I was super impressed with theirs. Perfectly steamed  chickpeas with right amount of spice & cilantro! A second favorite was the Aloo Pang which is spinach potatoes & spices. The nan was fresh & hot. Also, the service was great, I never once had to ask for water. 

For my second experience with people's I decided to order take out. They do free delivery to the surrounding area! (I live in Stanton Heights) it came within an hour of calling & was freshly made. I had no complaints. I order Chana Masala, Aloo pang & nan....it was about $20, lasted me dinner & lunch the next day ! Plan to
Order again soon
