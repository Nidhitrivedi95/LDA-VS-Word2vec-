UXEqtEXs92COE3UiaSx4oA Came here on my lunch break, checked yelp to see what was in the area that was recommended, wouldn't have found this place otherwise. Happy I did so. Ordered 3 chicken briyanni and dal makhani. Usually when you order chicken briyanni from an Indian restaurant, they use the cheapest cuts of meat and the chicken doesn't always taste the freshest; luckily at this spot they are the only place that I have ever been to that uses chicken breast. The quality of the food was spectacular. My father who was also joining me for lunch, has spent 6 years of his life living in India, he swears this was one of the best briyannis he's tried. Was perfectly spiced, not too overbearing like I've been familiar with. The dal makhani was also really high quality. Over all I definitely recommend this restaurant. They also have a lunch buffet that looked really good, priced moderately, bookmarked definitely going to come back and give it a try.
