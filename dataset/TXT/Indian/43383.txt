rLmUtrlEZO4BkyaAH_jQCQ I've eaten in at the Guru once and done takeaway a couple of times (they deliver but it can take a while since they're usually very busy). Some of their dishes are really good: the tarka dahl is rich and thick, the saag paneer is delicious. The meat curries tend to go a bit same-y for me, but they're OK. The menu's massive, though. The naan bread are the biggest I've ever seen. Perhaps leans a bit too far on the quantity side versus quality, but I'm probably spoiled by living next to Southall in London.


 A very popular Edinburgh eatery, and in the evening the tables are often full. Staff can be a bit of a laugh.
