UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA On of the best Indian food I had in US. The taste was really good and the variety in the lunch buffet was great (both veg and non-veg). The Naan and Tandoori Roti were hot and crisp. Plus the price for the buffet is actually a steal. If you are in Vegas and craving for good Indian buffet this is the place to go. Perfect for family. I am going there again when I visit Vegas.
