3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Really quite bad. I remember having curry twist several years ago and it was quite delicious - naan bread was the right combination of chewy and soft and moist and oily, curries were flavourful and fresh. But this time was markedly different. We got take-out and a couple of different curries and some naan and the curries were so insanely sweet they were inedible, we tossed them out. The naan bread resembled grocery-store-bagged pita bread. Definitely won't return.
