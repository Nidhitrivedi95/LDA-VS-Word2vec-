VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw Was referred to this place by a friend who swore by the food.
Sadly we never got that far.

We arrived just before 7pm waited about 5 minutes to be seated.
They took our order quickly and got us drinks.
We ordered the Assorted Appetizer Platter, Garlic Naan, Matar Paneer, and the Chicken Tikka Masala.
We sat for 20 minutes before the platter came out with no sauces.
We then sat for another 40 minutes while 4 different tables who came in after us had their order taken, were served, ate, and got to-go boxes.
We asked to pay for the appetizer platter and then left. 

Our waiter, who was very nice and apologized, wouldnt take the payment.

I dont know if this was an off night or.............

Wont be coming back here.
