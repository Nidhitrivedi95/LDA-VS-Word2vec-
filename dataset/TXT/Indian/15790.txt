cY70RdP5w6gxRhY-wZ681A Now this place was an experience :) . It took about 70 mins to get our order ... no exaggeration. Owner was one old lady trying to save money by making chefs do servings and talking way too much... kind of small kitchen but aura reminds one of Pakistani Tandoor. Decent food but it will take a long way for them to improve their service. Maybe I would skip this one next time ...
