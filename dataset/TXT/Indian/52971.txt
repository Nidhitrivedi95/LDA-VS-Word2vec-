v4jKdWjO0U_x4Z13geHfjA I'd walked past Punjabi Junction many times when wandering down Leith and been meaning to try it. It's commendable for being a social enterprise helping provide skills and opportunities for women. 

It's a nice little venue, bright and with a relaxed cafe/diner feel. It feels like stepping into someones kitchen and being served some wonderful home-cooked food. I had a chicken curry wrap and my friend went for the fish curry. 

Both were great;  cheap, authentic, satisfying comfort food. It was a nice size for lunch and so we had enough room for dessert. I'd *definitely* have the gulab jamun with mango ice cream again. 

Service was maybe a little bit too relaxed and so wouldn't have been great if we were in a rush but given the homely feel I didn't mind too much. I will happily come back to try some more of their offerings.
