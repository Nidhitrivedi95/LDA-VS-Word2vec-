The haleem is pretty good but felt as if it was a bit bland and could have used a bit more spices.  Their Chicken Karahi is amazingly tasty and you can not go wrong with it. Their naans are a bit small in size, so you might need to order an extra one.  They are also pretty well known for their Bun Kababs which was surprisingly tasty and has quite a kick to it and you cannot go wrong with a price of $3.19.

Overall, the food is well worth the price and definitely worth checking out.
