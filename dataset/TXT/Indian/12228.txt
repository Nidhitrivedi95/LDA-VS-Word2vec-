auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ The best Indian food in Vegas!  I love Indian food so I've tried a lot of restaurants but this place is my favorite.  I've only been to the lunch buffet, which is very reasonably priced at like $11 per person.  You have a choice of fresh naan-regular or garlic.  My favorite is the garlic naan.  My favorite items are the chicken tikki massala, saag paneer, tandoori chicken, basmati Rice, and some other items I can't remember the names but are also yummy. Remember to use clean plates for each trip!
