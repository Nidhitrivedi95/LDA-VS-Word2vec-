HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A I've only be to Saffron Patch for the lunch buffet (so far!), but I keep coming back because the buffet features some delicious food and it's always different. The BEST chicken tandoori I've ever had is here, and that's one thing that doesn't change about the buffet. It's the best because it is EXTREMELY smoky! If you loved that smoky taste, you have to try that chicken. 

Service has always been great and I can't wait to come back for dinner! 

The only weird thing about this place is that it's in an office building. Parking is VERY difficult during the day. Apparently people who work in the building take all of the restaurant parking spots during the winter so that they don't have to walk very far...? That's what I was told by the restaurant staff. There is a parking garage that is very awkward and bizarre to get around in unless you have a teeny tiny car but once you figure it out it's fine. 

And though it has an odd location, the vibe of the restaurant is very nice! I'd recommend Saffron Patch for the lunch buffet, and I'm sure the regular menu is even better...I will be back for both.
