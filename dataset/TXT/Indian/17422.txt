DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ Hands down the best Indian food I've had outside of India itself.  It's authentic, fresh and consistently awesome.  I've been here many times and have never had a bad meal.  The service is just as amazing as the food.  I strongly recommend trying the Samosas and well everything else too.  They also have a very affordable lunch buffet with many options.  Thank You!
