jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw The food of Lazeez for me and my family is the perfect fusion of flavors. Best of both east and west. I am devoted halal eating individual, so is my family. So for us finding the right place to have the quaint essential american burger but in a halal form was a challenge since we moved to Vegas. But I have to say that Lazeez's special Lazeez beef burger hit the spot for us. It has all the components of a delicious burger; juicy, moist, meaty and fresh. It also have hints of spices that gives it a eastern flair which is amazing. Their portion size is also very reasonable. The burgers come with steak fries and overall it was very filling. However the price is a little on the expensive side but that is understandable since they are offering halal meat and chicken. We still have not tried their other dishes, but we definitely would be going back for some more.

It's decor is also something I have to write about. It has such an unique up scale diner like feel with Mediterranean touches like light fixtures and etc. It is always clean and the red and white color scheme adds a nice brightness to the restaurant which I think adds to the dining experience. So Overall Lazeez was a great experience.

I  made a yelp account to just write how great this place is and for me it being halal is the most amazing aspect. Thank you from all the halal food seeking individuals out there, you fulfilled our craving. :) keep up the good work and just a suggestion if you could possibly bring more Americans but halal dishes to the menu then it would be great ;)
