ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA After 3 deliveries, 1 takeaway so far, I can definitely say this place doesn't shy away from using its spices. Good food esp their indo-Chinese. Biryani portions are crazy big! I really liked their Gobi-Manchurian. Very flavorful food. however please reconsider your spice level - their food can be very spicy but again equally delicious!
