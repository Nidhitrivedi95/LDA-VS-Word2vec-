UAXz2KC1aXpxzV-MLdXbmQ Hands down THE best Indian restaurant in Toronto and the GTA! 

I recently discovered Delhi Bistro and i'm kicking myself for not going earlier. Everything made for a complete, pleasurable, dining experience. We started with the most amazing onion bhajis and prawn poori. Both were really fresh and tasted homemade - not a hint of frozen food. We then moved on to our mains. We shared saag mushroom, vegetable jalfrezi and paneer makhani (SOOOO good!). Nothing was oily, tasteless or too spiced. Every dish was pure perfection. I know it's not good for the wallet to dine out every night but this place officially has me addicted. I dream about the food. 

The restaurant itself was tastefully decorated. Modern and not at all tacky like many Indian restaurants. It had a nightclub/lounge vibe that was a refreshing change from other Indian bistros. The server was absolutely fantastic. His is was Luis and if you get him serving your table, you won't have single thing to complain about. He was knowledgable about all the dishes (we had many, many questions) and his recommendations were spot on! Thank you again, Luis!

I will definitely be returning to Delhi Bistro and bringing everyone I know because I feel like I have found such an amazing place and it should not be kept a secret. 

Thanks for teaching me what REAL Indian food should taste like.
