E0hjQKyw3IRaVsyayTPr7w Hot off a long, long day of travel and craving Indian food, my husband and I decided on the first place we saw coming out of Haymarket station. Walking in, we were greeted by an extremely friendly staff and full menu - exciting! Our food was delivered quickly and was absolutely delicious with the perfect amount of spice. My husband had the chicken madras, I had the chicken jalfrezi and we split a side of rice and garlic naan - the perfect amount for two individuals who hadn't eaten all day! As good as the food was, we were just as impressed with the service - and I will forever be grateful to our kind waiter who sprinted after us with my purse and scarf in hand. :) If we ever find ourselves in Edinburgh again, this will be on our revisit list for sure!
