YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q Came here on a Saturday afternoon. A man, who was likely the owner was running the place. I'm a sucker for hole in the wall authentic food. This place fits the bill. However when we were there, it was FILTHY. There had been people in the place previously, but I couldn't tell if it was the day we were there or last week. The gyros come off the spit, the rice is good. The place is unsanitary as a place could be and still be functional. Not only was the dining area a disaster, but so was the area where food is prepared. The floor was filthy, the tables were crusty, the salt shaker was coated in dirt, there were chairs misplaced, lightbulbs were missing. I expected tortillas food poisoning and I didn't. I'm shocked. I think if the owners just kept the place clean, they'd have a legit, thriving business. After all, who doesn't love an authentic falafel sandwich or a gyro?
