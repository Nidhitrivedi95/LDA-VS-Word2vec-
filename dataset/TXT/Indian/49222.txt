tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA This is truly one of my absolute favorite restaurants in the Valley. I have started reviews on this place several times before, but don't post it because I feel like my review doesn't do this place the justice they deserve. Well today I am probably still not going to be able to accurately describe how amazing this place is, but I want to give them my 5 stars already!!

India Oven is such a great treat and I have NEVER once been disappointed in this restaurant. As much as I frequent here, it bewilders me that the food has never let me down. And I know it won't - they are so consistent here. 

I hate buffets, but this is not your average buffet. The food is of the highest quality and you can tell it is authentic and that so much care went into its creation. It is so savory and the spices are always perfect. I love how there is a separation of vegetarian dishes from meat dishes, and there is an equal number of each to choose from. The prices are fair and the staff is great. I have never once had an empty cup of water while dining here. The waiters are the most professional here than I have seen anywhere else before. They are kind, respectful, attentive, yet they never come over too much or interrupt your meal by trying to start conversation that they don't actually care about. They are amazing, just like the food. 

Please give this place a shot as you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
