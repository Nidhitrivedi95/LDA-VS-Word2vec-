7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg We went fr the dinner ala carte, nd chose the vegetarian menu fr the nyt.. bad evening maybe, bt the soup nd starters were on a minus note, nd the gravy fr the maincourse wasn't tht great eithr.. hwevr, the naan nd othr bread varieties wer aromatic nd tasted amazing.. Overall, ths place s too pricy, scores fine for the ambience, bt the flavors r jst Ok..! Definitely nt worth the tym nd money spent here..
