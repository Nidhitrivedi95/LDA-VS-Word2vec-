0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw This joint is off the beaten path of the hustle and bustle of the main Danforth strip.

We walk in and were immediately greeted and seated. They have one high chair and plates/bowls and children's plastic utensils.

We proceeded to order half an order of shrimp pakoras, Manchurian fried rice and deep fried ginger chicken.

The pakora were served with a cilantro based dipping sauce. They also have an In-house hot sauce which was very good. They were piping hot and fresh. Sooooo delicious! 

This was followed by the Manchurian rice which tasted just like any other fried rice. I could not taste the cilantro or hot sauce. But it was very good.

The ginger chicken was tasty and was the dry kind without too much sauce the way I like it. It was on the sweet side which is not my personal preference but the dish was good when eaten with white rice.

The price was on the higher side. Total bill came to $34 and $40 with tax and tip. Service was excellent. They kept refilling our glasses and the food came promptly. We also had lots of leftovers that we took to go.

Very good overall. Would definitely return to try some of the other dishes.
