A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA This was apart of the UYE Little India Crawl: Burn that Dosa! (Many thanks to Roma :D)

Tried the Idli Manchurian - yuuuuum. I got several comments on the very scent of this dish as it wafted around the table. Mouthwatering? Yes. 

At first I was rather skeptical at the size (pretty small, imho) of this dish but it was exceptionally filling. Almost couldn't finish! 

Having read the other reviews, I'd love to come back to try the other options on the menu, e.g. Tokri Chaat (via Gavin), Mysore Malsala Dosa (via Jennifer M), Pani Puri (via Kat T.),  South Indian Thali (via Krishna N.) and much much more! 

The decor ain't much but wow, the service was really good (the servers are very attentive): our waters were constantly being refilled. Plus, they dealt well with our some 15 person group, :).
