UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I love this place! I've gone several times and I've never been disappointed. I think the goat curry is the stand-out of their menu. The lamb curry and their hot crispy on top naan are honorable mentions. They also have lots of veggie options.

It's a casual place and they serve a deadly for your diet buffet during lunch. I think the dinner offerings are better than the buffet, however, so would recommend that.
