9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g We brought my BF's mom and his family here for her birthday celebration.

The food was very very good, no complaints there.

We ordered a bunch of different items to share - my faves dishes were the veggie tandoor platter, the pistachio naan (so so good!!) and the chili coconut fish curry.

Downside : Our waiter however seemed possibly inebriated, and even more so as the night wore on. We ended up waiting 15 awkward minutes to pay the bill as he wandered away while we were trying to use the debit machine and it stopped working.

Not a great way to end what was mostly a fun night.

Pro tip : try the sanf (spelling?) on the way out!
