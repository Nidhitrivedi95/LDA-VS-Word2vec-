GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Horrible service! Sat down for 15mins didn't take our drink orders nor acknowledge us. I ordered appetizer I was looking forward to it but it never made it out to me! Ordered curry chicken dish and it was salty. My Nann bread was just ok, just wished they cut it for me instead of giving it to me in a basket without cutting it first.  The chef/owner that was cooking on Guy F. Show I'd rather have her  cook for me! The guys there didn't know nothing. So I won't be returning!
