FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q It's pretty decent Indian food without a lot of expectations. The lunch buffet has a lot of options to choose with. With some options you might be disappointed but overall it's better. Sometimes when the restaurant is buzzing with a lot of customers, the service becomes too slow. Overall, decent food
