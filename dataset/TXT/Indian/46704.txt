t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Very limited selection for the buffet.... $9 is not too much to pay for, but compare to Indian buffet places i have been....this place is not very good. Since i was not convinced with the selection of buffet i just ordered their hakka noodles... so disappointed!! Too salty and it taste and looked like lomein... i asked myself AM I in a chinese restaurant... we are just so hungry thats why we went to this place.. and according to yelp it has 4 star so we went for it!!!! FRIENDLY advice try somewhere else....!
