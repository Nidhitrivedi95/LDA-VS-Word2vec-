B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog Best Indian food I've had in Montreal. I'm from NJ and know good Indian food! I've been to three Indian restaurants in Montreal this weekend and the service here is great. The waiters are very professional friendly and efficient. The food is delicious. Best kulcha I've ever had! Better than in India, so fluffy! We had a great time.
