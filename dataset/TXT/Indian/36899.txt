nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ I wanted to come here all winterlicious but was just too busy and thought I would leave it for the summer. But after talking about it the day before winterlicious was over, I just HAD to go. So made the right choice. 
The name might sound really lame, but honestly the food here is in decent proportions served beautifully and tastes amazing on top of that. 
They're a quaint restaurant serving you water in plastic water bottles, and being a restaurant with a small capacity. But the service is so great and it's really a hidden gem for any foodie. 

Going for lunch, this is what me and my boyfriend got:
Calamari: not greasy at all. Perfectly size with a great sauce 
Soup of the day: it was some sort of pumpkin bisque but it was just so thick and creamy and well.. Good. 

Pork Loin: normally I'm not a fan of pork, but this was just soooo juicy. I've never tasted anything like it. And it also LOOKED good. Ah my stomach's rumbling now. 
Portobello Mushroom:  mushrooms and goat cheese? yes. Always and forever yes. It's an amazing combo and you'd regret not trying it. 

Espresso Pudding: it's drowned in mango sauce and looks exquisite. The espresso itself is simple and not too sweet. I really liked it and I'm not a sweets person. 
Berry Sorbet: really loved the presentation and also the sorbet itself. Yes it's minus fourth outside, but this sorbet was so easy to eat because it tastes good and YOH can justify you're pretty much being healthy by eating berries. 

Overall this place was amazing. Plating, taste and service was great. I guess the only thing is maybe they should have wifi/serve hot drinks, but other than that, this place is a gem.
