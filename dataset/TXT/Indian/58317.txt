Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g After reading the positive reviews, I had to check it out myself.  I got take-out and it was ready to pick up in 20 minutes.  Vegetable samosas were some of the best I have had in Toronto.  Not too greasy, but not too dry.  I'm not sure if they make them on site, but they are definitely delicious.  

I followed that up with the butter chicken.  Definitely a different taste, but definitely delicious.  The sauce was better than the chicken itself, with hints of cinnamon really making the dish. 

I'll have to go back to make a more complete review, but good all and all.
