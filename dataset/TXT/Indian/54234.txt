VvZnozdEpjw0e7Dg-kKIxg Drove by here on the way home as I wanted some Asian food and it's been a while since I had some good Indian food! Totally found this place by chance and man....am I so happy I did. I use to joke around with my Indian friends that my middle name should be Sanjay because I love the spices from Indian food so much. Indian people really know the art of spice! It's no surprise that early explorers to North America were looking for a passage to the orient in search of spices! 

Since some Indian places I've visited in Montreal don't understand spice very well I asked them how spicy they do their dishes. The guy at the counter told me they understand spice. So okay I ordered the table d'hôte for one person ($22.50).  It came as 2 pieces of tandoori chicken, lamb bhoona, vegetable bhaji, basmati rice, salad, naan and one gulab jamun. Everything was ordered as a medium spice. Also came with papadam 3 condiments: spiced carrots a sweet yoghurt raita and also what tasted like a mint sauce. Overall it was a great serving size and allowed for another big meal the next day! Wow... Spices were fantastic. Like an awakening in the mouth. Naan bread was crispy and doughy...just perfect. The lamb was outstanding. Tandoori chicken a bit dry but everything else makes me want to go back and place another big order. I will head back! Value is amazingggggg! 

Come check this place out if you want real deal Indian at reasonable prices!
