e8_Xt-ldpDgWHn92s3rBaQ I typically love hole-in-the-wall, mom and pop shops so I makes me sad to give this place a bad review. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it was ok, not creamy like it is supposed to be. The naan was a pita bread with butter and garlic, and I paid $2for it. I will not be returning.
