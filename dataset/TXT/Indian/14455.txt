C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Kalendar is a wonderful restaurant. Nice candlelit tables, warm decor, they offer an abundant selection of quality drink and food. The restaurant layout has a seperate bar and dining room area.   

Everything we ordered was esquisitely prepared and tasted marvelous. Order scroll #6 beef filled naan, nice. (see pic)

I'd dine here anytime, anyday. Definite recommend.  C'est bon magnifique!
