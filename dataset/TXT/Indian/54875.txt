WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA well, first rule of thumb on getting to an authentic restaurant, such as Indian or any other ethnic food. make sure inside plenty of the local ethnic people
this one wasn't one of them.
so you've got the feeling that this might not be the right restaurant to go to.

unfortunate for the indian restaurant, most of them are Buffet style.
for them to cut cost, they need to cut on the amount of spices they use in the food. so the taste can or could be very bland.

enough summary on that.
went there for lunch, and the food was .. not what I'm expecting (rule of thumb, only 1% of the customer were indian, so that tells you something already)
but, because I also go there with my other indian friend. we are giving this place a shot.
wouldn't go back..
