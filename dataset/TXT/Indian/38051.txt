ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw This review was for a nice dinner experience here about 1.5 months ago.  We had a party of 10 here for our good friend's birthday.

(This dinner was for 2)
Appetizer
Chicken thigh tikka-This was very juicy but tasted different than the ones that I had before.  This appetizer is a little bit small for 9 bucks though.

Tandoori Black Tiger Shrimp - This was so sweet and yummy...will order again.  Shrimp lover must try.

Entree
Karahi Goat-Portion is smaller than other Indian restaurant that I have been to.  Flavor was decent, but of course, I asked for a plate of raw onions and lemon wedges and it brings out the flavor even more.

Fresh garlic & corriander naan and roti-very fresh and good!

We had bought an icecream birthday cake that was pretty much hard like a rock (didn't let it thaw enough), and the server was very kind to slice up the cake for us.  The service was very wonderful here.  It is a bit sad to see that this restaurant was a bit empty on a Friday evening.

Food:  Yummy,  but wish the portion was bigger...
Service: Perfecto
