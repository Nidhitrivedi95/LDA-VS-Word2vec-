ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Really enjoyed this place from the moment we walked in even though we were the only ones In there at the time. The popadoms with the 2 sauces was really good. We had the chicken Korma and aloo gobi (vegetable something) and they were both busting with flavor amazing. We were served by the owner and he was very friendly and helpful. We loved this place and glad we have a great Indian on the west side. Can't wait to try the lunch buffet next. Don't get anything past a 6 on the heat level , we had a 7 and I was sweating bullets. Rice pudding was an awesome dessert.
