ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ Whether takeout or eat-in, this place is always delicious.  The buffet is a great value!  The premises are a little small, but the staff is very nice, and the atmosphere feels cozy rather than cramped.  The tandoori chicken is a big favorite of the hubby's, and I delight in the various vegetarian curries, perfect naan, and tasty little desserts.  No complaints!
