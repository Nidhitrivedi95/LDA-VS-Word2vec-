gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw I'lll start this review off with a warning that I'm not very familiar with Indian food, and Devi was one of the first I've tried, so I may be a bit biased in that respect. With that being said, this restaurant is one of my favourites in Montreal! Every time I've been here, I've left pleasantly (occasionally painfully) full with enough food packed away for the next day's lunch.

My meals here have been limited to weekday dinners and weekend lunches, and only very recently did I eat the lunch buffet for the first time. In my experience, the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet has the best value, especially the unlimited naan bread, which is pretty much my reason to live, but it lacks the presentation and selection that dinner has. And, of course, the food at dinner is fresher since it hasn't been sitting at the buffet table for a few hours waiting for someone to pick it up. Still, the lunch is a steal for its price, and it's great when you're in the mood for anything and everything all at once.

Dinner is a cosy, ambient affair. One detail that stands out for me is the gorgeous lighting - I almost want to steal one of those lamps! The service is attentive but quiet, which is nice when you're trying to hold a conversation at your table. Overall, I'll continue coming back to this charming and conveniently located restaurant. 

Note: the free tea offer isn't available at lunch.
