Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ Very good Indian food! Had the shrimp saag, and hubs had the chicken vindaloo. We also shared an order of veg samosas. The samosas were extremely flavorful,  and huge! My saag was spicier than I am used to but not in a bad way. My hubs loves spicy food and found the vindaloo "really hot!" I would definitely come back if I'm back in town.
