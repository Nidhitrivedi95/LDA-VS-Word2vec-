RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg I am praying that I had an anomalous experience.  I came here on a Sunday not realizing that there was an all-you-can eat buffet that costs around $16 without tax (expensive for a student).  Fine, whatever, I was there already - but the food was cold and not great, especially for what I paid.  My favorite dish is the saag paneer and it left me lacking.  The naan was also disappointing because it was cold and chewy.

Even worse, the mango lassi was not fresh and you could tell they used some mango syrup.  Or even if it was real, it was sickeningly sweet.

No thanks.
