CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Stepped in for a saturday lunch buffet. Well, for 12.99$ u definitely are eating way more than you have payed for ;) 
We went in for the mango lassi as well as that was supposed to be half-priced that day. And wow , it was one of the best lassi's that i've ever had ! PERIOD.
Food was good, not great. But definitely one of the better experiences from an indian restaurant so far.
