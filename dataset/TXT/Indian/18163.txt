EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg Few things are more disappointing than arriving home with your takeout, only to realize the most expensive item you bought isn't in the bag. Let's call this place Kabob N Less. 

I wish I had read the reviews before and looked at the spread; it's an inverted bell curve, and that should tell you everything you need to know. Who writes all those inflated 5-stars? 

So, you go in, you chat it up about dal and naan and chicken tikka, pay $18, leave a nice tip, and realize once home that you have:

- a fine garlic naan
- 4 or 5 CUPS of rice. Who eats this much rice? 
- a container of dal

But, no chicken kabob. $18 essentially for RICE, and some lentils. I shouldn't write this while angry, but man, this was not a complicated order. I was the only one there! Three people were up front working, overseeing, and engaging with me. 4, if you count the cook in the back. At one point the owner/manager asked me in what in hindsight appeared to have been mocking disbelief, "YOU know what DAL is??" Yes. I dated a Pakistani woman, and I've worked in India. Did those fun facts throw everyone off their game?

4-stars for the taste of what I did receive, but a serious infraction for the negligent rip-off, the disproportionate amount of rice, all of which resulted in an over-priced meal of things not even present. Why is it so difficult to find a respectable South Asian fast-food joint in this town?

**I wonder if I can still get that free tea for a review and check-in after this
