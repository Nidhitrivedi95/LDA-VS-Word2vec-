-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA The food is decent BUT the delivery time was absolutely terrible! Short version: it took over 70 min & they flat out lied to us when we asked for the tip & delivery fee back. Full version: we ordered through Yelp eat24 & after waiting for 50 min, we called and they said the driver just left and that he was coming straight to us. It takes no more than 3 min to get to our house from them. Ten min later our food STILL hadn't arrived so we just drove to the restaurant & the person we spoke to at the restaurant called the driver, driver said he'd be 2 minutes, so we went home and waited...for another 15 minutes. They called us just after they dropped the food off & said he'd been pulled over by the cops on his way to our house, that's why he was late. Well, we didn't see anyone pulled over when we drove to the restaurant so unless he took a really, really long & out-of-the-way route, that was a lie. Then we called the restaurant back to speak with a manager, we asked for them to refund the delivery fee & tip, they said the driver wasn't affiliated with their restaurant (funny, the guy at the restaurant said he loaned the driver his car). So we contacted Eat24 & Eat24 refunded the fee & tip immediately and told us that they did not have any Yelp Eat24-affiliated drivers that were responsible for that delivery and that in fact, they do not have any Eat24 drivers at all in our entire city. That, of course, means another lie from Chutney's. Things happen & delivery drivers can be late but lying is just flat out unacceptable.
