We heard a lot about the Chhole Bhature at this restaurant and were disappointed. We tried the desserts(Rasgulla and cup kulfi) and they were both okay. Won't visit them to eat the same dishes.

May give another try for their Meat Thai or their desserts as there are some good reviews, but I'm not in a rush to head back.
