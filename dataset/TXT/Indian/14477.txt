C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I wish I was in theneighbourhood more often because this is a damn cute coffee shop with cinnamon infused coffee.
It's just a nice touch, people.

This place gets crazy busy and can be off-putting just because you don't feel relaxed when there is a lineup out the door and the space between the tables is next to nothing as servers run past you.

But on a more relaxing day this is a super nice bistro where you can enjoy some quality food.
