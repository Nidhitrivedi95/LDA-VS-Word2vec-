LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw Went to Jaipur for the first time today, just in time for their lunch buffet.  In general, I'm not a big fan of buffets, but Indian is my one exception.  I have to say, this place has the best Indian food that I've tried in Charlotte so far.  The manager/owner(?) was extremely accommodating, and the buffet had a really nice selection to choose from.  We will definitely come back again!
