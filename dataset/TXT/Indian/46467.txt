SU56w479vUfFHsvmvQIf7A I want to start out by saying this is the best indian food my boyfriend and I have ever had. We had the Chicken Khuma, Chicken Tikka Masala, rice and naan. Everything was so full of flavor, definitely made that day.
The staff was very friendly, always checking in and filling up our drinks. 
Even though it was only across the street from our hotel, if your driving there's plenty of parking.
