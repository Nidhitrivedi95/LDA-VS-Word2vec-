0rrxeGhMUXZdyVt16DdKHw I was very excited initially when this place came up in the neighborhood. 
The store itself is very bright and clean. Often staffed by young women from the community. 

On the positive side, service is always good. The staff are friendly and will often give you an extra samosa to taste. The coffee and tea is also surprisingly excellent, although they don't always have it available. I would much prefer the coffee from here compared to Tim Hortons across the street. The ladies here also know how to give it the perfect amount of sweetness. 

On the downside, I truly am not a fan of their samosas. They are overpriced, oily, and not tasty. Full disclosure; I have only had their vegetarian samosas. It would be better if they had a baked option. I also feel that they should reduce the prices because members of this community will be unable to afford paying $5 for 6 samosas. Another suggestion would be to expand their menu to include other middle eastern dishes that are not fried. 

Overall an average experience. Might be good if you have a desperate samosa craving, I suggest washing it down with some of their coffee or tea.
