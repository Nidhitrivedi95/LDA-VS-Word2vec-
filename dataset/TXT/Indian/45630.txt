ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Absolutely the best Indian food I have ever had, anywhere.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating to every request I've made.  The lamb korma is quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten in my life... I do not say that without some hesitation, as I do eat out a lot and have had amazing dishes everywhere, but this dish is a truly sensual eating experience.  The garlic naan is also great, very fresh garlic.  It's rare to eat at a restraint and end the meal thinking that every single item that was brought to the table was outstanding, yet it happens almost every time we dine at India Garden.
