We went there for dinner and found a stapler pin in the aloo gobhi. This happened to me, but Imagine this happening to a kid. When we complained, the manager came and apologized, and changed my plate. He said he would compensate us in the bill and all he did was make my $4 lemonade free (on a $100 receipt). If you don't care to compensate, don't offer. If you want to compensate, offer something that could make a difference.

The service was bad too, the drinks arrived very late. The food is spicy than most Indian restaurants around and spicy in a bad way. The place is so loud and noisy and everyone seems to be cramped in the restaurant. I would never go there again and would strongly recommend you not to visit this place.
