Got chicken tikka masala and garlic naan...20$...I stopped eating because I'm super picky about meat and the chicken was weird random pieces unclear what was going on(I almost feel like some wasn't even chicken)...I like clean meat that has no extra ufo stuff attached to it and that's not what I saw :(
