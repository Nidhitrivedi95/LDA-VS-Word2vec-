PIoUjT9DISeEdmZk55w7jw Solid 3.5 stars. The drinks, lassi and cocktails were surprisingly good. They also had a very diverse selection of naan - garlic, potato, onion, cheese, you name it. Pretty interesting! I had the chicken tikka masala which was yummy and just the right amount of sweet. The basmati rice was also very fragrant as well. My husband had a lamb dish that had a bit of a kick to it. He loved it. For appetizers we got the chicken drumstick dish. It was yummy, but not amazing. Overall, the food was quite good. Service is slow though since they seemed to only have 2 waiters on hand. One serving the front of the room, and one serving the back. It took several asks to get anything.
