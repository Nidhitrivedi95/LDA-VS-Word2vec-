S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA This is by far the best Indian cuisine in town! I don't normally write reviews but I just had to praise this place because of the excellent customer service they provide as well as the magnificent food!  My favorite dishes are the fish vindaloo with a side of garlic naan and the chicken masala  any of their dishes are awesome and you won't be disappointed
