-cZOrBfMRkNRSYm02SiY7w I want to like this place. It's on my doorstep and as I like the concept it has a good impression written all over it. But sadly it hasn't lived up to my expectations. Biggest gripe is the prices v portion. Too expensive. What we got was tapas for the price of a decent starter. This meant that for a party of 6 including small bowls of rice and naans, Drinks and water we paid around £20. Each. 
Second gripe is spice, heat experience. There was none. It was explained by the waitress that the spice level is authentic. The vindaloo is possibility the biggest let down. Gripe 3: music. This was loud, louder than you'd want for a sharing and convo experience. 
So in all I will have to mark it down and probably won't make a return visit.
