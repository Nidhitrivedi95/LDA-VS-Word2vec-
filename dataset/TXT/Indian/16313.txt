DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I love this place.  While the service is sometimes a little on the slow side when they are busy, the food is always hot and fresh and delicious.  The lunch specials are a real deal, but the other regular menu offerings are also great, and I encourage you to venture off the lunch menu and try something different.  The saag paneer is always delicious, the curries are great, and the naan-- the perfect accompaniment to sop up the juice from whatever you have chosen to order.  I also love how the owner always welcomes me back, and if he has not seen me in a while, gently chides me for it and encourages me back.  Try this little restaurant for wonderful Indian food, and you won't be disappointed!
