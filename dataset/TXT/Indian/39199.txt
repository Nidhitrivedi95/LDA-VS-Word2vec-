oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw A local favorite for reasons I don't understand. The menu, Greek and Indian, is an odd pairing and the kitchen executes neither well. No raita, no naan - basic menu items in an Indian restaurant. We had two chicken curries. The chicken was cardboard dry, inedible really, "medium" spicy was bland, our hummus was tasteless. The service was dreadful, the server rude and unpleasant. The terrace, however, was pleasant on a warm evening. I live in the area, love the neighborhood, and want this to be good.  I have been here several times. It has never been great but this last was so bad I can't ever see going back.
