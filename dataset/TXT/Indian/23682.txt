gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Popped in on a whim because I wanted to eat vegetarian tonight. What a gratifying meal. I can't really spell the names of the dishes we ate, but all were flavorful, both fresh and complex, in ample portions that allowed for sharing without that grudging, resentful feeling. Somehow I have hard time imagining that anything here will disappoint. What stood out most, though, was the service. It had a wonderful lightness and alertness. No hovering, just a perfect awareness of our needs at the table and the rhythms of the meal. I'll be a regular. And in my next review I'll check the menu so I can be more specific about what I ate. 

Delightful.
