vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w We were on our way to a potluck party, ran out of time to cook, and didn't know what to bring... luckily we were near Pushap. We ordered 5 dozen of one of the finest samosas in town. If you have a craving for vegetarian indian cuisine or need to satisfy a need for indian sweets and are on a budget, this is the place to go! I mean where else can you find a dozen of samosas for $4.80?
