VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ I can't recommend the buffet, but I have had many dinners here, and it is usually pretty good.  Really, my first disappointing experience was my last visit (otherwise I might have given 4 stars overall).  The Malai Kofta (vege-balls) fell apart and ended up blending into the thick sauce.  I still enjoyed the dish, but I was disappointed.  I tried the Chicken Vindaloo for the first time, and it was done well, but I thought the dark meat chicken was kind of 'too dark'.  I had the Chicken Achari on a previous visit, and have to say the flavors were more complex.  I liked it more than the Vindaloo.  Garlic Naan is always a winner here.
