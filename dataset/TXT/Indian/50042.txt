U5rfxvnZUupaWT_SgIV79g Having eaten here twice, as its relatively new compared to the other restaurants in the FMP foodcourt, it has quickly become one of go-to's if I ever feel like foodcourt food.

Owner is super nice, always accommodating spice levels, so you can choose mild or super spicy like I do. He even gives extra sauce in case it wasnt spicy enough.

It is an acquired taste, so some may find their chicken to be dry, but I personally enjoy this barbeque style as much as I love tender chicken. Will be back to try the kashmiri indian curries. Cheap as well.
