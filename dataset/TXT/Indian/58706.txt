South Indian food is probably my least favorite type of Indian food, but my family insisted on going here. I could not believe how much I enjoyed the meal! We ordered and had food served to us in under 15 minutes. 

We ordered a variety of items: Idli with sambar, rava masala dosa, sada dosa, and paneer dosa. The idli was perfectly soft and the sambar complemented perfectly. All of the dosas were served with a generous serving of chutney and sambar. Everything was perfectly crispy. The best part of the dosas was that they weren't oily at all! Normally I go through a handful of napkins but I barely needed one.

Their prices made it even better - every dosa was $5.
