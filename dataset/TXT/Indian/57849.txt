yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I bought a Groupon to The Dhaba, and my fiance and I used it a few weeks ago.  It was really nice.  I liked the decor.  The place is a bit smaller than I expected, but very cute.  

I had the chicken tikka masala and it was excellent.  Spiced just right for me.  I asked for it at a 5.  My fiance had sag lamb, and he liked his as well.  I had garlic naan.  It was a little dryer than I like, but still pretty good.

We went next door to the shop and it was pretty cool to look around.  We will be back.
