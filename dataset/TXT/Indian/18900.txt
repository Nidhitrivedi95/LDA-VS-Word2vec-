eRxkg193gzTGoKaj-7Wyig mezbaan has a slightly upscale atmosphere. a bit o the pricier side but authentic and extremely great customer service! 

had the Naden Adu Curry which was absolutely amazing. the only downside is the price. for a cheaper fix for students I suggest the Kebab Mahal in Newington!
