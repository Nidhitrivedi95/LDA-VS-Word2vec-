UXEqtEXs92COE3UiaSx4oA I never was here before the reno, however have been here 3 times in the last month and have loved it each time. Fairly priced, always fresh and most important of all, friendly and courteous service. Skylark down the street is cheaper and more selection, but the quality is always hit or miss. Willing to pay a bit more for what The Famous has to offer.
