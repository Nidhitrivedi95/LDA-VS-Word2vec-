ug_NBv4W_5fZf3hi2h2U_w Stratengers is a fantastic departure from the newly chic "gastro Pubs" as they have been dubbed. An unpretentious local favourite, Strats offers a wide array of standard brewpub items, but also provides exceptional wood burned pizza's and a surprisingly strong sampling of Indian staples. The butter chicken is rich and creamy and comes with a side of naan bread for convenient dipping. 

The patio is stellar, as is the service, Strats will not steer you wrong.
