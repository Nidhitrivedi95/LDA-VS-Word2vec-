dNdKrKp7H1xtOxkONkXjkg I am a fan of Hakka No. 1. Consistent service and quality at their locations. Straight forward hakka food, believe 140 menu items ( always wonder how the chef memorizes all the recipes ), good portions, and great pricing. Unlike most locations they have lunch specials on weekends as well. 

I occasionally go to the Keele and Kingston Road location. Recently found out about Kennedy and Eglinton, I believe its new. 

Really nice large space, good amount of seating for large groups. With large windows, bringing in plenty of natural light. Clean environment. Large TV's, which is nice. Went on a weekend afternoon, service was quick. 

We ordered the chili chicken, bombay chicken, and mango chicken. Flavors were there, no issues with the food. My friends and I enjoyed it. 

My only issue was the side condiments. I wouldn't say that the sriracha went bad or something, but just tasted a bit off and had a weird consistency. As a result we got a handful of chili sauce packets, staff were generous with that.I didn't inspect every sriracha holder, but honestly wouldn't bring the place down cause of this. 

Would recommend for catering as well. Ordered a chili chicken tray for $45.00 cash. Fed 10 people, no issues.
