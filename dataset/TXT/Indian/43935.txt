RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I am giving a 4 based on previous excellent times at Lahore. My latest trip definitely does not deserve that high.

We have been there dozens of times, although not much since my kids were born. When wifey was preggo with kid #1 we lived down the street, and the Karahai Beef was one of her main craving go-tos. It is not the Ritz...paper plates, foam cups, plastic forks...but really who needs more than that.

Loved the Beef Kebab, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chana Masala and Aloo Gobi over the years. Naan is always good, Kulfi is almondy, and  the I love the Chai.

Loved it so much we have taken our parents there. Paper plates and all.

Not so anymore, but I will chalk it up to an anomaly. Last time we went, food was greasy and less flavourful than usual, but maybe it was just a bad night.
