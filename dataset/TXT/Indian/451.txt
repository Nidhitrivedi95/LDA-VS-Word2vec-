-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g In my quest to eat a more plant based diet tried this place for the first time and was not disappointed.  The food was excellent, service was great, menu selection was huge, the manager/owner spent quite a few minutes going through menu items to ensure I chose the tastiest vegan items, the restaurant had good ambiance, was clean and food came out fast.  It's in a strip mall and doesn't look like much but looks are deceiving in this case.  Wine selection was limited but the red was good, so they chose wisely.  Highly recommend!
