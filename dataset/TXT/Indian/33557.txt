LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg Lovely indian style tapas restaurant.

My boyfriend and I went to Tuk Tuk because we didn't just want one or two indian dishes, we wanted to eat from several. That's exactly what we got. Busy, buzzing atmosphere was great in this BYOB spot. A few pointers:

- MUST GET: Butter Chicken
- Steer clear: Saag paneer - never has paneer been so salty and saag just like wilted spinach
- BYOB: There is an off license just a few doors down on the side street. Basic beer and very basic wine selection.
- Tapas = small plates. All of the selections are pretty small. We had the following and were full:

Mumbai Burgers (one burger), Samosas, Chutney, pappadom (x2), Kurkure, Sag paneer (again, skip it), raste ke biryani, butter chicken, peshwari naan, garlic naan.
