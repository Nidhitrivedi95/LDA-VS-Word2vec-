LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA We were served Andhra dosa which had spinach paste inside ! We did realise it was not what we wanted as pic of Andhra dosa in their menu looked completely different than what we had been given ! Although they insisted it was still Andhra dosa , we totally knew it was not the rit one and requested it to be taken back ! Next came unexpectedly to us, but we were offered another dosa and were not charged for the andhra one ! Professional and gracious attitude towards their guests ! Food is served with great care and devotion which is what matters the most ! Amazing experience  :)
