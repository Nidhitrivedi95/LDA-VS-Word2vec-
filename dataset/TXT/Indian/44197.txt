RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Well, I'm going to be one of the very few who have given this place a "meh" rating.  My GF and I aren't sure what all the hype is about.  We have a long list of better Indian and Pakastani restaurants in the SF Bay Area.  We wanted to like it, since it came with great hype...but just couldn't.  The chicken biryani was so oily and over spicy, that it was impossible to eat.  Plus, the quality of the chicken IMO was less than average.  I'd give it a 1 star, but the people who worked there were so nice and helpful when we told them about the food displeasure.  Sorry, folks.
