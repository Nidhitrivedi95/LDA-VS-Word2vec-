02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ This was our first visit to this location for a birthday dinner.  The food had great flavor though i was not super impressed as the quality of food is the same you could get at any indian restaurant.   What you dont get at the other restaurants is the indian style decor and ambiance.   The architecture of the building inside and out is very pretty and fun. They now serve "dirty mango lassi".. yummy!

Pro- the food was hot and the dishes are different than what you would see ata typical indian restaurant in the USA.  The chia tea was delicious.

Con- i dont think the price of the food matched the quality but i say you should go and see for yourself.   The garlic naan was not garlic flavored and not much to write home about.  The service did not meet normal expectations as they didnt use seat assigment when delivering food so it was like a cattle auction on who ordered which dish.  Also, the server was not attentive so we have to chase him down a couple of time. We were missing dishes and had to ask for them more than once. Dinner was at 6:30 and we didnt get to leave until 9:30.  Even for a party of 9, 3 hours is way too long.  We were waiting for them more often then the restaurant waiting for us. 


 I understand not all places will split a check so this is more of an FYI.
