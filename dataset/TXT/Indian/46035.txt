SMNZS7w9Blmc8TOUZ4oqYg I just moved to Strongsville OH from AZ literally 2 days ago and Bhelwala was literally my first adventurous meal out here. No regrets! Great experience! 

Like what the fellow yelpers said below, this is an indian fast food restaurant in chipotle/subway style. You choose your carb style or whatever it's called (rice bowl, salad, or roti wrap) first, then you move down the lane to get your choice of protein (veggies/chicken/lamb), complimentary toppings (potatoes OR garbanzo beans), sauce  (spinach/tikka masala), MORE veggies (more like toppings), and MORE sauces (chutney, hot sauce with garlic, and yogurt raita). Extra 99 cents for okra, just FYI. 

The service was GREAT! They really cater to your needs and are extremely nice. They will let you sample the sauces, too!

My rice bowl was surprisingly good and I will definitely be back again! It was really flavorful and I highly recommend getting both the hot sauce and the yogurt.
