Pros: Indo-Chinese food that is more than passable.  Not as good as Mumbai (what is?) or NYC/SF, but still pretty darn good.  We like their fried rice and noodles more than their actual meat dishes.  I think their noodles/fried rice are 4-5 bit their actual meat dishes are 3-4.  

Cons: service.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.  Did I mention that the service is horrible?  And this means all types of service, takeout and eating in.  In fact, we will not dine there anymore because the service is so bad.  So we stick with takeout.  But they have missed their promised time by more than an hour once before.  And that my friends, takes true effort.  If you get your food within 15 min of it being promised, consider yourself lucky.  These guys want to be so authentic, they are actually on IST (Indian Standard Time for the non-desis reading this).  That being said, it's something we put up with because we do like the food.  We order from here at least twice a month.  It would be more, and we'd also dine in, if there was any semblance of decent, timely service.  

I hope the management can fix the service issue, because if they can't, they are going to frustrate otherwise loyal patrons.
