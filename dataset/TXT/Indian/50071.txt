U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw Excellent lunch today. Ordered the butter chicken (because I'm a wuss) and it came back with just enough spice to not set my tongue on fire. Really tasty. (small con: would have loved a bit more.) 

The rice was fine and the side potato whatever-that-was was delicious. Naan bread was slightly too burnt on one side for my liking. 

Mango lassi was also excellent, and this glowing review was set in stone before I was served an extra small glass of the lassi after complimenting it. Nice touch. 

Despite all tables being used, we were not rushed out of the restaurant. Very appreciated.

All in all, this is 4.5 stars. I am giving 4 despite only tiny negatives (small portion sizes and slightly burnt naan) but I could just as easily give this meal 5 stars. Ah well, room to improve. 

Thanks for lunch!
