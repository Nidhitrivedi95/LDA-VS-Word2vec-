GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg We wanted to go to the Thai place next door, but it was closed, so we tried this place instead, and it was awesome! We ordered samosas for an appetizer, but they were out. However, the food was quickly brought out so it didn't matter. We ordered a chicken kabob and chicken tikka masala. Both DELICIOUS. This little place has big flavor. They also threw in a free dessert. So nice, so good.
