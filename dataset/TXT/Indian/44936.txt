When I was here for dinner a little over a year ago, the buffet (the matter paneer in particular) was fan-flippin-tastic.  Service was great, the food was amazing, and I swore an oath to myself that I would somehow come back here.

I was in Vegas with my fiancé this past weekend and, even though he's not big on Indian food, I talked him into having dinner here because of how good it was.

Womp Womp.

Did they change ownership??  There's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore.  "Well, I can't eat embarrassing amounts at the buffet, but at least I can order the matter paneer off the menu," I thought.  There was one nice host/busser, one food runner, and one disinterested waiter, which got to be a problem as the dinner crowd picked up.  The naan was sub-par; more burnt air bubbles than anything.  My beloved matter paneer was totally different.  It wasn't bad.  Actually, it was pretty decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be.  We sat at the table, done eating, plates cleared, for a loooong time before I was able to practically tackle the waiter to get our check.

Had I never been here before, this would have been a 2.5-rounded-up-to-3-stars-to-be-generous experience.  But knowing what was and what could have been, this mostly left me disappointed and apologizing to my fiancé for misleading him.
