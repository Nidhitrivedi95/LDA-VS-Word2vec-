m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Uh, so THIS PLACE. Is. Fab. Just stopped by to pick up some food to go (so this review isn't about the whole restaurant experience) and the man at the front table was enthusiastic, kind, and helpful as I was picking things to try from the menu. It smelled nice, comfy couch at the front, food was cooked quickly...and then I came home to the best Indian food I've had in sooooommee time. Veggie appetizer sampler is delish, comes with great sauces, and is $5.95?! Insane. Naan was cooked perfectly, and the tikka masala had a niceee little spice. Can't wait to see this place do well!! Champaign and the owners deserve it!
