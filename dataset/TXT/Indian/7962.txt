6z8izreEJW6bSAmBBwdPdA The sad thing about reviews of Phoenix Indian restaurants are made by non-Indians and others who have no real experience with Indian food. The reviews of Curry Leaf are an example of that.  This is not a restaurant by any means.  This is fast food Indian.  The food was bland and tasteless.  I'm Indian so I know what I'm talking about.  I ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala "wrap"  The chicken was dry and had little sauce. It was also expensive.  It was made by some Auntie who has no experience cooking; she is not a professional cook.  

I hate to write this review because the people were nice and it's in a nice convenient location but I was very disappointed.  It really looked as if a couple quit their jobs and decided to open an eatery.  It was very cheap looking and they charged a lot of money for very subpar food. I know we need more Indian restaurants/eateries in the Phoenix area but at the same time we should have standards. This place would clearly not be in business in a city with several quality Indian restaurants like Dallas, Houston, NY, Chicago, LA and SF have.
