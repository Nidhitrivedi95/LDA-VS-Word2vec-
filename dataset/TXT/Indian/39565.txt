P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag If you're looking authentic north Indian food, this is *the* place to go. I emphasize north because the naans, chicken butter masala, fish amritsari are awesome. But if you look for south Indian dishes like dosa, idli, you might be disappointed. The punjabi dishes are the best picks in the neighborhood, and possibly in whole of Pittsburgh. I have never had such a fulfilling Indian dinner in US before. Mention you're a student to get a dollar off. Also, the masala chai or spiced tea is a nice add-on which I love.
