HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw I'm sorry, but I'm not a huge fan of this place. 

I've eaten at many Hakka restaurants, and believe me when I say that Faley's food is nothing special. It's either too salty, too oily, or just too bland at times. 

The place is usually packed though, which surprises me. The decor is very mediocre, and looks like your average Chinese restaurant. 

Service is good though, which is what earned the two stars. There was a woman who possibly owned the restaurant who was very friendly. 

Otherwise, this place is overpriced and nothing special. If you want seriously tasty and well portioned Hakka cuisine, check out Hakka No 1 at Keele/Lawrence.
