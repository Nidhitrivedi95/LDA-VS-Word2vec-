RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This once used to be my favourite restaurant back in 2007 since it was newly opened. Now as their business and staff grew, their food lost their homemade taste it once had.  Still, a nice place to visit with family once in a while.  I do recommend to be mindful of how much you order because their portion size is fairly large and not go in with too great of an expectation of their service and food.
