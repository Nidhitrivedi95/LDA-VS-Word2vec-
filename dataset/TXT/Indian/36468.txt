NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg It's a fast-casual place... the ideal lunch spot; it's like Chipotle, but way better because 1. the food is amazing, 2. the service is always friendly/ patient/ helpful, 3. it's Indian = naan!

They have a handwashing station right next to the plastic-ware/ soda machine. A+
Excellent vibe. Very modern & clean. 
 
The service is excellent... always friendly, smiling faces, willing to explain menu items or how the ordering process works. I got my order to go, and the person behind the counter made sure all of the order was accounted for. 

Yes, the food is Americanized (we're in Ohio), but it's really good. I love that there's another vegetarian-friendly place in the area. I typically get a meal, which is a ton of food. Ask for extra hot sauce. 

Unfortunately, I'm not in the area often so I only eat here once every month or so (please open more locations). They did a great job with location though, across from Whole Foods. There's an around-the-side exit if you can't/ don't want to turn left across the busy road.
