OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Spent a few years in Vancouver and boy let me tell you they have gazillions of Indian restaurants, so i had the opportunity to eat a lot of Indian food (plus I ate lots of home cooked Indian food at my Indian friends' place) - this to say, that this place tastes amazing and the price is excellent. One of my favourite Indian restaurants.
