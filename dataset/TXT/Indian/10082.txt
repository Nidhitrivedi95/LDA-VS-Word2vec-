The place was busy but we were seated right away. We requested a booth and that's where we were seated. The food was fresh and very delicious. The selection was very broad and there were tons of great South Indian dishes to choose from. The chicken 65 was great and so were the desserts. We all tried a variety of dishes and none were bad. The naan was also fresh and the waiters kept our baskets full. When we paid our bill at the front, the owner was there and was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. Finally a good, clean Indian spot in Madtown!
