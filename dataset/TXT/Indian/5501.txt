I went here with a colleague for a late lunch and boy was I surprised, with food ranging from Tibet, Nepal, Thailand and Malaysia the menu was simply amazing. I'll admit the decor is a little rustic and the prices are above average compared to the serving size, but the food was fresh and clean so what's not to love.
