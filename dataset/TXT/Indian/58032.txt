Then, we tried to order a bottle of wine. Selection #1: "Oh, we're out of." Selection # 2: "Let me see..." "No, we're out of that one. My husband gamely tries another selection. They come back with "We're out of that as well. Perhaps you might like the merlot?" 

The food arrives, blessedly, quickly. It's mediocre Indian. We've lived in major metropolitan areas and just weren't impressed. The menu, at first glance, IS impressive. But the food was just above average.

One last note. The alley-shaped space is a noise box. Be prepared to yell your thoughts across the table. So much for a nice night out.

**UPDATE** The owner offered us a dinner in response to our disappointment. We responded that, rather than that, that he ensure that no future diners experienced what we experienced. I'll give him another star for trying to remedy the situation :  )
