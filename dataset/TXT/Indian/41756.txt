Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw I sincerely dislike the food at this place. The food is sweet and completely not authentic. Better places to go to around here are Jaipur Grille (great food and lunch value) or Banjara (better food than Chef of India but decor is drab).

My colleagues have also had some terrible experiences with the lunch buffet here.
