NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Far exceeded my expectations...wow, good stuff.  I want to call this place the Chipotle of Indian food but that description completely dumbs it down.  The flavors are authentic Indian...it is so approachable for people who are new to Indian food and flavors (but not for this old goat...I have eaten seriously authentic Indian over the years).  There is a great sense of humor about this place from the naming of the chulah ovens to the copy on the napkins.  I ordered the chicken tikka, chickpea masala, Naan and a side of hot sauce with the side of mango sauce.  Deeee-licious.  And flavorful without being spicy.  If you think Indian food has to be blow-your-ears-off-spicy, eat here and debunk your own myth (or go eat at Taste of Kerala and actually have your ears blown off).  Are you as neurotic as me about what you eat?  Check the back of the menu for a complete list of nutrition information.  BOOM.  Not sure why BBQ is in the name...does not make sense to me.  Anyway...Brilliant concept, great atmosphere.  Save that last piece of Naan for me...pretty please?
