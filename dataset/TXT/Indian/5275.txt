2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw The horrible place to take your family.

The people working there can't speak english. I asked if they could warm up my food for which a guy working there bluntly said 'NO'.I was taken aback by his response so I asked 'sorry, why no'? , the guy says microwave not working broken'.. I would have agreed if he said in a polite way or atleast explained the situation.  Come on , customer serive obviously matters.  When I realised he lied about microwave i went to his colleague who offered to warm up my food the first guy came running to the second guy and prompted him not to warm and said ' microwave stopped working I told her'. Then the other guy was a little surprised and gave my food back.  It was very obvious to the people standing there that first guy ran to the second guy just to save his big ass when I realise that was a lie from second guy.   And food is all oily and someone working next door told me that it is not fresh and please don't  buy because he had stomach upset after dining at samosa king. Beware guys. I asked for just 2 peices of bajji And the first guy said it it 5 for $5. I said i just want 2 peices and the first guy kept repeating what he said. He basically was arrogant.
