J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Ran in here last week and had a quick dinner. Ordered up the Meat Combo (impressed with the Tandoori and the butter chicken; like the kebab and prawn). Also had a half order of the Tikka Masala for good measure that I thought was meh.

I don't know how this isn't a 4 star spot in anyone's book. The food quality varies from solid to excellent while the prices are relatively low given that the portions are generous.

Perfect atmosphere for a low-key Indian restaurant and great service.
