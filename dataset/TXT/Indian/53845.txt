VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ The buffet is good. Lots of selection. But I would like for it to be spicier but I understand that they have to cater for patrons who cannot take the spicier stuff. The thing that I was disappointed with was the service. There are 2 servers (male and female) during the weekend. The male server was excellent. But the female server could do with better customer service. Always seemed irritated. Not pleasant at all. Her service brought down my impression significantly. I think twice about going there because of her.
