This is the one you want to go to!

It also is amazing for lunch buffet. If you are inexperianced with Indian food the buffet lets you pick and choose and really figure out what is what and more importantly what you dig.

The Naan bread is killer as well. I recommend the Butter Chicken and ordering a bowl of rice per person, it goes pretty fast if shared... or maybe I just love it too much.

One negative is the wait time can be a little bit when it's busy. Def check it out.
