DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ The restaurant was good but the food was horrible. I went in because people gave good reviews to the restaurant. But I guess they gave it a good review so that we can feel the pain they went through eating the old food or maybe they just went in to see the restaurant and their menu and then thought maybe next time and felt the food might be good seeing the restaurant but it is not. 
They had old food even on a Saturday afternoon. 
But a nice surrounding place.
