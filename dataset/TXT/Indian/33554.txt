LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg We got 5 different curries, all of them were great, most around  £5 each. Giving 3 stars because paying £2 for one piece of naan or for one cup of rice is ridiculous. Maybe we're spoiled in the US, but that's a horrendous upcharge compared to what we're use to. Actually rice is generally unlimited in most Indian restaurants.
Also, the waiter was definitely pushy trying to get us to order more curries, insisting 3 per person.
