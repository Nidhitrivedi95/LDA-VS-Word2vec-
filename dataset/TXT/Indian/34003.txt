Thank you for helping us create such amazing memories. Your wait staff was so helpful and kind, everyone is so professional and willing to help! The food was delicious, we received many compliments with the venue. I highly recommend Bombay Palace for dining and even small group gatherings, they are very accommodating and the food is delicious!
