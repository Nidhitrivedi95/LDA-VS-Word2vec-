Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ I had the non veg platter and it was just okay. I didn't find anything really great about the food. One minor annoyance, and I'm not sure I can really fault the restaurant for this, was I asked to replace one item with another but my server declined saying it was a set menu. I didn't see the big deal, but I suppose they have to stick to their rules. Anyway I just didn't think much of my food. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't spectacular either. The kheer was really good but I found the food to be just okay.
