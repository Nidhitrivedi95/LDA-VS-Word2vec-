9K2FHkajUaTU4P2cfFJmGQ I dont know why this place is never as crowded as it the best tasting Indian food !!! They had both Goat curry as well as Goat Biryani in the weekend buffet !
The Chicken Tikka Masala was to die for ! Apart from this they also had fish fry , egg curry !! Also a ton of other variety of items that i've never found in ANY other buffet !! Also their price is simply unbeatable!!!
