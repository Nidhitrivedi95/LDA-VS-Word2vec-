1PfNM_6ouYvNEbAukY76EQ The resuturant  has the right elements to be make a good namr in the indian food culture of GTA. It was  our first experience in this restaurant  ans we were served by a pleasant server Neelam. She gave nice advice on the house special and we tried Veg Sheesh Kabobs & one of their Paneer Sabzi.  Their menu and food has a touch of Sindhi food. We enjoyed our dinning experience. As a critic they can really do well by beining an experienced server who can introduce their menu. They can also improve their wall dicors.  we will like to visit again.
