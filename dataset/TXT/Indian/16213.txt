De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA Chettinad cuisine is spicy and flavourful.  My must tries - even for meat eaters would be the Cauliflower 65. Over the years, I've been here many times.  It's deep fried, spicy, cauliflower goodness. So amazing, whenever we go we end up getting two plates. In terms of the main dishes - the dosa is okay, the crab curry is great, the briyani is so good, gravy, raita (yogurt), and a hard boiled egg is provided. The egg parotta/roti is also good! The curries overall - from the vegetarian and meat dishes I've sampled have been good. Their "North Indian" dishes are decent enough.  Mango shake the last time I tried as pretty good. 

Cons: In terms of service , it's not superb. that being said, I've had some good wait staff. and  sometimes you get someone who forgets to refill water but it's okay. It's not hard to flag down attention or walk up to the counter (do whatever you got to do).

Portion sizes are adequate for family style sharing of dishes. 

They also have a side room to host small parties and etc.
