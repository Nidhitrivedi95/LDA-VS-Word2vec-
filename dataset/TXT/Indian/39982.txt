pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I tried this restaurant after seeing it numerous times on my way to the mall and then reading about it in Pittsburgh Magazine. The food was good, but i wish it had been hot (temp wise). It tasted like it had been microwaved and not all the way through since it was cold in some areas. 

The man who seemed to be the owner never seemed to leave his perch on a raised area behind the cash register. He was always yelling at the help and eyeballing all the customers the entire time we were there. 

The overall experience was not good. Luckily the food tasted okay. I may get my family to try Indian food again no thanks to this restaurant.
