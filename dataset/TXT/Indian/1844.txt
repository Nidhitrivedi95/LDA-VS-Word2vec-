-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw The girl who served food there when I went had the worst attitude I had ever seen. She made the entire experience very very shitty, gave me dirty and impatient looks while I waited with the other customers as my food took the longest, as though it was my fault. She also spilled sauce over my tray and it dripped onto my bag and forearm. Everyone was given a side salad except for me. When I asked her about it, she did not acknowledge it. She talked to her boss and her boss told her to give me extra sauce and rice. She still did not acknowledge me and just waited. So I had to ask, can I have sauce? She, armed with an impatient look, then drowned every grain of my rice in sauce to make some kind of porridge curry, which does not taste good. So I asked for extra rice, which I was entitled to. She glared at me before giving me the extra rice. And the cherry on top of this terrific experience is the chicken that was raw near the center. 

Overall shitty experience, fire that girl waitress and it'll be heaps better.
