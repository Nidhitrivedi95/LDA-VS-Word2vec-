J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I went to Little India Restaurant with a friend on a Friday night. There was a small wait (not even five minutes) and the place was busy. The food on every plate looked amazing. 

Wait times and service were a little delayed for our food, but it was completely worth it. I had the vegetarian Thaili with three vegetarian curries, all were fantastic, and my friend was fighting me for my raita! She had the Chicken Korma and assured me it was just the right blend of curry and sweet. It smelled FANTASTIC. 

This is a good, consistent restaurant. You won't have a bad meal.
