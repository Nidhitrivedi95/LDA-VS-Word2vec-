Sd1UqBycilIJO-m9Cmmz8g We are BIG fans. I have eaten in only a couple times. Takeout - probably had it 6-8 times and always right on.  I haven't ordered by delivery so I cant comment on that. Usually I walk in, order, take a stroll, adn come back 25 min later and evverything ready to go.  Every dish we've tried was generous in portion and very tasty. Also, they package things really well - the food stays hot, organized, and never soggy the way it can be at some places.  Prices are competitive with similar places. It was nice to walk in last Saturday and see every table taken.
