emNQ1jxMev2NzIcP2wdfgg We went out for our monthly dinner date with friends and the 5 of us were not disappointed with this restaurant.  We agree with previous reviewers that the place is small but welcoming, service was friendly and helpful.
Based on the server's recommendations we ordered the Mogo (fried cassava thick cut fries) served with 4 different chutneys/sauces and Daal Bhaji (lentil dumplings).  The cassava was fresh and served hot, the sauces were interesting, one spicy, one tangy with tamarind, a coconut based one and a hot green chili sauce.  The dumplings were a bit bland.
The mixed grill platter was inconsistent, the ribs and chicken wings were excellent, well flavoured, tender and moist.  The chicken cubes on the other hand were dry and tasteless.  On the other hand the African Thali mixed plate was a hit, the fish was fried perfectly, not greasy and served with a smooth spinach curry.  The bean curry was a bit thin and lacked flavour.
