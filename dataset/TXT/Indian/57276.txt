Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ This garden of goodness never fails me. We ordered take out on a Sunday afternoon and it was just as delicious as sitting in the restaurant. I have to say that that is probably the best thing about this place to me: the food tastes just as good whether you eat in or take out. A lot of restaurants aren't consistent with their foods and I really appreciate the fact that India Garden is. They always ask how spicy you want your food..."0-10" . I always receive my meal accurately prepared, and the staff are friendly and accommodating. A few times they even gave me extra garlic naan (brownie points)!! 

While eating in, I find that our food is always brought to us in a timely manner and drinks are refilled graciously. If you really can't decide and are here during the lunch hour, you can't go wrong with the lunch buffet.

Now that I am writing the review, I can't even think of something that I would improve about IG if I could. Maybe it would be a bit of updating the building? However I like the "old feel" and think it adds character.

A must-try is the shrimp saag (I can't stray), and the Taj Mahal beer they sell has been requested by my brother in law for years, since he can't find it anywhere in Philly. I honestly carry it out in boxes for him- it's that fabulous. Quality Indian cuisine doesn't get much better than this!
