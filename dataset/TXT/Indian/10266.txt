9N7VAcNFqjHptX3vRWqgnw I just ordered delivery from Earth Indian but would not order from them again.

The Badami Murgh Tikka was so salty I had to wrap naan around it just to get it down. Really bad.

The traditional chicken tikka was very good. 

Naan was excellent, large portions. Steamed rice was same as anywhere else, perfectly fine.

One of the chicken dishes had oil/liquid seeping out if the container and the dish itself.

Food was not the type to entice a second try, unfortunately. However, other reviewers seem to like it.
