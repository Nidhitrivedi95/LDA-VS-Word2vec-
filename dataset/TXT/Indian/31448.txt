kTJEf56gjzBSpi9X14X54Q First time ordering here this past Saturday. The owner was very nice and explained dishes to us without seeming annoyed with my 20 questions. I appreciated that he asked if we wanted our food "American" spicy or "Indian" spicy.  After not believing we could handle the heat of Indian spicy, he brought us a small sample to see if that was tolerable. We settled on the lemon noodle dish (I'd give that more than 5 stars if I could), lemon rice (solid 4 stars) and Paddu (10 stars!!) I would recommend ordering ahead as our food took about 30 minutes to come out. Each dish is prepared fresh to order (nothing is pre-made). I really enjoyed my food and would recommend without hesitation.
