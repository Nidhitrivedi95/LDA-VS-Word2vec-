Jq60uSolPAPJKXulKzyP4Q It is sometimes hard to believe that all the food is here is vegetarian.  The food is tasty and so fresh.  The pakoras... yum!  So crispy!  The curries - to ie for!  And the Indian sweets.  I've never had jalebi or barfi this fresh before in my life (granted, I've always wanted to go to India.).  Usually, if you go to other Indian places in North Etobicoke, their sweets will taste oddly like samosas or some mix of 3 day old Indian food.  Not at Brar!  Thumbs up all around.  

Side note: the Indian place next door is terrible.  Do not go there.  I think the only reason they are in business is because the lineups at Brar Sweets are too long and people assume that they'll get equally as good food.  Not so.
