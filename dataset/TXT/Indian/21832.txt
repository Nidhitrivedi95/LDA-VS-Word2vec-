gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw Had lunch here - food was reasonably good (had the gyro with fries, other lunch guests had gyro and chicken kabob).  Was moderately busy when I was there, and kitchen/register was lightly staffed, and food took around 30 - 35 min. from order to service - which was a bit long, particularly for a lunch on a workday.  Staff was reasonably friendly.  Decent lunch option downtown based on quality of food.
