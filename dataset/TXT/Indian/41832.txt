QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg The place was freezing yesterday.  The plates were cold making the food cold.  I've eaten here a few times and have had about enough now.  They refuse to put small bowls out for the soup.  They took the cups off the buffet years ago so you couldn't use those and are using styrofoam for the tea.  Shame on you!  Lazy and wasteful.  How many trips am I supposed to make to the buffet for some rasam.  It's ridiculous and thoughtless.

The food is mostly very tasty and well prepared.  My problem lies with the amount of cayenne they put in EVERY dish.  ALL OF THEM.  I eat at hundreds of Indian restaurants all over the country and NONE except Tamarind in the Pittsburgh area are hotter. I would like to slowly enjoy my food not gulp it down quickly.  I like spicy but this is ridiculous.  

The service has ranged from rude to ok here and the assortment of buffet items used to better. It's too bad.  I would come here more often.  I was at one of their places and they even made the raita hot.  Clueless.
