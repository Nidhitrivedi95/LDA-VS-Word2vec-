GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw My vote for favorite Indian food goes to Tandori Times 2.  The food is great, the restaurant has a very cool atmosphere, the wait staff is extremely friendly, and they offer great daily specials.  This locations is definitely less crowded during dinner time but I'd eat at Tandori Times 2 any time!

I am sad to say I have to change my original rating for Tandori Times 2.  Not once but twice while dining with friends my debit card was swiped for not only my bill but my friends bill as well.  The first time the problem was taken care of quickly.  The second time I got the run around before they took care of the problem.  I have been hesitant to go back to Tandori Times 2 since this happened and will never go back  without cash.
