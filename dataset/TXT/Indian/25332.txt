HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A The food was mediocre. I had the lunch buffet and I came around 145 so about forty five minutes before they close to get ready for dinner. I would expect that there would still be some food or it slightly replenished. It was decent though, the biggest issue i had was i couldnt get a server to get me a drink or napkins. When he did walk by after helping the only other table in the restaurant o had to flag him down. He seemed annoyed i bothered him. When i got my stuff he seemed more friendly and pleasant. If youre looking for great this place isnt it but if youre looking for average with little or no service because you really want Indian food this place will do. I might be able to revise my review coming in at a busier time but so far this has been my only experience.
