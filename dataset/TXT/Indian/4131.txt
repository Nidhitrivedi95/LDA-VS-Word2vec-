1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA Great family-style Indian restaurant with booths, comfortable and homey in a corner of a strip mall, packed with parked cars. It has the feel of a family run business. The menu is lush and colourful well laid out with all the favourites from India. Prices are decent too! Their naan came in quite a variety with the garlic naan tasty and fresh. Another favourite was their chicken wrap made with fresh naan wrapped around moist chunks of chicken with a zesty sauce, wow what a delightful spin on some classic ingredients and absolutely blows Tim Hortons chipotle wrap completely out of the water. No need to add extra sauces or anything like that to our food as it came to us piping hot, seasoned and flavourful. My shrimp Masala was excellent with plump juicy shrimp cooked just right. Our service was fantastic with a quiet guy who showed up exactly when we needed him, filling up our water glasses and bringing us all the good stuff. Kudos to the staff who were inundated with a festival going on nearby and the lineup for takeout and sweets going out the door, yet not missing a beat with the sit down customers. Very impressive! I'd love to visit again and try another dish or two.
