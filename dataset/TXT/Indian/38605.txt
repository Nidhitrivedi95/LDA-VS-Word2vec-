OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We had a really great meal here! Jose, our server, was the best! He really knew the menu inside and out and had good suggestions so that we could maximize the menu tasting! (And he was funny as shit too!). I had the palak paneer which had a nice slow burn to it. The butter chicken was sweet and quite tender. The betel nut ice cream was interesting too, brightly colored and reminiscent of good n plenties. The menu is extensive and has a section of bottomless curries for those with big appetites!
