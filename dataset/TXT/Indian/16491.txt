DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA Best South Indian Buffet (esp Saturday and Sunday) in the Cleveland area.  It's not your typical American Indian food with Tikka Masalas, Mutter Panneers, etc...it's much better than that!  Dosas, Chaat and a huge buffet with spiced meats, currys, etc.  

I especially liked the option to have a Dosa made fresh in front of us.  Pack it in without the cheese (that's the American flavor) and enjoy the coconut or tamarind sauces with it.  Yum!
