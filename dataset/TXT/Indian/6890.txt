4L3VJwVqUareUUIGPE2zcw I really love Shalimar's family friendly atmosphere. I can bring my 2 year old and family for a great time here. We share the large food portioned plates, and CHAI TEA is FREE REFILLS...WHOO HOO!!!! The sauces are authentic, and the owners are extremely friendly and hospitable. It's the most authentic in town... I keep coming back, and the food is always amazing!!!! YUMMY!!!
