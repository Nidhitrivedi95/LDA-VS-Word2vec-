MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ We have been to Al Hambra several times since moving to North Scottsdale.  We go about every other month for our Indian food "fix".
Wait staff is always helpful navigating through the menu if you want to be adventurous or try something new.
We usually get the chicken curry dishes or the Tiki Masala (chicken) because they are consistently very good.
The sauces are very nice and creamy, wonderful to dip your naan bread in.
The chicken in the sauced dishes is always tender and one serving from the menu if you have rice, an order of raita and an order of naan is plenty for two people for a lunch or average meal.
The naan is alway served hot and has a nice pull texture to it.
I would recommend this restaurant to those readers who enjoy Indian food.
Also, be sure to let them know what spice level you want your food in case the wait staff forgets to ask.  We usually ask for a three to four there which presents itself as a nice kick to the sauce, but not overpowering so you don't enjoy all the wonderful spices and other ingredients while you have your meal.
Very nice ambiance, nice cloth tablecloths, and spacing of the tables.
Great place for a group of four to enjoy a nice conversation or for "date night".
Never had a problem there with loud groups or anyone which was disrupting the meal of others.
Enjoy!
