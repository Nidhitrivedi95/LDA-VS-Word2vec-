U-C7FKpKMdt9VOTXcmS4Hw Ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and Samosa Chaat. The Paneer Tikka Masala was creamy but a bit too spicy for me (not enough Paneer as well). The Garlic Naan was deliciously garlicky and toasted quite nicely. The worst was the Samosa Chaat, it was soggy and tasted odd...

Overall, probably would be coming back to Bay Leaf Cafe unless I'm REALLY craving Indian food and no other Indian places are open.
