45fMwU6aolShQ-B0mTwglg I visited chutney swammy last week we ordered on weekend buffet and two dosas off the menu the 
cheese and garlic dosas was too salty and the complimenting sambar was just not up to par. In a South Indian restaurant sambar is key.
The pav bhaji dosa on the other hand was very good great flavour dosa was nice and crispy.
They only had one server up in the front which lead to poor service times the server was prompt and worked hard just could not help everyone in a timely manner.
P.S we got the masala tea at the end of the meal and it tasted amazing.
