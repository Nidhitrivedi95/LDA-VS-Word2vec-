9N7VAcNFqjHptX3vRWqgnw One of the best indian restaurants i have tried in toronto. I always get my butter chicken and chicken tikka masala to go. The vibe in the restaurant is really dull and quite but the food is exceptional. They have delivery too but i think its just a certain distance. But definitely would recommend if youre a indian food fan.
