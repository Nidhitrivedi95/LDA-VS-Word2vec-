S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Alright, this is another place that you have to know how to do right.  I have been here for lunch and dinner, and lunch is totally the way to go.  They have a really tasty Indian buffet with lots of options.  I am not sure which ones are gluten-free, so the next time I go back to Vegas, I'll have more to report.

The service is alright.  I usually go thirsty for water.  Remember, your lassi is not included in the buffet price.  They do have large bus tours of people who come here en masse, so rub your rabbit's foot to make sure you don't show up at the same time.  Dinner is table service, which isn't the most awesome, and provides less value than the buffet.

Great vegetarian selections.  (Again, will update this again with GF facts.)  The best value for Indian food in Vegas.
