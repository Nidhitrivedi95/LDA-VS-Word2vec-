B3ucstFotOHce9VhSs9dog This place continues to impress me. It is a must stop when I visit Montreal, and I swear the food and service gets better every single time. I had the pleasure of bringing my boyfriend here this trip. We had the onion bajhi, chicken tikka masala, Sag with onions, and eggplant. We also had traditional naan and basmati rice. Please do yourself a favor and eat here when you are in Montreal. You will not be disappointed.
