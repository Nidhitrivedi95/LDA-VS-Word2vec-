-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g I am sorry that I can't review the food because I went to Mint after hearing they were under new management and could not get waited on.  I arrived and after getting a menu, I did not exist.  They were busy and I was patient.  Three people came in after me.  The 3rd one after I had been waiting 15 minutes. They finally waited on the the 3 people who came in AFTER me and still did not even acknowledge that I was even there.  I will not return and will tell the large Indian population at work about the non-existent service at Mint.  Note to Mint staff:  All you had to do was to say "I'll be right with you" or something..Anything.   But to keep walking by a customer and not say anything is not excusable.
