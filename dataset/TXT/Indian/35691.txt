N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg Not so good, if you are from India, you need to think twice about trying this place. Not trying to bash this place but it all seems pretty premise with the most. Basic flavors, let alone the "authentic Indian". Only good thing is they are open 24/7 however the quality lacks a lot of good indian flavors and spiciness that is a basic requirement with our somewhat traditional food. Service is not nearly up to par. Not looking forward to come back.. Good luck if you went to give this place any business specially its nearly $15 per person and I came with a party of 7. And none of us seemed to enjoy our food.. that's six different plates.. money not well spent unfortunately
