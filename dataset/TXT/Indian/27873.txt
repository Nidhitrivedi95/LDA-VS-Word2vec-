IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Tasty Kabob is a must see on any Hookah bar tour. They serve food, coffee and alcoholic beverages for those of age. In addition, the Hookahs are top notch. Now on to the food! Ever had Saffron Rice or Chargrilled Steak, Chicken or Pork? Try any of the Kabob platters, very good!  Also they have the best Persian Ice Cream which is only one flavor....what is the flavor??....(its a secret, you will have to go there and find out!) Prices are moderate for a dinner for two, atmosphere is casual enough to be a great first date place (attention cheesy guys) and they are rarely busy so cosy dates can become sweet and innocent. 
For persian cuisine in the East Valley this place is a must.
