9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g My husband and I have eaten at Amber three times, each time with friends or family. Everyone loved it each time. As we walked in the door, the fragrance of fresh spices aroused our appetites and delighted our senses. The service was prompt and solicitous. The waiters explained the menu and allowed plenty of time to look over the extensive offerings and make a decision. Rather than the usual stars or peppers icons to indicate heat, the waiters use a zero-to-ten scale, which allows much more fine tuning, and the chef is very skilled at creating the dish with just the right amount of heat. The menu includes a greater variety of dishes than we have seen in other Indian restaurants, from various regions of India, Indonesia-China, and Goa. There is a long list of types of naan. Papadam, a crisp cracker-like, spiced bread, is brought to the table with the usual three chutneys- tamarind, tomato and onion, and cilantro-mint- all delicious. We usually do not order appetizers, but have had three at Amber. I could make a meal of the samosa chat- a thrill to taste! And the dosa 65 (?) was also delicious. The third was a tandoori paneer and came with grilled vegetables and a tikka masala- like sauce that was wonderful. So don't pass up the appetizers. The main dishes are superb also. The waiters are very attentive, but not intrusive, and are good about bringing take-home boxes when you request them. At the end of the meal, they each time have brought us a small helping of dessert, different each visit and all terrific. We did not order dessert and were not charged for it. The finale is steaming hot wet washcloths to wipe your fingers, very soothing. We did also try the chai, which was as excellent as everything else and not over sweetened, as it can be. If you like Indian food, you will love Amber. It's our favorite in Madison and maybe the best Indian food I have ever had anywhere.
