9EsW_emJj-4IW2Y48Jmb-A I do enjoy Guru Lukshmi, but honestly, it's such a production to just be able to sit down and eat.  Even if you've made reservations, you still end up sitting at some vacant, former eatery next door in order to wait for a table.  Service is kind there, but then the owner - or whomever - smiles, looks at you, then looks at the door as soon as you've taken your last bite.  Needless to say, it's not an entirely pleasant experience.

In comes Yarl Dosa/Yarl Dosa Corner/Dosa Corner to the rescue!  I believe it's just called Yarl Dosa 'cause that's what their signage/menus say.

The atmosphere at Yarl Dosa is probably the direct opposite of Guru.  It's located along a strip of Kennedy S, in Brampton, where every other unit is some kinda South Indian or Caribbean eatery.  Due to the dim lighting, the place appears to be closed, but it's not.  No chandeliers to speak of.  And there are no crowds waiting for a table.  It was actually quite dead on a Wednesday evening.

Lucky for me, I ended up going with friends who are from Sri Lanka, so they were able to order stuff off the menu and explain to me what certain things were.  Menu are words only, some descriptions.

I ordered the Ghee Paper Masala Dosa which my friend requesting extra ghee for me.  Dunno why, but I think they thought that I'd like it.  It was a bit too greasy for me, not to the fault of the cooks, so I think I'd skip this next time.  Spicy potato was underneath the actual dosa.  Chutneys were lovely, especially the spicy one!

Other standouts include Daal Curry (usually I'm not a fan of daal), Mutton Chukka (off-menu), Paranthas (nice 'n flaky), dosas...sans the extra ghee, & freshly made Masala Tea (a bit too sugary as a regular order).  ;)

Next time you're in Brampton, do yourself a favour, and check this place out!
