UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Hands down, Mint Indian Bistro is the BEST Indian food in Vegas.  I'm originally from SF, I'm Indian, and have been searching for a good Indian restaurant in Vegas for years.  Mint has authentic, fresh, some organic, and most importantly, amazing flavors that give me the perfect curry fix, if i'm too lazy to cook myself ;)  The service and team there is also VERY nice and attentive...
