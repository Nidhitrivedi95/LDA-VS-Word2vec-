GYmdm_Vy7sf9tji7WUcohg Had a lovely buffet lunch but not a very good ending. I came out to find my car that is parked on the direct west side of the restaurant is blocked off by the actual owner of the lot (mechanic lot) who said the owner of the restaurant was not willing to put signs on his restaurant informing his customers not to park there and that is was actually his garage property. Very difficult to tell if  you are new to the restaurant. Instead you're supposed to only park to the rear of the restaurant which can only be accessed by the next adjacent street. Shame on the owner of the restaurant to not put a clear sign directly above the parking spaces. There is a smaller sign off to the said that says "park at rear". Nobody knew would think to look there.
