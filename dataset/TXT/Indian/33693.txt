lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw Last visit was a disaster but its important to improvise, improve and move on. Thats what sums up our experience at Bombay Street Food the second time. I and my were invited by the owners and it was really nice of them. We were surprised to see how our feedback was incorporated and everything was so much better and tasted so good. Be it chicken frankie, veg platter, vada pav or their so different sweet dish (a hyderabadi speciality), yes we tried it all. Thank you so much Amreen and Seema ,we shall remember your hospitality forever and will be back soon. Shivani and Rohan. A must try for everyone who is missing the Bombay ambiance.
