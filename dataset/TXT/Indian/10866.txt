A2aeHV_EsLIxEqRthPoujQ We did the pack to go over here. The food was average and so was the service. The restaurant was completely empty at the time we went which was over the weekend at dinner time. One could give it a try but if skipped one would not really miss out on much. With nothing in sight it's a place one could have a meal here.
