gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Dive into this incredible buffet 10 bucks. 5star   I love Indian, and they do it really great here, and you cannot beat the price.  Small place in the ghetto, sahara and valley view, not too ghetto, but still, its not pretty on this corner, but inside, you forget about it quick when you start salivating at the door, and running to the buffet like a wild animal ready to eat yourself silly.  Take a breath, its ok, this place will give you everything you need.   Every indian spice is in something, the quality and freshness is stellar!   Hightly recommended, just see the other reviews, dont take my word for it, try it and take you own word, its amazing!
