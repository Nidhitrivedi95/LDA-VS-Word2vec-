GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g First, the positives.  The food I had was very good.  Gobi Manchurian, Dal Curry, and chapati.  There were many vegan options available, clearly marked with a * next to the item on the menu.

There's next to no decor here, and no ambiance to speak of.  And I thought the food was overpriced, especially for lunch.  But the Styrofoam and plastic ware really turned me off.  They go straight to the landfill after one use, no attempt to recycle here...  Reusable cups, plates, and silverware would be a much better choice.

I am in no hurry to head back.
