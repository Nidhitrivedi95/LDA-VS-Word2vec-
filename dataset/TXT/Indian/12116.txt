auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ My mom is British, so I grew up on Indian food (Brits love Indian like we Americans  love Mexican). I've tried dozens of restaurants and even tried to make it at home a few times ... this is one of the best Indian places I've ever been to  -and it's certainly the best in Las Vegas/Henderson. 

The staff is attentive and polite, the food is good and spicy, and the Mango shake is delicious. That's all you need to know -- now go and try it!
