zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Went back on Friday and was disappointed to find they are  closed from 12:30-1:30 on Friday...lunch time  on Friday seems like a super strange time to be closed and I was unable to eat there due to the closure (and I drove out of my way to go there never thinking to call and make sure they would be open at a time that should be the busiest of the day).  I will go again, but I will call before heading out of my way to make sure they are open and I don't waste my time on the drive.
