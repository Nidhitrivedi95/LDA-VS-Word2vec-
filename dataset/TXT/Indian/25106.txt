This Indian restaurant is by far one of the very best in the city, and is my personal favourite. It recently moved from its Queen West location to Little India on Gerrard St. East. We used to go all the time at its old location and now we will continue to make the trip to the east end for the food. It is a welcomed addition to Little Indian which has previously been lacking really high quality food. We had the chicken tikkka masala ($11) and the paneer korma ($11) (not currently on the new menu, but ask for it and they will make it) and both dishes were by far the best we have ever had! You will not be disappointed with any dish you get here. 

The food is out of this world and it is insanely cheap! Check out the menu with prices here:

The service is fantastic. They are so kind, attentive and really nice people. 

Don't let the décor sway you. They have not made any changes yet from the previous restaurant's interior (Skylark) and even the lettering of their name outside resembles the old sign (they told us a new one is currently in the works) but it is NOTHING like Skylark. The chef is completely different, the food is incomparable, it's just physically, the restaurant still looks the same.
