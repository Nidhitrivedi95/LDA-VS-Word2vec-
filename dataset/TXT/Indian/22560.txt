gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg I absolutely love and adore this place! This is the place that got me to find a newborn love for Indian food and culture. The owner is really nice and I feel like every one that works there together is family, they have extremely sweet customer service. I appreciate how they are so welcoming and receptive to people who have never had Indian food and come there to try it for the first time! Every time a newcomer comes by they are always so sweet about telling them what is the best and how to eat the dish correctly. 

I go here often, It can be kind of pricy but it's all worth it with the amount of food you get. I recommend this place to every one and go there as often as I can. Beware of spice if you are not one for spicy food, but that's a given for all Indian food.
