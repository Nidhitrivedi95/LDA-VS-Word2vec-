Food is always fresh, service is top notch, naan is made fresh to order with your choice of garlic or regular and the buffet price is great at 8.99! They have good options for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. We have been coming here for the buffet at least once a month since we first discovered India Palace a few years ago.
