J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Just tried the buffet and came our pretty satisfied. I'm no expert on Indian cuisine so a buffet style meal is just the perfect choice to be able to sample the different flavours the cuisine has to offer. Especially for someone as clueless as I am.

chicken curry, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, shrimp curry, deep fried breaded fish, salads, dessert, etc. etc.. they have everything covered. While I wasn't particularly amazed at any dish, I wasn't disappointed either. It was a better than expected dining experience for only 11.99. 

*service was quite excellent
