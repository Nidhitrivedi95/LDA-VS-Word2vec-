P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag All India has a solid lunch buffet and I was happy to find that they also do dinner buffet. They have a very large selection of items and it's pretty good for vegetarians too. I prefer All India to Tamarind for  buffet because of the larger selection and bigger space - it's always easy to get a table. I have also gotten takeout quite a few times - chicken saag and chicken tikka masala are pretty good. The biryani was okay, but I've had better.
