UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw After waiting to try is place for months, I went here with my family for my parent's anniversary. Safe to say I will NOT be going here again. We walked in and the staff was nice in seating us quickly (there were very few people in the restaurant). We ordered gobi manchurian and papdi chaat which were good but the plain dosa was cold by the time it came to our table. We kindly let the server know that the plain dosa was cold, but we ordered a masala dosa too so just to make sure that is not cold. Instead of apologizing or even just saying that it won't be cold, the server went on to say that they don't pre make their food and that once it is made, we bring it out (never once had we indicated anything of that sort). We ignored that and said that's fine and went ahead and didn't cancel our order for the dosa. Of course that dosa was cold too. The whole time at dinner, not once was our water refilled, and so when towards the end of the dinner, once we were done, I asked the guy serving water to refill them. He comes back with the water and tells me how I should have called him to refill it because the place is getting so busy and it slipped his mind (for one thing, I did call him and second, not once did I mention that he lacked in doing what he was supposed to, I simply just asked if he could please refill it). When he did come back with water, he was serving it and my mom who was done with dinner did not want water and simply said, no it's fine, I am good, to which he replied saying, "TAKE IT, THE WATER IS FREE" I didn't say anything then to try to not be rude, but to that man, learn to respect your elders and paying customers. If you need a couple pointers, I can come give them to you, FOR FREE. 
They have definitely lost my business and I will make sure to let our other friends and family in this area know as well. They need to learn what customer service is.
