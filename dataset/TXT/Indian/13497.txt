biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg Pros:
+ Good flavor all around. The Butter chicken...

Cons:
- Not spicy enough for full legit-ness

Would I come back: Yes

Had lunch with coworkers here. They have solid curry offerings and a variety of chicken, plus good deserts. All pretty good. Only thing is that they don't offer any truly spicy dishes at the level of what indian people would actually eat normally. Not surprising given the location I suppose, but I was hoping to have that option. Still, a good place.
