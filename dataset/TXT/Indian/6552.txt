Make no mistake, this is a South Indian restaurant through and through. They can say "North Indian" dishes on the menu but it tastes like South Indians cooking North Indian food. Sambar is in nearly everything and it tastes sour which can tell you where the chef is from. The place was hot and muggy inside. The place had an odor and it just felt really dirty in there. I won't be coming back
