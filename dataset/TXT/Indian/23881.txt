gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Just ate here for the first time a few days ago... big portions.  My son is 15 & ate 1/2 of the large portion of rice for both of our chicken tikka masala & ate his entire portion of the chicken & sauce along with 1/2 of mine!  This is a favorite meal & we just got mild.  I love spicy but figured I'd start with mild, my nose was still running but I definitely could have gotten spicy  also very warm & cozy atmosphere! Amazing service too!  We will be back
