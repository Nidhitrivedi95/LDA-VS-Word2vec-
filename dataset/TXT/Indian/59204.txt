yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug The WORST BUFFET ever , we walked in at 2:35 pm and they pick up their buffet at 3pm, the food was almost done and they didn't bother to refill any of the food, the rice was hard felt like left overs from last night. Curries were tasteless, low budget menu, boiled egg curry,cabbage , the appetisers were finished, over all not worth $12.95 . Rather eat mac Donald's for $10 !! Never go again , this is not what Indian food tastes like.
