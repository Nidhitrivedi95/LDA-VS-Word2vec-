8vzMRsSIjkdjwq3u190ohw If you work downtown, if you're vegan, or if you just are craving a quick indian meal on your lunch hour, this is the place.  It's cheap.  It's fast.  And the food isn't anything to laugh about.  It's not as spicy as I would prefer but I love the price and the ease of being able to stroll in and stroll out in under 10 min.  The owner has always offered advice on what to try if you're new to the whole idea.  This is a downtown staple and a favorite of many downtown workers.
