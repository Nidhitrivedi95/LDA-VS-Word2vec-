KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I was born and raised in India (Indian from India i know Indian food), so trust me when I give it 1 star. 
Of course, I was exited to try this place as I just moved to the valley of the sun from San Francisco. I was highly disappointed with everything we ordered : Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Chilly, Garlic naan and Daal (you cannot mess-up Daal, its like messing up Mac and Cheese).
Both chicken dishes tasted exactly the same (which is not correct). Naan was cold (another red flag). Finally the Daal I know most of you don`t order this dish in Indian restaurants as I mentioned it will be like ordering Mac and cheese in an American restaurant. I always try Daal at a new Indian restaurant as this gives me a good idea of how good the food is. It`s a simple vegetarian dish made with Lentils. There are many interpretetion for this dish so very restaurant will have a different take on it.
I really wanted this restaurant to be good after all the reviews, but it will be a challenge for me to try this place again.
