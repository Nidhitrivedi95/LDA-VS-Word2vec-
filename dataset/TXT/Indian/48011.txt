TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I am from Atlanta which is filled with Indian restaurants, but I never go and eat there as they suck.
I visit Vegas very often. And I try to eat at this place at least once when I am there.
Everything they make is just too good...I love their samosas/ kabobs/naans..rather everything. They make everything just the way you want it to be.
Yummy!!!!!
