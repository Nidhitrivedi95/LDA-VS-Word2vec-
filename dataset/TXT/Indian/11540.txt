ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ It's not a fancy looking place but if you are looking for good Indian food you will find it here . Great dosa, yummy chutney , sambar like home , even the Biriyani is much better than anything you will find in any Indian restaurant in North America. 
I was very surprised to find such well prepared Indian food in a restaurant with such simple decor . 
Our server was also very nice and respectful, which is also not common in Indian restaurants. 

What a nice experience
