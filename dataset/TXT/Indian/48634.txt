tqJGBUKMNoUNX6FvHOHQGg I don't know if the servers here are scared of the customers or not, but they definitely don't make any eye contacts with you and don't come to you unless you stand up and wave at them. I stood at the front of the main desk, hoping one of the 3 servers who are walking by me will show me to my table...but maybe I was wearing Harry's Invisible Cloak because 3 mins went by and no one acknowledged me. I had to walk over and wave at one of them to show me a table to sit. Menu didn't arrive at the table, my husband had to get it from the front. I had to wave at a server to come and take out order. All this time, restaurant is not busy. Food is oily but that's just almost all brown food in GTA. Service is terrible!!!!! Will not come back here again. This is where Pak Centre and I part ways!
