My colleague at my office had mentioned a couple of times about this restaraunt. I finally got a chance to go there today for a lunch buffet. The food was fantastic. The chicken briyani, goat curry and the chicken masala were top notch. The "Idly Sambar", a specific variety of sambar made just for Idly and Dosas was phenomenal. The owner later told us that she is planning to have few more special items coming which includes "Appam" which is one of my favs. 

Can't wait to go back for dinner!
