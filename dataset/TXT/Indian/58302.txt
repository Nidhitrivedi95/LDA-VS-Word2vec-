Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g After moving from New York, I was pretty disappointed with Toronto's delivery options; then I found Rashnaa and things improved. It's a dependable choice for "lazy" nights. Most of the entrees travel well, which is good because Rashnaa is rarely quick (I'm near the Skydome and it takes 45-60 minutes). My favorite entrees are the mutton curry and butter chicken. The appetizers are less reliable, probably because most of them are fried. Sometimes the beef pancake is OK. Can't speak about the dine-in experience, but it's a keeper for delivery.
