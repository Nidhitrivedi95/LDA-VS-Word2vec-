GRIRHR35knxFo0qySwIysw This place is unreal.  My wife and I go two or three times a week. If there's an indian restaurant in town with cheaper, more flavourful food, I've yet to find it.

We usually take the Thali, and we're consistently impressed with the quality of the vegetarian curries that go in it. On top of this, their naan is usually made fresh to order, and, well, you can't beat fresh naan!

Go. Just go. It'll be the best decision you made all day.
