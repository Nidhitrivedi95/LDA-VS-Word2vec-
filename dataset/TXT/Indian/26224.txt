IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA Amazing food and service! My girlfriend and I come here almost every week to have dinner. We always get lamb samosas, garlic naan (yum), lamb tiki masala and side order of basmati rice. This place serves the best lamb, it's so juicy and flavorful. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who has a serious craving for Indian food
