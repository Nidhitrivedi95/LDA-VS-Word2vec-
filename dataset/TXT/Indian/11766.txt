aPnAEP8WzjJkxyAJ59GS8Q I wanted to love this place so badly. I love Indian food and it would be nice to have a good Indian place downtown rather than having to drive out each time I'm craving it. 

I went in around 5pm and was immediately greeted by an Indian gentleman, he was so kind and explained the menu to me and what my options are. There are many items to choose from and their popular combo is any three items on the menu over basmati or brown rice for just $6.75-- what a deal! 

I went with two popular Indian dishes; butter chicken, and tikka masala. The portions are very generous. I've had these dishes many times over the past few years and consider my palate to be expert when it comes to Indian flavors. Unfortunately, the flavors did not deliver. If someone else ordered for me and asked me to guess what I'm eating, it would be impossible as the flavors are way off. I couldn't eat more than a few bites. It's bland but one great thing is that the chicken is cooked thoroughly, it's still tender and I love that. 

Customer service is great and prices are very good. I'll keep hunting downtown for Indian food...
