gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Had the buffet and it was among the best indian buffets I've ever had (and I try to test them all out)  

The service was a bit strained, because there was only one person doing everything.  Being a buffet, that didn't really matter too much, but a little more attentiveness would have been nice.

I saw a review about it being too cold, but when we went, it was super hot and humid in the restaurant... so much that we wanted to hurry and get out.  If it is like that every time, it will definitely put me off of going in the future

Edit:  I've been back for the buffet probably 7-10 times since this initial review and things have been great ever since.  I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  I loooove this place!
