-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Came here with coworkers and left unsatisfied.  Each dish we ordered which include daal tardka, chicken tandoori, bagun Bharat, butter chicken was more disappointing than the next. 
Addironally, I asked for ketchup for my pakora, he laughed and walked away. 
Would give 0 stars if possible. Service was also sub-par.
