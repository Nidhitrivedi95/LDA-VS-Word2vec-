LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw I drove around Charlotte for two hours exploring and when I decided to eat I found myself searching through Yelp for the best local restaurant in town.  Almost everything I searched was pointing me to Uptown, going against my instinct I found this little restaurant at the bottom of the review page.  I decided to give it a go.  

I am all about Indian food and was willing to try any place, including this one that is located in a shady looking shopping center.  I was surprised, as soon as I walked in I was greeted by every employee and seated.  I went with chicken buryani, chicken tikka, saag paneer, and chicken curry, with a large helping of bread.

I was impressed, I was glad I had chosen a buffet and knew I would be helping myself to seconds.  The service was great, even though they were busy, I never had an empty glass in front of me.  The price was exrtremely reasonable and the quality of food was top notch; its a shame I don't live in Charlotte, otherwise I'd be a regular.
