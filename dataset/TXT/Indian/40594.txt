prFx0Kg92PfPkoU8OY4KxA This is my favorite Indian restaurant in AZ! The food is amazing. I get the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan at every Indian restaurant I go to... I have to say that Nirvana tops all of them. Not only is the food delicious, but the staff is amazing and quick. That's a big deal for me when I go to restaurant... the customer service has to be exceptional and Nirvana definitely accomplishes this! :)
