112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA I was pleasantly surprised with this place! It's always empty when I walk or drive by.. But that's because it's mostly carry out.
Do I like Indian food? I had no idea until I tried it that I do! I had the rice chicken bowl.. It has an Indian name but I forget it.. It was really good! 
The decor of the place made me laugh.. It's very random. But the service was fast and friendly and I was home with my Indian rice bowl in no time!
