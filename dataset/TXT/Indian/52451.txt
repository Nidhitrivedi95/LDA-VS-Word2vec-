UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg I had heard good things about Situl.  We usually go to Maharani but we thought we'd venture out.  My first inkling that things to come were not going to be wonderful were the poppadoms .  They were greasy.  & I don't just mean slightly oily, I mean there were pools of oil on them.  I didn't know poppadoms could be greasy!  The food lacked undertones which are one of the enjoyments of Indian food.  It was spicy but that was it.  There was no real flavour behind it.  It was oily & one dimensional.  We were the only people in there at 7pm on a Saturday night which also usually says something about a a restaurant.  Go to Maharani instead.
