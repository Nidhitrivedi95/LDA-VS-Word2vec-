jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw We have only eaten using delivery service during my wife's pregnancy and the food is amazingly consistent and always fresh. Fantastic favorites are Tikki Masala of course and Veggie Samosas. Lamb Gyros and Veggie Burgers are tasty treats as well. Highly recommended and we have never seen the joint!
