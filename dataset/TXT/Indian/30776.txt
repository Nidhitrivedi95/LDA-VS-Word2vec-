KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ We've tried this place a couple times. The food was excellent and copious.  The wait staff is friendly and very helpful.  I  have not had  a lot of experience with India cuisine, and the young lady helped me choose the most yummy dishes.  I don't know if they are busy at other times, but we hardly saw anyone in the both times,  or when we drive by. With food this good, I don't get why the restaurant is not packed. After reading the reviews, we still need to try the buffet.
