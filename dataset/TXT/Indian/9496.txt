8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Sitara has the standard north-Indian cuisine which is toned down a little to suit the american palate without loosing the flavor!

Ambiance is of a closed dance-bar or a gastro-pub. There is a huge bar which seems out of place. The bathroom area is best to be avoided before ordering your food. Overall service is less than good. Wait staff is running around doing a lot of things and don't have time to tend to your needs, so if you need something ask anyone!! We had two vegetarian entrees with rice and naan and some raita. Everything was freshly made without frozen curry. Taste was very good and overall I enjoyed the meal. Portion sizes are good for two people to share but only one dish between two might be too little for main meal. I was able to get a lunch out of left overs the next day. 

This restaurant has potential to provide better experience but as long as food is good, I will still come back again.
