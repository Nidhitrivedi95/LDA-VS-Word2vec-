uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA Atmosphere had a few contradictions that are eerily common at Indian restaurants in the Phoenix area - at first the place seems newer and nice with newer floor tile, paint, and better than average plates on the table... yet, the walls by some of the tables have unrepaired damage, the napkins are paper, and the restrooms are subpar.   The glasses looked incredibly dirty but upon closer inspection it was just an abundance of scuff marks from the dishwasher.  Nonetheless, why serve them when they look so bad?  Most I saw were like this.  Why?  When you know how easy it would be to touch up the paint and such, it makes me fearful of what goes on in the kitchen that we can't see to critique.  Well there is one thing I could see in the kitchen, as I found it odd the kitchen staff at the door was wearing a colorful tank top "beater" as he rolled some dough right by the door.  Seriously?

Restaurant was empty except for one table.  So guess where the server/host decides to try and seat us?  Yes, immediately next to the one other table that happens to be occupied.  After this we also encountered a language barrier when ordering and it was confirmed when the food arrived.  Somehow he was under the impression I wanted TWO of an item and given the context, it was absurd.

Food was average and took quite awhile, given how empty the restaurant is.  Prices are in line with others, neither high nor low.
