PiT0jyLL2Jwm2ODTDapOcg there seems to be two restaurants with this name, but the one I went to was not the one under the mosque but it's nearby (corner) since I heard this one has the original chef.  I had "chicken pulao with rice".  There was no chicken in it, but just this wonderful sauce over rice.  Even in a styrofoam bowl and eaten with a plastic spoon, it tasted really great, not to add that it was very reasonably priced at £2.50 (lots of rice drenched in sauce)-the 2nd time I had it with extra vegetable toppings (peas, carrots, and potatoes for an extra £1), it wasn't as good though. the chicken curry was even better! very tender chicken
