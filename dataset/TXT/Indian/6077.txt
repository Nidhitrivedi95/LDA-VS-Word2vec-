3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA The food is delicious. I went there with my family today and ordered the paneer chili and chili chicken as appetizers. What can i say the appetizers was absolutely amazing. Try ordering it at a level 6-7 spicy and it will burn your mouth. Loved the Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Jalfrezi. They also have a check-in deal for yelp for a free lassi or soda. Last but not least one of my favorites was Gajar Halwa, it was nice and warm, and absolutely amazing. The prices are reasonable and cheap compared to other Indian Restaraunts around vegas. Chicken dishes are at $14 versus other restaraunts that have them for $18. They also have huge buffet for only $9.99. The most selections for the lowest prices. Now thats what i called a indian Buffet. I would deffinetly come back here again.
