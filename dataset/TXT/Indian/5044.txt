2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Where do I start.. so I've been here about 6 to 7 times now within the last 4 years. Needless to say, each time I go, I find myself less and less impressed. The food is good, with the exception of the non-Indian portion of the menu. I'm not sure if they use different chefs for Hakka because it always turns out terrible, and the chicken quality sucks. The tandoori menu however never fails to oblige. Service is very slow especially on busy days.. we had to remind the waiter we were still waiting on various items atleast 3 times. Making reservations on a busy day? Forget it, they only take walk-ins. You'll be waiting atleast an hour before getting a table. Step it up Avani.
