CtE5hqCQ-HKHwxAKxKH0gg We ordered from here through UberEats. We ordered Naan - garlic and plain, tandoori chicken, aloo ghobi, aloo paratha, chicken briyani and eggplant Bharta. I absolutely LOVED everything however the chicken tandoori did not taste fresh. It was very dry and not very tasty. My favorite was the eggplant and the naan was absolutely perfect.
