OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg The Host was the first Indian restaurant I ever tried. I didn't know what I was ordering but it didn't seem to matter because everything was delicious. 

Favs are butter chicken,  samosa, eggplant, naan, vindaloo shrimp, lamb kabobs,  wafer thin warm cracker with cumin, curry beef

Chai tea is awesome. I didn't think it would like it but I was pleasantly surprised.  Amazing stuff.
