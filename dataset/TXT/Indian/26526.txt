ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg Copper is a solid Indian resturant.  The place is fairly small and seating is tight.  I agree with another reviewer who said it is a bit dark inside - it really is.  The staff are friendly and service is usually pretty good.  The Chicken Tikka Masala is very good and the naan is excellent.  The place is fairly expensive for what you get.

Overall a solid inidan restaurant.
