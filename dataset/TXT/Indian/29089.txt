jG46RAFm2kWshUIZ4HoJtg I was really craving some good Indian food for take-out. With my favourite place being about a twenty minutes drive from me, I decided to find something a little closer. I settled on Tadka Sizzles after looking at the menu options. I called them to try and place my order. No answer. Went straight to voice mail. I waited a few minutes and decided to try again. Again, it went to voicemail. They have an option of ordering online, so I try that and it takes me to a broken link as their website is currently under maintenance. I believe it's very poor business etiquette to not answer your business phone. Twice. In  a row.
