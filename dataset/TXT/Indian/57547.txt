ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ Classy place located at the Holiday Inn.

The chicken makhani and chicken tikka masala were EXELLENT.
I had both dishes at Tandoor 1 and 2,
but this place tops all.
Very well seasoned, thick rich and creamy with tasty herbs.
Meat was juicy and just right.

Rice was consistent in texture.

A gal in braids served us. She had a foreign accent and was very awkward by tring to be overly friendly.
but I'm sure she was just trying to be friendly to her patrons lol.
I think she was a n00b, but I realized this place opened not too long ago,
so she's likely still in training.

I asked her for a to go container for my makhani and masala,
and she came out with one of those sandwich containers.
Had to send her back to fetch a soup container bc the sauces will leak and make your car smell like Indian food for days!!

I would say I was impressed with the food.
Not quite San Jose level, but close :)

I would def go back again if I drop by hat side of town.

If it were closer to home and more affordable, I'd eat it EVERY DAY :D
