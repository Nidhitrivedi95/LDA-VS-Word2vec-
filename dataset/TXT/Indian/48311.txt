ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA We went here for dinner. The service was good. We ordered Tandoori Roti and Matar Paneer and it came with free rice serving. The panner tasted really good and fresh. The ambiance was great and so was the price. Great place. Highly recommended for people who love Indian cuisine.
