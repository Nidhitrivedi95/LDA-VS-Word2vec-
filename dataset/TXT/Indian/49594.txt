tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Went in not expecting a buffet, but after looking at the menu and then the items on the buffet table, we went ahead with the all you can eat. The food was delicious and had a nice home cooked taste to it. We left full and satisfied, but with all buffets I probably won't be back for awhile.
