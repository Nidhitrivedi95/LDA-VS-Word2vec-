A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA I returned to udupi palace yesterday with a girlfriend and had a much better experience. We're both gf and my friend has a zillion allergies. The server was happy to answer our questions and knew without hesitating which things were safe. 

We shared the idli (rice and bean patties) which were served with two yummy sauces. We then each had a dosa. Yelpers ain't lyin' - the dosa are fantastic! My friend had the paneer masala, which was served much like a wrap. I had the special rava masala dosa, which was delicious but puzzling. It was more crispy, and dotted with holes (like Swiss cheese), and in the middle of the dosa was this yummy pile of potato and onion. I'm not sure how I was supposed to eat it, but I enjoyed tearing off bits of the dosa and using them to scoop up the potatoes.

Definitely recommend.
