P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and had the buffet both times.  I have no regrets because this buffet is completely awesome.  

My experience here started when I walked in the door and smelled food.  Not just any food, though: delicious food with reasonable spiciness.  I walked further in and got a table, and the smell just got stronger.

Everything here is labeled as to whether it's vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free.  The entire salad bar area is gluten-free, the pakora and idli are gluten-free, the rices are gluten-free, and a bunch of the curries are too.  I don't know about the meat dishes because I'm vegetarian, and even if you eat meat you're likely to get caught up on all the delicious veg stuff before you even make it down to where the meat is.  So labeling is taken care of, and you probably know what you can and can't eat at this point.  

For me being allergic to part of the available offerings was probably to my advantage, because the food here is amazing and if there were more stuff I could have eaten I'd have been at risk for eating until I hurt or possibly making myself sick.  I regret that I had only one stomach to offer for each meal, but I'd like to think that I made the best use of it I could and tried everything I thought I could handle, all of which was delicious and well-made.  I was also delighted to find a few dishes I hadn't encountered before in my various travels - I'm pretty familiar with Indian food, I cook a lot of it at home, and I'd like to think I know my stuff decently.  So when I encounter a dish I'm not familiar with in an environment where I know it's safe to try it, that's pretty much the best thing ever.  

The food is delicious, service is good, the space is nice, and the biggest thing I am sad about is that I don't live in Pittsburgh so I can't go here very often.
