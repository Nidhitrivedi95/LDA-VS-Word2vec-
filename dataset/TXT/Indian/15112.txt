CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw We initially walked past this place because they had a front man trying to lure customers inside.
However we made a U-turn and we ended up coming here for dinner. 
This was a pretty tasty experience, better than most Indian restaurants I have been to in the United States. 

We all got the theater dinner special (no need to actually see a show to get this deal). 
The waiter seemed brusque in his menu suggestions, however in hindsight he wanted to ensure we had a nice spread of dishes. 

The chicken appetizer was quite smoky and flavorful, and more importantly the chicken was moist and tender.

The best entrée was the lamb vindaloo. It had a complex mix of flavors and spices, and there was just the right amount of heat. 
The garlic naan was actually pretty tasty as well. 

For dessert they brought us each a glass of Mango Lassi. 
30 bucks per person. 
I think this place is worth checking out if you're in the area.
