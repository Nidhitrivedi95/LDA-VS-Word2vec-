Dd1w7xR7Xs3bthwusgy33Q I eat at Lotus Deli a few times a week for lunch. Each time I go the staff is very helpful and considerate of my vegan lifestyle. They are knowledgeable and friendly. I always feel welcome. The food is amazing. I've tried a few different dishes and the flavors are so rich. I would recommend this place to anyone, not just vegans. If you are in the area, it's tucked inside the Lotus marketplace. Definitely a hidden gem that you want to check out for an affordable and delicious vegan lunch. I'll be back!
