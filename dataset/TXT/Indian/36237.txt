Gurkha Cafe was a nice breath of fresh air amongst the usual mess of Indian eateries. With a Nepalese/Indian blend of offerings, well-designed decor, impeccable service and gorgeous food, it's got something great going for it. The portion sizes were really generous and every single thing was delicious. This is definitely a keeper of a place on my Edinburgh restaurant list. Yum!
