fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw Fantastic food, questionable ambience: if it weren't so far away, I'd go all the time for dinner. 

One caveat: I've only been for dinner; most of the complaining reviews seem to be about the lunch buffet.

The plus is that the food is delicious. A few of my friends who generally refuse to eat Indian food will eat here. The Indians I know, who are really not pushovers when it comes to food, love it. I'd recommend the biryanis, and I really like the bhindi masala. Curries are also good.

The minuses are what you expect from a place like this, so they really don't count.  Look, you're not going to take Ban Ki Moon here or have your wedding reception here.

-Service is fine, but not amazing
