RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I have known and visited this establishment for several years. At first, I was in bliss. The chicken tikka and butter till naan was amazing (and still is). Eating in a essentially a temporary trailer was forgivable, since construction on their new place next door was under way.

Fast forward 5 years. The new place is still under construction. Primary seating is still in those trailers. And for what I'm paying, I think they can at least provide better plastic cutlery and Styrofoam plating than what they are currently providing. 

Having said all that, I still bring out of town friends to this place on occasion. The food is still great. But my love that I once had for this place has cooled off somewhat.
