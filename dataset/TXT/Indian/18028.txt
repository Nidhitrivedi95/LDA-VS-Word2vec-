ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ Closest Indian restaurant to me, and although it is on busy (at times) Penn Avenue, there always seems to be plenty of street parking. I have only done take out, but the atmosphere is pleasant and the staff very friendly.  Preparation time was very fast so there is not a long wait if you haven't called in an order. 
I was not exactly blown away by the chicken korma , my favorite dish and yardstick for Indian food, but the vegetarian version was very good. The nan is good, but the samosa was a bit over-cooked.
The clincher for me is that they are the only place I have been able to find mango mousse, one of my favorite deserts.  It is thick and flavorful, and not like mango-flavored whipped cream that I have had in other places (not in PGH). It is worth trying this place at least once just for the mousse!
