86d1M8MMrb94n5djgKWqEQ Really enjoy their chicken biryani, butter chicken and naan.  Portions arn't that big, but the taste is great.  My wife and I enjoy indian food at home, so we don't eat out at Indian restaurants since we find our home made food to be better, however in the Yonge and Sheppard area, this place makes great Indian food.  I would recommend to everyone, including those that eat indian food often at home!
