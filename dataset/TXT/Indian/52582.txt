If you want good Indian food go to little India (yes Toronto has such a thing, embedded in the gentrifying Leslieville).

If you want great Indian, go to Famous's buffet. 

Forget Siddharta's or any other uppity restaurant on the block. Famous has an unassuming dining space but you always walk in to a friendly reception and walk out wishing you'd put your spoon down a plate earlier than you did. 

Don't take my word for it. I surveyed the Indians in the area (yes- that's right- why not go to an authority on a subject) and most agree this hideaway has the best buffet on Gerrard street east. Furthermore it's available, lunch & dinner, at an AMAZING value (leave the plastic at home people, the loose change in the couch and car should cut it).

I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way for this buffet... I've had better Indian in DC, NYC, heck in Ottawa even... BUT if you're craving tandoori chicken on a whim, the 504 streetcar to Famous might be your best bet. And the kitchen guys are great. I've asked for a dish that's not on the daily special and been accommodated within buffet price tag!!!

I RECOMMEND: the naan. It's free with your buffet but comes straight and fresh to your table. Pff, who needs rice! 

EXTRA TIP: don't let the waiters get carried away refilling your water glass. They are relentless! Oldest trick in the book, filling you up with liquids at an all-you-can-eat.
