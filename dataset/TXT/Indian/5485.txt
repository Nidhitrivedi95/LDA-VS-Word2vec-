3BJhHBe9xEKe8jaIDd8SWg The food here is excellent. I had the beef and chicken momma along with Tibetan tea. The momos come with a spicy sauce that pairs really well. I had never tried Tibetan tea before but loved it! It's milk tea but a bit salty. Very nice for a cold day! The service was great and the prices are very reasonable.
