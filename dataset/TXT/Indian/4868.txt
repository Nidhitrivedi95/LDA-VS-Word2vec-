2SaGdoBtccnmTXuIN89G4Q Arwen, Serhiy, Ana and I met up there for brunch yesterday. This was my first visit to Les Casseroles and local community leader and owner did not disappoint in the least - heaping portions of tasty eats. Quebec traditional diner fare meets East Indian influence: eggs and toast or dim paratha or butter chicken poutine. It's all good and comes with a cup of splendid homemade-brewed black tea with cinnamon and cardamon undertones. Totally worth it.
