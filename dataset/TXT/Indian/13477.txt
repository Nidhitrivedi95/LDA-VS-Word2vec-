biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg Food: good
Service: pathetic 

We went with group of friends on saturday afternoon for lunch buffet. We were waiting for server to show up..but no one did..and finally we had to go and ask server (who was the owner) to come to our table. 

Most of items in buffet were empty and it was after very long wait (over 20 min) that they refilled it. 

One of my friend's kid crashed against the owner who was carrying drinks. The lady almost screened at our table and was rude. She came by yelling to take care of kid. Seriously !!!  
(i understand my friend should have been more attentive with the kid but that doesnt qualify for being rude to customer)
