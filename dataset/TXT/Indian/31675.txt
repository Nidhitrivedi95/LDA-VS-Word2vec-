KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Ok so When I go to Toronto for work this is one one of the must go places on my list every visit! I had 2 very very picky eaters with me and they couldn't stop raving about the place. The time I went was always as good as the first time. 

I am not sure if they are the owners but there are always these 2 semi elderly people there and they are so nice! I am a veggie and I can always find something wonderful there to eat. 

The portions are always good....I wish I could take home the leftovers but alas I am always ina hotel....The prices are very fair and the atmosphere is good as well. 


Go for a stroll if you are in the Mississauga area :) and have yourself a plate or 2 of YUM
