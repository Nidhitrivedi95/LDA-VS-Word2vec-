4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Excellent decor and  variety  but  food is tasteless!
Decor, price and  ambiance is  great , however the  Indian  food is  know  for its  flavors  which are  completely missing . what a waste  of  such a great  location and  concept .
 They desperately need a change of head  chef !
