KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw Wow!!! Finally a fantastic, inventive and reasonably priced place in the GTA. We came here a couple weeks ago on a Friday night. The staff was great, the food came in a timely manner and the atmosphere is very laid back. I got the dosa burger and paneer fries. Holy smokes, I was honestly blown away. The fries were quite possibly my fav fries I have ever had and I am all about trying new French fry concoctions. The dosa burger, mixing two things I love dearly: dosa and burgers, what more could a girl ask for? Watch out it is a messy one though ! My boyfriend got some kind of grilled cheese with bacon and jalapeños, I was too busy inhaling my food to ask him what his was called lol. I am so excited to come back here and bring my friends. A+ Rick!
