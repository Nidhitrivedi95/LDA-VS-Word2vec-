J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I always order Saag Chicken, Lamb Rogan Josh, vegetable Jalfrezi and Zeera rice. You can't go wrong with those imo. As long as you filter out a bit of oil from Rogan Josh, they become pretty healthy I think. Big fan of Indian cuisines that are healthy with little to no cream. No butter chicken etc. Wish the portions are a bit large though because it has drastically decreased over time. Their website delivery system is a bit wonky so I just tend to go for a pickup order (10% discount).
