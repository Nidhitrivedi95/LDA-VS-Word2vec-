79mXPrgfaOuCSINOpekWAQ I am rating 2.5 stars but rounding off to 3. We came across new Indian grocery store in Chandler and we had to give it a try considering the number of options available in the valley. 

The place is pretty organized and arranged well, it is clean and tidy. They also have a small restaurant as a part of the store.

We found some fresh pulses which is not easily available. One can find authentic gongura leaves (Roselle/ Hibiscus cannabinus) , thotakura leaves (Malabar Spinach) and other Indian veggies too. We also ordered samosa chat and punugulu. The service was very slow and we had to wait for half an hour get our order. The taste was average and wouldn't suggest for the wait time. 

Overall I am removing two and half stars for the restaurant wait time and the taste of the food. Mainly the cost of the groceries, the scarcity is understandable but hiking the price doesn't help either. Also, comparing other Indian grocery market in the valley the price is a little more on the higher side.
