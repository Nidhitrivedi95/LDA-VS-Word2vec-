PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g I'm a big fan of Kamasutra. We've been here on a couple of occasions and have always had a fantastic experience. The food is delicious, and its reasonably priced.
My bf is gluten/wheat intolerant so we are always looking fo places where there are gluten free options. On our first visit we asked the server what were our choices for a gluten free meal. He was very knowledgeable. He told us exactly what every item was made with and what was gluten free. I was impressed. Most of the time when I ask a server about their gluten free options they look at me all wide eyed and confused, clearly not knowing what I mean.

So we got an apetizer and I got butter chicken (my fave) and he got Chicken Byriani. The butter chicken was not the best I've had, but it was still delicious. The Byriani was superb. I also really love the warm naan with garlic and butter that they bring out while you wait for your food.

On our second visit we got the dinner for 2 which includes two meat or seafood dishes, one veg, the chef's appetizer platter, rice and naan.  We got the same server as the last time we were there, which was great :) This time we decided to try something new, so we had the chicken vindaloo, curry chana, and fish with some type of curry based sauce that I can't recall right now but was delicious.

All in all, the food was once again great, the service was fantastic (fast, attentive) and our server was super friendly and made little jokes with us and some small talk. Also, if you ask him what he recomends he will be more than willing to tell you and guide you. 
I love this place and I see it becoming my tried and true spot for when I want a nice and delicious Indian meal.
