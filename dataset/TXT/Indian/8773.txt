7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg First of all we have to take into account that they are still new and trying to get all their ducks in a row... with that said... The food was very good.  The servers still need to learn the menu though. My husband specifically asked if the goat curry was boneless and the server assured him that it was... It wasn't... But the flavor was still good.
But I got the Chicken Masala and it was excellent.  The other couple with us also enjoyed their meal.  The naan was also tasty.
The down side is that if you want a decent sized table for more than 2 people you better get a reservation because the seating is really limited.
And the one thing that both couples agreed on (especially the women) is that it can get super cold in there!  We had to sit in the front by the bar - and although the atmosphere is nice, we had to keep our coats on the whole time!  We heard other patrons complain also.  The main problem is that although they have a double door entryway, there is an open window between the two doors so the cold air just blasts in!  It is kinda hard to explain - just take my word for it : )
So anyway, the 3 stars is because the food is good - we are sure the servers will become more proficient - but the bad design for the doorway and the cold weather mean that we will probably not be back until springtime.
