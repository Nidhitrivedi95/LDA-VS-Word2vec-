mUk-0jToBuzk4KaDXp-uew I want to give this place a 5.. but i just CAN'T. There is nothing wrong with this place... and I can't even think of a concrete reason to not give it the best review... I have been here two times, once during dinner and once for the lunch buffet. 
-my opinion- 
Great service (at dinner) 
Great selection (lunch buffet) 
Very decent atmosphere 
Very Clean 
Good location (fills that need for Indian food in that area) 

But the problem is this... The food is just.... I mean it's good... just not quite... Great? what am i trying to say? I don't know. 
I think the food is a bit bland.
