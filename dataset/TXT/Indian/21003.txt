GC9Re0tKAnecMww3DB638g I am so glad this place exists! Go-To place when I'm craving Indian flavored ice-cream. Really loved the kesar pista, it's obviously creamy ice-cream but it has the perfect kulfi flavor. I really enjoyed the meetha paan flavor too, it's strong but awesome just what you expect out of a beetle leaf and fennel seeds. The rest were good too, sitaphal, malai kulfi, gulkand. Not tried the standard flavors or cupcakes. I'll give it a 5 just for the Indian flavored ice-cream it's that good.
