I am giving this restaurant 5 stars based on the lunch buffet and cleanliness. 

I come here often, about 5 times a month, with family or friends for the amazing selection at their lunch buffet. Friday through Sunday is my favorite time to come because the food is much spicier. Beware, this place is PACKED on those days. If you prefer it on the mild side then stick with the Monday - Thursday buffet or come during dinner hours when you can order it however you prefer. I have noticed that the people in my party are usually the only non-Indian people dining here, which is an excellent sign that the food is authentic. I've never been to India, so unfortunately I cannot say for certain. 

This restaurant is always very clean. The service can be hit or miss; sometimes we get fantastic service and other times not so much, but that may be due to a communication barrier that the food more than makes up for. 

Tips: 
Great place for vegetarians who like it spicy. (Yes, they do also serve meat.)
Be sure and try Rasam & Sambar soups, they are both delicious!
