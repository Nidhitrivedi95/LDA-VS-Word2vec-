RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg I don't know about the Green St. location, as I've never been there. I have, however, been to this location many, many, many times since it opened. There have been times when the food was superb. There have been times when it was "Meh." We have had great service and not-so-great service. Generally, however, the level of food quality was such that it was always worth the crapshoot. The roller coaster became part of the lore of this location.

That ended about six months ago. This location never bothered to renew its liquor license, they stopped investing in the decor which has, predictably, become progressively shabbier, it's always cold, and the food has taken what looks to be a permanent nosedive. The staff is...bizarre. There is one guy who is always there who can't be bothered to do his job. He literally forgets to come take your order. We know this because he says, "I forgot to come take your order."  Which would be barely acceptable if it was his first day. Not, say, the 5th or 6th time you've had him as a waiter. The other waiters are always new. There must be a revolving door.

We have finally come to the sad conclusion that this location is not worth it any longer.  This is a shame, because there was a period in there where we came in once a week, happy to have good Indian food in a non-campus atmosphere, in Champaign. There is better Indian food sold pre-packaged in the grocery store.
