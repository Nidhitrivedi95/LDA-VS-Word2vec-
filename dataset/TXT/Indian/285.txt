-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Excellent Indian food. EXCELLENT.

They have a ton of delicious stuff that I have never had/heard of, but expect tons of veggies, chicken, potatoes, and curry. 

The lunch buffet (yes, a GREAT Indian buffet), was under $10!!!!! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!

Seriously though, if you want some awesome Indian food here in Tempe, this is the place to go. 

Check it out.
