jb0-JZMt-6Khsh-VwsDtLQ I'm really happy I tried this place tonight. I'm not kidding, I drove around this area for 25 minutes trying to figure out what to eat because I've had everything around here so many times. I brought the paneer curry and aloo curry home. Excellent, fresh flavors. Both entrees were $6 or 7 dollars. I ordered one with bread and one with rice. Good food for reasonable price and it's a local family business... I'll be back.
