4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw I ordered some food for delivery tonight through Campusfoods. It was running late and I noticed the restaurant was about to close, so I called Tandoor. They assured me the order was on its way.

A few minutes later I called again and all I got was their answering machine. At this point in the night it was too late to order from anywhere else.

This is very sad because I order from them frequently. I know things go wrong with deliveries all the time, but I do have a problem with them telling me something that was not true.
