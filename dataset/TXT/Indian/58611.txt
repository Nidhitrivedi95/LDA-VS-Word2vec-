yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ The food was great, but not quite what I was expecting. Since the restaurant is a "kebab" house, I was expecting to find a döner kebab somewhere on the menu. Unfortunately there weren't any but the lamb kebab roll I ate was good enough. 

The naan bread was delicious, and so were the potato fries that came with it. The service was good, and I got my food pretty fast after I ordered. I liked that the food was easy to take home, but not so good as leftovers. 

Casablanca has a great location, and I will definitely be making a trip back.
