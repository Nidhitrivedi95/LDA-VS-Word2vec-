PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ A bit pricier than the usual Indian buffet but relatively tasty.  They have a lot of dishes to try but a lot of same chicken on a different sauce.  The butter chicken and naans are good as well as their desserts.  The paneer was a bit off and their tandoori chicken was cold.  Food is better than the service.  I would still come back but wish they would improve service like cleaning the finished dishes, bringing water and not making people wait for their checks for longer than 20mins. It happen to us and several other tables that prompted the ladies sitting next to us to pay at the terminal.
