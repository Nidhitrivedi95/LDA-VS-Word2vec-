RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg The food here was amazing!  We started with the paneer pakoras. They were really good.  Butter chicken spicy hot really hit the spot.  My friend has the lamb chop masala. The garlic naan was so good, had to place a 2nd order.  The food was 5 star, but the service was disappointing.  I'm not sure if the guy was in a bad mood, or mad because he had to be at work during the game (world series, game 7) or because we were first customer of the evening (had show tickets for later) but he just seemed annoyed we were there.  I was going to order a cocktail but as I picked up the menu, he advised he didn't have a bartender, so no cocktails...all righty, guess we'll stick with water.  Abt half way thru dinner, we got a new server and she did a great job.  I would come here again for the food, but I wonder how many customers the grumpy guy with bad attitude has chased away. Food was 5*, grumpy guy 1*, ultimate server was 5*.
