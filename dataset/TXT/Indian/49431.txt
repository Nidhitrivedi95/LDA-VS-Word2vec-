This is one of my favorite places to go for Indian cuisine. I have come to this establishment on my own several times, come with family a few times, and I have brought friends/co-workers on multiple occasions that several of them have become regular patrons on their own. The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and eager to assist with your eating experience. They come around each table several times refilling your water, asking if you'd like another beverage, and bringing fresh Nann to the table. Sometimes they also bring tandoori chicken if it is not on the buffet. They have vegetarian dishes, chicken dishes, and lamb dishes to choose from. All the dishes are marked and the vegetarian dishes are separated. They have assorted snacks, a salad, some chutneys, and dessert choices too. There is a mango lassi dispenser at the buffet area. Lunch buffet is under $15 if you get an ice tea or soda. Dinner buffet is under $20 with the same conditions. There is decor around the restaurant, but most of it is up on a ledge out of normal view. They have a very large plasma TV playing Bollywood movies, and Indian music in the background. The only criticizes I have are: the buffet area needs to be larger because it can get very cramped around there especially if you are trying to eat at a nearby table/booth. Another is using the restroom. You have to get past the small pub where all the waiters go to get the alcohol drinks, ring up checks, and people are getting their take out weighted and paid. You have to squeeze through this traffic, along with a cooler that holds the glasses.
