Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g I had the chili chicken here and it was awesome. Exactly what I expected from a good Hakka place. 

I put this place up with the premiere Hakka places in Mississauga. Good service and great food.

The only thing I would say is that it is in a less busy area that you need to drive to. But at least parking is either cheap or free!
