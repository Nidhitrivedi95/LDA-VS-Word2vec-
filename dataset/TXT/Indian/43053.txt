RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Went for dinner with a big group 
Started kind of slow and.we were ok with that
Service was very slow and the entres were not served together 
The food was fine though and the chef seemed to know his way around
Perhaps these are starting  challenges and we plan to go back after a month or so and see if the ratings needs to by increased
