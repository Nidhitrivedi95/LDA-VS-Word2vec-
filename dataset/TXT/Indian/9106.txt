82fdk8YOZ67hl_t66BydzA a friend took me to this place and i couldn't stop going.  definitely one of the best inidan resto in mtl.  

their naan is soo delicious and moist, yummy!! damn too bad SD doesn't have good indian resto.. i love their eggplant dish, out of this world.  not sure how they cook their eggplant but it comes out smokey.. perhaps they grill or roast it in the oven but it is one of my fave dish there.  

i used noticed that we're the only non-montrealers writing this review.. what happened to these montrealers?  

i can't wait to go back once i'm in town!!
