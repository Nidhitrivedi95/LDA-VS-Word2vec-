uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Never disappoints.  I have been going here for 15 years and my parents have been going for 35 years.  The food is always fresh and flavourful and I have not had a bad meal yet.  The Pakora is a great appetizer to share and we always get the butter chicken, tikka masala and sizzling chicken.  We have taken our out of town guests here and they also were very impressed.  Unless I move away, I will also visit for 35 years.
