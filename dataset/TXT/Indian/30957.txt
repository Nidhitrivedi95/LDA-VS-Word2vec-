kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w Food is simple and good here, Me and my Wife went for the first time today for lunch from office and liked the food.

No extra spices added, Food is all good as per the spice levels of an American Indian Standard. Great service and see people enjoying their visits, We do feel like going here again. 

Altogether this was better than the other Indian food places tasted earlier near Charlotte downtown area. 
Next time for Dinner soon.!
