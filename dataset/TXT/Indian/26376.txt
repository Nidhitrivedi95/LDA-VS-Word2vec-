My beau and I went to Copper on a Friday night to recreate our second date (from four years ago). We made a reservation for 7:30 and arrived right on time. We were seated promptly and then completely left alone for 8 minutes. I know, because I checked my watch. 

The dining room was busy, but not slammed, however there seemed to only be two waitstaff for the entire business on a weekend night. Seems ludicrous.

We ordered samosas, saag paneer, their lamb curry and garlic naan. The food came out in a timely manner and tasted really good. I had asked for no cilantro garnish, but there was a significant dusting of cilantro on everything we received. No biggie, I picked it off and stuffed myself full. 

Now that we are done with our food we waited nearly 15 minutes for a waitress to come around so that we could get our check and go.

I am not slamming the staff, as they were curteous and prompt when they were around, I am admonishing the management. It makes no sense to fill your restaurant to 90% capacity and have barebones staff. Copper is not an inexpensive establishment, and with the prices that are posted, diners expect to have not just tasty food, but a full food experience. That is simply not possible when you aren't properly staffed.
