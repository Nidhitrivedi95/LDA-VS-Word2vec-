Awful Service

We were seated relatively promptly but the problems began when it took 10 minutes for the waiter to come over to take our order (2 chais, chana saag, lamb rogan josh, and garlic naan).  Our chai arrived in 10 minutes--pretty tasty, enough for another helping.  After 20 minutes with no food, the waiter said the kitchen was backed up and that our food was coming out soon.  10 minutes later, a different person (maybe the manager?) came by just to ask if we had ordered yet.  When we said yes, he just nodded and walked off.

Soon thereafter, the bus boy came by to refill our water.  When I asked him if they had free refills on the chai (which is not an absurd question), he seemed surprised that I was asking him anything, and muttered that he could ask someone.  He seemed apathetic and annoyed, was dressed in street clothes, and had no accommodating atmosphere whatsoever. I wasn't expecting him to come back with an answer and he never did.

We were looking at other places to eat on our smartphones when the food arrived, 50 minutes after we sat down.  There were 2 other groups near us who also waited a similar length of time.  Both entrees were surprisingly good, served in the traditional bowls.  It was enough for a meal, but I was expecting more for the price, or at least some papadum or other accouterments.  The garlic naan was just naan and there was no oil or butter on it at all.

I asked the server about more chai (free refills?) and he said he would get us some because of the long wait.  I didn't expect him to return and he sure didn't.

You can read other Yelp reviews who had similar experiences.  I might try the buffet, but I will never come back to this place for regular service again.

After reading about some people's credit card receipts being edited, I will also be watching my next statement to make sure they didn't cheat me out of more money.
