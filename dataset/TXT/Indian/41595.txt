Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Ordered take out for dinner and it was delicious. My favourites were the crispy shrimp which was covered in a sweet and sour type sauce and the breaded honey garlic chicken. Both were generously portioned and covered in a large amount of sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the Manchurian paneer since I found the sauce to be lacking in flavour. I also have to add that the owner was extremely friendly and accommodating. Everything was so tasty that I returned the following weekend.
