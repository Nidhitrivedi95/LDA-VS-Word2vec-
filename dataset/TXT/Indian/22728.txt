GRIRHR35knxFo0qySwIysw Just got done having the delivery from Curry Mahal, and definitely felt the need to sing its praises immediately. First of all, cheers to the 45 minute delivery after being told it would probably be an hour. Also, the delivery man didn't wait at the front entrance, he came all the way to the apartment.

To the important things... The food was great. I lived in India for 3 months and this was some of the best Indian food I've had since I've been back. I love Chana masala and I thought this one was very good. Most of the other dishes were not necessarily my favorite I've ever had (for instance I know a place with better tikka masala in my opinion), but every dish was very good. I was a big fan of the rice, and I was glad they gave us a lot.

Finally I found all the prices to be VERY reasonable. Two good sized samosas for $3. Most of the dishes were less than $12. (It seemed especially cheap to me given I'm an American and the exchange rate is so good, but still.... I felt like it was a steal.)
