OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Got the classic chicken Marsala, Garlic Nan bread, Lamb Skewers (it didn't come on a stick, more like in a plastic shot glass and mint sauce). The food was awesome! Definitely 5 out of 5.

The reason I have it 2 out of 5 star is because of the service. We wait about 30 mins for our food. But the sad thing was, there were about 2 tables before us and they didn't get their food yet. I felt so bad for those people. I just don't understand why they couldn't bring Nan bread first, so we can have something to eat at least. We were able to see a guy in the kitchen just sitting there telling people what to do but he wasn't doing anything himself. I guess his the owner or manager?

And when we're ready to pay, the iPad actually died and we couldn't pay with our credit card. It was so bad that it was funny. All the workers seemed like they were running around with their heads cut off. We had to laugh it off.

I can tell there was so much confusion in the kitchen. I don't know who was the server, or who's the busser, or who's the manager even. I felt like I was in a live recording of kitchen nightmare, and Gordon Ramsay was going to pop out and yelling "Everyone just stop, stop the service right now!"

I hope they learn from this episode and get better in the future.

Maybe we will go back when we are the only people there.
