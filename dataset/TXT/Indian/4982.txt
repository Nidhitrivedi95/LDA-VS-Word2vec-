2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Second review;-
was here on Sunday.. saw major change in food taste and quality and the service...

it took almost 50 mon to get the order with 5 reminders... and by the time rhe food arrived I wasnt hungry anymore... the food tasted different... the servers were really good though... I wish the food tasted the same..

will not be visiting on weekends or will avoid as much as possible... coz the actual food tastes way better on weekdays..
