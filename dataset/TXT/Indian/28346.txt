J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Let me just start by saying that the name of this restaurant can be a little deceiving, because when my friend suggested we go to "Little India" for lunch I thought we were going to an Indian neighborhood, like Little Italy or China Town.  

The value is incredible!  $12.99 for an all you can eat buffet is a great deal - I definitely got my money's worth.  They have a nice selection which they replenish frequently.  My favorite part was the butter chicken, but who doesn't like butter chicken?  The only disappointment for me was they didn't have any Saag Paneer, another great Indian dish.
