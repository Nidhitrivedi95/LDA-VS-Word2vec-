Pz13Ru_-U4qoZiu89ezVmQ Super convenient location. Super lovely deco.
It is my first time trying Indian cuisine. And it was such an amazing experience.
Ordered garlic naan and butter chicken according to the staff's recommendation and they all turn out to be good choice.
The chicken itself is tender, but kind of dry. But the sauce is art. I will say it's clean and refresh. After you finish, only the fragrance of spice stay in your mouth, not the curry.
The garlic naan is also chewy enough.
I ordered butter naan later. And I really really love it. The outer layer is crispy, while the inner layer is chewy. You can smell the wonderful butter. 
For me, most restaurants are delicious, but nothing impressive. But this one is not only delicious, but "wow"!!
