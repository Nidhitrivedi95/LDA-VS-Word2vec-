The food was very tasty and I got to sample a whole bunch of different dishes.  If I remember correctly there were about 10-15 different dishes available in the buffet line.  The mango and coconut ice cream dessert topped things off for us.  All of this for $9.95.  A couple more bucks for 2 mango lassis that we had with the meal.  

Afterwards we promptly went home and passed out for a couple hours with food coma.
