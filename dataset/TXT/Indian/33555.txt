LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg OK, never heard of it until taken by friends.  Looks pretty good, friendly staff.  Food though takes it to the next level.  We had quite a few veggie and meat options.  Chicken lollipops, lamb chops, Railway lamb etc all went down well.  Tarka dal was superb as was the paneer and masala chips.  Food came reasonably quickly in tapas style dribs and drabs.  5 of us had a feast and it came to just over £70, obviously booze not included.  I will be returning.
