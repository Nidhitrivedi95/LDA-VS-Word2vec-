HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A The Saffron Patch is just like others have described; a little hard to locate, friendly staff, and average food. 

My GPS took me to an entrance right behind a gas station, you can follow this up around and down so that you can park in spaces by the first floor where the restaurant is located. Or you can park in a parking deck and just walk down some stairs once inside. The restaurant is clean and tidy, but not much in terms of decor. Restrooms are located outside the restaurant in the main hall area. 

We had a young man wait on us and I thought he was friendly and attentive, I never had to call him over for anything. And while he seemed a little nervous he was pleasant. 

For food I got the Chicken Tikka Masala with spice level 1. This was pretty bland compared to other places I have been to. Just because a dish does not have heat, does not mean that it should lack flavor as well. Portion size wise, I would say you could eat this all in one sitting, do not expect to have leftovers unless you got appetizers with your meal. My date got the Lamb Biyani with a spice level of 3. This was a much bigger portion and you could definitely tell it had a kick to it. A side of Garlic Naan was nothing special. 

Overall, It was okay, I probably would not go back, but that is because I live closer to India Garden and Namaste which I really enjoy.
