RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg We've only been there once for lunch but were extremely pleased and plan on returning soon. The tomato coconut soup of the day was excellent. I ordered Leek Kofta from the lunch menu entrees and my husband did Chicken Masala from the build your own. We were both very happy. Service was prompt and the server offered to explain anything. There was a small complimentary dessert which was a pleasant surprise. Authentic Indian food.
