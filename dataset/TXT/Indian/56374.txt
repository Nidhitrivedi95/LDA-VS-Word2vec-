XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw I love going here for their lunch specials! I always order the curry chicken which comes with rice, small salad and a beef deep fried dumpling! The owner is always so nice, polite and full of smiles, great atmosphere to enjoy food. I come here every now and then and it's always a good time!
