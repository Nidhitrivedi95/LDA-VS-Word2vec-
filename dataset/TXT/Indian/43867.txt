RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Mmmmm ... everything. 

LTH will never win awards for decor or for expedient renovations, but it certainly should hoist the bang-for-your-buck-Indian-Pakistani-experience championship belt in Little India, in my opinion. I'm also of the opinion that the wall decorations have nothing to do with the quality of food, so keep that in mind if you decide to read on. 

I visited LTH again last night will some friends from out of town and it was a hit once again. 5 people, 7 dishes, 5 naan, $72 pre-tip. Yeah, baby! 

I'm a big fan of almost everything on their menu, save for the butter chicken. It's way too oily for me, and I think it's missing that something I can't put my tongue on. The rest of the menu, however, is great. The palak paneer is flavourful with some zing, the chana masala has a great smoke and coriander burst, the lamb is fall-off-the-bone and the tandoori chicken was a little bit of heaven. 

I'm certainly not an Indian or Pakistani expert, but I've yet to leave LTH thinking that my money could be better spent in the area with a bunch of great friends. And you know what, I like the fact that the tables and chairs are fold up, so take that!
