OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Probably the worst biryani I ever had. My wife and I ordered a goat Parda biryani and himalayan chicken curry to go. The biryani was 70% basmati rice, 25% mixed veggies and had around 5% goat meat. The rice wasn't even mixed well with other ingredients. I actually showed this to the owner who said this is how they cook it and that it would taste great. I seriously felt like giving him an earful after eating, but unfortunately this was a to go order.
The himalayan chicken tasted like tomato water with floating chicken pieces. Please look at the pics if you think I'm overreacting.
I'll never set foot at this place again and I'd advice the same for others who like quality Indian food.
Other notable observations -
1) We went here at 1 pm on a Sunday and there was absolutely no one at that time! Should've taken the hint. The high rating on yelp is really puzzling to me.
2) Waiter has zero knowledge of Indian food and kept asking the owner for whatever questions I had.
3) The decor was pretty good which was the only decent thing. I'd give 4/5 for that.
