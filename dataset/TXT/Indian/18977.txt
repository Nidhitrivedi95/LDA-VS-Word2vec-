food was terrible to put it midly. 
biryani was stale and dry. the rice must have been on the heater since morning tasted bad and rice as bone dry and hard.
pakoda was a joke was not properly fried and tasted of batter.
jamoon tasted of oil after first bite. chicken tikka was sweet. the only eatable dish was naan and ginger chicken. they charged 11.5 for buffer wasnt worth even 2 dollars. please look else where for good food.
for good biryani try sabri nehri on devon in chicago
