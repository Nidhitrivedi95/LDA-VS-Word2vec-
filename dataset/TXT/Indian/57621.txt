yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Food was good but, spice level was not consistent with previous visits ( much spicier last night) Service was OK, but I felt we were being rushed, the wait staff told us at 9pm that the kitchen was closing and they seemed a bit too eager to take our plates away (I was still eating!)
Sadly the management's inability (reluctance?) to honor the remaining balance on our Dhaba gift card left a sour taste at the end of the evening. Their excuse was that their machine wasn't working although they were able confirm that we had a balance of $5.68, but told us we would need to come back some other time and use it. 
Hopefully it will be better in 2016.
