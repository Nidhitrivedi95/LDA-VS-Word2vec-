1S6eB9Ag2VMx3Ab7LHORJw the food is good. The manager is a little funny. We (a group of 4) went to an empty restaurant on a sunday afternoon, and the manager seats us on a slightly cramped 4 seater. we request him to move to any bigger in the entirely empty restaurant, and he refuses. On protesting, he becomes aggressive himself. Later, the manager seemed to be in a hurry to have us leave. brought the check even before we done eating. 

I am not going there again in a hurry.
