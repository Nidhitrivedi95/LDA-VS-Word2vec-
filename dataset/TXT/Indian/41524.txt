q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw Went to Kabob tonight for dinner and it was absolutely amazing! I'm super picky when it comes to indian food but this actually hit the spot. I told my server what level spice I wanted because i'm scared when it comes to choosing the levels of spiciness but the cook definitely got it right! We will definitely be back again soon!
