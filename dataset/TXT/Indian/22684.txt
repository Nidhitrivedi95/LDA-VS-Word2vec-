GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw I wanted to like this place, but the food is just too bland.

Pros:
-Very friendly service: Our waiter was very attentive, and a cute little girl (presumably the owner's daughter) even helped with our order.
-Cozy, relaxing atmosphere: It's in a semi-basement, but that's not a problem once you're inside.
-Good location.

Con:
-Bland food: With Indian and Thai being two of the most flavourful cuisines in the world, you'd think this place would be tasty. It wasn't. We ordered the Basil Tofu (on the recommendation of the waiter) and the Dhal Maharani. The place was almost empty, and the food still took a long time to make, which we didn't mind, but we were expecting it to be good. Unfortunately, both dishes were dull and flavourless. I'm sure it was made to order, but it didn't taste very fresh either. And the naan had the stiff texture and taste of store-bought naan.

With an improvement to the cooking, this could be a really great place.
