zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q The food is amazing! Hands-down! Which brings me much sadness to have to give them a one star review. I have tried to come here four times since my first experience and every single time they have closed at least 20 minutes prior to the closing time time posted in the door! I am currently sitting here right now staring at one of the employees standing inside the restaurant, it's 835 and they close at nine and the door is locked. Also they do not answer their phone so you can make that impossible to place a pick up order or to go. Great food but horrible at caring about their customers. Don't print hours if you don't intend to keep to them !!!!!
