daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ BEST INDIAN FOOD! Don't listen to the negative reviews! This place is AWESOME. The Chef, Cashier, and Waiter are the sweetest people. OMG!  The Chicken Tikka Masala is SO GOOD! I've been to authentic Indian restaurant's and use to live in Irvine, CA where a lot of Indian restaurant's claim to be the best but this place is THE BEST! It's nice, relaxing, clean, and the staff are so nice. I let the owner know it was our first time and he took his time to explain the different items. This is my new favorite place. I actually just came from there and it was so good that I had to come home and write a review! :) If you're on yelp looking for an Indian restaurant STOP LOOKING! believe me... I've done my research. This place is the BEST! I felt like I went to India and came back, no passport required. :)
