TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This my FAVORITE place to eat when I'm in Vegas! The food is beyond excellent and the spices and flavor are over the top! The chicken masala is to die for! Korma is amazing... Vindaloo was soooo good! I also enjoy the vegetarian plate where you can choose four different dishes to sample in smaller portions. The garlic naan and chile naan are so delicious. You would never expect this little hole is the wall could be so good but you will not be disappointed! Gary is our favorite waiter! He will take very good care of you! Don't miss this place!
