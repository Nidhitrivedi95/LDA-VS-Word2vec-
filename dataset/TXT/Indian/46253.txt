sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I think same guy owns Maurya's as this place due to the similarities. 

I am sucker for good Indian food. Can't say this place is authentic but it offers really good roti. My personal favourite is butter chicken roti. Biryani is also pretty decent. 

There are few short comings though - there is no consistency for the different level of hot offered. Sometime medium is hot and other times hot is not hot enough. 

Another issue I have is that they put in potatoes along with meat and I hate that. I specially ask them for no potatoes each time. May be it is to save cost of something but they need to check with customers whether they want potatoes or not.
