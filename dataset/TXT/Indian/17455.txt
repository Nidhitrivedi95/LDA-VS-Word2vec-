DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ The lunch buffet at Sangam is fantastic!  The food is wonderful.  There is a nice selection of veggie and chicken dishes and rice and mango pudding-- each dish with a wonderful, delightfully unique flavor.  I've eaten there many, many times and have never once been disappointed.  While it is a buffett, the service is still stellar.  An empty plate never lingers on table and the beverage glass is never empty.  The people are always very friendly yet very professional.  It is very reasonably priced too.  The atmosphere is a small and cozy.  It is tucked back off the road in Shops on the Green and every bit worth the little effort it takes to find it.
