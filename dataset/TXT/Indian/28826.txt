jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Honestly I don't understand all the glowing reviews. It's an Indian restaurant  in the airport district with an unappealing second floor entry, sitting alongside hookah up bars and low end restaurants. That was a warning sign but I thought Vegas reviewers know their secret places. Not the case. 

As far as the food goes, you could do much better in a run-of-the-mill Indian buffet restaurant than this place. I was there for dinner, and prices for basic vegetarian entrées run well over what I would pay in high-end places in DC metro area.  The samosa chickpeas had cheap oil fried samosas and canned chickpeas with powdered spice.  The naan disappointed with its low end flour.  The potato cumin had burnt cumin seeds taste. The dal makhani had honestly been cooked for half a day it seemed.  Maybe this is appealing to first timers and folks not too familiar with Indian food.  But anyone who has tried mainstream Indian or cooks at home and understands fresh, whole spice taste of any cuisine would know better. 

The waiter was a good natured guy. I wouldn't ding the service. Nothing out of the ordinary. 

The lighting was off with a stark tube light shining above and two endless looped Indian entertainment of second rate Bollywood.  But even novices know decent ambiance. This place disappointed. 

I'll venture out to say many of the reviews may be gamed.  It was a sad start to a spring break in NV/AZ.
