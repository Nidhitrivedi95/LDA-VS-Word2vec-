I was skeptical as a meat eater -- this place is a vegetarian only affair. 

I should have known that if anyone could do Vegetarian, it was a well trained Indian place. That's what this tasted like.

Vegetable Samosas were huge and delicious, served with two lighter sauces that accentuated without drowning the samsoas.

I completely forget the name but it was a potato / cauliflower red curry. So good.  One complaint here: that there weren't as many potatoes/cauliflowers as one would like given that there wasn't any meat.

Coconut / Vegetable Pancake - friends had, I couldn't try -- too full. I can say that it looked like a very good value, at the price

I also tried a puff bread / pastry that was quite good. unfortunately i don't remember many menu items since they seem to lack a business presence on the net. Let's hope that this Yelp will get some people to actually believe that it is possible to eat a meal w/o meat and enjoy it.
