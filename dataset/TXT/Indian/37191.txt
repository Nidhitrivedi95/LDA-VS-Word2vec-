o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ I love spicy food but be careful when you order here, their spice levels are intense.  I would recommend ordering a level down what you would normally order for your first visit. My boyfriend and I couldn't finish our meals (he got medium hot and I had medium). I will try it again because the curry was tasty.
