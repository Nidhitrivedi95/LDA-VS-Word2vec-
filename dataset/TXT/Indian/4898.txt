2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw I am in love.

Everytime my family comes to visit, we trek out west to eat the delicious Indochinese food served by Avani.

Although the Indian fare is also delicious and spot on...I am dreaming of when I can go back for some black bean tofu.

The highlights:
- TOFU in wikid black bean (5/5)
- pan friend noodles (4/5)
- chilli chicken (5/5)
- tandoori shrimp (5/5) ..we had to order another serving!

Please go here.. you will not regret it.


Note: More of a family place!
