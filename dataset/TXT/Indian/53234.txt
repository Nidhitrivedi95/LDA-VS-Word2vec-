VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg The best Tandoori chicken we ever had in USA. We love this place and tandoori chicken here is the Highlight and of course belly dancing if you enjoy your chicken with dance. However the service sucks.. else this place deserves a 6 star rating. The waitress or any staff does not care for you at all. You got to yell at them and waive your hand to grab your attention. They are least bothered to please their customers. However we only go there because of the food and best tandoori dishes. I hope the owner takes serious considerations to improve the service and ask his staff to be more attentive and courteous.
