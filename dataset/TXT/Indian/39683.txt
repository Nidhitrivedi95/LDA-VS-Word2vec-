P4h8kgy_48oE9vCHJc4BCQ In general, food is just ok. A lot of confusion from staff in regards to order, I have often gotten the wrong order. Last night, I ordered a kabob roll, although they got the order right this time, I found myself taking a huge bite of aluminium foil along with my meal. They had rolled aluminium foil INTO my roll. I had to take the roll apart and, take out all the foil then reassemble it. It was pretty inconvenient and extremely messy. On top of that, they didn't give any tissues!! Overall, this place started off really well and their food used to be really good too, but recently I find that the quality of their food and service is just poor.
