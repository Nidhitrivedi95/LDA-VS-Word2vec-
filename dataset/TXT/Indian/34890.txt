Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I was excited to know about the presence of an Indian restaurant right on the strip, and we were happy to shell out 40 bucks (including tax) for a dinner buffet for two of us (which is highest that I have paid for an Indian buffet!) The experience turned out to be just okay. The quality of food was not bad. In fact, the naan and Gulab jamun (dessert) were excellent, and  most of the other items, except Idlis and Sambhar were also okay (not great). Idlis were certainly stale by at least a day! 

I have more problem with the variety aspect of the buffet. I have seen more variety in $10 buffets!! The number of vegetarian entrees especially was limited. How can any Indian buffet be complete without a single Paneer entree? And Really, Zucchini as an entree in an Indian buffet !? :-o Also, I would expect more starters than just pakodas and  at least, a complimentary chai in a $20 buffet!  (Chai was $2, and wasn't good!)

Next time, if you  are on the strip and you crave for Indian food, take the DEUCE to Indian Masala! You can thank me by a "Useful" vote here later! :-)
