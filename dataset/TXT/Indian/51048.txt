UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I liked the place. It was your typical curry joint. Not very fancy, sort of dumpy. The kebab appetizer was real good. The chicken korma was excellent and the shrimp masala was spicy but not too crazy hot. Made you sweat in a good way. The onion naan and the rice was also fine and we washed it all down with these mango smoothie drinks which were perfect. I'd go again.
