V679T4yys91392j8rcKaMQ A friend and I stumbled upon this place when we were heading to Lick's next door and it was closed, oddly enough, but I'm so glad we did.

I am not usually crazy about Indian food but this is hands-down the best Indian food I've ever had. Since my first visit, I've been back a few times and never been disappointed. I especially love that you can order "half portions" of things so that for someone like me who doesn't know Indian menus well, I can try new things. Their butter chicken is incredible and I love their cucumber raita.

The staff is very friendly and attentive and though I've only been a couple of times, the waitress remembers me which is nice. The atmosphere of the place is also great. It fits somewhere between casual and fine dining and yet the prices are incredibly reasonable. Seriously, I almost feel bad at how reasonably they are priced.

My one very minor complaint is the consistency in how spicy the food is. This may just be my white-ness coming through but I like a very mild taste and sometimes this is hard to come by. But it's nothing a bowl of raita and a few extra orders of naan won't solve. I'll definitely be coming here often
