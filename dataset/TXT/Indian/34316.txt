MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ I give them 5 Stars! This is real home made food. After a long day from work I enjoy ordering from Al Hamara carry out so I can enjoy this great food while I'm coming down from my long day at work. I am so blessed to have this quality Indian food. It's always fresh!!!! Hands down the best Indian restaurant in the entire State of Arizona. 

I love Al Hamara!
