9sS0LaJVnv_HR_klZq4Dlg Bengali Sweets is a small Indian vegetarian take out restaurant specialising in sweets and simple vegetarian fare.  Normally when I hear the word  "vegetarian" I run away from it like the plague as I'm a full blooded meat eater, but when it comes to Indian I'm totally down for it!

They have hot tables where you can order some really good thali plates as well as chaat platters but for me the main draw are the sweets.  The Bengal region of India is known for having the best sweets and the ones here are fantastic!

The jalebis, ragulla, gulab jamon, rasmalai etc... are all really good here.  Sweet, fresh and delicious!  Yes you will need to get your insulin ready as you will go into diabetic shock, but hey that is why they call them "sweets" not "bitters" right???  Haha!!

The place is really small and has a couple of tables so its more of a take out place.  Overall a solid place for some vegetarian Indian fare!
