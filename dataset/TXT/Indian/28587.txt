J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ We arrived here after seeing the Cavalcade of Lights, so there was a bit of a line ahead of us and the restaurant was quite busy. One of the workers was bringing some of the people in line to their other location next door, which helped with the wait time.

We were eventually seated after 10 minutes or so. The place is small, cozy, and dimly lit. After much deliberation, we settled on butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, naan, and pulao rice. 

The food arrived quickly and the service was prompt. The butter chicken was extraordinarily sweet, in a jarring way. The portion size was also quite small. I wouldn't order it again. The lamb vindaloo, however, was definitely the highlight of the meal -- very bold flavours with a lot of spice. So much in fact we were sweating! Very enjoyable nonetheless.

Overall the food wasn't too bad, and the service was great. But you could probably find better for the same price.
