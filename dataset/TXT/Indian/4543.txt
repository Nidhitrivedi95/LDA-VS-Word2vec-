1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg Came here for lunch on a budget, and their lunch specials pack a lot of food for its price in this area.  Also, given that no customer was speaking a word of English, to me, that's a great sign.

Lunch special had quite a lot of variety as I was able to choose 2 of the 3 veggie dishes available in each combo, along with 1 meat.  Pack in some rice, and some authentic Indian cooking, and man, I'd totally come back for a budget lunch.
