Lbao9gRdsh4GmObsVqANPg The food was very good, the service was quick. I could barely read the menu the lighting was so low or see the food I was eating. The decor was very impressive. We almost walked out upon arrival because the host was giving us a hard time about not making a reservation for 3 on a Sunday night, the place was empty. Also we ordered a salad that never came, I meant to check the bill but forgot. All in all, great food but not so friendly.
