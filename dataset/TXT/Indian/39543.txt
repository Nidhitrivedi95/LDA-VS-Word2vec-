P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag I have had buffet more than 4 times here and by now, I'm a big fan of this place. It is the best Indian food I have had in Pittsburgh. Both the lunch and dinner buffet has a long counter of ample vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. You get samosas, pakoras, customizable chaat, dosa/vegetable idli and mouth watering pao-bhajji (takes you back to Bombay street side pao-bhajji joints seriously!) for appetizer. Besides you can have salad, main course (biriyani pulao, paneer, daal makhani,gobi, egg-plant, sambar, chicken curry, chicken tandoori, mutton curry, fish, shrimp...you name it, you get it). They have Indian sweets for desserts too! You'll definitely want to eat more than your appetite can take. Besides buffet, I had also tried andhra spicy dosa from the menu, which was great too! the way they serve the food is pretty neat and impressive too. I'll also recommend the Mango lassi, which is a must-try if you have some space left after a sumptuous meal.  Everytime I dine here, I've never been dissapointed. If you are looking for some authentic Indian food and some peaceful atmosphere to dine, it has to be All India on S. craig street. It's truely a awesome treat. some of my non-Indian friends have become a great fan too. It has become our weekly dining place for us.
