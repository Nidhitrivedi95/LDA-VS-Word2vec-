kkNWzhSpAjxm0zIxol3IzQ Great casual place for tasty indian food. I love the indian Thaili lunch special, (weekdays T-F only I think, they are closed Monday) where you get a generous tray with a variety of either Vegetarian or Meat-based dishes, including Naan, curries, pakora, rice/biriyani and a dessert. One gets to try new things every time and they are always very tasty. A nice alternative to the buffet, as everything on your plate it super fresh.

I also have ordered dinner from them via Uber Eats, the Palak Paneer is a favorite! And if you love the hot spice like I do, I recommend the Cut Mirchi. But don't worry if you don't care for hot food they are accommodating to all levels of spice preference.

The staff is very friendly and I like that they are attentive to make sure your water glass is full and that you are enjoying your meal.

I understand they now serve Indian Breakfast, which I am looking forward to trying.

Also, a bonus that there is an Indian grocery next door. The sweets are very tasty, and I like to grab some basics there, like dried lentils and fresh veggies.
