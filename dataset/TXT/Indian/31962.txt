La_yPXZpdIJINeDEP-THLA Ambiance - comfortable. Server - pleasant and attentive.
Mmmmmmm Food was very authentic, hit the spot. We ordered the fish koliwada for appetizers - they were delicious. For the mains - butter chicken and saag paneer - flavours were just right - 8.5/10 for both. The best part were their soft and fluffy naans. Overall good experience. Def recommended !!!!
