fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA Recommended by a friend to try out.  Happy with my experience.  Last time i tried Indian buffet was a long time ago, in Brampton which was over 8 years ago.  It was good in Brampton, and it was good here too!!.  This place is not extremely huge for seating, and they don't take reservations after 6pm on weekends. Staff is friendly and pretty quick. Food was tasty and good!!! I just tried a little of everything including goat curry, 
On a saturday night, we got there at about 7:30pm and waited for a table until past 8pm. Paying the bill at 10pm there were still people waiting to be seated.  

Will visit again!!
