G_5zQbGAFYYKD7vBEoWByg Up until tonight this place was one of our favorites in the neighborhood. We always order the same thing - Butter chicken, vermicelli and avocado smoothie. We liked the place because the food always tasted fresh and nicely prepared and we like that they use aluminum trays instead of styrofoam ones. Tonight we ordered delivery which took more than 40 mins.  The avocado smoothie was very dark and tasted so bad we couldn't finish it. Same with the food.. Butter chicken was bland and the beef in my vermicelli didn't taste fresh. Even the spring rolls were a bit off. Giving them a 2 star hoping it's just an off night they were having. But I'd probably will need to be pretty desperate to return to this place. Very disappointed!
