PPCuGwbGA7HlhsGh8dbBsA Since I wrote my first review, I've been to Taj at least four times.  I really love the food here!  It's not too spicy, so I can enjoy the intricate flavors that are put into each dish.

Today, several of my co-workers and I went to Taj for the lunch buffet.  It costs $9.80 and they serve you water.  If you want a drink, sure, you can order one, but typically, you walk in, you are greeted and asked, "How many", and guided to head straight to the buffet.

The first thing you're going to see at the lunch buffet is Tandoori Chicken.  This is marinated chicken on the bone that's red in color.  It tastes pretty good, but I usually don't get this.  The next dish is Chicken Tikka Masala.  This is chunks of boneless chicken breast mixed with a butter, tomato, and lots of herbs sauce.  It is one of my favorite dishes on the buffet.  There are approximately 14 dishes (3 meat, 6 veggie, 3 bread, and 2 rice).

There's the typical Indian bread (Naan), plus little yummy Indian pancakes (Khana) that are really tasty and great to dip in the various sauces that are in each dish.  Today, they served curried cauliflower and potatoes, which was just okay.  The rock star of today's buffet was the curried spinach with peas and carrots.  I absolutely loved the taste of this dish and I wanted more.  Heck, I want some right now!

I also got some yellow rice, some red chutney (for a little extra kick), some curried chick peas, and a curried corn dish that reminded me of good old creamed corn.  These dishes were okay, but all I really wanted is the Chicken Tikka (especially the sauce!), the bread, and the spinach dish.  

The food is not too spicy, but if you like spice, you can add some hot chutney to increase the heat.  Or you can order something spicy from the kitchen.

I love the food here.  LOVE IT!
