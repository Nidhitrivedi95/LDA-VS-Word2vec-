OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Came to Vegas today and saw good reviews for this place and it did not disappoint. The lamb seekh kabobs and chicken tikka were amazing. We took Himalayan chicken which is more like home style curry and went very well with tandoori rotis. To top it, the chef followed up and made sure everything was perfect. Will be coming back here again in this trip.
