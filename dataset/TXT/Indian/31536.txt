KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ Ugh... truly the worst. I don't quite understand how they have the accolades or bragging posters on their window.

Yes the food is microwaved. In styrofoam containers, for your carcinogenic enjoyment.
I saw 3 cockroaches crawling across the dirty floors which looked like they hadn't been swept or mopped in months.

I had ordered aloo gobi with naan but was so put off by the cockroaches and the two men giggling like school girls behind the counter over a cell phone, I just left.

Blech... don't waste your money
