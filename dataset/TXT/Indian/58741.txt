YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA The food was pretty good. My friend and I shared a chicken biryani because we were not that hungry, but the waitress seemed annoyed that we only got one thing. We got medium spicy but felt like the kick was non-existent.

The atmosphere in this restaurant was soooo awkward. It was DEAD SILENT even though there were three other tables there when we walked in. There was no music and it was almost as if the walls were sound-proof. The waitress was pretty awkward too, it seemed like she didn't really know how to waitress because she tried to stack our plates on top of each other with utensils between them. She ended up dropping something.

Overall, it was okay. Would go back for food if desperate for Indian food and all other restaurants were closed, maybe...
