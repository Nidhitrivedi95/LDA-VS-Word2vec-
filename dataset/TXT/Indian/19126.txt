f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg So delightful! We tried the mixed grill, yum tandoori chicken and the tikka masala chicken. Also tired the mixed vegetables which were so flavorful. Got everything at medium spicy which was so good, but if you don't like spicy def go low. Finally, the two gentleman working were genuinely nice and helpful. Can't wait to try the lunch buffet one day!
