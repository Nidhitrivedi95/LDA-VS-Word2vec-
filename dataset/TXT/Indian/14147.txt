BxkVct02QHybp54ATZgkUQ I'll keep it simple.  I enjoy coming here for lunch or dinner.  The service is friendly and efficient.  The food is delicious.  One of the best Indian restaurants around.  The prices are very reasonable as well.  

The kebab platter is always appetizing.  The combination of spices used really wake up the palate.  The chefs really know what they're doing.   Great location and ambiance.  Nothing pretentious about it.  Simple, clean decor.  The food speaks for itself.
