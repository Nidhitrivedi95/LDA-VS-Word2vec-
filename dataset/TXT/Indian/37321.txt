o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg We used to eat here quite frequently, however we then began going to Blue Taj, which is my opinion is better food and definitely service. We ended up at hyderabad biryiani last night and had one of the worst experiences we have ever had. We arrived and we're seated and the table hadn't been set. We ended up grabbing cutlery and napkins from another table. We were given water pretty quickly but our drink order and food took a out 10 or 15 mins after we got our water. We received our beer and then began our wait. After about 45 mins we inquired about our food, and my husband asked for another beer. We were told it would be ready soon. After another 30 mins (during which time my very pregnant friend had to get up and get her own water because no one came by to offer us any more, and my husband left to go to the bar to order his own beer)we finally received our food. There were no apologies until my husband said something to one of the waiters. To be fair, my husband because a bit rude to the staff because by this point we had been at the restaurant an hour and a half at least. We finally ate and asked for the bill which was not seperate (we went with another couple). Another 10 mins passed and we finally went up to the cash. The service was terrible and I doubt we will be going back. Please sort out your wait staff and/or kitchen staff. You guys were great 9 months ago...something has obviously changed and not for the better. There was also another table beside us and they were not happy with their meal either.
