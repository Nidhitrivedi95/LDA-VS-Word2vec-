Instead it's fresh hand made traditional north Indian dishes prepared meticulously. My Punjabi wife eats only at one Indian restaurant in the city and this is it for us !! If the food isn't enough, this family owned restaurant will show you what friendly service is all about. We are regulars here already, and you should join in too.
