Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg I don't know a lot about Indian food, other than the little tastes of it and the flavor profiles, so I just ordered a bunch of random entrees, a lunch special, and a dessert. It was all delicious, piping hot, perfectly cooked and seasoned, and napkins and utensils. They were out of the ice-dream dessert and they called and gave me some fried balls in rose syrup, which was a little saddening but it was tasty-I'm not a huge fried foods fan but the flavor and execution was there. 
I was really impressed with the food, having somewhat low expectations due to other uber eats restaurants like Cleat's and Lucky's giving me half-assed food. Indian Delight is just that, a delight! 10/10 tell your mom, take her there for lunch you know she misses you!
