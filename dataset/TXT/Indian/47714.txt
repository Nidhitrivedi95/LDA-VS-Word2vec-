TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I had the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious. I would have to say this is probably the best masala I have tasted in a long time and I have been to many Indian restraunts around the country.  The Bryani also was tasty! I will be back soon! The flavors were amazing in all the dishes I tried.
