If I was rating just the meals, I would say 1.5 And the service was 0. The woman came over with a menu and I reached out to receive it and she moved it away from my hand and placed it on the far opposite edge of the table. Weird. She did the same thing when she brought my drink, instead of placing it in front of me she deposited it at the far opposite side of the table so I had to reach across for it. Why?? Didn't say anything when she brings the drink either. I asked for a mango lassi and she said they had a "mango shake". I ordered that and it was awful. Number one it was room temperature! It tasted like they mixed a little bit of canned mango drink with water and maybe some skim milk or something? Anyway it was totally unpleasant. Later I discovered that this watery, room temperature glass of liquid cost me $4 plus tax. Ignore the other review that says it's $1! The food itself, served on a prison style metal tray was just okay. The portions were not that big compared to a lot of other restaurants and the curries were nothing special. I really didn't think it was a very cheap or amazing deal for $8.50. What makes something a deal is if it is good and inexpensive. If it is kinda crappy and $8.50 it doesn't qualify as a deal. My meal came to over $14 (masala dosa combo and mango "shake") . If you go a little but further east on Bloor St you could go to Banjara and get the most amazing delicious huge veggie combo with dessert for less than that! Further, the interior of this restaurant is awful. Weird pink and yellow walls, horrible fluorescent lighting, filthy vinyl chairs, annoying music playing a little too loud. Not good.
