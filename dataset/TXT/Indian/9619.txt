8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ After eating here, more than 7 times, It really hurts to gives this such a low score. Unfortunetly, their bad service (see other comments) is turning into terrible service. 

After a long wait, they will insist something is 'just coming out' of the kitchen then disappear for 10 minutes. And take out, don't get me started they don't even pretend to listen to spice levels or give reasonable pickup time estimates. If you order one thing mild and one thing spicey, they get it wrong almost every time.

Their food is pretty good and I really like the vegatable curry but the constantly 'lying' staff makes this a no-go restaurant.
