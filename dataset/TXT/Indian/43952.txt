RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This is the best Pakistani restaurant in Toronto, bar none.  Authentic Lahori Pakistani food.  Luckily I don't live too closeby, otherwise I would be putting on some serious weight.  

Anything from the grill is delicious here - the seekh kebabs, the chicken tikka, the boneless chicken, the tandoori chicken - these are grilled to perfection.  And the best part is when they come to your table they SIZZLE.  You can't get that sizzle anywhere else.  They are brought to you on cast iron grill plates, with onions, peppers and delectable spices.  

The curries are also good, as are the biryanis.  But the BBQ is what this place is known for.  I would also recommend a Lahori Kulfi for dessert, this place makes their own kulfi and it is wonderful.

Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for authentic Pakistani BBQ.
