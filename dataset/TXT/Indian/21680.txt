GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g OK, don't plan on being impressed with the atmosphere. You will be served on paper plates.  However, what is put on those paper plates in divine nectar! This is a big step above the original/famous Woodlands restaurant in Rishikesh (unrelated,I asked the owner in Rishikesh, & he is LIVID about all the imitations!) The food here is amazing. BEWARE: closed Tuesdays! (drove 2 hours from Chino Valley one time to find that out the hard way) Also, please note that "South Indian" means HOT. If you want it mild,you need to tell them. The owners are very sweet & attentive,as well as the Mexican waitress. Always packed full of Indian customers = authentic. The only Indian restaurant I found in AZ to compare to this one is the Govindas in Tucson. This is a family run business (the owners are the cooks,& you can watch them prepare the food) Best food,best price. Very clean. I love Indian food,& this place is great.
