q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw A big group of friends and I went to Kabob n Kurry for my husbands birthday. It was absolutely wonderful! The staff was friendly and the food was delicious. There were about 10 people in the group and we were all really impressed and each one of us said we would come back. We got the lunch buffet platters and it was great to be able to try so many different things. The chicken tikka masala was probably the best I've ever had. The kabob was different than I've had before (a ground meat and spice mixture rather than seasoned cuts if meat) and i really enjoyed it. Super flavorful! My other favorite dish was a side dish of potatoes. We joked and called it Indian style potatoes au gratin. My cousin (who had recently returned from India)!said that kabob n kurry is the most authentic Indian food he's had in the states. We'll be back for sure!!!
