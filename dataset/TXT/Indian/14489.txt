C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA I've gone here for brunch on a couple of occasions. The service has always been great. I think I have been lucky enough to not have to wait. The food has always been yummy.. I ordered an omelette on both instances and both times they came out warm and cooked well. I recall that the portions were average. The home fries were yummy. I don't recall there being a lot of tea selection though.
