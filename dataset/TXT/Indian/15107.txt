CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw The food could be pretty tasty except it was way too salty and too oily. I ordered Matar Aloo (green peas with potatoes instead of Paneer) and potatoes were too big and hard. I prefer smaller pieces and softer, cooked longer. I also did not like that they did not serve papadum at the beginning - instead it was a fishy tasting fried "waffle" thing - very oily and ... we did not eat that. Other than that the customer service was very good, but I am not sure if I would return.
