BZ_j2EpBANxiNA1cBr-b6Q If you're looking for a lunchtime curry, Zest may fit your requirements quite nicely. Their lunchtime deal is pretty good value, and their food quite tasty. I didn't find it particularly "zesty" though, so one for the long list, rather than a must-visit essential.

Overall, we said: "I enjoyed the food in Zest very much. For £7.95, this was a well-executed and filling lunch. Even the filter coffee to round things off was pretty decent. The whole place could use a big squeeze of the zesty goodness that the name of the place implies, though, as it's slightly in the "solid and reliable" mould, at the moment, rather than offering something bold and fresh."
