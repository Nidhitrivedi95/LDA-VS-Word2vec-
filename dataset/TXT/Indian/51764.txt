UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Buffet bump! There is pretty much nothing I love more than an Indian buffet (well, excluding people...don't worry loved ones). Following a chat with the owner of Mint, and being impressed by his passion for healthy, consistent offerings, I decided we needed to give their lunch buffet a whirl.

Knowing the owner's commitment to serving food without heavy oil made me feel good about what I was eating, and the flavors were considerably more pronounced than when I had visited at dinner. The dal was delicious enough to warrant two helpings. The selection was great with three soups, a salad selection, approximately 4 vegan and an additional vegetarian paneer dish, plus 4 or 5 meats and a selection of deserts. (My numbers may be off, but suffice it to say it was a bounty of food!) 

The buffet is available everyday 11am-3pm for $9.99. The food is fresh, healthy and tasty, and there is something for everyone. I am now officially a fan!
