5DWBUWdr6UEtWfHeD7zIRw Its been one of my worst experiences in Toronto's food scene overall. Upon contacting them they said they had availability and on arrival we were put in an ice cold room with two tables so close that we could overhear them talking at normal voice pitch. There were no high chairs available at the restaurant hence they gave us a bar chair for our niece instead of relocating us to a table with probably sofas. The food was below average specially when they have very limited menu, our naans came before our sabzi and by the time the sabzi came, the naan was more like papad then naan. The portion size is enough for individuals and our malai kofta was still in the kitchen and we had finished our dinner. No one had a clue what a virgin mojito is. And when we asked for a serving for papad they served us khakhara which is definitely not papad! And we were told it is. When we said oh we know it is not papad. They said the kitchen ran out of papad on a long weekend which any good restaurant would be more likely be prepared for;than them. Our salted lassi was inedible. The service was a little sloppy and it felt they couldn't handle the events happening for a partially booked bistro and birthday party.Very disappointed.
