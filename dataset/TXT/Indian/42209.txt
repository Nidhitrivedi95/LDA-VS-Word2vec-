qjaMwPcTyq5_JLcZpmTqNw So I heard about this place for a few months now and wanted to check it out & just to my luck, around the holiday season (Dec. 24th and 25th to be precise), they had a special 12 course meal for only $15!!! We were a party of 5 and opted to attend their lunch seating on Christmas Eve. The appetizers consisted of a traditional South Indian mutton soup (loved it!!!), a fruit salad in a coconut, creamy, curd base with poppy seeds (meh) and grilled meats that included chicken skewers, fried King fish, jumbo shrimp etc (heaven!!!).The main courses took over an hour to arrive but were beautifully presented (you could tell that their chef really took the time to put his heart and soul into the presentation of the dishes) and included traditional dishes such as Red Fish curry, Beef Fry, Chicken Roast, Mutton Stew and Duck Curry. I wasn't too much of a fan of the mutton stew but the rest of it was deeeelish! I was super impressed that all of these items were served in authentic earthenware. For dessert, we were served a caramelized sweet vanilla ice cream, fruit cake and a grape juice mixed with Sprite which was uniquely served in a glass bottle with a bow! 

Heads up if you're checking out this place for the first time - do so only if and when you have ample time to enjoy your meal and experience. Our 45 minute seating that was reserved landed up to be 3.5 hours because of extremely slow service and disorganized staff (on numerous occasions we had to signal the wait staff to bring cutlery or water or napkins). They also tend to forget the order of seating and randomly serve patrons rather than going according to when customers come in to the restaurant and are seated. My extra two cents here is to highlight that Patience is an ultimate virtue with this place. The food is definitely worth it!
