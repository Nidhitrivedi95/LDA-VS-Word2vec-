t58AtYOZqw9BlDdZHUrZbA I ordered this from an online delivery service. I was a bit skeptical about this place since I could only find a few reviews that sounded like owner reviews. Food came just as ordered. I had the tikka masala, fish pakora and chilli chicken dishes. They were nice and spicy. It's not the best of it's kind but i'd order from here again.

I didn't go to the physical location, so I have no idea how it looks.
