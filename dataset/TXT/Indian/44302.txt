rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ Sometimes Indian fusion can be a disaster - but this place does it really well. I loved the food and I am Indian. Brought my parents who enjoyed it as well. Their wine menu pairings are well put together as well. Good ambiance and service was excellent. Yes I'll definitely return.
