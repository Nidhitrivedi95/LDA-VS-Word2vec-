L4q6PF-0Enef6gKsDB6EjA I came here on a Saturday for lunch with a friend. The service was great! the server welcoming us, got us seat and took out order nicely. The seating area is nicely decorated and the place is very clean.

we both ordered chicken kabab with rice and trust me we weren't disappointed. The food came in a decent time and was hot and happening. The presentation of the food was very well done and the chicken was tender, hot and perfectly spiced. The rice was good size.

For my Muslim folks - The meat served here is Halal!
