nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ I am grateful to yelp reviewers for pointing me in the direction of this little gem. The location (central, though not teeming with amazing dining experiences nearby) and name would not have intrigued me if I hadn't seen all the 5 stars here. 

The set menu- $25 for 3 courses- is a such great deal. Though choice may be limited all the options sounded so tasty that there were no problems for our group of 4. We hadn't checked ahead of time if they were licensed, no dice. I managed to convince the boozehounds I am pals with to leave the flipping tables til later and give it a shot. Though once they'd seen some of the meals coming out to other diners they were actually excited to start ordering. It's brightly lit, no fuss atmosphere, not for romance but great for a mid-week dinner as we did. 

The presentation of the food is really quite incredible. The appetizers were by far the best part of the meal- the quail and the lamb rolls were inventive and delicious. The portions for the mains were frankly out of control, it was the biggest pork chop I have ever been confronted with. All our mains were good, but in almost intimidating portions!

Service was very attentive and helpful.

Would definitely recommend- great food for an exceptionally reasonable price for downtown Toronto.
