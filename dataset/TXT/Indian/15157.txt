CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I'm not the most experienced when it comes to Indian, but I like what I've had so far.  I was out of town for work and luckily, my coworker fancies himself an expert.  He got a personal recommendation for Dhaba and I wasn't going to pass up the chance to get a "real" Indian experience.

We came for dinner and I didn't find street parking to be difficult, but maybe it was because we went on a random Tuesday night.  As others have suggested, just do that instead of paying an arm and a leg.

The restaurant entrance is kind of small, so you might miss it on the first pass.  Once we got there, I left all the ordering to my expert friend.  He ordered garlic naan (a must), lamb vindaloo (spicy!), butter chicken (my favorite dish of the night), chana masala, some kind of paneer, and some dessert.  Everything was good, but the butter chicken and naan were my favorites.  I could just order those and be set.  I didn't go with 5 stars because the paneer and masala didn't knock my socks off.  I'd definitely go again and experiment with some other dishes.
