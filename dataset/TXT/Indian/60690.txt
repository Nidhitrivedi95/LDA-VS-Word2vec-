zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q First of all, this is an Afghani/Pakistani restaurant. Its the only decent Pakistani food Ive had in the valley. Their beef shish kababs are great. Nihari is also very good. As for their Afghani items, the Bolani and Mantoo are amazing. Its a very spartan restaurant in a less than spectacular strip mall. The owner and his family are very welcoming. 

This is as close as it gets to authentic Pakistani/Afghani food in the valley. So dont go there if you're seeking ambience!
