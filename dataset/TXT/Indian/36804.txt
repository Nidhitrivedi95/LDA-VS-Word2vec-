nyM76RUyFzekHHmYEU-KBQ Summary: Very generous portions, and great plating. Food is above average. Very casual setting. 

Pros:
-as mentioned above, plating is good (usually I don't really care about plating, but the wife is into stuff like that) 
-great value... 3 courses for $25, and the lots of fresh ingredients (fruits and veggies)
-service was good
-1st course (chicken lollipops) and desert (milk chocolate panna cotta was awesome). 



The main entree was good. Not up to the high standards of the other 2, but still very tasty. Still, the entire meal is $25, so I'm willing to let that slide. 

Another cool thing was that I could make a Saturday night reservation on a Thursday. I'm pretty sure if this place was in a better location, and at this $25, you'd need to make a reservation far in advance
