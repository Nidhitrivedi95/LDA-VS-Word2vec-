RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Wish I could rate this restaurant lower than one star. Came all the way from the States hearing all the hype about Lahore Tikka House. I've never been so disappointed. Ordered Nihari, Beef Kabob, lamb Biryani, and can't say one good thing. You could tell the food was old. I would NOT recommend coming here, especially with high expectations. Try other restaurants on Gerrard, I'm sure they'll be better.
