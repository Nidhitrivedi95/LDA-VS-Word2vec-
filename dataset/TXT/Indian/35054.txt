Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Indian Food is by far my favorite, and I was so pleased to run into Tamba on the strip! We came during lunch and were able to eat off of the buffet and get unlimited non-alcoholic drinks for $13.

Being vegetarians, we were totally stoked that they had at least 5 different dishes in addition to rice, naan, and those weird soda break things.

I learned that I love Dal Makni, Malai Paneer, and Punjabi Curry, which would be things I would normally not get to try because I always order my favorite, Muttar Paneer.

Anyway, the service was really great, the location was awesome, and the food was so incredibly tasty. Five Stars alllll the way!!!
