LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg I just eat there today. The food is OK, I had food from their lunch buffet.
The place needs to be cleaned! The floors are black, the air conditioning vents are falling apart (you cannot see that because they have dropped the reflectors lower from the ceiling and painted the ceiling elements black, so unless you really look you cannot see), check out the chandelier in the place, filthy! I saw a tinny bug walk over the buffet foods while I was helping myself. I am not a picky person, but I will never go there again. There are much better Indian food places around.
