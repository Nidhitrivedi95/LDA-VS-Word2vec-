ToU2fHhYJ6_7AVc_MojMRg Had a butter chicken and spinach cheese curry with chicken biryani rice to go. Drive back home for 40 min, food are still hot enough to eat. Curry is tasty but bid sweet like a northern Indian curry rather than one from southern city Mumbai. It's good to try if you passed by the area, otherwise use KFI curry as a base then add extra chicken , tomato and BD's mild cheese (use butter to cook them at first then add KFI). Curry is a great food, anyway.
