After i have tried some good real indian restaurants (real as confirmation from my indian friends), i am addicting. Bombaychaat is one of them. Food make me feel fresh. Tasty and very delicious. Only problem i have is the parking because the downtown location. 

I like dahi puri and vada...something (cant remember the name). Mongo lassi is also awesome. I never had buffet because it is only weekday.
