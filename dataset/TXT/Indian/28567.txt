J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ This by far is my favourite indian restaurant.

3 1/2 STARS for the restaurant: its clean, but very small. There are always line ups.

5 STARS for the food: the food is amazing. The butter chicken is by far the greatest EVER!!!  The prices are so reasonable. I would recommend going for lunch when they have the buffet. Its a pretty small buffet, but it has all the main dishes. The quality of the food is great!!!
