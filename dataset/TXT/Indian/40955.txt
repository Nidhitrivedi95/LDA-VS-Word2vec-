PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA I cant stand indian food, sorry its just not my cup of tea. But my wife kinda likes it and wanted to try it here. The food court here in the Riviera is literally a ghost town, I cant comprehend how all the eateries stay in business. She ordered a non veg plate that came on a little prison plate with tiny little compartments of food and a big piece of bread. She said it all tasted pretty good and she easily finished it all, and she doesnt  have a big appetitie. The cost w/o drink was over $16! which is outrageous for food court food during lunch. I know this is vegas and eveything is overpriced a bit, but every other eatery had equal sized portions for half the cost, Plus my wife got really sick after eating it,
