It's really filling, you get a decent amount of chicken, a curry to add more flavor on top, and just lots of rice that balances it all out and makes your soul really happy. I'm a big fan of biryani and although this may not be the best in the world and the spicy option is still not really spicy- it's the best option for the price you're paying. Perfect for hungry students like me. And service is always fast and straightforward, just gets a bit busy during lunch but the wait is still never longer than 30 mins.
