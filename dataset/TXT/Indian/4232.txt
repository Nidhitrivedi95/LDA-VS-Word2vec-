5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.

This is not very good at all. There's a reason why someone would include "in a hurry" in the name of their restaurant. The food has the flavouring and appearance of a forgotten cafeteria. There's nothing special about this place at all. Stay home and heat up your frozen "Indian Curry" meal from President's Choice; it's very similar.
Plus, why would someone open up a place that serves roti this close to Vena's?
