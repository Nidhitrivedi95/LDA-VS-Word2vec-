I came here at night and ordered chicken masala and samosa. The chicken masala was over cooked and dry. No flavor at all. The appetizer that they delivered at first was the wrong order and burnt on top of it. The samosa was okay, but again the seasoning was poor and there were 2 big ones for 5 dollars, which is pricey for the quantity. 

It took me awhile to get the food, and I had to get the waiters attention just to place the order. They weren't that busy, so it was disappointing. The place looks nice. The food tasted like buffet quality, and I have had better buffet food to be honest. My bill came to around 20 dollars.
