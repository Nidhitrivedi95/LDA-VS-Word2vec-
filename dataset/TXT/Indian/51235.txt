uteI0OIVarN_qkmORgPPgg Not sure what the rave reviews are about. Had a really bad experience here. It might have been because I went with the veg fare but I will let you be the judge of that while I detail the experience. 

I walked in and asked the person behind the counter in Hindi what the best vegetarian dish is. He says I don't know. I eat only non vegetarian food. I looked at the board and under curries decided to go for aloo gobi (literally potato - cauliflower). 


Now, there are many different ways people make aloo gobi. But this was bad. The cauliflower florets and potato pieces were too large. What little flavor the dish had was on the outside of the potatoes and cauliflower. Additionally the dish was dripping in oil and was more or less a dry vegetable dish. I mean, it would definitely not be under a curry. I asked about what it would come with roti or rice. I was told that it comes with roti but I can add rice extra extra. While that was factually true, such a dry dish couldn't be had with rice. 

I ended up leaving most of the food on my plate and not taking it to go. Try it at your own risk. If you do decide to try it, I suggest you stick with the non veg since that is what most people are talking about.
