VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw On a recommendation we stopped for lunch, and against my better judgement we tried the buffet.  I'm glad we did - this was the best Indian food I've had in Arizona - finally!  What a wonderful surprise. I've been searching for good Indian food and this Northern Indian cuisine was consistently excellent. The place changed owners and will add Southern Indian cuisine and be renamed - so that's a great excuse for a return visit.  Looking forward to it!
