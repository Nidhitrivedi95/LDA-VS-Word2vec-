I'm pretty sure that the rice was reheated leftovers (it was dry and kind of clumpy), and the raita is the simply the worst I've ever had. It was like a bowl of milky water with weird lumps in it. I overheard one of the young gentlemen owners tell another table that the problem was a lack of access to reliably good milk. That is the biggest bunch of baloney. Hahaha! Look, if you can't make a decent yogurt from scratch for your raita, buy yogurt. Given the choice between having to tell customers "Sorry, we don't have raita tonight" versus serving that mess, go with the former, please.
Now, on the upside, the rest of our meal was good, and the kitchen got our food out quickly. All in all, just based on one visit, I'd say that the "New" India Gate is a fine place to satisfy your Indian food cravings, but it's nowhere near my first choice.
