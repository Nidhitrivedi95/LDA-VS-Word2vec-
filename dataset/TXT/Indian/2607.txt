02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but I do believe that's because I was probably eating at bad places. This place has converted me! I had the Lamb Korma and my hubby had the Butter Chicken. Everything was very flavorful! The establishment is very clean and very authentic. Our service lacked, slow and didn't ask us for drinks etc, but they were very friendly regardless. We will definitely be going back to try more!
