hq10TdILrwtTcAESKY251Q We went here a few times and though we've never been disappointed with the food, we weren't wowed either. We had the saag paneer, butter chicken, and their appetizer platter last time. All of it was fairly tasty. The spices weren't overwhelming and everything seemed fresh. The service is lacklustre. They weren't rude but it wasn't efficient. It felt pretty slow. It's an alright place but I'm sure there are better options in Mississauga
