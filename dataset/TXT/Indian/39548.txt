P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag After a recommendation from my husband's friend, we decided to check out All India on a Saturday night when we were meandering around North Oakland.  We have to say, based on this visit alone, we were not disappointed at all.

The service was super attentive and kind, and the menu had a great selection.  There were 4 of us, and each of us ordered something different... we were all very satisfied.  The portion sizes were good and they were priced more than adequately.  

We will definitely be back... the service, the food and the ambiance made this a good experience overall!
