This place has great Indian food, plus offers some pub favourites for those that don't like Indian cuisine ( this is a great compromise for my family). The non meat options are plentiful and so many things on the menu I want to try. Had the Korma, and really enjoyed it. The garlic naan was nice, and the pompodoms very nice. My wife also enjoyed her Tikka chicken. Parking is a little tight, but worth the effort. We will return.
