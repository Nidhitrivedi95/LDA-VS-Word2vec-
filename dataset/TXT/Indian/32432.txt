LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw We had lunch at Salem's today.  The service was first class and the food was fresh and great tasting.  

The staff is super friendly. The polite  young man who took my order was helpful -- he not only explained the history and ingredients of various desserts and side dishes -- he also suggested options. The service was both efficient and speedy.

My husband had the lamb/beef  shawarma; both the spice marinade and temperature were perfect. My falafel with yogurt sauce on the side was quite tasty!

While the ambiance might not impress the bourgeoisie, the food and friendly staff will. The food is fresh and the servings are large.
