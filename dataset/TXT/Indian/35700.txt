N1BTJaWnLsCVsJ3I41EPdg I have been to Dishoom twice.  Both visits were wonderful. All the dishes are quite unique.  The Waitrose told us the food was more Persian than Indian.  The flavours were just delicious.  The service is great,  lovely atmosphere too. Only drawback is no reservations for parties less than 6.
