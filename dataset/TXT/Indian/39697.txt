Stop in to India Palace for a lunch buffet, it is affordable, fresh and delicious!

The staff were so nice to us, even though we hauled in there with a stroller, diaper bag and a baby!  Our waters were refilled, our plates cleared and good conversation was had with the owner.

The vegetarian options are wonderful, over half of the buffet on the day we visited.

I noticed there was wine but did not imbibe, I did not save room for any dessert either.  Perhaps you will.
