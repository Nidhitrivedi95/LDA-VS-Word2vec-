f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Best best best biryani in Charlotte. After having goat and veg biryani in Zafran, I stopped going to other restaurants for biryani. This is my favorite spot for biryani and kebabs. Pricing is extremely reasonable and staff is super friendly. I went on a Saturday to pick up my food and saw the buffet food. Buffet time was already over but the food looked super delicious. I am going to try that when I visit next time. When I picked up my biryani today, the owner told me - "sir, trust me, you will fall in love with this biryani". He was absolutely right. It was one of the best goat biryani I ever ate. My stomach was screaming to stop eating but my mouth told me - keep bringing that food in and I finally over ate. Lol. I have been to so many places around the world and have had biryani. I rate this place at one of the best places in the US serving authentic biryani. Keep eating guys.
