-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw I got the chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread. Everything was all right. Nothing super fancy. The chicken had clumps of some spice that I couldn't tell you what it was. However, I wasn't pleased with that as it was an overpower explosion of spice in a few bites that I discovered those.. The naan bread was rather rubbery and the garlic tasted sweet. 
To be honest with you though, it did taste really good and for the price that I paid, I would definitely return.
