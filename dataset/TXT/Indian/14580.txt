C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw Been looking for a Kotthu roti place after trying it in Manhattan, and this place is my new favourite joint. The Kotthu roti was delicious, spicy and flavourful. The cashier was happy to explain the dishes. The only downside is that it's a tiny spot so seating is hit or miss, but otherwise definitely a place worth checking out!
