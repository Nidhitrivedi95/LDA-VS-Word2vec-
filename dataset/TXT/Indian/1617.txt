-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA I love indian food and vegetable korma is my favorite. My husband and went in to try this place as the past restaurant in this location was not good at all.
The inside is totally redone and very pretty. Service was quick, we choose the buffet which for two people was a bit steep over 35.00 for two people. I enjoyed it and might return if I had a coupon or groupon but don't think I would pay full price. The vegetable korma was very spicy which I didn't care much for.
