llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I've been eating here regularly for a few months now and I absolutely love it! The food here (I've tried quite a few dishes) is phenomenal! Some of the best I've ever had. The staff are welcoming and it's a nice quiet atmosphere, at least when I've gone. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to try some authentic, delicious Indian food.
