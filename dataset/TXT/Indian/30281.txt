K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g In my struggle to find decent Indian food in the north valley, this place is the best up here. Trust, I have tried many. The flavor profile is right. Service is pretty good and it's all vegetarian. I usually get the mutter pander, this is my favorite dish. It's delicious here. Also love their gulag jamun. Yum yum. The servings are great and I always have enough for leftovers.
