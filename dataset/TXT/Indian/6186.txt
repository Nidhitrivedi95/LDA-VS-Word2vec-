3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA We decided to visit this place within 2 minutes based on the reviews and directly drove from the airport for a weekday buffet. Since it was a weekday the restaurant was not busy, 3 or 4 tables were occupied. 
The food was delicious, and the buffet had a good variety of both veg and non veg options. The naan was served to table and it was one of the best I have had until now. The food was hot and fresh, and the staff were very courteous. The reason for 4 star is not all the items tasted good, biriyani, noodles, and idlis tasted below average. 
Overall the food was delicious, and would visit again when I am in the area.
