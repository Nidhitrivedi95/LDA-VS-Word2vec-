KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA Kadhai chicken and Dal makhani are as good as it can get.. late night destination helps..
Service can get slow at times but the mouth watering food makes up for it.

Note to the Chef: Dosas used to be very good, they have recently changed in taste for the worse, thats why 4 stars..


Re reviewed to 5 stars cause the manager reached out and was eager to know how the dosas could be improved! Way to go desi bar and grill.. 

P.S. I have had experiences with places where owners antagonize the bad reviewers
