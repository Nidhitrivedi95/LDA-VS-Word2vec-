+ Delicious made-to-order food
+ Dirt cheap, as compared to other Indian restaurants in the area
+ Clean restrooms
+ Spacious dining tables. You will be glad when you have ordered multiple items
+ The host was fluent in English

- Service is slow, probably because the food is cooked to order
- The place is HOT! I do not know why the AC was not working

We dined here on a sweltering Vegas evening. The place was hot but was offset with good quality food, easy on spices and oil. I found the food to be under-salted but that is any day better than being served over-salted food. 

We ordered the following:
- Chicken Curry - Best of the lot. Enough for two people
- Malai Kofta - Easy on the cream and very delicious. Enough for two people
- Goat Biriyani - Low on oil, wish it had a little more salt to begin with
- Naan - Soft and delicious
- Rotis - Give it a miss...was almost as crunchy as a poppadom

They ran out of ice and we had to wait, while the owner had to rush out to get the ice. By the time he came back, we had paid and were about to leave. He explained the situation and apologized for the delay and thanked us for visiting Shalimar. Nice guy.
