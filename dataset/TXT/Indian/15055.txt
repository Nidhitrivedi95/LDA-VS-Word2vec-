CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I've been to Dhaba to have their delightful all-you-can eat lunch buffet. The lunch buffet is a great deal and is available seven days a week. The food is quite good, not outstanding, but you really can't beat the price for the quality you get. Plus it gives you an opportunity to sample a number of different dishes. If you are dining there for dinner, the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka achari and the lamb vindaloo are highly recommended dishes.
