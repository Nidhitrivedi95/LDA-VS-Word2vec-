GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Two words:  Goat Karahi.  The reason I will be willing to drive from San Tan Valley to Tempe again.  

Hopefully I spelled this right, by the way.  I forgot to grab a take-out menu to get names right.  Anyway, this dish was suggested by our server.  Who incidentally was very courteous and attentive.  

The goat was tender, flavorful and just delicious.  We should have ordered two dishes of it because it comes on the bone and my husband and I were left wanting more.  

We also had the Chicken Korma, which was good but when we return we'll try something else.  

Prices are excellent, entrees include either rice or naan.  We opted for rice but also ordered garlic naan.  Good call on our part.  The naan was crispy and soft at the same time with great garlic flavor.  Yum!

If I understand correctly, they've recently remodeled.  I saw no problems with cleanliness, one of the things that seems to have been an issue previously.  

Had a nice chat with our server about how their experience was with Guy Fieri as well.  

Can't wait to go back and try some other dishes.
