The manager seems to take keen interest in the place, quietly greets you, and is constantly near the kitchen.  They take great care, so they get a pass.  Listen, great atmosphere, take a date to impress.... Just not the greatest Indian food in Toronto.  You should go tho.  Worth a one time try and make up your mind for yourself :-)
