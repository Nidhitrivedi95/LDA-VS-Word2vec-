DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I'm always on the lookout for new flavors to treat my palette. Indian cuisine has a wonderful variety of herbs and spices to sample.
I stumbled on this jewel late at night when everything else had already closed.  To my delight they have many vegetarian and vegan items on the menu. I tried an eggplant with curry dish. The dish had many layers of flavor and prepared to perfection. 
I highly recommend taking the path less traveled by and expanding your taste bud's horizon.
