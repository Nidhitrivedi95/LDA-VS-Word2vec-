2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw Once you walk in, looks awesome and the environment is awesome. I ordered the Chicken Tikka which came with cream & brandy. I specially asked for no brandy as I don't drink & no cream as I am lactose intolerant. I received my food in a nice period of time, however there was so much cream. I told the waitress or daughter of the owner that this has a lot of cream, she cleared my table and had me waiting for a replacement without cream this time. I receive the order and the chicken wasn't fresh at all and smelled bad, also it was undercooked. I was hungry, I ate the food and left a fair amount behind. I thought it would be a restaurant with awesome food, specially the fact they're replacing Denny's old location. I would not recommend this place. Try Indian Hero, they never disappoint & make food with love, it's always fresh or try Kazana by Sanjeev Kapoor, amazing lamb chops & chicken tikka!! Giving them 3 stars because I feel bad and don't want to give them a 2 star rating, it would hurt their rating, also why I never wrote this review on Google. Sorry but had to be done. I like writing honest but positive reviews, saddened that I have to write a negative one.
