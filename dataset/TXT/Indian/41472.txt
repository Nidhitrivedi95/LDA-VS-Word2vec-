Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Wonderful lunch buffet! I came here with a friend and we each sampled the vegetarian offerings from the spread in the buffet room. Naan was fresh and warm, vegetable biryani was "on-point", and the assortment of spicy pickled onions, mango chutney and mint sauces were all very complementary with the salad. 

For $10 a person, you really can't beat the quality of food for the price. 

I'm very happy I finally tried this place out, after driving past on Odana forever.

Thanks Maharaja
