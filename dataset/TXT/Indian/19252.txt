F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w Indian Spices is my go-to place for Indian Food in Pittsburgh. Each of the 5 or 6 times I have gone there in the last three years, the food was delicious. You can set the spice level for what you order on a scale of 15, and it is not an Americanized scale. Higher numbers are quite spicy.

The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is casual. The servers are fairly attentive and polite.

Excellent and authentic overall.
