ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Being from England I'm always worried about ordering Indian food. I grew up eating amazing Indian, and haven't found anything close since I left back in '81. Lamb vindaloo is my favorite and usually a good indication of how the food's going to be. Well, it was amazing, as good as anything I ever ate growing up!  Perfect spices, right amount of potatoes and lamb that melts in your mouth. So happy to have finally find excellent Indian cuisine. Compliments to the chef! Be back soon!
