tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Just took one of my best friends here and we both agree... This place is by far the best Indian good in Phoenix!!!  Be service is spectacular and the good is extremely flavorful.  They are very attentive and even though they were very busy, managed to check in us and make sure we were good.  Highly recommend this place!!!!
