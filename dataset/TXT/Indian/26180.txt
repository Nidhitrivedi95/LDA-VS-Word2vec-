IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA In a search for the best Indian restaurant in Vegas, from the point of view of a Desi, this place deserves the highest marks. The food is quality, fresh, and delicious. The chef knows what he/she is doing. The dishes are well spiced made with crisp, fresh vegetables. They are fairly priced with a classy ambience. Most importantly, they don't over oil their food. Their hospitality is above and beyond the best restaurants in town. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a refreshingly tasty Indian food.
