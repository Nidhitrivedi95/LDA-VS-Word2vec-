0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw I give this place a one star only Bc I can't go lower. Food was cold!! Bland!! We love our food spicy!! When we ordered we asked for a level 9!! I told him, don't be afraid I can handle it! I eat ghost peppers and habaneros like nothing!! So go for it. Food arrived cold!! And wout any flavor!! I explained it wasn't hot enough and if he can bring me some sort of sauce hot enough to put on it. And I'm not sure what he brought us but, it was like siracha!  the chicken was dry! Just def a place I won't go back to!! I've been to many many Indian food places and have friends in that culture so I def know what's right and wrong. Worst $70 spent!
