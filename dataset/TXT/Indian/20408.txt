FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ I love this place.  The food is delicious, the prices are right, and the service is generally pretty quick.  About the only thing I don't absolutely love is the location - it was far more convenient when you could get this stuff downtown - but I'm sure people who live on the south side are happy to have it.

The menu is more Thai than anything else, but there are a few Mandarin items and a couple of Indian-inspired dishes.  Everything I've had has been satisfying, though I think the tikka masala and chicken karee are some of their best dishes.  The massaman curry is slightly disappointing compared to other Thai restaurants - it seems a bit watered down - but it's not a total failure.  I also enjoy some of their appetizers/sides (spring rolls, curry purses, roti), and their willingness to adjust the spice level of their dishes is much appreciated!

The atmosphere is fine, but not fancy.  It's probably best as a lunch or takeout venture.  Make sure to visit their website first, as they generally have coupons you can print for a few dollars off.
