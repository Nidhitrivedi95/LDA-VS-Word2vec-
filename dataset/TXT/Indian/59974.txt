zJRJX2-xnxHCUXA5WbBYPA i have been here about a dozen times now, each time tried something different. 

The food is always great, probably the best Indian food i have had in the Charlotte area. Try the Dosa (an indian pancake), they are exceptional. The naan are also good and its nice to see goat as an option.

Their food is on the spicy side, so if you are unsure i would suggest mild. Its normally a warning sign to me to have the question of spice level, another reason to pick mild. IMO a particular dish generally has a particular spice level, but in this case its OK because the underlying food is good.

A few common curry dishes you may expect from any Indian restaurant are not here but the curries the do have are good.
