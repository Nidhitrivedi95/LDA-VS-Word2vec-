ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw I bought a $25 lunch Groupon recently, and my wife and I decided to use it yesterday.

We each had the lunch buffet which had about 6 warm dishes and 3 cold dishes. I had mixed pakora, basmatti rice, dahl, soup, lamb curry, spicy fish, chicken curry, naan, and raita.

The naan seemed a tad under cooked. The lamb was very tender. The pakora was good but on the soggy side. The soup was tasty. The rest was rather forgettable.

My wife got a mango lassi and she said it was one of the best she ever had.

Even after our Groupon, the bill came to $15 for the two of us for two lunch buffets, a mango lassi, and a diet Coke. The food was okay but I've certainly had better Indian food. For the price, I did not think this was a good value, and I have no plan to return.
