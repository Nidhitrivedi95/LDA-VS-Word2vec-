kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w The service here is great. We went on a Sunday and were the only people there for a while, but even as more guests arrived to the restaurant, they were still very attentive. I have to agree with other reviewers that the curry is VERY mild. We asked for them to be a bit spicier than they might normally make them, and they were still very mild. Good, but mild. However, the veggie samosas are mind-blowing! Spicy and smooth and not greasy at all - highly recommended. The kheer was also really yummy. Spicier (cardamom and nutmeg spicy, not hot spicy...) than I've had in the past, but good. Go for the garlic naan as well, delish! The only negative that I can think of is you don't get all of the free "extras" (a pekora to start you out or some kheer and chai at the end) you get at some other places, but I haven't heard of anywhere in Charlotte that does, so I guess it's an even playing field. Good wine selection, good food, good service.
