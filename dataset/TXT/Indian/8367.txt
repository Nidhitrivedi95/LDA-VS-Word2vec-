I came here based on the recommendation of the King, the guy with the most check-ins here.

What they get right: variety - they have a nice variety here and they do serve biryani on the buffet which many places don't bother with.  They also had the obligatory chicken curry or butter chicken etc., the thing your non-adventurous fellow diners can eat.

I enjoyed the way you can bring your food back to the table, reminds me of a dabbas carrier.  I really like being able to put my raita in a little bowl and the edge of my plate.  They have a variety of different sizes of metal bowls/tins depending on what you want.

What was missing - tandoori, I like the tandoori chicken but I really enjoy the onions and green peppers that go with it.  Flavor - some of the items weren't up to what I had wanted.

WARNING: This place is inconsistent.  I agree with what I read in the reviews about things being a positive experience along with those having a negative experience.  I don't know why but each time I go here the experience differs widely.

My favorite Indian dishes, other than biryan, have been absent.  I love chana masala and all forms of korma.  I haven't seen rogan josh here yet.  I go here because it is close to where I live, but I am trying other places trying to find my sweet spot.

Good enough most the time but not so good that I don't yearn for something better.
