yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw After seeing this place featured on "Check, Please!" we decided to try it.  I'm not a big fan of Indian food in general, but I was excited to try something different.  We ended up with some combo platters and I loved everything, especially the lamb and chicken curry.  Will definitely go back to try other things!
