MWffCS7UkTUj9yDMy4jaLA I must admit...I don't know much about Indian cuisine, but it doesn't matter...I enjoyed the lunch buffet here.  I got to try a bit of everything which I can't really at an a la carte restaurant because I usually don't know what half the stuff is on the menu.  The staff was very efficient and friendly.  Although there was only one waitstaff, he was really good at what he did.  Saw the chef bring out the food and he was very welcoming too.  The naan was so tasty and fresh when it came out - I had to eat it right away.  They served a bit too much in one shot, we couldn't finish it all and it seems to be a waste.  It would be been better if they served less and on demand so that the naan stays fresh and warm.  Also noticed some of the labels for the dishes were placed incorrectly.  Other than that, I will definitely be returning as soon as next week!
