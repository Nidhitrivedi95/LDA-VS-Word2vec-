JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I highly recommend Aroma. The food is AMAZING!! All the meats are very tender and all the food is full of flavor. The deserts... You gotta be sure to have them because they are mouth watering. The service is some of the very best in the area. 
No exaggeration here. Once you go and have the experience yourself, I assure you, you'll agree!!
