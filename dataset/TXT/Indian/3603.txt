0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ When I think of "fast food Chinese", the food at Chilli Chicken House comes to mind.  So weight watchers, people who don't like fried foods, &/or those who like to get their veg on, should probably stay away!  It's basically a carb-fest here.  

Almost everything on the menu, with the exception of the drinks, are either fried, slathered in gravy, or BOTH!  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but personally, this type of eating is reserved for when Aunt Flow comes to visit.  

Tip 1:  If you want to order a wider variety, order the Dinner Combo.  It's $6.75 for a good portion, with 2-3 servings, and it comes with rice.  You can pay extra for fried rice/noodles.

Tip 2:  If you're sensitive to MSG, ask for them to reduce it OR not use it altogether.  I grew up with MSG in my house, but I never used it myself, so I don't miss it!

Tip 3:  Menu items with pic of chillis aren't that spicy.  So if you're Indian or from a culture who can take your spice, ask for EXTRA SPICY!!!

We ordered:  Chilli Chicken (with gravy), Sweet & Sour Fish (came out bright, flame red, and was like S'nS Pork), & Manchurian Veg Pakora.  The Pakora dish was probably my least favourite.  The sauce sorta reminded me of a Chinese, black bean sauce, but a bit spicy.  The owner said that it had garlic, ginger, green chillis, and a coriander base.  It probably had soy sauce as well.  The Pakoras tasted like meatballs.

Service was polite, pleasant, and efficient.  And I'm sure that waitstaff would be more than happy to answer questions, but I really wished that there was brief descriptions for each menu item. 

Verdict:  Chilli Chicken House is definitely legit, but again, there's a time and place for consumption and it's not an everyday meal for me.  However, I won't hold my dietary concerns against them!
