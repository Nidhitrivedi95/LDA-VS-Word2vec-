rwLm3556i3xw2n3ND0cpdg We are visiting from NY and was looking for a good Indian restaurant for dinner. Saw some great reviews on Yelp and decided to try it. Plenty of street parking (it was a Sunday so not sure if that makes a difference). The place has many tables and is very clean. We ordered the lentil soup, masala vada (lentil doughnuts ) for our appetizers. They were both fantastic!! My husband had the chili chicken boneless with tomato rice and I had the Paneer Masala Dosa. It was my first time having dosa and it was fabulous!!! This is a gem of a restaurant and if you are looking for great Indian food try this! They also have a 6 foot Dosa that will feed 6-10 people. So bring some friends!!!
