uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w I love coming to this place! Their food is pretty good. I have never ordered from the buffet. I have only tried the chicken tikka masala and it's really good. Sometimes they don't put enough chicken - so I just ask them to put extra chicken in. Their rice is nice and fluffy. I know it's very Indian-basic of me to ONLY order the chicken tikka masala ("CTM"), but when something is already so delicious why try something new? I will try and order more items - but for the time being, I am perfectly happy with the CTM. The chicken is nice and tender and the sauce is flavorful - not too spicy. The decor inside is nice. There is ample seating.
