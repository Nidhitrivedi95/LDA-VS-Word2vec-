Most people would associat Indian food with a combination of immense flavor and some degree of accompanied spice. Neither of these two characteristics was to  be witnessed in our culinary experience of this establishment. 
We shared a Saag Paneer and Channa Masala, two basic and common northern Indian dishes that are very standard fare in any Indian restaurant. Both were completely tasteless with no spice at all. We asked for spicy by the way. As there was no salt or pepper on the table, why would you need it one might surmise, this being Indian food after all, these two condiments were sorrely missed. We also shared riatta which seemed a bit under fermented, more like plain yogurt with some chopped onions thrown in. 
I have NEVER had tasteless Indian food before in North America. No spice I understand but no spices is another matter. If this were someone's first time with Indian food they would walk away wondering what all the fuss was about.
