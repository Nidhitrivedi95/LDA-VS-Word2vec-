0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Kohinoor Cuisine of India is great place to get Indian food at near Tempe. They offer a lunch and dinner buffet, as well as a carry-out buffet! Additionally, they have an Indian bakery which is a nice departure from the typical Indian restaurants. ASU students get a discount, the buffet has all the classic dishes, and you get a free Mango Lasse with the buffet! My only recommendation is that they add a couple more dishes to the buffet, and are more careful when chopping up chicken as to not include bone fragments within the curries.

I'll be back next time I'm in Tempe!
