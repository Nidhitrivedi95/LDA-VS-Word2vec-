ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Love this place! Have been here for lunch buffet and dinner. If you are not so familiar with Indian food I really recommend trying out the buffet so you can find something you like. My favorites are palak paneer which is a spinach curry dish with cheese cubes. Yumm! Other favorite curry dish is the mutter paneer, cheese cubes and green peas. Both vegetarian and both delicious. The garlic naan is a must! Price wise it is a bit cheaper than other Indian places I've visited. So if you're in the lookout for a great Indian food restaurant, give this a try!
