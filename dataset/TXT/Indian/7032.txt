4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q This place is really not good. The buffet options are fairly extensive however everything I tried was passable at best. I'd say "workmanlike" in its attempts to please the palate. I tried one of their specialty lemonades which was supposed to be flavoured with Indian spices. It tasted like old dirty socks. As I just ate there about an hour ago, I'm hoping my stomach can hold it together long enough for me to have a soothing cup of tea at home. I most emphatically don't recommend this restaurant.
