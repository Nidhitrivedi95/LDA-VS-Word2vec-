0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w Pretty good nepalese food. The portions are a bit small so go for an appetizer to go along with your entree. Went for a la cart dinner but they also have a lunch only buffet that looks like it's worth checking out.

There's an extensive tandoori portion of the menu which looks very interesting. I will have to try that next time.
