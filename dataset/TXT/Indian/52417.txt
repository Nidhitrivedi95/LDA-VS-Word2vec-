UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg Being a lover of Indian food, I was excited that my group chose Situl. I had never eaten there before and was looking forward to it.  The restaurant  had few customers when I arrived.  Appetizer platters had already been ordered.  The term "platters" was quite an exaggeration.  I would have used the term "salad plates."  But, the appetizers, served with a green sauce and a relish listed as 2 on the heat scale, were delicious!  I ordered Vegetable Karma, described as grated vegetables and cheese in a cream sauce.  I specified number 4 on the heat scale, which went to 5.  It came with rice, and I also ordered garlic naan.  The heat was nice, but the meal did not stand out visually or flavor wise.  But, I did adore the little copper pot used for presentation.
Now, one would think if a restaurant was expecting a group of 10 or 12 that there would be adequate staff that night.  One server for the entire place.  Not sure how many chefs were in the kitchen, but it took a long time, an hour or greater, to be served.  Other tables seated later received their food, ate and left before we did.  It was as if we were guests in the home of someone who didn't plan ahead.  It took a long time to receive our checks as well.  I like to support small businesses, but probably will not return.
