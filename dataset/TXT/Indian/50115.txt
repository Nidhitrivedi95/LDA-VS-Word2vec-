U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw I've been passing by this place for a while and I finally decided to go. I'm glad I did, food was delicious. I ordered the chicken tandoori plate, it came with 3 pieces of chicken, some rice, 2 naans and some saucy potatoes. Except for the rice everything else was very flavourful and very delicious. Will be coming back to this place again.
