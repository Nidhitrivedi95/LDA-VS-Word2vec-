FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw This is second time at Swagat.  I'm a huge fan of Indian food, but until a recent job change, it was quite far out of my way.  First, the service is excellent. They weren't exceptionally busy today, but they were the first time we came and both times they were attentive and kind.   

The Masala chai is a little less sweet than most Americans might be used to, but overall good.   The gohbi manchurian, a fried indo- Chinese califlower dish is a favourite of mine and it is delicious here.  Rich, crispy, while not being overly salty as I've had it before.  Likewise the butter chicken is a standard of excellence.... warm and comforting, buttery. Plus where many Indian places in Madison the chicken isn't strange chunks, but rather nice fresh cut looking pieces. The samosa aren't fairly standard, but for me the real standout was their chutney.   It was fresh tasting and of course free.  

The only reason thing I found a bit odd.... they put marichino  cherries in their peshwary naan.  It was tasty, sweet and savory, but not quite as much fennel as I'd like... and the marchinos were.... were a bit odd.  

I will be back.
