Iqu-RwRA4XfwILKQLKQZew First off, i was super excited because its almost impossible to get indian street food in AZ - esp., Puff pastries with egg/chicken/veg fillings here in tempe/az. So i wanted to try that out. The egg puffs did not have any decent gravy, and were basically saltless , spiceless (by spice i dont mean just chilly/hot spices, i mean all combo of indian spices), and just boiled egg inside a pastry sheet baked. And the veg puffs had majorly paneer in them, and i couldn't taste any other veggies! I wonder what panner puffs would have had in them! I mean veg puffs have onions, tomatoes , peas and a host of other spices forming the curry inside it. And other foods are all the same, for instance samosa, samosa chaat is extremely overrated. It had just one small pretty bland samosa (which again wasn't that great), and the channa in the chaat wasn't that great either.

Add to all this they overprice it (which by the way is super cheap in indian streets) like its some niche rare authentic street food. But if my experience of growing up in india for 20 yrs is any good, it most definitely is not authentic.
Bottomline, if you are an indian like me missing home street food, don't have huge expectations, and be ready to shell out way more money for what the food is worth. And probably just go only when you miss/ can't make these indian chaat food yourselves!
