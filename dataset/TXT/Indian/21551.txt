GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g We are vegetarians and found Woodlands the day we moved to the area. We got the Butter Masala and the vegetable soup (got take-out). The portions were big and prices were good. The Masala was wonderful - creamy, savory, extra tomato-y, and a little bit spicy, which was perfect. I ordered the veggie soup for my lady who was sick that night, and it ended up being the ideal thing. Delicious broth, not too spicy, kind of like the Indian equivalent of a good chicken noodle soup. But vegetarian. We will absolutely be ordering from Woodlands again - what a nice introduction to the Phoenix area!

EDIT: We've just ordered take-out from Woodlands again (probably will happen pretty often) and got the Vegetable Curry which was nearly as fantastic as the Masala. The order came with a couple yummy sides: a yogurt sauce and a gingery concoction. We also got the lentil soup this time and wanted to post a WARNING to fellow Yelpers: This soup is SO SO SO SO SPICY, I absolutely love spicy food and couldn't finish it. Not for the faint of heart!
