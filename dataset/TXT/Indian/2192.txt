_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA This is one of my most favorite restaurants to take friends within the downtown core. The service is excellent and the wines they offer are perfect for the food (try their Reisling). The dessert selection is my favorite along with the curried eggplant.   

Overall, one of the best Indian restaurants Toronto has to offer.
