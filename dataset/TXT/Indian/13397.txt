bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Worst chili chicken ever! I bought a full order of chili chicken for lunch.  Chicken was dry, tasted days old & how dare they serve me several days old chicken like we wouldn't notice!  Why do people continue to go here at give a good review?!  People, there are way better Hakka food out there : Lin Garden, Tangerine, Supper Hakka, Asian Garden,  & China Garden to name a few!  Never again will I go to Federicks and even the one in Markham!  Smarten up people! 
This place sucks!  They are serving us cheap quality foods and you are all falling for it!
