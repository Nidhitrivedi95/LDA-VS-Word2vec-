t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q We usually go to the one in Scarborough but this one will do in a pinch.  The space is clean and open, we were seated immediately, the service was good and attentive.  Our order consisted of "chili chicken - gravy" and "ma po tofu" (sauce is chicken), both come with rice.  In addition, my husband opted for the second chili chicken for only $5, to take home.  The chili chicken was alright, if a little salty.  The spice level was good.  It doesn't come close to chili chicken of Royal Chinese Seafood Restaurant (Scarborough), Lin Garden (Scarborough) or Tangerine (in its heyday, Markham).  However, the ma po tofu was made with fried tofu.  In no universe does my ma po tofu come with fried cubes of tofu.  When the cubes are this small and fried, they become hollow cubes of skin which I do not enjoy.  The main reason that I love ma po tofu is for the silky cubes of 'fu.  If not for this, I would have given it the additional star.  I see that they deliver and have online ordering which is a nice service.
