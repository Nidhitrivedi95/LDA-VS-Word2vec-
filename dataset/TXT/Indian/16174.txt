Dd1w7xR7Xs3bthwusgy33Q Walked in on a whim.  Glad I did.  Place is SUPER clean.  Indian market has everything you need to make curries, samosas, roti, etc.  TONS of spices.  What surprised me, was the restaurant area.  I had no clue what to get.  The gentlemen was so nice and helpful.  Explained everything in detail.  I ordered a paneer wrap.  Boy was it GOOD!  I split it with other person since I didn't know if I'd even like it.  As soon as I took first bite, I wish I didn't split it.  The wrap was made from scratch.  Not from any package.  The wrap had Indian cheese also made by them.  It had spices, peppers, onion, cilantro and two homemade sauces.   This little market is a hidden gem for those in Mesa/Chandler who LOVE Indian food. The menu isn't that big, but what they offer are items that you see typically in India called "street food."   I read they also do Vegan dishes.  The glass case also had some nice deserts and Mango Lassi drinks.    The owner came out and asked how everything was.  She said the store will be offering Indian cooking classes very soon.  I know I would love how to make this dish I had today at home.  I will be back again very soon.
