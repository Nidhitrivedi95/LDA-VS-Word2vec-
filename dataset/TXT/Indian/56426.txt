XrcB7Of1KfHlkeXYpHLIrw Been waiting a long time to try Tibetan  food. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful. She told us what popular Tibetan dishes to try were. We ordered:

Mango lassi - smooth and creamy

Chilli chicken (dry) - she said this was the most popular dish. I can see why! Very crispy and flavourful. We got it mild and it wasn't spicy, but watch out for the tiny chillies because those are super spicy. 

Ting mo: smooth and moist. Try it with butter. Tasted way better with it!

Chow mien: delicious! Flavourful and yummy.

Beef momos: a bit disappointed because it was dry due to the lean beef. 

Overall, I would definitely come back and try their other dishes!
