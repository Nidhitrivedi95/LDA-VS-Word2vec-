TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I have been to many Indian restaurants around and this one is by far the best and my favorite. It was refreshing to be greeted by Manny with such spectacular hospitality as if we were family and the customer service was amazing! He was extremely friendly and pleasant and made my experience there top notch. Vick was wonderful and helpful as well. The food was phenomenal, much so that we went back two more times during our stay in Las Vegas! Every dish was so absolutely delicious and seasoned perfectly. Also, the portions were quite generous and they had a huge vegetarian selection. With service and food that was out of this world, there is no need to go anywhere else! I will definitely be returning every time I go to Vegas. India Palace is my favorite place to dine in Vegas!
