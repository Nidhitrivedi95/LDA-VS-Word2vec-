CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ My family went to dinner yesterday for my b-day at Soma Grill Indian Bistro (704-321-9689) in Matthews NC...I am not a big fan of Indian Food but this place has changed me. The food was out of this world and the service was 5 star. Ms. Tulsi the owner and cook makes everything from scratch and can make it to your liking. My daughter is vegetarian and very picky but this is the 1st place we have gone to that has something to satisfy her as well. They even have ice cream that is made right there. All of the meats they serve are halal so you don't have to worry about the treatment of the animals which is good to know. Everyone should go to this restaurant at least twice in your life. There is no chain restaurant I can think of that tops this place in quality, service and taste and I am saying this after being a fan of Morton's in downtown Charlotte. So if you get a chance take someone there to impress them and have one awesome meal.
