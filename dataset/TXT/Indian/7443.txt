5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA Just moved to the area and was in need of an Indian food fix. The reviews were awesome so why not, right? I had the pleasure of speaking with the owner for a little bit before picking up our food. He made a couple of recommendations for our next order and even gave me two different rice puddings to try (which was amazing!). The vegetable samosa, Chicken Makhny and Saag were really good. Next time we are going to go a little hotter in spice (9 out of 10).
