S6pZkoM41a2GWbaxR5bYHw Uhhh, I hate writing bad reviews but this is definitely warranted. The poor waiter who said he was the manager clearly didn't know Indian food nor how to wait tables. He was quite nice but the guy didn't have a clue. Most importantly the food. Dinner is fairly pricey and we got the Tikka Masala Kabobs and the sauce tasted like Tandoori and the chicken was super fatty. Did not resemble any Tikka Masala I have ever had. We also got the vegetable Korma which was okay. Save your money or go visit Sangam for some amazing Indian food.
