g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Just had a wonderful lunch here. Ordered the samoas chaat and the vindaloo curry special.  Both were excellent,  full of flavor!  Vindaloo was spicy like we like it but owner was nice enough to warn us if we were not spicy people. Our boys were acting up while waiting for the food and they brought us little pieces of cake to help occupy them. I appreciated that greatly. We ordered a chicken tikki pizza for the kids and we both loved it. Prices are right and it's the perfect fit for when I'm craving indian food. A neighborhood gem.
