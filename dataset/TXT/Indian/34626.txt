Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg My boyfriend and I were starving and didn't want to walk very far from MGM for dinner. We found this place on yelp and were skeptical about the place since the location was quite hidden and not many people were dining in. 

Anyway, we were there last night. It was our first time to have Indian cuisine, so we absolutely didn't know what to order. Our server was very welcoming, friendly, and very informative. He made very good recommendations for our entrees which was called Karahi Chicken. It was AWESOME! It had the right amount of spice and had such a great thick blend of curry with onions tomatoes, peppers, and cilantro. Served with garlic flavored Nan. I ordered the Ashoka's Feast which consisted a taste of India's most popular dishes and that was amazing.

So to sum it up. Great service from our waiter. Great food because my boyfriend was very happy at the end of dinner, even though he was feeling down when he lost $150 gambling. Lol.
