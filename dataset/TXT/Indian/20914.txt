gA4bnK91phT5FTzG4ki3Dw This was a surprise! Normally, I try to avoid any restaurant on Crescent street, as they are too 'trendy/crowdy/touristic-trap' for my tastes, but this Indian restaurant was really good.

And since my palate is a bit of a wuss when it comes to spicy food, this restaurant managed to not numb too much my tongue, which is good ;)

Of course, I will need to go back and test their menu on a regular night, since I went during the 'Montreal à Table' food festival in earlier November. But it was a good experience. I really liked their lentil soup, the Chutney Tikka chicken, and the naan bread!

And I'm a sucker for any Indian restaurant that put Bollywood music in the background ;) I just love Bollywoodian music!!
