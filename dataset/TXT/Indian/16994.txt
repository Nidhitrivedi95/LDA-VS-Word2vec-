DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew This place is great! I had the chicken vindaloo (medium spice) and the chana masala, both were fantastic! My husband had the Kadai and he really liked it as well. We also ordered naan and samosas as appetizers and they were great. Our bill was around $75 and it was well worth it. My daughter loved the tandoori chicken and rice. The waitress was awesome and so sweet. I definitely recommend this place to everybody!
