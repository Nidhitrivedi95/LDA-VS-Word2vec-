B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Best tasting food and that's coming from a hyderabadi. It was a heavenly experience. We drove ways out and were quite skeptic of the place but it took us by surprise. Very clean and immaculate interior. The area was lively with about a dozen art pieces on the wall. Staff is very courteous. I don't want to talk of food anymore as I want to go there now. All in all a very happy experience for my tummy and my heart. See you soon dhaba!
