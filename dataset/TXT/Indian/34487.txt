MKCbZC6KR4oxA4LOQAVdhw Delicious, up-n-coming spot in Cleveland Heights offering Greek & Indian plates. But this Greedy Gal isn't so much about fusion as she is about variety. With modern takes on classics from both cuisines, Greedy keeps her eats fresh, flavorful, & always made-to-order. 

I'm a Cleveland native, so I know that Greedy is the first of her kind. Few other restaurants have wed diversity, freshness, & flavor so seamlessly. Must try: okra fries, baklava waffle, Parsi omelette! 

This spot is great for brunch, lunch, or early din-din. Only critique: wish they were open later! 

Friendly service & food that you know is always made fresh, sans freezer. What could be better? Missing this gem already & will definitely visit again when back in the CLE.
