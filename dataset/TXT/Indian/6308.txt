3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I rarely eat Indian food, so I took an opportunity to come here for dinner while my kitchen was out of order and I had some shopping to do nearby. Some friends recommended this place, but didn't give any specifics on what to order. I tried the Delhi vegetarian thali- a sampler of curry dishes served with naan, rice, and samosas. Everything was good- and the presentation was quite nice. My favorites were the malai kofta and dal makhani. I also ordered the mango chutney, but didn't love it. The Thali says for one person only, but I left very full without touching the rice. The staff checked up on me often- maybe because business was slow. I would come back, maybe to try some new things or to check out the lunch buffet.
