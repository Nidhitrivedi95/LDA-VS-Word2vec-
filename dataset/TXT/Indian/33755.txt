LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw I have to say that what's been missing from the entire Las Vegas valley was Indian fast food.  I was hoping this place would make the cut and I am glad to report that it does indeed.  It's not the best Indian food I've had but for fast food and an amazing price, this place is absolutely stellar.

Must get the Naan, it is the best I've had.
