Iqu-RwRA4XfwILKQLKQZew Some Like it Chaat! And those that do head to Pastries N Chaat. This little shop is a few doors down from the Tempe Improv and sells a lovely looking selection of cakes and Indian sweets in addition to chaat, Indian style pizzas and main entrees.

The interior of the restaurant is contemporary with wood paneled walls and a digital screen menu. We browsed through the selections before deciding on a chicken tikka and keema pizza with mango lassi. The lassis are in the dessert case and are premade in small little drink cups. They had a refreshing creamy tangy taste. I enjoyed the pizzas. The chicken tikka pizza was filled with chopped white meat chicken, a copious amount of cheese and a sprinkling of cilantro. The dough was light and crisp, a little thinner than naan. I tasted some of the keema pizza which was filled with spiced ground lamb. I loved the spices in the meat but the pizza was a little soggy due to all the oil accumulating on the bottom of the pizza.

I peeked at some other people's orders and the biriyani looked quite impressive so I will have to try that next time I'm here. The prices are reasonable and the food was tasty and made quickly. I will be back to try more dishes!
