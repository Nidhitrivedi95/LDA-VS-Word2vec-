zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA This place was delicious! We just relocated here from the West Coast and I must say, I have been quite the food snob. But Yuva has really impressed me. We had lunch here and it was a great deal! $8 for 2 different dish samples, and salad. 

I recommend the butter chicken-it was fabulous! The chicken tasted like it just came off the grill and the sauce was super flavorful! Also, the Naan was realllllllyyyyyy good!

The hub had Tikka Masala which was also good, but I really like the butter chicken.

Pros: Atmosphere (interior decorations are really cool!), Service (super attentive and friendly),  Food (yum), Pitt student discount (score!) Lunch Specials (very filling!)

Cons:I was too full for dessert! ;)
