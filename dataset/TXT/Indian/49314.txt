tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My husband and I stopped by to have dinner last night and OMG! the food and service was DELICIOUS! It was a late dinner so wasn't until 9 that we dropped in, but I'll tell you this...the food in the buffet was still fresh and great! They even brought us out from fresh chicken masala off the grill with some nice sauteed onions! 

Gotta try it out if you haven't done so already! and if you have been there -see you there!
