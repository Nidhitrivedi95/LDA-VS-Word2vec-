llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Visited the Indian Palace for the first time on Sunday- I'm an expat Britt constantly looking for my new Indian local. This may be it! The food was the best I've had state side. I've been searching for a place that would make me a lamb tikka korma- and nowhere has it listed or ever tried until now. The chef whipped one up and it tasted amazing. They even have onion bhaji too, and my minimum requirement a keema naan. My friend has the vegetable korma which was also easily one of the best I've tried.

The staff were very friendly, very accommodating and the food tasted excellent. I will be visiting again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a down to earth place that's serves delicious food.
