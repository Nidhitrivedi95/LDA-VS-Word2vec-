gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A A little underwhelmed by the much-hyped Chicken Tikka Masala. Ordered take out, added on the garlic naan and galub jamon. Specified a spice level of 5/10 for my 'tikka and order was out in 10 minutes flat, with a large side of basmati rice.

Chicken tikka masala was a good size for the $13 price tag, which included the rice. Garlic naan was worth the upcharge: delicious, soft, and flavorful, with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as I drove home. 

My disappointment came when I finally tried my entree. For a spice level of 5, I tasted absolutely no spice. And the sauce had a sweetness to it that I am not familiar with. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the dish didn't have the kick to it I was craving. 
Chicken in dish was in large chunks, sauce was a smidge on the thin side.

Based on other reviews, I'm going to have to come back for the lunch buffet and reevaluate.
