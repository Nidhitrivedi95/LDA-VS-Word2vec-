-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Top notch Northern Style Indian food I've had in this town. Very comforting food and staff was pleasant. Went for the buffet and, although the Chicken Vindaloo only had the sauce and some vegetables left by 130pm... I went back for seconds strictly for that sauce!! Giving it 5 stars for the fact it was a refreshing change of pace and expectation for Phoenix. Definitely for those who appreciate the difference in the regional approach to some of these classic dishes. Oh and yes.... free mango lassi and  garlic naan included.
