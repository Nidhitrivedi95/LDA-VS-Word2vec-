tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Consistently great!  Buffet style and kind of a hole in the wall type restaurant, but some of the best Indian food I've found.  Staff is pleasant and attentive.  Looking for a nice date night and all dressed up?  Go somewhere else.  Looking for excellent food at a very reasonable price and comfortable going out to dinner in shorts and flip flops?  This is the place!
