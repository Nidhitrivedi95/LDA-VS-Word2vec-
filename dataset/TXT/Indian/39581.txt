P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag Tried the buffet at All India - probably the largest Indian buffet I've seen (and they have it for lunch and dinner, 7 days a week)! An unbelievable amount of vegetarian options (which is always a plus for me) with all the classics you'll be hoping for and plenty of options you may not have tried before. I enjoyed the experience at All India from start to finish. Though their buffet seems to be very popular, there were plenty of take out orders going on. They have a very small lot in front, but for Oakland, street parking is relatively easy to find. Worth a trip!
