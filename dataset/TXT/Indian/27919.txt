IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA I stopped by here on a whim for take out yesterday and am extremely impressed. The woman who greated me and took my order was very friendly and not at all concerned that I came in close to closing hours.

I ordered the beef kabob dinner plate with half salad and half rice. I also treated myself to an order of the Persian ice cream. When they prepared my order, the cook seperated my ice cream from the dinner plate (since the dinner plate was hot) and even put it on ice for me in a ziplock bag. They definitely went above my wildest expectations with their level of service.

When I got home the dinner plate was still steaming hot and obviously prepared fresh. I'm a huge steak fan and don't generally enjoy sirloin, but the preperation of the meat was perfect. It was tender, juicy, and extremely flavorful. The spices were great without overpowering the flavor of the cut of meat. It also had just the right amount of charbroiled flavor like it was cooked over a coal fire. Yum!

The rice was possibly the best long grain rice I've ever had. So good.

The salad wad tasty too.

Also? The Persian ice cream? It was like ambrosia. I'm not even exaggerating. 

The dinner portion was huge, which left me plenty for dinner tonight, though I must admit that it was difficult not to devour the whole plate on first taste. It was a struggle not to over eat, considering how amazingly yummy it was.

Yeah. I'll be back again, this time with friends!
