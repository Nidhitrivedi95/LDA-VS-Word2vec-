PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ I've been here a couple times and it was decent to good. This time however.. I ordered the chicken curry thali and a few papadums. I got the thali. It was decent, though the salad was more of a bland decoration. 

But where we're the papadums? I asked the waiter once. Later on I asked him again. Later as he was picking up our plates he asked me if I got my papadums. I never did!

I believe this place is known for ok to good food and bad service but how often should one have to ask for papadums. Oh yes, and they tried to charge me for them.
