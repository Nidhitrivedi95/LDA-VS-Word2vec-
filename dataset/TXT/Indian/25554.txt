Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA Luck would have it that I was close enough to Queen West yesterday to make coming down worthwhile, especially because I needed a ticket to the summer BLOWUP which will take place at the Bristol.  Ticket in hand, I decided to stick around for some brunch.

Why did I think, and fear, that the menu had drastically changed since things were located on Christie?

The huge breakfast and many of the other favourites were still around.  And everything on that that huge breakfast plate remains as tasty as ever: mushrooms, tomato, toast, bacon, sausage, etc., etc.  No doubt about it--this is my favourite breakfast in the city.  

My order took a little while so the waitress brought out a bonus black pudding meat pie.  So good!

I liked the old digs but this new location is very spacious and has a full, well stocked bar.

Service was great.

Given what you are getting, $20 for this amazing breakfast plate plus a pint is totally worth it.  They are not opening up a can of Heinz beans or using Sysco back in the kitchen.

Toronto is spoiled for good breakfast and brunch places but the Bristol is worth a trip out of your neighbourhood.  I'm eager to try dinner here soon.
