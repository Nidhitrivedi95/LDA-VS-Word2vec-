kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A I wish I knew about this place before! Its so yummy, doesnt smell at all compared to other south indian places that Ive been to and the prices cant be beat. 

I had the potato bondhas for an appetizer and the mysore masala dosa for a main.......both were awesome! The lassi wasnt up to par, but I dont like mine as think as others do. They had lots of variety in dosas as well.  The service was quick and nice and the restaurant was clean. I would definitely introduce it to others as a nice place to eat. 

There is a free parking garage downstairs which was a big plus!!
