Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Zero stars if I could. The food here was once great and the service. 

The new owner is a con artist. We decided on the restaurant as a cater for our wedding. We had home made food and also Indian. We wanted enough food to feed half the guests. The owner persuade us to pay him to be there during the dinner even though we explained we could have had family help with replenishing food. We paid him the full amount he quoted up front. Long story short the guy demanded an additional grand in CASH at the end of the evening. He said his wife had to run repeatedly to the restaurant to grab more food because there wasn't enough to feed our guests. Of course no one kept tabs on how many dishes and how many times his wife left the venue. 

We didn't understand how he could have added another grand worth of food when he was suppose to only feed half the guests and there were more than enough of the family food. We understood a couple hundred extra but not a grand. And why he demanded cash. 

We tried explaining to him that you can't just decided to bring more and more food and then send a random bill to a client. But him and his wife argued that we are disputing because it is already said and done. I have never know of such a cater in America to pull such a scam. He would not let the argument go so we did end up paying half, $500. Please don't cater from this guy. 

We did do our investigation afterwards and the grocery store owners around the area said he wasn't doing so well and have been looking for someone to purchase the restaurant.  I warn you to not support this guy. Please save yourself some stress and head ache. He is cunning. He use to own the grocery store on the east side and looks like that was working for him so he purchase this restaurant earlier this year. Looks like his cunning ways are catching up to him and this isn't working either. People like that don't last long in business.
