B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Dhaba is my second favorite Indian restaurant around Madison. The first being Swad and the third being Maharani. They have some really good food. The Dal Makhni (Literally lentils and butter) is a must try. It consists of lentils that have been soaked overnight and cooked with butter and spices. They will adjust the spice level depending on your order.

Garlic naan is my best bread. Their garlic is generous and really comes out. It will definitely ward off any vampires that might have strayed too close :) 

On weekends, for lunch, they do a veg and non veg thali. The thali is an Indian version of a sampler. You get small amounts of different items. These guys offer 3 items along with rice and a bread (Roti / naan). For less than $10 it is a steal. When I first saw the thali I felt that the quantity wouldn't be enough to sate me, but I was so wrong. I had to have the additional item I ordered sent back and packed in a to-go box. 

Take cash! They give a 5% discount on lunch prices and a 10% discount on dinner prices if you pay in cash.
