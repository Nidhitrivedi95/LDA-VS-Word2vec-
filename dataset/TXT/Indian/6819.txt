4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw Decent Indian food. I usually order food off of Campusfood.com and Tandoor has one of the best specials available for delivery and whatnot. The food is pretty tasty, however, sometimes the boldness of the flavors and spices fluctuate between orders. Also, the driving service sometime takes a while to deliver the food, so the naan and entrées get cold and less flavorful.
