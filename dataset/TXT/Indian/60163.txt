zlF2RzJYTgZRbzFbhe3zTA The first time I went to this place we ordered only NAAN, we waited while they prepared them so it took about 30 mins. We didnt mind because they were delicious. However, Extremely expensive compared to all other south asian restaurants.

we ordered them again a couple weeks later along with butter chicken, kababs and chicken biryani.

Firstly i want to add, the naan were not fresh and were a little on the raw side. Secondly, the butter chicken was too sweet. Lastly, the kababs cost $13 and we got 2 kababs cut up in 5 pieces. Horrible.

I think all south asians are smart enough to realize how they are ripping off customers and only non south Asians would go there if they do not realize what the norms are.

I think the inconsistency in service and the high prices for mediocre food is the reason me and my husband will not visit again. Too bad, we love indian food and since we live in stouffville its pretty close but id rather drive far to markham then to subject myself to this food.
