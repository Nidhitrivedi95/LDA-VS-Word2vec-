ld0max-y0Uba4gUDC9c4Yg Went to buy Royal Falood and spent $8 dollars. The dish is served in a plate with noodle flavour on it. Instead she gave it like a shake which is not how its served and was completely opposite to the picture on the menu. When asked the manager said that's how it's served and that its not like the picture on the menu. Be cautioned and ask how your item actually looks compared to the menu. Would never buy from here again
