K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g My fiancé and I found this place thanks to a Groupon, otherwise we would have never known about it. I'm not a vegetarian, but the reviews on Yelp were good so I was looking forward to it. To cut to the chase, we both really liked what we had, which was quite a lot of dishes considering we had to order enough to meet our dollar value. 

I really like Indian food, but always order dishes with different meats, etc. This style, I believe is more in line with Southern India cuisine, and was quite different than what I've had before, but doesn't mean it wasn't as tasty. 

What really set the experience apart was the wait staff. We were helped out by two different waiters, each tag-teaming different tables. I really like when waiters offer their opinions on dishes instead of saying "everything's good." We asked what they recommended, they gave us some options, then we asked what they eat and they gave us different choices, which we selected. 

And another good marker, we were one of a small handful of non-Indians there, which is always a good sign for a place like this. 

While I would have loved to have these dishes with little bits of tasty lamb, I still think it was very good and recommend this place highly. We'll be going back.
