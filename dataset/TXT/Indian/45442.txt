ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Yum! I grew up eating Indian food cooked by my aunt (who married a Punjabi man), and to a very small extent, my mom, and have been to India twice. While I'm sure that those of Indian heritage may find some fault as it is not like their mom cooks(ed), this Irish girl LOVES India Garden. I've sampled much on the menu, but come back to my favorites - Chicken Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Aloo Jeera. Their naan and paratha are outstanding as well. The atmosphere is perfect, and the service is very good. Everyone is so friendly. If you are a fan of Indian food and haven't tried India Garden, I suggest checking it out.
