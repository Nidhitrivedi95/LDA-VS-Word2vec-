iX0XUpk34WqHfUuLjPhR9g Ugh, the music was way too loud for conversation--in a room this size, you hardly need a sound system.  It's a cozy living room-sized bar: lots of mismatched chairs and dark walls, a single bartender, some cool drink specials (the Dark and Stormy?  YUM. And the bartender's pretty generous with the liquor).  It's a good place to go with people you don't really need to talk to--don't bring a first date here!
