RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Long story short. The food is awesome to me, while the environment is quite street-style. The experience is quite interested. If my friend doesn't speak so good about it, I probably wouldn't dine in here forever. We had butter chicken and lamb curry with garlic naan. The dishes are so flavourful and rich. We got food coma after this. Both dishes are great, I especially loved my friend's lamb curry. Lol
