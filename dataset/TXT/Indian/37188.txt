o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ Started with a 5 star review but brought it down to 4 ironically for the same reason I dig it. The spice levels are bordering on masochistic. I was waiting for my order one day and noticed an older Indian man insisting that they had too much spice in their non-spicy/regular curry chicken roti. (As if you needed more reason to believe how spicy it is...) Of course I didn't try his roti so who knows right?  

I order the same thing on another visit and yup - still spicy. Would appear there is no escape from spice here. Bottom line. Don't expect to be able to bring you grandparent/parent with the stomach problems unless you want them to get an ulcer. If you yourself have a phobia of stomach ulcers I'm going to recommend that even if you're saaay-- doing construction nearby it wouldn't be wise to go here more than 3 times a week and I hate to say it. Still 4 stars good despite all that...the Samosa's are top notch, worth coming in for those on their own even.

Good eating all!
