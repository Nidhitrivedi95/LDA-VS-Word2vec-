abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg One of the most talented young chefs I've seen in a long time runs this place with her boyfriend taking care of the drinks. 

The menu is simple yet packs a punch and has one of the best Indian fusion cuisines I've come across at a reasonable price point without the usual pretensions of places like Morad of San Francisco. 

Try ordering 2 to 3 dishes per person and share. I can not recommend this place enough.
