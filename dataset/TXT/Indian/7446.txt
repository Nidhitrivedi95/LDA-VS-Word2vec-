5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA Let me preface by saying I've never actually eaten here. HOWEVER, I know the owners, have eaten their homemade food before, and can only imagine the food is the same if not better at the restaurant. 

First off, the owners are easily the nicest people I've met. They remind me of my own parents, friendly, warm, inviting, and all around good people. When you meet them, you instantly feel like you're around family, and that isn't something you can say about everyone. 

Moving onto the meal experiences I've had with them...the naan is to die for. It literally melts in your mouth into delicious goodness. On top of that, I've always had perfectly cooked rice to accompany my curry. Overall, I can only imagine the restaurant to be at the same level of quality, and I hope to make it back there some day to check it out first hand!
