UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw Excellent food, very good south and north Indian dishes. 
The only bad thing is that the service is very poor. The staff is not focused and very immature else I would give a 5 Star review, however the food deserves a 6 Star out of 5. The waiters do not come and ask if we need anything. Even the menu is not provided quickly when you are seated. You have to search for the staff and waive or literally yell at them to get their attention. 

I hope the food quality remains the same and staff quality improves.
