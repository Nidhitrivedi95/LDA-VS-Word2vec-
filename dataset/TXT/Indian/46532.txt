sUGlSS0AF2xPYFEjvKJbSA The owner was so nice! I ordered my food Togo and he recommended the chicken tikka masala. I caved and got it because who can resist. The meal itself comes with a good portion of rice, tikka massala, and dessert. As much as I liked the portions, I wasn't able fully get the explosion of flavor I was looking for. The rice was plain...which i was looking for something more fragrant and the actual tikka was creamy but missing that pop. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. However, you should definitely try the mango smoothie if you go. I'll be back for convenience, but isn't my first choice.
