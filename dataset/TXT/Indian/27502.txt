Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg Hands Down best Indian food in the area. The Owner, Bhim created a menu fusing together deifferent regional plates and cooking variations to create a flavors that are uniquely his yet still authentic to India. Service is quick and friendly. We asked the server for recommendations and had questions about dietary restrictions, and received incredibly knowledgable feedback. The ambiance is cozy and intimate. Whole authentic ingredients are used.  I highly suggest the Chicken Tikka Masala.
