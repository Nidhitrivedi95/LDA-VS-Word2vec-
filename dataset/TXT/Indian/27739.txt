irCBE0vRZ9oQZ26qMR-5HA If you eat south Asian food often don't eat here.. But if you're looking for an exciting change and aren't very familiar with Indian food definitely try it (unless you can't handle spice at all). I eat a lot of spicy food but this was intolerably spicy, I couldn't taste anything and the curry dishes were too watery.. Not a fan!
