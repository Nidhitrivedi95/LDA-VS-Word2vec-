3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ They told us about an offer where you order an entree and get same price entree of same category 50% off. We asked the lady who took order if she can do a mutton and paneer on the offer and she agreed also . Then the   counter guy comes to correct  us that offer can only be on mutton entrees and no veg with intention of charging us full price on both . This is after the bill is ready .We asked him to cancel the item  and take it back as we ordered it to go.

It's safe to say that after 30 minute wait between first food item and next , we did not appreciate the attitude of demanding.Also we do not appreciate saltless chutneys .

So good luck to anyone who wants to give this place a try !
