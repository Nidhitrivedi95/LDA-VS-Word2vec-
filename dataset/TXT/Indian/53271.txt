So many traditional Indian dishes- our favorites like Chicken Makhani and garlic naan plus many others. Our waiter was very friendly and had some good drink recommendations off the cocktail list (it was happy hour pricing at the time). The alcoholic mango lassi was delectable. There aren't many Indian eateries in Scottsdale, but this is probably the best (out of the other 2 that I know of). Not a fancy place. Dress casual. Or buy an Indian-style blouse in the front of the restaurant!
