We had the butter chicken, shrimp bhuna, sag paneer, simosas, onion bhaji, and fantastic gulab jamun for desert. The butter chicken was my favorite, and had one of the best tasting sauces I've ever had in my life. I definitely recommend that one!

Overall it was a fantastic experience, and I really hope this restaurant stays around.
