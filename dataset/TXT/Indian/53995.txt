Vp8Dkam_Hv204Or0hul1NQ Dev is an institution on Victoria, one of the most famous dirty little Indian restaurants that isn't dotting Parc Extension. When you walk in you get a vibe like you're in a community center done up for a Friday night hoedown or something, but it's forgivable because the food is actually pretty good.

All the staples are done properly, although recently I've noticed a slight drift downwards in the size of the takeout containers. Once in a while you'll get a Jalfrezi with a pint of sauce and two little chunks of chicken floating around there, which is always a pissoff, but I guess the point is to fill up on Naan and sauce. 

At least the service is speedy and always with a smile, and they don't wait until you physically show up to start cooking up your takeout (cough *Punjab Palace* cough).
