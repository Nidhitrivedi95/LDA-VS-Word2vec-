DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Food: I have never had food in my life with so much flavor! My mom and I had the 12$ sampler tray, Samosas, and this bread that was similar to Indian fry bread and it was outstanding. I do not think I have ever ate so much in my life. Keep in mind there is NO MEAT at this restaurant.

Service: The service was not all that great I must say, but since the food was so good I just had to give them a 5 star rating. The menu is extremely difficult to understand (and has no picture). If its your first time I highly recommend using the photos on yelp to assist you in ordering because the waitress was not very helpful. 

Location: The location is in a small strip mall and is nothing special. There is a good amount of seating and its generally nice and quite.
