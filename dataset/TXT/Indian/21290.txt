GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I like this place. It's close to campus for a good price and good portion sizes. I like their yummy Chicken Tikka Masala! They give you a good portion sizes. The other dishes were pretty good, samosas were ok, their curry is tasty and the food isn't that spicy. Super love their tikka masala fries. Yeah, I said tikka masala fries! 

They're currently undergoing renovations to make the place a bit bigger and it's needed since it can get busy and full.
