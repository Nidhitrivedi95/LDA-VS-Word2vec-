ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Situated in an old but accessible part of Las Vegas east of The Strip, this restaurant is a short cab ride away from anywhere. Buffet was about twelve dollars plus drink, tax, and tip. Full bar available. Awkward entering the restaurant... the signage is good outside but when you enter it's like they have construction occurring in the foyer. Anyway, the interior is nicely appointed. They spent some money on chairs and tables for sure. The buffet was decently built up with my favorites: lamb curry, sag paneer, tandoori chicken, fresh-cut red onion, and mixed pickle (achaar). In fact, the food (especially the remarkable quality of the achaar) is worthy of recognition. The people running the restaurant seemed to have a skill at doing so: the waitress kept my water glass full and sat me within a decent amount of time, the six other personnel I  witnessed in various capacities seemed motivated, etc.

Why is this review 2 stars? 
A) This restaurant has a documented history failing health inspections, resulting in immediate closure, and
B) When I  went to the restroom... -My-Shoes-Stuck-To-The-Floor-. Let that ruminate for just a second while I  explain the baseboards in the restroom looked like they hadn't been wiped down in decades... And my shoes stuck to the floor. Shoes. Stuck. To the floor. Of the restroom.

It's a pity I  won't be back, I think most people who don't care about American-style cleanliness will enjoy this frustrating experience of a restaurant. Not me. I removed my bookmark. I  have one check in, never to be two.

The floor. Shoes. Stuck!  -Six- people working in this restaurant and !not one of them! Can figure out how to mop the #;;!!!##:#$ bathroom floor?!
