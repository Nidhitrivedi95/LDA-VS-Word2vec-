Their Chana Bhatura is really good, and extremely cheap! If you're looking for a satisfying meal for under 5 dollars, I would highly recommend it. I have also had the butter chicken before when I'm looking for a meat option and have enjoyed it as well. The one downside is that they give you food in paper plates and the owner can be a little stingy when it comes to extra plates/napkins. Overall, great food at great prices!
