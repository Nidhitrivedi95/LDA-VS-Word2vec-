sJ0MYSAIVK28cMzh-s-NPA Food was not bad My issue with this place is the so called daily special It was a Tiesday & I ordered the Chicken Madras which in the menu featuring the specials was 7.49 Beside this menu was the regular menu showing Chicken Madras at 8.85 When I got to the cash I was asked if it was the "regular" or the "special" i asked what the difference was & she explained what the regular comes within addition to the entree Seems to me for the small diffrrence in price the regular should be the special as it seems to come with a lot more for a small difference. To call the dish I took the Special seems very misleading if not in fact dishonest. Like I said the food quality & quantity is not the issue & my dish was probably 3.5 stars
