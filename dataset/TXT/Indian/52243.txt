UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Yummy Indian food! Our first time here 

We came for the lunch buffet, which was a great deal at around $12! There was a lot of variety here, almost too much, as it was hard to tell the differences by a non-seasoned Indian food expert like me  But everything was fresh and good, except the tandoori being a little overcooked.  Here is a pic of my plate :

There were some really good dishes, but I really enjoyed the chicken and mild curry goodies. Also, the garlic naan bread was super yummy! I also liked the more spicy chicken dish, which had peppers and other tidbits. They have plenty of orange slices for my little one, which makes him a very happy boy!  

Come check it for a great and inexpensive Indian food buffet!
