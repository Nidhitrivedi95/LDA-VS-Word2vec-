Southern style Indian food- ALL VEGETARIAN AND VEGAN!!!!

After having a few games of Buckhunt at the Stray Cat (and perhaps a pitcher of Miller High Life...I won't front), my companion and I decided we were hungry. Not wanting to resort to Four Peaks in Tempe for food, he suggested Green restaurant-finally! A Flexatarian (def. someone who enjoys not eating meat at every meal and understands that a person may not eat meat and still like food) who understood my lactose-intolerance wasn't just to be difficult!

So we stopped by Green..and they are closed on Sundays. Damn.

We drive down Scottsdale road, saddened by the rainy Sunday night, and he spots this Indian restaurant. I pictures creamy paneers and chickeny kormas...uh-uh folks. All vegetarian and vegan!

We are welcomed warmly to a full house and realize quickly we are the only white people there (SCORE!). I order us the appetizer sampler-WHICH IS HUGE. I mean, it had four sauces (the cilantro, coconut, tamarind..and some kind of chutney), pakoras, samosas, lentils, etc. We ended up cutting them all in half and taking them home. I had the Dosai with potatos, onions, chutney, peas and spices and loved it. I love tamarind sauce and I think the staff was please I did cause they give me a shitload. He ordered a kind of dosai with cheese in it and it tasted yummy..but eerily like an enchilda. I also convinced him to indulge in the mango lassi (god, I miss those dairy yogurty drinks) and it was tasty-not that sweet and maybe a bit yogurty than necessary, but really cooled down the mouth when had too much of the spicy chutney.

The bathroom was nice, the staff was great, the decor was simply, all the Indian families were happy, I was happy, he was happy, and I had about 100 vegan items to choose from. Why the hell did I wait so long to go here?!? Please check it out!
