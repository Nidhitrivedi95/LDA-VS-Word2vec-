UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ I have eaten here a few times already and feel bad I haven't written a review sooner seeing as I've enjoyed every trip I've made here. I picked up food for the hubbie and I today and it's exquisite like usual. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Samosas, and the Chile Garlic Naan. The flavors and spice are beyond amazing and the portions are huge compared to what you spend. It is truly something special and I feel so lucky to have a family owned establishment in my neighborhood of Laveen. This place is so yummy that even if we moved away I would make the drive to get my fix. Do yourself a favor and stop in and support them so we can keep them in business for many years to come! Remember what you spend in a local business stays local!
