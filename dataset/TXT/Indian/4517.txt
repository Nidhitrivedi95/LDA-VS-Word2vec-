1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg Came for the lunch buffet during November 2011.  Nothing was hot, just luke-warm. The food, while edible, wasn't very good. Surprising, considering it is a prime location. The naan was alright.

The only redeeming dish was the smoked bharta, fresh and well-spiced.

Well, not coming here again.
