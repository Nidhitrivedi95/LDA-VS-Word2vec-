OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g The worst restaurant experience ever!! Everyone was busy with some party in hall. Items after order were not available suddenly. We ordered chicken pizza for kid and only received cheese pizza. The kid took a couple of bites when we told this to our waiter who as ever seemed confused then took the pizza he was eating and put some chicken pieces on top and returned the same pizza rather than replacing the pizza. We ordered Bombay Platter for apps and Tandoori Mushroom on it was uncooked. No chutney was served with anything. Chicken Kathi roll was inedible. Not even once were our water glass were refilled. Nobody just gave a damn. Place is way over priced. They completely spoilt our evening.
