PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ I've seen my share of Indian Buffet (IB) restaurants.  Enough so that my friends all know what "going IB" means.

Most of the time I'm with a bunch of ravenously hungry guys who value a 50/50 split between quality and quantity.  We're the ones who every buffet restaurant loathes to see because of sheer ecological devastation we can bring to those tasty flora and fauna.  There is absolutely no way they make any money off our visits, but I'm sure we're in the minority.

Having said that, the food is really quite decent.  It's not fine dining mind you, but it is decent enough to bring me back, and not just with my hungry-hungry pals.  My wife throughly enjoyed it too.

The selection is quite diverse even at lunch.  I found it difficult to portion control sufficiently to be able to try a large number of dishes.  (It's very difficult as there are many!)

If I'm in the area and hungering for IB, I will most certainly come back to this place...  Heck, even if I'm not in the area I'll make my way here seeing as I'm a glutton.  If my stomach isn't seriously distended at the end of the meal, I'll need to get another few plates.
