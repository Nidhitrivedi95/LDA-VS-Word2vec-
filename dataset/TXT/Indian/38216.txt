OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ We went for dinner buffet yesterday after a long time. The baby corn appetizer was so bad that it  looked like old food . To add to it , Mysore bhajji was horrible . They could have atleast changed the name . Jeera rice , vermicelli trays were empty. Naan wasn't available . Veg biryani looked like it was prepared long back . Wasn't satisfied at all . Bad experience .!
