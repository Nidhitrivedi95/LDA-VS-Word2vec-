It was very good, however I do wish the tikka masala was a little creamier. Food was hot and fresh, service was good. I did have an instance where my server (blonde haired lady) was behind the bar chatting with other servers, looked at me and laughed rudely. I could not hear what was said but it did make me uncomfortable. Another server I believe Indian herself, was on top of her game making sure we had our drinks, plates were taken and had an actual conversation with us to make us feel welcome. I will of course go back because it was so tasty and the ambiance was amazing. I just hope they make everyone feel welcomed.
