LUhVj-r2TtmFx6cyF9ilJg We visited as a large group so they'd set aside a table for us which was grand. We initially decided on individual items to order but then the waitress steered us towards the set menu option which was actually really appealing (if not a little hard to understand). We ended up with a huge selection of dishes and overall I found the food really impressive - fast, fresh and very tasty. 

This place reminded me a little of Babu Bombay Street Kitchen in Glasgow, although obviously it's a restaurant. On that basis, I was a fan and would definitely head back for more of the delicious curries next time I'm through in Edinburgh!
