Vy3geS_HXBY0FQttgdHa4A I have dined in and ordered take out from here multiple times.  The food is ALWAYS delicious and the service is always helpful and friendly.  When dining in, the food is served in styroform, but honestly the food is so good it doesn't matter.  A few times I've called to order take out and they haven't been open (around 3 pm), but I've just waited and called back around 5 pm and they've been open.  The menu is also very vegetarian friendly.  I love baingan bharta with a side of saffron rice pilaf.  The naan it comes with is incredible too, very fresh.
