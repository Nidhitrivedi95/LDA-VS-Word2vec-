1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh right now. The food is delicious. You feel like you're eating food cooked at someone's house and not mass produced in a restaurant.

The momos are excellent. I'm just really glad that I found a restaurant where they serve delicious momos in Pittsburgh. I've been to Subba twice and one of the times I just ordered a plate of momos as my main course (they're listed as starters).

Which brings me to the price. Everything is really cheap and the quantity is huge (not to mention delicious!). The restaurant itself is in an older building and the entrance makes it look like a hole in the wall, but don't be fooled by that! I've been recommending this place to every person I've met since and I've been there twice in a week even though it's a bit of a drive from where I live.
