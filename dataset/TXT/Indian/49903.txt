U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg I went here a few days ago looking for some delicious Chana and was not disappointed. How had I never heard of this place before?  I had the Chana Roti with samosas and they did not disappoint. The gentleman at the counter asked how spicy I wanted it and warned me that medium is actually quite spicy, so I opted for mild instead.   I arrived around the dinner hour but the service was still prompt and friendly. I found the portions to be fairly large so you definitely are getting your money's worth!
Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to satisfy their cravings for delicious Indian food. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. I will be back to try some of their other menu options.
