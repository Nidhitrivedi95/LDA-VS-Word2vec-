x-4YTxRXrNaW6Rua2j-7wA Punjab Palace it absolutely the best bang-for-buck ratio possible, and having said that you don't sacrifice on quality, taste, or authenticity either. This place does biryani like nobody's business, the portions are huge but you won't be choking for air when you get the bill. Believe it or not, two can eat here (and I meat EAT, like you may have to unbotton whilst leaving the resto) for $25 tip in. 

The waiters are attentive, but good family-style service aside, their food is absolutely delicious, I can't honestly say I haven't enjoyed every single thing I've had, and I've pretty much done the menu. But then again, this is food you will respect in the morning! It's spicy in all the right places, and the fact that you can bring your own wine (for free, some of us Montrealers take this for granted!), and works well with large groups too. 

Their (classic) butter chicken is worth it alone. I am a butter chicken snob and this one fits the bill. Garlic naan is a must. And the point about reserving ahead is valid, but if you happen to drop by unannounced and they can't accomodate, there are at least 2 acceptable places in the immediate vacinity that will feed you. But this one is definetely worth the wait if there is one. 

Note to the reader! I'm a HUGE fan of all things Indian so this doesn't really bother me, but just in case you're sensitive to these types of things... this resto doesn't have the best ventillation and the wafts of kitchen air spill freely into the dining room. Prepare by wearing something that you can easily clean after. And I mean this with the most respect, but they could definitely invest in some better fans. But all that to say no matter what, this place is worth it. Hands down, the best Indian in Montreal.
