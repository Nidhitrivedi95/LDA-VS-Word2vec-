V_jIfMz9Z7a5mthleRq0_w A new indian option uptown. The way I see it, anything's better than the place in the Latta Arcade. I welcome you with open arms. Cheap prices, friendly service with a smile and decent food. 

Minimalist interior, I mean seriously. No decor, it just a straight up take out restaurant. No decor = low overhead. Yay for me.
