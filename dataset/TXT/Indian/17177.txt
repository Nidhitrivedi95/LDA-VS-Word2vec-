DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew My lovely wife and I spotted this place driving through on errand day. We stopped in and peeked at the menu and dining room and were intrigued. Later that day we Yelped it and checked out some of the photos. We were hooked in and returned this evening for dinner. We ordered the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and the lamb biryani at a medium level spice for both meat dishes. Each dish was equally delicious, well prepared and generous in portions. We are small eaters and have enough leftovers for two more meals for the two of us. We'd definitely encourage Las Vegas natives and visitors alike to try this place out and soon!  They just opened three weeks ago and we personally think they should be very successful. We will definitely be back to try the saag and the rogan josh.
