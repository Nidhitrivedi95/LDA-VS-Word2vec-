prFx0Kg92PfPkoU8OY4KxA Fantastic lunch buffet! I particularly liked the Chili Chicken they had today, as well as the chicken tiki masala. They also had this really good mango dessert type drink that came with the buffet that was quite tasty.

Staff was very kind and came by multiple times offering more bread and refills.

This will be a favorite lunch spot for the foreseeable future!
