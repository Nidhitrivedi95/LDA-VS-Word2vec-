2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Busy take-out place, very cheap samosas, lots of variety to choose, lunch special, desserts, everything you want at one place. I'm not indian so don't know how is the authenticity but i saw a lot of indians customers which is usually a good sign. I tried chicken tikka, curry, rice, and the desserts. Very salty food, and very sweet desserts. Kidney, diabetes patients visit less is better. Solid 4/5
