sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Pretty delicious. I'm more familiar with Mother India, their sister restaurant, but this was very delicious as well. I would say that I liked Mother India slightly better, but I can't say why exactly as they are very similar.

More for takeout, than sit down, though they do have a few tables.
