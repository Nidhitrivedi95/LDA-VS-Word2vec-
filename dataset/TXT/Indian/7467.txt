5qAnki509wBtMeabE3jUHA I love this restaurant. It's wonderful on so many levels. The location is a beautiful drive that takes you through some lush green fields if you're driving from mason. It's a family owned restaurant where the recipes are mom and pop perfected over years of being in the business. So needless to say, crazy high nom factor. And the gentleman running the place is super friendly so you get to hear some nice stories and experiences from his life in the south and the Midwest...the lunch buffet and dinner both are a win. Fresh and authentic from scratch. Unbeatable taste!
