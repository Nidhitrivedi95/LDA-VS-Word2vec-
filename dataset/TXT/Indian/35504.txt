Very little in the way of decor has changed.  Its still has the Joey's tables.

So I brought my six year old daughter here for dinner on a Saturday evening.  As most people have noted the restaurant is really geared up for a takeout business.  

One of the first misnomers on the menu is it says that they have burgers.  My daughter was all over that - wanting a burger.  However appearances can be deceiving and they really just put a kebab in a burger bun, and bury it under a sea of mayonnaise.  My daughter described it as disgusting.  I tried it and it was rather bland, compared to kebabs I have had elsewhere.  The horde of Mayo was too much though.  I think that even Burger King uses less mayo.  She's not as heavily into Indian-esque food as I am.  Please don't call one food something when it really isn't.

I had the Beef Paya.  I had wanted the lamb, but the girl was saying that since it was Ramadan they weren't serving lamb.  The beef was served with Naan.  Two things I didn't like was the sea of oil that the beef was swimming in, and that the Naan had been buttered.  The beef tasted good, and like most Pakistani food, it was as hot as a volcano in July.

On to the washroom.  To put it kindly it was dark and dirty.  There was no toilet paper, and even the supply cupboard in the washroom didn't have any so we used paper towels instead.
