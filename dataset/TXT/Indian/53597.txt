vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w Final try.  Ordered food for pick up.  Waited, messed up my order with another persons.  Lucky him got his food.  Waited. One, two, three plus customers after...waiting.  Watch stuff get served with bare hands (saw this happen before but I can overlook that kinda thing when you leave quickly).  Waiting...saw kids go into the kitchen coming out with food in their hands, no fish nets no gloves several people in and out.  Leave no food.  This place has been fined many times over, I stopped ordering for a long time.  We tried again, I try to not look at the mess or the fact that I constantly wait for food that's been ordered.  No more.
