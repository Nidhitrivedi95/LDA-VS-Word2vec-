xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Wednesday is the time to be at Leela's! There are a lot of specials available, and the serving sizes are generous. I ordered the bone in goat roti ($3.99) and my friend got the jerk chicken platter ($10 I think), they ask if you would like peas and hot sauce in the roti, but beware, the hot sauce is intense. I would recommend getting it on the side and adding it in as you go, similarly for the jerk chicken. 
The roti was a bout the size of a large fist, and had large pieces of goat inside (the bone was kind of annoying though), I could have loved to polish off 2-3 of these, I want to try the chicken and potatoes ones next. 
I stole some jerk chicken from my friend too, I personally thought it was average at best, but my friend has been in love with it for the longest time. 

Good place for a cheap but filling meal, will go back soon!
