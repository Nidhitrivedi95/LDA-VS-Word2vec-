htK8VGscVVAiOGnsaZFNsQ Looking for delicious Indian food in Edinburgh, Scotland then please stop by Kasturi restaurant. You will not be disappointed. 

They have an affordable lunch special going for 8 pounds including an appetizer, main course and dessert. In case you are a vegetarian then this is the perfect place for you.

Considering there were so many different choices on the menu, I decided to be a bit adventurous this time around.
 
For appetizers, I had fried eggplants served with fresh salad! Now for the main course, they had lots of vegetable dishes as well as chicken tikka and curry lamb. They also served a basket of crispy nan and a bowl of pilaf rice.

Yummy!!!! Their serving portion was filling! 

If you are too full for their yummy chocolate or vanilla ice cream then substitute with a cup of hot tea or coffee.

Overall, Kasturi is a classy and relaxing environment. The staff is wonderful!
