OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg Good food, good serivce.  We ordered butter chicken(3 orders), chicken tikkah masala, jasmine rice(1 order easily serves 2), basmati rice(again 1 order easily serves 2 people) , a veggie dish (cannot remember the name), we had a bottle of white wine, a glass of red, an order of naan, and an order of pakoras....there was 5 of us and it cost us $200 (including tip).
The pakoras were good but a little heavy and greasy.  Shere Punjab on the Danforth has the best pakoras, in my opinion....light and fluffy, never greasy.
Overall, a nice dining experience, did not feel rushed...would go back.
