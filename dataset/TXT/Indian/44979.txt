S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA Great service and great food! Everyone working stopped by several times. People don't sweeten the tea around these parts (coming from the mid west region that was different for me) but the food was amazing. Portions were hearty. You even have options on how spicy you want your food. Overall a good find.
