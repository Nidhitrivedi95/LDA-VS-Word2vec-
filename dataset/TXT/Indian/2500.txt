02EYqwh47uVxOaOKrnx8SQ I can't cook (and don't want to learn), so I lean pretty heavily on Indian Delhi Palace.  It's my go-to Indian place - consistent and fairly priced.  Sure, maybe every dish is not the best version of it I've ever had, but there are standouts.  The butter chicken is excellent, and I think their palak paneer is the best in the Valley.
