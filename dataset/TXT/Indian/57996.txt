yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Looking for gluten free restaurants that deliver, found this place on grubhub and they listed gluten free and vegetarian menu items right there in the grubhub app.  

I did call ahead to verify a couple items and the gentleman who answered the phone was very nice and informative. 

So I ordered the cornmeal rhoti and a chicken meal with jasmine rice.   Food was great if not a bit mild for my taste but great flavor.  The cornmeal rhoti was surprisingly tasty.  

My new favorite place when I'm down in this area of Tempe.
