IUTU_8qM7M8j9A1TbmMjYA Coming from a Persian/Iranian guy, the food here is very exceptional. The grapeleaf and hummus is a must as appetizers. The kobideh or lamb kabob is where it's at.. they cooked the basmanti rice to perfection, the meat is marinated and cooked well. Get the yogurt sauce with your entree, amazing.
