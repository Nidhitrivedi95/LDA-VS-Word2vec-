Came here for summerlicious with a group of coworkers. We set reservations for 10 and was greeted immediately upon entry. The place is a bit small but there are 3 floors so in total, there's quite a bit of seating! Lots of windows, great lighting. Ambience was perfect. 

It was my first time having Indian cuisine so of course, I went for the butter chicken. It was great! The naan and the chicken were great. The rice and the yellow side dish was a bit spicy for my tasting but nonetheless, great. 

Wonderful experience!
