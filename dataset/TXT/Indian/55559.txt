x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag If you are craving hakka Chinese. This place is it. Delicious food and perfect blend of spices. We ordered tom yum soup which was tasty and spicy. We also got sweet and sour chicken, beef chilli, chicken 88, chowmein and chopsuey. Chopsuey and sweet and sour chicken were my favorite. In soup I love the hot and sour and hubby loves the chicken corn soup. Over all a great experience.
