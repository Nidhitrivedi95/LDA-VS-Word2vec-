cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw You have to consider this place in the context of its main clientele, working / middle class Pakistani families. And as far as I could tell, they love this place. There are few places in Mississauga that have a 30min wait time on a Monday at 10pm for dinner. Also when Pakistani people go to eat bbq in Pakistan, things like table service and clean plates and health code compliance are not really things that exist in a meaningful way. So this place by comparison is amazing.

If you go, expect a lot of crying babies being comforted by there mothers or mothers who don't give a shit and are done comforting there babies. Large families, in mean like 20 people taking over large parts of the restaurant, people on interracial dates, and families taking visiting  grandparents out for dinner

The food is basic Pakistani BBQ, and it's not the best in the world but it's very likely some of the best in town. It would have to be, as Pakistani people do not tolerate bad food on a family night out. 

We had the Kat-a-Kat, seekh kabob, tikka and Bihari kabob, all where good. the tikka was a little dry but that's pretty had to get right. 

All in all it's an entirely authentic experience, not the only possible authentic experience but one of them. If you don't like this place maybe try Lahore tikka house on Gerard it's not much better or much worse.
