For the food, the butter chicken is the best while the vegetable (fried rice) tasted weird and somewhat hard. The others like the naan bread was too soft and didn't really compliment the curry so much as what I tasted in other restaurants.

For a $15 (plus tax) buffet, it's somewhat a rip off considering there are a ton of other buffets around this place.
