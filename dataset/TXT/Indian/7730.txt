6aDfalYZOkWzwtVRA2wYaA Does it have two front doors, one of which doesn't work? yes that is true.
Does it have a slightly less than clean feel in the eating area? yes, that is also true.
Is the ordering process smooth and staff helpful? Not so much. 
Should you ignore those points and try some of the best Indian food in the valley? YES.

The food was excellent.  The Chicken Tikka Masala was excellent, just spicy enough without being overbearing.  We also had the Dal-Lentil which was very spicy, and quite delicious.  The Naan was some of the best I have ever had.  

Huge portions and not too expensive with a setting that can only be described as adventurous.  

I say its worth it.
