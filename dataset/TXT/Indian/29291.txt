JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ EXTRAMLY pricy indian restaurant I have ever seen in the Charlotte area. For regular entrees cost over 17 dollars like malai kofta,  paneer dishes etc. SAMBHAR is so watery and lack of taste. NAAN also very pricy.

I would better go somewhere well else and eat same taste and dishes less pricy. Money and food not worthy.
