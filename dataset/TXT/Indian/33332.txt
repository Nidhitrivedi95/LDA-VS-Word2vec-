llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g We love Indian food and have had it many times. I normally steer away from a lunch buffett, but we decided to give it a try. 9.99 per person without a drink. Everything we had was super fresh. The Buffett is open until 3 pm and we arrived at 1:30. Often the food has been sitting out under a heating lamp. Not at all the story here. Several times we saw new fresh food brought out. They had all of the classic favorites such as chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, lentils, lamb meatballs, vegetable korma, tandoori chicken, etc. some of the best we have ever had. Even the naan was excellent, fresh out of the oven and perfect. The cilantro chutney was delicious too! 

Service was friendly and very attentive!

The place was very full for a Saturday afternoon at 1:30. I was a bit surprised, but we were in and out in 45 minutes and super full. 

Now some of the chairs were a bit worn, a few scratches on the walls, but we love mom and pop places that serve great food. They have definitely tried to decorate it nicely, very clean. 

Highly recommend!!
