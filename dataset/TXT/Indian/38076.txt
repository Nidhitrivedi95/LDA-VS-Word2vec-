ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw this place is just ok, i've given it two chances and still have not been impressed.  the first time i went my friend asked for chicken curry and the chef made it for her even though it was not on the menu. the shrimp/garlic dish is tasty as well as the lentil side dish but nothing on the menu is worth the high prices! thumbs up also for the mango martini. the second time i went the menu layout had changed and some of the items.  the "platter" we ordered was hardly a platter at all. maybe it's cuz i dont know what to order but i like to get my money's worth and will probably stick to buffet type places from now on. the ambiance is nice and i love the candles, but this is more of a snack/drink type place then meal place for me.
