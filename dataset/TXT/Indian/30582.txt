kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw Stopped here for the first time today, and I'll definitely be back! I enjoyed the Green Envy Curry very much. The carnivore in me thought it could have had a little more meat (though the chicken was very good). However, the veggies were fantastic! No semblance of previously frozen, uniform vegetables here! The whole dish was really great - nice and spicy! When I ordered, I didn't get asked about spice level, but I'm guessing you could ask for more or less? Attractive presentation; it seemed less heavy on the rice (which I guess is a good thing). Nice place, great food, quick service, and very affordable. Yep, I'll be back!
