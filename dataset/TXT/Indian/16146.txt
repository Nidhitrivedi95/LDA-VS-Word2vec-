Dd1w7xR7Xs3bthwusgy33Q The deli is tucked inside of Lotus Market - a small Indian super market. There is plenty of seating, though I rarely see anyone eating there around lunch time. They have a variety of curries available along with a range of other wraps and treats. In the past I've ordered one of their wraps which came filled with a blue/green sauce that both tasted and looked like a very artificial "mint" chutney. This time I tried the Combo Thali, which comes with a curry of your choice, soup, jasmine rice, and bread. The flavor was just okay, but nothing like my favorite Indian eatery (Ruchi).
