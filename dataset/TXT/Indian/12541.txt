AY4WY_rfrQum3Ad_ohNhVw After reading the reviews here, I went there over the Good Friday weekend to buy two dozens of samosas for a friend's lunch party. The store was crowded  with people lining up to order or to wait for their order to be ready. After about 15 minutes wait, the lady (a middle age person) announced that my order was ready, her holding two small paper bags, each filled with 12 samosas and two styrofoam containers of sauce. I asked her for a plastic bag to safely hold the two paper bags with the samosas. Apparently she wasn't pleased with my request since she grabbed a plastic bag, handed it to me, walked away, leaving me to gingerly bag the samosas hoping I don't drop them. 

I asked my friends what they thought of the samosas. They thought the samosas were  oily (perhaps still dripping with oil since they were recently fried) , typical taste of curry with potatoes, vegetable and meat, all in all -  nothing special. Apparently one can buy frozen samosas from any large Asian supermarkets which taste  just as nice, cost so much less, and which one can bake in the oven for a more healthy treat.
