skKvWc8KwSAhj5Zf_pe7Dg I had dinner with few friends of mine and I was very disappointed overall with  food,  service and mediocre decor. The menu sounded too good to be true!! We each ordered a thali (full dinner plate) and one entree (which they forgot to serve). The food was presented well but was cold, tasteless and tasted like left over's!! The Mango Lassi we had was terrible, just milk and sugar, we complained but the staff did not care or seemed to pay attention. The service was sporadic and slow. The waiters were confused and were not well informed about the menu.
