When we walked in, we had our doubts.  The restaurant is pretty big, and the decor is very nice.  But it was 7:30PM and the place was literally empty.  Not one other customer.  Normally, this would have turned us off, but we decided to give it a try because of the good reviews on Yelp.  We were not disappointed.  My Butter Chicken was not the best I've ever had, but it was delicious with the perfect amount of spice.  My nephew said that his Tikka Masala was the best he's ever had.  He lives in Vegas and commented that he has a new "go to place" for Indian.  Our vegetable samosa's were very nice as well, but the reason I have to give five stars is because of the Chicken Pakora's.  They had the perfect amount of breading in comparison to the chicken.  The outside was just crispy enough, and the chicken on the inside was moist, tender, and juicy.  They were without a doubt the best pakora's I've ever had, and I've been to Indian restaurants all over the world.  The service was very friendly, and quick (granted, we were the only ones in the restaurant), and the prices were surprisingly reasonable.  Give Delhi Indian Cuisine a try if you are in Vegas and want a fantastic Indian meal.  You will not be disappointed!
