g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ Thought I would try this given its proximity to Bombay Street Food and I wanted to compare places. Bombay street Food wins hands down. 
Visited at 1pm and the place was very messy with dirty plates piled up at the counter and no one greeted me (having just opened a few weeks ago, client service sucked!). I dug up a menu from the counter and ordered the Kathi Roll. I didn't even get asked if it was chicken or paneer server just assumed chicken. I asked for water and my total bill was $14.70!!! I was handed the credit machine and said I was paying cash! 
The food came quickly and hot, the portion was TINY given the price, but I did get a handful of potatoe chips that were obviously from a bag. The roll fell apart but the taste left me the most disappointed, it was overly salty. 
The highlight of my meal, I scored a complimentary gulab jaman. 
I will not return!! Another Indian pop-up where the staff lack client service skills and are banking on the food concept to succeed. There are many other options for Indian food, give them a try instead.
