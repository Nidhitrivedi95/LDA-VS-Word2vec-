-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g I happened to be in the neighborhood last night (1-14-2016) and was driving past when I noticed Nandini. I really enjoy Indian food, so I decided to stop in and give it a try. Best decision possible!!!

I have lived overseas and have tasted authentic food from many different regions. I must admit, this is the best Indian food I have had in the US! No kidding! I had the Chicken Tikka, spicy (of course ^,^)... Unbelievable! Also, the nan was amazing! 

If you happen to be in the area and are a lover of authentic cuisine, give this place a go! Absolutely worth it! Albeit, a bit pricey by the end. Worth it ^,^
