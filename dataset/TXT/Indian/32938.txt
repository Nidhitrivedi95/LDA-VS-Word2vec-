llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Ordered to-go dinner from here last week. The taste was great! Service was good. We ordered cut mirchi - which was okay, chicken Manchuria which my friend loved, kadai paneer which was yummm, veg biryani which was also good but I asked him to make it medium spicy and it peaked to super spicy for my spice levels (though being an Indian!) and chicken biryani which again my friend loved. 
A good place on the whole. It's a tad bit expensive but good for once in a while.

4 stars for the food.
3 for the price


And they gave us free gulab jamun (which tasted meh... But who cares it's free!)
