9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w We arrived Mothersday Lunch on a Sunday 1 pm opening, 2hosts at the door, no greeting just do you have a reservation, then pointed to the ones with reservations, but we felt kinda insulted with no greeting,  entrance has limited waiting area, numerous tables with 4 seats . Menus were given as water glass followed tables did not have cutlery at first,were brought shortly after, tables had cloth settings with brown paper as an additional cover, after waving the server we gave our orders-
Pani Puri as an app
4 samosas with house Tamarind sauce was very good
Main dish- two Non veggie Thali
We chose beef as our choice
Menu is in my pictures, as well as food photos
Drink-mango Lassi
In all food was good, nothing memorable great for once a try, but will be coming to try other stuff just may not get the thali.
Did not like service after the food, they forgot about us, we need water refills, and cutlery and napkins but as we finished no one came to give us the bill we walked to the person on cash, a man with turban who seemed to be the owner. Very little greeting or acknowledgement except bill/charge/ receipt . Fix service pls be attentive.
