tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I've been here a handful of times, usually for dinner but today I went for lunch.  I expected the lunch buffet to be inexpensive because the dinner buffet is only $9.99 (what what?! yes, please!), but the lunch buffet is $8.99 (not as exciting, boo).

Nevertheless, the food is always delicious, the service always fantastic, and it's one of my fave Indian places I've been to.  

Will probably stick to the dinner buffet though because I'm not that keen on spending $14 on lunch (for buffet, Diet Coke & tip) and then being way-too-full the rest of the day because I couldn't stop eating all the deliciousness.
