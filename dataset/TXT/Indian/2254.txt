_n5gPknmF6_WBrFngFb21w Be prepared to go back hungry! If you are in an adventerous  mood to try your luck on wether you will be served or not, this is the place to visit. The staff is terribly underprepared to take on orders and serve customers. We arrived as a group of 5 and were crammed into a 4 seater saying that the larger table available is meant to seat 8. We placed our orders including a masala dosa that I ordered. Some on our group got lucky and landed their meal! After half an hour of waiting we reminder our server that part of our order still hasn't arrived and were told that it is on it's way.  15 minutes later we checked again and still no food. They did however manage to serve a couple other tables at this time. We waited another 5 minutes and  decided to give up and cancelled our remaining order.  Well I guess the one star is all I can award since I was never really served to start with! On a lighter note, maybe this is a sign to cut down on calories ;)
