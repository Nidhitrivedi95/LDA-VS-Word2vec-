4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Generally mediocre Indian food albeit the incredible variety of options and ethnic flares. Honestly, everything starts to taste the same after a couple of bites especially the different curries. One side has the veg options and the other has non-veg but our friends who had the non-veg said they weren't anything incredible. They also make Jain curries!!! Major ups. We went on the 4th of July which wasn't a big holiday in canada, so the restaurant was fairly empty, but service was still kind of slow for the amount of patrons that were in house (~20 ppl total??). Check out their pani puri though and make sure to add some garam masala, which is next to the puris, since the water was a little too sweet for my taste. 

For what it's worth though, I would definitely come back for the speciality drinks which were UNREAL. We each got a separate mockjito (pineapple, strawberry, raspberry, and watermelon) and they were fresh, brisk, cold, big, and garnished w mint. Each of them had a spicy tinge in them (chaat masala?! Brilliant) and I could totally see myself coming back to drink all of them again. 

Cost was not worth the quality and I'm not sure how I feel about Indian food items as a buffet style cuisine since Indian food is best when it's freshly cooked a la carte. Regardless, tbh if this comes to the states (esp ny/nj area) it would be v successful.
