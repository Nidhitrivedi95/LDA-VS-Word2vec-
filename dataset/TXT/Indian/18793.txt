epb_jKqFvo34MoozEM3Qsg Let's say: 3.5 for me.

Since the place is so close to my apartment and it got positive review, I decided to go their to check it out.

I had a chick pea and potato (chinna?) roti and two vege samosas for $13 including tax. The roti was big and the taste was great. Samosa was hot and clispy. I enjoyed both of them very much.

Interior of the restaurant was quite simple and tiny. Probably I'll never eat there, but take out because I love to try other rotis in the future.
