RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg If not the Queen City's classiest, Blue Taj is without question one of the city's hippest Indian eateries to date. Its coolly lit, swanky-modern interior but echoes the style and panache associated with Ballantyne Village, in which the restaurant resides.

For some, prices may be BT's Achilles' heel. A dining experience smooth and polished as the restaurant offers justifies comparatively premium costs, but whether or not menu items admittedly simple in nature like their 'Masala-Chili Cauliflower Florets' or 'Mustard Tawa Lamb' need require a $5 or $9 decrease in one's wallet, respectively, is understandably debatable.

It must be affirmed, however, that food taste and quality are consistently outstanding. Though non-appetizers offered below $10 are virtually non-existent, both lunch and dinner menu selections are more than substantial [despite opposing reviews]. Looking past the $13-20+ price range, nothing disappoints... each and every dish utilizes a considerably more robust complex of ingredients compared to those presented by competing Indian restaurants. Moreover, portion sizes are satisfactory.

One aspect worth highlighting is BT's selection of drinks and cocktails. Prices are expectedly high, yet the sheer uniqueness of each drink due to its fusion of traditional Indian herbs and spices far outweighs any initial pangs. Execution has always been flawless, and said reason is why I've swiped too many a card on alcohol alone.

FYI -- (1) the restaurant's front door is situated "within" the shopping complex's ground floor... NOT INSIDE, just not on an exterior wall that's visibly seen from the street/parking lot; (2) if there's a wait, fancy cozying yourself up at the bar located to the left upon entering; (3) SUNDAY BUFFET for $30; (4) first-timers beware Ballantyne Village's ever full parking lot at any hour past 4 PM... if need be, a garage is available.
