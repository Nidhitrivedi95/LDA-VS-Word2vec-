J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Came here for a lunch buffet on Thursday with a party of twelve people.  The restaurant is pretty spacious and have two sections for dining.  The food was delicious - moderate selections of vegetarian and meat dishes.  The meat dishes were only chicken - pakora chicken, tandoori chicken and butter chicken.  Veggies consist of lentil, chick peas, spring rolls, veggie pakora and spinach. Too bad they didn't have aloo gobi cause that's my favorite veggie dish!  They have a selection of salad, fruits and desserts.  As well as four flavours of ice cream (mango, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry)
