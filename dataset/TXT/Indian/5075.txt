2tuBMS03CGYV82gH1oq-kw I visit Brampton often and have been to the Khana Sutra a few times during weekdays for both lunch and dinner. I have also gotten dishes for takeout. It is a very clean and tastefully designed restaurant. Each time I was there the service was great. The staff were kind, caring and knowledgeable about their dishes, helping us pick our dishes with great recommendations.   For lunch, I have tried their lunch special non-vegetarian platter. It was tasty but since I eat a lot, I still felt hungry when I was finished my dishes. However, I asked for more rice, Dal and chicken curry and they provided me with more without a charge. For dinner, the appetizer we ordered was Bhuta Makaii. It was truly special. For the main course, we tried Paanch Mirchi Ka Paneer aand Ghosht Shehnai and a chicken dish from Tandoor. All were great but for me Ghosht Shehnai was out of this world. If you are non-vegetarian be sure to try Ghosht Shehnai.

For most dishes you have to order rice, naan or Roti separately. As such, the overall cost of the dinning in my opinion would become a bit pricey.
