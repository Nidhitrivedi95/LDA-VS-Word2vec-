S-lTS8UX34-Z7G1uYjVzvw Great night out on the Royal Mile, the staff here are the stars of the show but the food isn't bad either. As you would expect on the Edinburgh Royal Mile it was a little more expensive than an equivalent quality restaurant elsewhere. 
The staff are the stars because they provide a relaxed and friendly atmosphere for your meal, very attentive but not at all overbearing. The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.
My only word of caution I found is to visitors to Edinburgh in general, when they say hot up here they don't just mean hot they mean very very hot indeed.
