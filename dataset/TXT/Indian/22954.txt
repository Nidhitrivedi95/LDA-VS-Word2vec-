gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Went back after last being in Las Vegas a few years ago and discovering this place. I didn't remember the name so we just went to the one with the highest yelp ratings and we were so excited to see we had hit it!Great mango lassis, seems like everyone in the restaurant was drinking them! And the staff is very friendly! Food excellent. We wanted to come back the next day for the buffet but we had so much leftovers we made our own buffet in our room!
