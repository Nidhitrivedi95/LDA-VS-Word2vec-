Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw If you had asked me about this place a few years ago I would have had a much higher rating. I used to dine in here a lot and it was always excellent. Recently though I have had some not so great experiences. 

I keep coming back because of their Madrasi Chicken dish. Its the only place I can find it and it is delicious with its coconut curry tasting chicken, ahh, its so good with their rice. But everything else has seemed to decline in quality recently. I'm finding more of the chicken is dark meat and in strange pieces. I'm not a fan of dark meat and think it looks gross and cheap. Everything had become way more oily than I remember. My chicken sag just left so much oil on the plate I was really disappointed. Dishes are still tasty just not as amazing as I remember. 

My biggest issue has been the service recently. The service used to be on it! They were clean professional, and everything was perfect. Last time I had to repeat my order 4 or 5 times over the phone until I thought they finally understood what I was saying. When I came to pick it up the order was wrong. When I asked them to correct it they seemed annoyed. It seemed like everyone was running around asking for dishes; they seemed rushed and unorganized. They did offer me the correct dish for free which made up for the mistake. Another time after the takeout order we were dining in. I pointed to my selection on the menu just to be crystal clear. I was still served the wrong dish. Having this happen two times in a row really put me off. 

I feel like these kinds of things didn't used to happen a few years ago. The food was better quality and the service was outstanding. I cant say either of those two things about it now. I'm only coming back for their madrasi chicken for now. For my other Indian food nights, I am going elsewhere.
