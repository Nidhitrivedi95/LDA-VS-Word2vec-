DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Have tried their buffet lunch a few times. Just tried it today. Soft n crunchy Vadas, perfect masala dosa and one of the best gulab jamuns I have had in a looong time. Parathas needed a little more work but were ok otherwise. 

Special mention - mutter paneer. Just the right amount of spices with the paneer sautéed separately before being tossed in ( are the other Indian restaurants listening??? ) . 

Please remember the menu changes daily and speaking from past experience, the food taste might vary a lot!! Will update this review again when I visit again. 

Also wanted to mention the fast service!
