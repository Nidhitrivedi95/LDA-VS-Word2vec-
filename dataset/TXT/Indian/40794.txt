pX7ftE5CySOa-5cpuJl_ZA I love chicken tikka masala and the chicken tikka masala here is great!  This place has a hint of Indian fusion with paneer in puff pastry. 

I took my three year old here and there were loads of other kids eating dinner.  My son loved the food and he's never had Indian food before.
