The Fry Bread House is an unpretentious spot serving fry bread, burritos, tamales, and various other items.

I use to be a huge fan of the Fry Bread House.  However, lately the food has been somewhat disappointing. My lunch group and I were looking for a spot to grab a quick bite to eat. After noticing that the parking lot at the Fry Bread House was  full we decided to give it another shot. After all with that many cars in the parking lot the food had to be good.

 However, our lunch was a disaster. The Fry Bread we ordered was soggy, greasy, and lacked any real flavor . My lunch companion ordered green chili and it ended up being the worst green chili she had ever received - and that was after sending it back because the original order was wrong. 

My other lunch companion had the red chili fry bread, he said it was okay, but nothing special. I would recommend trying somewhere else.
