YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try!  Food was fantastic.  Not to spicy and fresh ingredients.  My friend and I split everything so we ordered:
-meat samosas as an app 
-tandoori platter
-dal
-garlic naan
-basmati rice
Over all it was great but the portion sizes could have been a bit bigger. Wine list is limited and pricy.  Service was very attentive.  The chef even came over and asked how everything was.  I would definitely go back.
