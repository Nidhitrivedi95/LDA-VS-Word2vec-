v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug I just returned from having lunch here with a group of several friends.  One of my friends suggested Coriander, so given that I'm always down for Indian buffet for lunch and that I hadn't tried it before, I decided to try it out with them.  Unfortunately, the value and quality of the buffet were lacking in comparison to other Indian buffets I've tried around town.

The buffet consisted of the usual array of options, of which I sampled the following: chicken tikka masala, mango chicken, tandoori chicken, samosas, saag paneer, chick peas, rice, and naan.  If I were to use one word to describe all of them, it would be flavorless.  Most of them lacked any spice whatsoever, which was disappointing given that I enjoy Indian cuisine for its complexity in flavor, much of which is contributed by spices.  The one exception was the samosa, which I found unusually overseasoned, yet still inexplicably lacking in flavor.  In terms of temperature, all of the food was at room temperature, except for the gulab jamun, oddly--which is one of the few items that should be served at room temperature.

Given that I was underwhelmed with the quality of the buffet, I only took one plate of food.  When I went to pay, the price ($11.75) came as a bit of a shock, given that Prince of India in Oakland offers a comparable quality lunch buffet for $10 ($9 w/ ID discount).  While I feel kind of bad writing a negative review given that Coriander has sentimental value for my friend who suggested it, it just doesn't measure up to the quality of several Indian restaurants in Oakland alone, let alone the rest of PGH.  2.5 stars.
