PyTHy9VPOhBCiGLsi-PA2Q We were directed to a table, but then we were left without any menus nor clue as to whether or not we were expected to be only eating from the buffet. My friend was distressed about it so I walked up to someone & asked if my friend could order from the menu (she didn't want the full expense of the $9 buffet as she wasn't so hungry, it was mostly me that was hungry). The buffet itself wasn't bad but I had hoped for a wider selection. Another couple that came in after us were seated & given menus, so maybe it was a fluke. Based on the initial service experience & buffet selection, I can't really rate highly, sorry. I've had much better elsewhere.
