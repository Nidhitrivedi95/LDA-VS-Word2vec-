iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw Great food,

Menu was a bit confusing as main items were described as a la carte
When the food arrived,  we received 4 plates of rice, 4 plates of roti and naan bread, 2 vege dishes with meat, our entrees and that was after already eatting our appetizers, samosas and pakoras which were phemonenal. Overall great experience,
