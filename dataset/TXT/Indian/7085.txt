4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q I love butter chicken but they manage to cut the pieces so that they have some weird tendons attached to every large chunk. It is white meat.....I think!! You chew it and there is just something wrong!!  After a couple of take out orders that were not satisfactory, I started to order the paneer version of this dish. Shahi paneer. That was better but now it never seems to be the day that it is available so i have stopped going there for take out food.

 The naan is a bit thin compared to what I have enjoyed at other Indian restaurants and if you order it with butter or garlic it is so fricken yellow that it makes you wonder what the hell they put on it.

The milkshakes are pretty weird too. Maybe this is what is acceptable in India but these drinks really should be called something else.
