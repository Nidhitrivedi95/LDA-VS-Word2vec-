RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg It was my first time dining here. The food was fantastic and very affordable. Service wasn't bad, but not perfect either. There is a large selection of authentic Indian cuisine; which is nice to find in an area like Ballantyne. I ordered a cucumber salad, garlic naan, and Chana Masala. All were delicious. I'll definitely be coming back.
