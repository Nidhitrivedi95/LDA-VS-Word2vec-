abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg Worst experience. EVER. 

We were blatantly ignored for the first 10 minutes while we stood awkwardly in the middle of the restaurant's floor. When I asked the server behind the bar if we should seat ourselves her response was, "I would prefer if you didn't." Following which she continued to ignore us. A group of three patrons asked what we were doing because we were hovering around their table making their meal uncomfortable, at which point the same server who I had spoken to came over to deliver some food to them, ignored us again and then went on to clear a table (of the wrong size for our group) rather than acknowledging us. 

There were 2 open tables at the back, which would have been large enough to accommodate our group of 3 - so having been repeatedly ignored and told not to seat ourselves we left. 

I will be sharing this horrific experience with all of my friends to ensure none of them eat there. Stay posted for the review of the restaurant we wound up at, which acknowledged us.
