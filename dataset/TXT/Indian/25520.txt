hq10TdILrwtTcAESKY251Q The food and service here is amazing. Definitely coming back. I read some negative reviews on here but after having lunch there and ordering the Shrimp, Butter Chicken and Tandoori Chicken I can definitely say that it was absolutely delicious.  Way better than I was expecting.  Also the mango drink is really good.
