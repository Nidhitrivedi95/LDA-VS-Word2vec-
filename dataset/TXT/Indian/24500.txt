h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ 2 stars for the awesome food. All that we ordered tasted good. But the service was below par. Especially this one server,  Arshad. He threw too much attitude!  Customer service is a very basic necessity when you decide to run a restaurant. The minimum one can do is be polite while taking orders, you needn't smile, needn't go out of the way to help customers. But you CANNOT be rude and outright snappy! We were there for a family get together and he began by not helping to seat us, not getting silverware, and when we tried to place orders for some bottled beverages, he refused to get them saying "kitchen is closed"! Couple of other families had bad experiences with the service too. But 2 other servers were the saving grace of our evening.  Overall, good food, bad service.
