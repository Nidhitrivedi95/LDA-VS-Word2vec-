Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg With all these amazing reviews, we knew we HAD to come here for our date night. 
The hostess/waitress was so polite and went out of her way to help us as it was our first time at an Indian restaurant. 

My husband picked something right away. A chicken dish in a very yummy curry sauce.

I wasn't able to decide, I told the waitress I was wanting something with coconut curry and tofu, she said the chef could come up with something special for me if I'd like, so of course that was perfect.  

We got rosemary Naan, first, it was fantastic. UT was served with 3 sauces..  both my husband and I loved the tamarind and green sauces, but didn't like the white one at all.

We were both so happy when our food came out.  We each tried both of them.  I was so happy with my dish. It was heaven on my plate.  The perfect blend of coconut, curry, heat, tofu and vegetables. It couldn't have been better!!  

And the rice.  Oh my gosh, the rice itself was the most fragrant, best tasting rice I've ever had.

To top it all off, after we were done, the chef came out to check how our food was. He was wonderful to speak to, we can't wait to go back.
