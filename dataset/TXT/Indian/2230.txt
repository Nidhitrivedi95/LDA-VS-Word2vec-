_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Came here to try out their Summerlicious menu with a couple of friends. For $18, we got a lot of food and were all quite full. I ordered the chaat papri without yogurt as my appetizer. This is a very simple dish, nothing too special about it. Common Indian street food, and you can probably get much better on Gerrard street or Brampton. But still good for what I expected. 

For my main, I ordered the 'bhindi'. This is curried okra and potato. A little bland, but still good! The naan was soft and hot. This also came with lentils and rice, so it was very very filling. The dessert was very simple - gulab jamun. Nothing special here. 

The service was a little lacking. Nothing great, waiter seemed tired and service was slow. I didn't expect much anyway.
