22nkIQ4BeSYwsyaPOczOeA We found this place on trip advisor and went in starving at ~5:45pm on a Friday night. We were pleased to get a table despite how busy they were. They advertise "tapas" style dishes to share, but they were pretty large portions for tapas. We had vegetable pakora, saag paneer, butter chicken, and Peshawar pitta bread. Omg it was all delicious and just they right amount of food for the two of us. Everything was perfectly seasoned and top quality. The staff and managers operate like a well oiled machine and do an amazing amount of business. They also offer 125ml glasses of wine so you can sample things- again brilliant! We loved our dinner and would definitely go back!!!
