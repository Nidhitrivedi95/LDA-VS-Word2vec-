TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I wasn't super impressed with the India Palace buffet. They had a few interesting selections that I don't usually see at Indian buffets (like malai kofta- yum!), and also a few things that just looked downright unappetizing (the haleem looked really, really unappetizing- and my husband confirmed my suspicions when he, braver than I, gave it a try- it was gross). The chutneys were weird and it was hard to track down a server when we needed a drink refill or something. The malai kofta was tasty, though, as well as a chicken dish I sampled and I liked the inclusion of samosas on the buffet... but the gulab jamun tasted like soap and chemicals and overall I just got a weird vibe. We won't be back.
