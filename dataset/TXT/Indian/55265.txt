WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA I have to admit I haven't eaten a lot of roti yet but this place is amazing and makes me want to have roti every day!

It's a small locally owned restaurant in Pardale just west of Dufferin on the north side of Queen street. 

They have spinach, sweetpotato and squash in their roti and they have meat and vegetarian options. 

I had the goat roti and my friends has the chicken roti - all of it was super flavourfuland tasty. The prices were cheap and i had two meals out of it because their portions are huge. 

I will definitely go back there soon to try something else on the menu.
