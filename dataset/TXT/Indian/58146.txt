yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg I like this place a lot and they offer take out if you just want to pick up food and go home to eat. I always get the chicken makhani and my husband gets lamb curry... and garlic naan (so good you should get it!) Every time the food doesn't disappoint. The decor leaves much to be desired but I could care less about how the place looks as long as its clean and yummy. The people that work there are always very nice and welcoming. We'll continue to go there in the future.
