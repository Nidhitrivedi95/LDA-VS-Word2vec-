wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Ever since I moved to AZ I've been on a search for amazing Indian food and I'm happy to say I've found my new spot!! Their chicken tikka masala, veggie samoas, aloo chole and of course garlic naan are all AMAZING! Service is always on point. Keep up the great work I'll definitely be back
