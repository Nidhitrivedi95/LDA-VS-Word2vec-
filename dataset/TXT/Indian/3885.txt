0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Just moved to the area from San Diego and found a deal on living social. The majority of the dishes were WAY to spicy (and I love spicy food) and the naan which I thought was included in the buffet was soggy. When I told the cashier he couldn't of cared less he just wanted my credit card. Most of the good reviews must be local students who don't know any better and no other options are close. Won't be coming back!
