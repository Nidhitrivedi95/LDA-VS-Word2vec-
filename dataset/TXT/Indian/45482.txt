Buffet- I'm upgrading my review to five stars. There's really no reason not to give five. And after yesterday's Indian at another place I'm coming to the conclusion this is the best place in Cleveland. I travel a lot and seek out Indian wherever I go. The food was all incredibly fresh and hot. Spice level was just right and the aromatic level I complained about on y initial review was definitely better. Must've been an off day then. Plenty of dishes to choose from, goat, chicken, plenty of vegetarian options as well and possibly a vegan one or two. The goat curry is fabulous...nice and rustic on the bone just how I like it. Tandoori chicken is great also. None of that strange texture you sometimes get when it's been over marinated or warmed up from the previous day. You know what I'm talking about. The tea is great too. I've had tea in places where I literally thought they were trying to Poison diners with listerine in the tea. Seriously. Great service. Great atmosphere. Charming place and NOT in a boring strip mall. Would be a fabulous place to come at night time. I'm sure it's quite pleasing with the lighting and the colorful walls. 109% recommend this place. Clevelanders who really know indian food know to come here. 
***note...I've found all Indian places to be better closer to opening rather than towards the end of the buffet. I got here right about noon on a Sunday. 

Old review:
Good food, but for me it was lacking in aromatic flavor. Admittedly I only ate the buffet, but that shouldn't affect the aromatic flavor profile. The goat curry was good, the meat very tender, just devoid of much aromatics.
