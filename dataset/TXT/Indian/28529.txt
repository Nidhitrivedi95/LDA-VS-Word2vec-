J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I've been trying to duplicate Little India's Chana Masala for close to five years now. No other chana masala comes close to it. I wish they'd disclose their recipe, if only so I could enjoy it more often.

The servers are incredibly friendly and accommodating, even during the busy lunch hour.

Of the three Indian buffet restaurants that are located on the strip of Queen between University and John Street (Little India, Trimurti and whatever the other one is called), Little India is definitely the best.

At lunch you can take away buffet for $10.10 including tax. They have an impressive selection of veg and meat items and their sweet naan is heavenly!

They don't have debit - cash or credit only.
