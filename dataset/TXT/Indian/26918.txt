iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I was amazed with my experience here. My girlfriend orders the lamb chicken Marsala and I had the chicken Vindaloo. Well her lamb was delicious and my chicken was sub par, so naturally I ate all of hers. The waitress noticed my untouched plate and comped it off the bill and offered to make me something else. I will definitely give this place another chance
