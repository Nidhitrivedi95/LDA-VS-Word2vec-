7NurnM6G9b_2jTEKpIkQpg The Holy Grail of Sri Lankan food in the east end.  This is a real winner, and it is hard to point to only a few items.  If this is a first time, then string hoppers are a must (for "appa", I'd go to nearby Hopper Hut on Ellesmere but that is another story and another review).  Also worth sampling are the mutton rolls -- incredible coriander flavour with a chili kick -- and the egg roti, for something a bit less incendiary.  They fo lamprey on weekends -- a whole meal in a banana leaf, either veg, fish or meat.  Absolutey incredible, and feeds at least three .  Likewise the chicken biryani is inexpensive and will feed a crowd.  This is takeout only and because it's so damn good there often are lines at lunchtime.  I am lucky -- my office is ten minutes away, and often we bring this food in when we cater lunch.
