DxbdfvNYPCyiLJDDPJK3Tg The price is affordable and big portion - ranges from $5-15 per dish. Family style. Food is delicious but it's a hit or miss sometimes. I don't recommend getting pad Thai. Chilli chicken and Bombay chicken are great. Favourful. They're fried rice is mediocre. They're Manchurian fried rice just looks like regular fried rice, unless they mixed up my orders. 

All in all, they're a great place to go if you want affordable prices, family style and leftovers. Also, they have lunch specials on the weekdays :-)

The service is OK. Nice staff.
