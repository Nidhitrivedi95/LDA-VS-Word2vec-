sUGlSS0AF2xPYFEjvKJbSA My friends and I came in on a Sunday  for my birthday dinner. We were seated promptly and very friendly. Our server told us about the drink specials.  I had a margarita and a cocktail he chose for me. Sweet, spicy, and delicious with oranges, limes, tequila, and tamarind. Our food was hot, with great flavor and large portions. The menu was accommodating to my vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free friends. We were given a complimentary birthday dessert that fed all of us. We were very impressed with the staff and quality of food. I'd highly recommend Tandoori House for a fun get together with friends! Thanks for a fun birthday meal!
