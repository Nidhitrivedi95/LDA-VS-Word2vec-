LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Had a urge for something spicy today and found Indian Paradise.

We found a groupon, but it was only good for dinner 5pm-10pm, but we decided to try the buffet as it looked great, and the other yelp reviews were positive.

Well we were glad we went in.  The servers were wonderful and made sure our glasses were full with water and drinks the entire time.  I only usually get water, but they were nice enough to tell us drinks were included, so I had a sprit which was nicely carbonated, which is important!  There is nothing worse than not being able to feel the carbonation in the stomach moving things around. :-)

The servers also made this a wonderful experience in the fact that they also had my plate remove every single time I went back for more food, which was a lot!

All the food was hot and fresh.  I would suggest going around 11:30am when there were not that many people, because by 12:30pm, it was packed!

The food is nicely labeled and they had a variety of chicken, lamb, goat, and lots of vegetable choices.  I am a stickler on the rice and they had it cooked just right.

I think the part I like best is that I did not have to continue to ask for things like naam bread, they just knew to bring it to me.  The impression I got was that they are about the customer experience and not just trying saving a time.  I also asked for plain naam bread and they brought it to me without charge.

The food was not that spicy, I would assume because a buffet, but I am sure they would bring you extra spices if asked.  I was happy the way it was.

We have $25 and will definitely be back!
