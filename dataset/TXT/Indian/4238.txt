It was delicious and authentic in the way that only food from an Indian restaurant is, as opposed to just a stand-alone takeaway. It took a while to come but was worth the wait and proved to be filling and of excellent quality. We had a range of chicken dishes, prawn dishes, rice and nan breads between us and all were impressive, I'll definately make it my local go-to for yummy and reliable indian food.
