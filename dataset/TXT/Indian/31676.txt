KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ It's all about the crispy beef.  I've tried a number of things here.  Most are pretty good, but some are below average (Their hakka noodles are terrible!  What's with the wide flat noodles?  Should be skinny thin noodles IMO.)  However the crispy beef is great in my opinion which totally makes me frequent here.  I've also tried their chili chicken (meh, dark meat.  They have a white meat version too but its not breaded) which is above average but not the best I've had.  Dragon chicken with cashew nuts isn't even close to being as good as Salt & Pepper's which is just up the road.  I'd get the crispy beef and fried rice (manchurian or szechuan) from Bombay Chopsticks and get the Crispy chili chicken and hakka noodles from Salt & Pepper.  They are very close to eachother..
