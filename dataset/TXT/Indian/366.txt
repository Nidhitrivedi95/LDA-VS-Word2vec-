-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g A local search for an indian food fix vetted this relatively new spot in Southeast Tempe for a nice lunch buffet option. Fate would have it that the place is owned and managed by the previous manager of Indian Oven (a place I used to be of check-in royalty for), and all the food is just as delicious and fresh as I can remember.

Spot on for value (~$8 lunch buffet) too!

From talking with the guy, he is planning to introduce a delivery food service after hours (10PM+) for the hungry late night crowd in the area! When another night of filberto's just doesn't sound appealing anymore, this could bring a really great alternative for the area..
