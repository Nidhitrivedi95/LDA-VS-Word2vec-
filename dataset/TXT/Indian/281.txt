-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g After reading the reviews and craving Indian food I convinced a group of co-workers to join me at Nandini. We stopped in on a Wed. for lunch and the place was a little slow with only a handful of tables filled - all I can say is lucky us! 

The food on the lunch buffet was plentiful and full of flavor and the personalized service of the staff was impeccable!  They offered suggestions, kept our water brimming and checked on our meal and overall enjoyment throughout!  We had some first-timers with us and everyone was very happy with the food and selection. This is a great place for those who haven't had the opportunity to try a lot of Indian dishes as they do a good job of explaining them on the buffet labels and the staff are wonderful and help you figure out the pairings for the food and sauces/chutneys.  

Overall a wonderful experience and as this is close to the office we will be back soon!
