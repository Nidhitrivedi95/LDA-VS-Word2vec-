qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA I think they are from the same batch of owners as Java House and the Green Room. So the food is average but the prices are great for a person on a tight budget. My friends like the beer specials and/or prices. 

I organized a meet up here. We had a great turnout. Orders got mixed up, the staff didn't come back to check on us very often and he and she were not very pleasant or cheerful. 

Great space for small or large groups, good bathrooms, the music was a little loud where we were sitting and they said they couldn't do anything about it.
