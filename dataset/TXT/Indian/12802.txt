B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Dhaba's has good service and good food. And they hit the spice level nicely, as requested. We usually order mild, and the food comes out mild, but still very tasty. When we order medium-spicy, the heat level definitely goes up, but not too much; and everyone always agrees that the spice level is solidly in the range of medium-spicy.

We only select from their vegetarian options (I have only eaten with other vegetarians at Dhaba's). All of their dishes have been great! We especially like their paneer options.
