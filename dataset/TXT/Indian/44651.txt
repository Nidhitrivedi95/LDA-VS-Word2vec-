S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Lunch Buffet was very crowded on the weekend--long line, but water/drink service was still good.  A wide variety of food--nan was actually out in the buffet line which was nice to see done.  Only thing was the plastic utensils bothered me.  I could live with the plastic water cups but plastic forks and spoons seem like picnic items and eating tandori chicken with them proves difficult.  I was glad to see a well stocked buffet even with such a crowd!  Good food- but not the best to bring me back often-mango lassi was okay too.
