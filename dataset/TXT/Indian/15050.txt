CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw I have not eaten a lot of Indian food, so I didn't know what to order. The chef actually prepared me a couple different dishes to try out.

Not sure what it was called - but was Lamb Chops - the best lamb I have had. Excellent.
I also tried the house specialty of Butter Chicken - can't go wrong with that - but very rich!!
I also had Chana Masala - not my favourite dish. But 2 out of 3 ain't bad.

The Naan bread was to die for, and the chef took me into the kitchen and showed me how it was made.

Great service. Great Food. Would definitely recommend it.
