PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g We ate here due to a Grupon coupon that we purchased, as it is a bit far from out West End home.  But we will certainly come back.

The large room is comfortable and accommodating, with indented black upper walls to cleverly give the impression of empty space behind them and elegant chandeliers.  The food is North Indian with a modern/fusion trend.  Everything was first rate - our appetizers of topnotch samosa and fried coconut crusted calamari with a great chutney along with terrific chicken madras and spicy lamb - the latter was exceptionally tender.

Service was friendly and helpful as well.

Given its name there had to be something erotic in the place somewhere, so the poster of sexually suggestive temple carvings in the men's room filled the bill, I guess.

Look forward to additional visits.
