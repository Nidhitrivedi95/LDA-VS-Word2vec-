tRSUE3l8T2ptsj4LMk8Ysw To find good Indian food in Scarborough is surprisingly a struggle. 
The food here is decent enough. It's good- haven't had a bad experience thus far but it's not amazing or memorable.

The service is good and the restaurant is nicely decorated.

Their Faluda is really good too- so try that for dessert.
