DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I've read plenty of good reviews about samosa factory and true to story you can't go wrong coming here!! Upon walking in my husband and I were greeted and seated. The owner and waitress was very nice and had good suggestions for the menu. We ordered: chicken korma, lamb vindaloo, garlic naan and onion kulcha. We were given mango lassi to try. EVERYTHING was absolutely amazing! The service was excellent. I will be going back for sure!
