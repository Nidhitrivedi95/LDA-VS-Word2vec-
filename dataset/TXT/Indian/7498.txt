As mentioned below, oxtail is usually gone by 1-2pm so be there early. Any regulars reading this will know what I mean, get there or it's gone. I've only ordered the dinner size and it leaves me completely satisfied everytime. Try the oxtail just once and I guarantee it'll keep you coming back for more!
