K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g Being new to Phoenix area, we were searching for good South Indian food options. I think we've found it! Decor of this place is no frills - simple and clean. Madras offers a wide variety of menu options and they don't skimp on heat in their food. They do however ask you how hot you wanted it, so we told them to not hold back and we got what we wanted. 
It is vegetarian only, but I really didn't miss non-veg options because the flavors and variety were really good. We ordered Rasam (nice and spicy to start the meal with), then Veg Samosa and Rice Idly served with sides of Sambar and 2 other sauces - both were delicious, and for the main meal we ordered Aloo Mutter with Naan which was excellent. All that food for 24 bucks wasn't bad! The food wasn't oily which in my experience tends to happen with South Indian food. Although I don't have other places to compare this to (as there seems to be no other South Indian Restaurants within 15 mi radius), we'll definitely be back.
