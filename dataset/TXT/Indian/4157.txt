1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA I visit this awesome place today.  It has one of the best vegetable Thali in GTA, food is spicy in taste in comparison to other restaurants which makes it even better. I was in a fix to give 5 star or 4 star. I settled for 5 star due to their awesome staff and specialy owner. They helped me in deciding what to eat as I was going there for the first time. Must go for veg Thali and Punjabi and Bengali methai.
