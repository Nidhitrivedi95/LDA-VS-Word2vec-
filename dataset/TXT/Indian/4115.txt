171c2z28JaSYQtWimiZ62A We had the worst possible experience at the Indian Bread Bar. We had bought a groupon and was excited to check this place out but was hugely disappointed. We went for dinner on July 18,2015. The server was very rude and abusive. It has horrible customer service which I did not expect from this place.

The prices are exorbitant and the food was awful. The naans(bread) were burnt and hardly edible. 

I would NOT recommend this place. It was a horrible experience. Be prepared to be abused if you ever happen to check out to place. AVOID Indian Bread Bar at all cost.
