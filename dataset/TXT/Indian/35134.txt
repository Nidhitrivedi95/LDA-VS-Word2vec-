MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw I went to Adrak for my dad's birthday dinner on a Tuesday night around 8pm. The restaurant was empty except for one other group so there was no wait to get a table. We started off with apps: Aloo Papri Chaat, Potato Tikki Trio and Masala Fries. They weren't amazing. The tikki trio was supposed to be three different preparations/flavours of aloo tikki but tbh they all tasted the same. The masala fries were good for a crowd but it was just normal french fries dusted with parmesan cheese and served with mango chutney to dip. Nothing special and either of those are definitely not worth $9. The chaat was good tho, with pomogranete seeds and thin strips of beets on top to garnish.

For mains we ordered: Shahi Kadhai Paneer, Cabbage Manchurian, Kashmiri Aloo and Malai Kofta.  My favourite was the manchurian, hands down. It was seasoned really well with a sweet spicy sauce and all the pieces were nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Paired with garlic naan, it was amazing. The kashmiri aloo also had an amazing cream sauce that had the right balance of sweet and spicy. Portions are decent for the mains but naans are priced individually which is odd. We ordered 6 naans for 6 people.

We got masala chai to end the meal and it wasn't very good. Pretty watery and not something I'm used to when drinking indian tea. 

Overall, the ambiance and food was great but in my opinion, skip apps and go straight for the mains.
