ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw This restaurant definitely hits as a fit for the new "Dormont is actually kind of cool" scene.

The food is well above average, eclectic, creative, and tasty.  Some are knock-outs, and some are average.  For example, the sauce with the chick pea dust encrusted cauliflower was top-notch... the chips that went with the fried cod: mediocre at best.  But this imperfection seems inevitable when you are trying to fuse Indian and British pub food.  The real question is--will it continue to get better?

I would call the food overall a solid 7.  (I would like to note here that this is often the case for even the most "in" restaurants--inconsistency is everywere).  The drink menu, however, is a 9+.  My guest, and others in the restaurant, were loving the mixed drinks.  $10 for a lot of creativity and kick.  I was driving, so I just had a glass of wine - which was actually quite good itself.  

There is also a passion in which the servers, bartender, manager, approach the whole endeavor... I hope it is sustainable.  

Décor is nice, and a little odd - just like the food.  I think this one has a pretty good chance, if it continues to evolve and stay edgy and happy.  My advice to the owners would be to view the opening of the restaurant as the beginning, not the end, of the innovations.
