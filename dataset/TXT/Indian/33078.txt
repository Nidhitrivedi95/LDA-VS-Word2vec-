" Although lame to say all the time, in some cases it is true. I have been to India and the food was probably the best thing about the trip, seriously. Luckily India Palace does a pretty good job - for being in Phoenix, AZ anyway.

This is on my lunch rotation as it's close to the office. A few of us hit the buffet every once in awhile and I must say it's always very consistent quality wise. while changing up the menu items every time we dine. 

The buffet is small as others have mentioned but I think this has an appeal. I feel it helps keeps the quality, flavors, etc consistent and everything fresher. They always have more then a few vegetarian and vegan items to fill up on and service is always prompt and friendly.

This place is easy to miss tucked back into a hard hit(read lots of open, leaseable space) strip mall in NW Phoenix but worth stopping in for some almost-authentic indian grub.
