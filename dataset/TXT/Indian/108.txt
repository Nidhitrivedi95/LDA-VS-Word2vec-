-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g We came here twice in 2 weeks as not to lose our Groupon Value. So glad we changed up our old Indian restaurant in Tempe. The place is big, plenty of tables, service is very good along with the food. We came the first time on a Saturday at 7 and a weeknight at 7, both time there was open seating.

We ordered King Fishers (beer) and snacked on complementary Papadom while perusing the menu. We started with the Vegetable Samosa. Entrees were the Boneless Chicken Vindaloo, Tandoori Chicken, Basmati Plain Rice, and a Garlic Naan. On the second occasion we opted to try the Boneless Chicken Tiki Marsala. All the dishes we requested on a 1-10 in spiciness ,a 7 and 8. The Samosas were the best I've ever had. All the chicken dishes were very good, perfect heat at 7 and 8. The Tandoori Chicken portion was huge. The Naan was fresh and perfectly crispy/soft.

Glad to find a new place for us, food and service a winner.
