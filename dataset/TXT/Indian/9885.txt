I have only really had this type of food every so often, but I really enjoyed the taste here as well as the service. They were extremely polite and made sure we were taken care of.
I think what was impressive was at the end. They were closing in a few minutes and I watched as two different groups walked in to eat. Now I found that to be rude as I had been in the restaurant industry, but again polite and made sure to sit them down like no big deal. 
Excellent!
