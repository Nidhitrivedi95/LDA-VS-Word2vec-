2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Good Indian food. I loved their spring rolls, amazing. Their hariali chicken is the best I've ever had. Its not at the typical Indian resto prices, so its good for a celebration meal perhaps.
I also tried their lunch buffet, and was greatly disappointed. The food tastes nothing like what they serve for their a la carte.
