80NTyBDwAtppP3oL84PN7w This review is based on the takeaway food only but hopefully useful review nonetheless. I heard recently this local restaurant was voted second best curry house in Edinburgh so was keen to try. I have to say it was delicious and was really impressed. Great flavours, fresh and tasty and great nan bread too. My wife who is very hard to please actually said "this is the best takeaway I've ever had" - high praise indeed. Actually really reasonable prices too. 

The restaurant looks great and look forward to trying it out soon.
