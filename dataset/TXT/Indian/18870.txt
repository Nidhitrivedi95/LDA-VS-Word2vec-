ePBGDKArVr5YImZu1QP9rg I ordered from this restaurant on Foodora, and I really didn't enjoy any aspect of it. The samosas were very greasy (so greasy that the bottom half of the brown paper bag was soaked), the basmati rice had spilled all over (it had been packed in the weirdest way), the curry was very oily and the chicken was undercooked, and the yellow lentil daal was wayyy too runny. I threw out maybe 80% of it. Won't order again.
