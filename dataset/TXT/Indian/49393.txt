tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA The food here is amazing. It's the type of food that once you taste it, you will crave at the most random times. There really is nothing bad on the menu (haven't tried the desserts or appetizers though I sure they are great). What brings the rating down one star is the younger girl who works evenings. She doesn't crack a smile and makes it apparent she'd rather be doing a million other things. The rest of the staff though is nice and very approachable.
