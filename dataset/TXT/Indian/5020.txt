2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw Hot hot hot menu! I love it but my tummy does not like the chicken vindaloo... Very spicy. I love the interior design of this place - gorgeous and I feel like I'm in another country... If you like Indian cuisine try this restaurant. I have to go back soon, it's been a long time! Hope to see you there too! Very romantic atmosphere. The food here will cause you to crave it, it's that great.
