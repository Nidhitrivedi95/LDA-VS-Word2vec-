b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA Great service, they delivered to my hotel when no one else would. The delivery man was very friendly and pleasant as was the lady from whom I ordered on the phone. That's where the praise stops. I ordered chicken tikka masala and it was honestly the worst I've ever had. I'm no expert but I've probably eaten the dish at least twenty times at different restaurants and this was disgusting. The chicken was a very strange shape and texture. The sauce had gigantic chunks of bell peppers and onions and the sauce was soupy and flavourless. Not the creamy and smooth dish I'm used to. The garlic naan was yummy, which is lucky cuz I threw the rest out. Very displeased.
