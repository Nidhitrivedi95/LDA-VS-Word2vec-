DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I love me some vegan friendly Indian food and the chutneys were awesome.

5 stars for the service and the samosas and chutneys. The samosas were delicious and had a great flakey outside with a little bit of salt that made them really pop. The service was great and super friendly.

3 stars for the rest of the food. The entrees were a little under spiced and over salted. This may be because we were not asked about spice levels when we ordered so we got generic bland style. The eggplant, which is a favorite at most places, was our least favorite. It was a bit over pureed and had little spices. Out of the entrees, the fresh spinach curry was a standout, it had a great flavor.

With your dinner you are only served a small scoop of rice on the plate, which was not enough for a second helping of food. Since I wanted spicier food, I asked for something hot to put in and was brought a chili paste that added a good kick to the food.

I will still highly recommend this place and will be back in order to get some spicy food which I think will be much better. I am looking forward to giving this place a 5 star review next time.
