yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Although the food is delicious, as always, we were upset to be told after the meal that because we made a reservation we could not use our groupon on dinner.  In general, that does not make sense. We can only use groupons if we are walk-ins? This is a groupon that expires in two days and we will not be able to get the value out of it now. I feel that a business should honor the deals they offer and/or make any caveats known up front.
