LIjlU7K-0SPXPtYFQiXamQ Sloppy Bunjo where have you been all my life?

I can't describe it any better than they do:
"Yellow peas simmered in a mix of tomatoes, cumin, turmeric and a blend of other herbs and spices stuffed in a soft white bun and garnished with chopped onions, cilantro, tamarind chutney and hot sauce."

I got the standard, but next time I'm definitely getting the samosa sloppy bunjo. Take the recipe above and add a delicious, broken-up samosa to the mix. My DC loved it.

We need more places like Market 707 / Scadding Court Market in Toronto. Head to Dundas just west of Bathurst and check it out for yourself.
