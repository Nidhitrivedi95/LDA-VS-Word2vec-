NOjmj2XNnn2kuc7lARdggQ Definitely a place I would recommend for take out. Incredibly reasonable prices, good selection, daily specials and super tasty curries!  Actually everything we ordered was tasty. 

Samosas (and the sauces were yummy). 
Chicken makhani with rice or "butter chicken" more recognized by folks was DELICIOUS and all white meat (huge plus PLUS plus with the hubbers!). 
The garlic naan moist, tasty and so fresh! 
The kheer was just ok - big orders (which I didn't know so I ordered two but not the best flavor I have had and sort of clumping together like the rice wasn't all the way done or maybe over done?)

Recommend again for take out - not a bad wait time 25 mins - and worth it as for two we paid what would cost for one at a sit down establishment for about the same thing.
