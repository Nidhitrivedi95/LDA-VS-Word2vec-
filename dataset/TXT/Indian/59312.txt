YywWkWX235ZurTWSLqNPog I have been a regular of this place but over last year or so, I have seen a decline in the taste and quality of food served here. 
The prices are very nominal and the quantity isn't bad either. Waiting time over here has always been high just because of number of customers coming here to eat. Food quality has gone from great to pretty mediocre and inconsistent. I wish they would shift from using disposable cutlery ( spoons/forks/cups) to actual one. Overall a good place but really need to tighten their belts to compete with newer restaurants opening in the area.
