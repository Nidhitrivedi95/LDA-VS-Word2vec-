FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw We went for the lunch buffet, which I only found to be mediocre. The food had it's flavor, but did not seem to be as authentic as I would have hoped. Maybe it's because I live in California, and my Indian food expectations are high, but I wasn't terribly impressed by this place.
