NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw This is the BEST Indian food I have ever had! It is so addictive though! My boyfriend and I frequent Cinamon all the time. Minimum of once a week. He goes at least twice a week, daily if I'd let him!

I always get the extra spicy chicken vindaloo with rice and naan. It's amazing. The chicken is so lean and the sauce is always cooked to perfection.  I can not fault one thing about any of it. I've tried a few other dishes here too such as Korma and some spicy fish dish, can't recall the name. Beware however, once you try this place you'll not want Indian from anywher else.  They don't have a liquor licence yet which is a pity, hopefully soon! As I love that I live close to this place!
