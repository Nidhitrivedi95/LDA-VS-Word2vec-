Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg Great food, great service.

I came here with a few of my friends and we ordered a bunch of stuff to share. At first, we thought that it wouldn't be enough (4 dishes for 5 people, plus naan, paratha and rice) but it ended up being more than enough!

My favourite dish was the Baigan Ka Bharta
(Eggplant baked in Tandoor, smashed & sauteed with green peas, tomatoes & spices). It was just incredibly flavourful, with a nice texture, and went great with the rice, naan and paratha. I may have eaten half the dish... we also had:

Gosht Saag (Lamb/beef cooked with spinach & fresh spices): great sauce, but the lamb was a little dry. 

Subzi Do-Piaza (Mixed vegetables, mushrooms, peas, cheese, cooked with onion sauce, garnished with tomatoes & spring onions): very good, but the mushrooms were kind of big.

Saag Paneer (Cottage cheese cooked in onion & spinach): My friends enjoyed it, said that the cheese was nice and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside.

The bread and rice were also really great.

I will definitely return and try their other dishes!!
