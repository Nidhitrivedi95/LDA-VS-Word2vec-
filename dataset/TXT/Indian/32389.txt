LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw I finally got sick from this place.

There is a MAJOR cleanliness issue.  Picture dirty trays used by other customers piled two feet (yes) high on top of a trash can overflowing with garbage, immediately next to the utensils and napkins you're supposed to use.  

I've never seen a single table wiped down between customers.

There are flies flying through the dining room.

There is the overwhelming scent of raw meat that wafts in from the equally disgusting grocery store.  

The refrigerator coolers they keep raw chicken kabobs and such in are WARM to the touch. 

If this is what we see front of house, I dont want to know what goes on in the back.  I was extremely ill within an hour after eating here.  The food is good but I did not enjoy it the second time.

I just can't ever bring myself to come back here.

Also the high chair is covered in filth.  I can't imagine anyone seating their child in it.
