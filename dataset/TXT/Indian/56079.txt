xhc-bSw2Cz2Inskzjve3Rg After a movie, I was hungry and knew I didn't want to cook.  I stopped at this spot for some take away.  I ordered the Goat Curry (mild), Tandoor Chicken, Naan, and Somosa.  I was quoted about 15 minutes for order to be ready.  The gentleman who took my order offered me water or a beverage during my wait.

I observed a clean dining area and the buffet set up.  The buffet looks like it would have many different options.  I would like to come back to try that in the near future.  It was towards the end of the night and the restaurant was very quite, with only one table.   A party of six walked in at 9:30 pm and they were greeted warmly.

There is a nice comfortable couch were I read a book for the 15-20 minutes.  It was longer than quoted for the food to come out but I was not upset.  Food came to me very well packed.  When I got home, there were no spills or leaks.  The Goat Curry was very flavorful and the meat was cooked well.  The Tandoor Chicket was very good, too.  I had left overs for multiple meals.

I look forward to dining in and upgrading the stars.
