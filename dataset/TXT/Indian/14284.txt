c_ZDTkfDlfzLm0a3osk1ow We went there for lunch with a big group and the food and the service were good.
To my disappointment they don't seem to have the mango lassi for lunch buffet. Neither they had the table with various items. Just the sign where the table usually is... something 'chaat' I think.

Tandoori chicken was way too red, and kind of too tender... like it was steamed or something, I like my tandoori chicken a little drier, even a tiny bit burnt.

I asked my vegetarian friend what he thought about the choices, and he said it was OK, but the paneer had a weird consistency.

Anyway, still 4 stars because they have a good variety (some of them spicy), they have free chai, and they had gulab jamun... which I love because I sweeten my chai with the syrup from the gulab jamun : P

Also, the staff was very friendly, a lady with blond hair and a young man took good care of us.

I had a little bit of kheer (rice pudding) and it was very very tasty.
Overall, a good experience.
