A_05gZ2QwayLb0YeQ_TItQ Husband and I spent a week in Montreal for some work, and we didn't expect to find much good Indian food there let alone South Indian food. We went there for lunch 2 times during our stay and were reasonably suprised and pleased with both the quality of the food and the taste. The masala dosas were top notch. It is a small eatery shared with other vendors, with a few seats so be ready to take your food out and eat. Busy around lunch time and lots of people were getting thalis which looked great. Overall would visit again if in the Montreal area.
