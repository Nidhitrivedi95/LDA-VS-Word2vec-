Small, rustic and no one ramming apps or desserts down your gullet. 
A James Beard award winner for local fare, The Fry Bread House is great!  Big taco like creations with their amazing fry bread. The green chili sauce is outstanding.
You also need to make room in your belly for their dessert. It's chocolate sauce on their fry bread. Amazingly simple and extremely addictive. My hands looked like a fight scene from The Matrix as to how fast I ate it! 
Parking lot is super tiny and I heard the lunch crowd is huge (not large in weight just lots of people).
