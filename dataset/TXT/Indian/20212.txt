The wait staff is nice but completely clueless about how to wait on tables. Often times you have to wait in the front to be seated & with the chaos & confusion of crowds it is hard to catch their eye. They also bring menus only for the adults! The wines taste awful. I had to send back the wine the one tine I ordered it & the waiter was affronted by this. I told him that I should be affronted that such wine was served! He was not too happy to replace it with a freshly opened bottle. The wait staff is also not knowledgeable about what A la Carte menu item is available. The management of this restaurant needs to take interest & train the staff properly.
