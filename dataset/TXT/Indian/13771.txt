BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ This is a review based on take-away food ordered on Just Eat and I should also say that I'm most familiar with Indian food from my home in the North East of England and it seems the flavour palate may be quite differet.

I found the Vindaloo to have sufficient heat but to be more sour than I might expect and I found the meat (chicken) to be oddly fatty.

Jal Farasi was somewhat bland and again the meat was fatty.

Vegetable Biriani had rice and vegetables but came without sauce... is this normal in Canadian versions of the dish? It had more bite than I expected but was okay. 

Nan and pompoms were 'meh' and, at least by the time they reached us, the Onion Bhajis we're soggy.

To be honest if I was scoring this against what I'm used to in the UK it would scrape 2 stars but some of that may be just what I'm used to so i've opted for a generous 3 stars.

Overall I'd say it was edible but uninspiring.
