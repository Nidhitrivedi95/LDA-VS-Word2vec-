ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw Quick, simple place to eat. Pretty busy New Year's Eve, chicken biriyani ran out so we went for the meat combo with naan. 1 meat curry and 2 veg curries. 

Limited space to sit, but we got a table. They get top marks for the naan. Freshly made to order! We'd definitely go back if we're in the area.
