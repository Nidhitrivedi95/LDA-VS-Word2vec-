IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA Buffet is great deal for the price with a good range of vegeterian ,chicken and goat items - especially liked were the Himalayan chicken and goat curry.  We are a non vegetarian family originally from India visiting from Austin, tx. Son and I ordered off the menu while the hubby and daughter went for the buffet. We ordered lassi, tomato soup, alu paratha and chai off the menu. Food is fresh hot and nicely spiced and came quickly to our table. Our server was friendly and chatty.
