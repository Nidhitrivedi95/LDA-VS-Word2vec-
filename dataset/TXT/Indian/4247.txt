The menu is great too. Really inventive dishes, not just the average Indian restaurant choices. I'm a vegetarian and was really pleased to see a separate section of veggie meals (and not just carnivore dishes with the meat cut out!) I had a great curry made with paneer (yummy Indian cottage cheese). The service was very quick, and the waiters were very attentive. 
All in all, I loved eating here and have been dying to go back! The intimate nature of the restaurant means its great for couples, or smaller groups but, as I was leaving a big group came in (who obviously had been in before and knew the waiters) and they were made to feel at home, with lots of chat with the waiters (even the chef came out to speak to them!)
The only down side when I visited was that it was very quiet while I was eating which meant the waiters were perhaps a little over-attentive but this didnt spoil the meal at all.
A great restaurant, lovely food, excellent service! I loved it.
