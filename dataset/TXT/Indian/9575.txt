8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ The food here is excellent and the service is abysmal. I wish the service was even slightly more tolerable, because the food was so good I would happily eat here again, and certainly warrants 4 or maybe even 5 stars, especially at the price point. I really enjoyed WHAT I ate but I did not enjoy eating here.

The good:
- The food is excellent and the portions are large-ish.  The butter chicken is very, very good if a little bit too sweet and the Tikka Masala is also great, but Lahore's is better. 
- The food is at a decent price point (2 meat mains, 2 Naans, rice = $39)
- Good location (for me!)
- Dining room was very clean, linen napkins, inoffensive decor, etc... it's sort of clean-bland

The bad:
- It was impossible to get our waters refilled; I almost got up and took a pitcher off the counter
- It took forever (and 2 asks) to get the bill
- We thought we would make it easy on them and just split evenly on two cards but that was an impossible task for them to execute. It literally involved a scrap paper and a calculator and two employees.
- We went to the takeout window to pay with credit card and the guy was MANUALLY TYPING our card numbers in. WTFITS? (what the f@%! is that s#!t, for the acronymally challenged)
- It took longer for us to pay than to eat
- They have taped off the window on the door into the kitchen. That just makes me feel a bit uncomfortable. What don't you want me to see going on back there? I already smell that your chefs aren't wearing deodorant when I walk past to get to the restrooms. I'm fine with it - it adds... authenticity?
- The restrooms were clean but had no soap or toilet paper - Mike S. also commented that there was no soap in the mens room. Is there soap in the kitchen? I'm just not going to think about it. The food was still good.  
- I told them their restrooms has no soap or toilet paper and the guy smiled and nodded. And then didn't refill the supply or bring the bill.

Overall, I will definitely eat here again.  I will probably call ahead, get take out, only pay with cash and not think about them not having soap in either of their restrooms.
