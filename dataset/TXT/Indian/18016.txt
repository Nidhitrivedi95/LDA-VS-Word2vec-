ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ My first time going there, I was a little unsure of the atmosphere and to my surprise, everything was awesome!! The people who work there are nice and they have really exquisite food that knocks you off your feet! I would say this is one of the best restaurants I have been to here in the Pittsburgh area! I love the Masala chicken and the curry rice is awesome!! The lunch buffet is about $9 but you eat all you want.
