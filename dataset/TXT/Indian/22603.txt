gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg It may seem like it is overkill to say one is teary eyed at the opening of a restaurant but this was exactly what happened tonight as my husband and I paid or first visit to Ruchi.  As committed vegetarians it means so much to us to have delicious all veg food that is such high quality that it actually feel therapeutic to eat.  The environment is beautiful and relaxing and the food is simply off the scale good.  Although it is over a 20 minute drive (thank goodness for freeways) we will return regularly because there simply is no other restaurant like it anywhere in the Phoenix Valley. Make sure you don't miss out!
(We are searching our address books to figure out all the friends we can think of to take to dinner here! Seriously!)
