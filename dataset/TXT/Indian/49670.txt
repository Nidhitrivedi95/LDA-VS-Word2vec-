tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I visited India Oven today with a bunch of friends. They close at 10 pm and we reached there around 9pm. Our friends were going to reach earliest by 9.30 pm but we were informed that they close the buffet and accept the last order at 9.30 pm. We were left with no choice but to order for everybody. Having worked in a fast food chain I understand how bad it is to trouble the chefs just before they close. But even after that they treated us really well.
I want to give a shout out to Mini the manager that day. He helped me out with the choice of the dishes. He was completely honest about how much quantity would be required for 6 people. He knows the dishes served really well and has very helpful inputs. Because we missed the buffet he offered us a complimentary Lamb Curry!
Now the main part- FOOD! It was amazing! It is hands down the best Indian food I have had since I have been in the US. Butter Paneer and Butter Chicken are two of the must haves here. Among other dishes we tried Chicken Tikka, Achari Chicken, Lamb Curry, Chicken Biryani, Garlic Naan(Their naans are amazing!). This was followed by complimentary ice creams!
 
All in all we had an amazing evening. It is a must try if you love Indian food and don't want to burn a hole in your pocket. The service and food is impeccable! What more can one ask for?!
