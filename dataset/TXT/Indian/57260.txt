Y5EralXpOcigSLwkJasAXw The food is okay - I've been there twice and each time the items I bought were somewhat damp i.e. missing the normal crunch. The place kind of smells and the staff does not inspire a lot of confidence in terms of cleanliness. I wasn't brave enough to try any "sweets" - only the fried stuff. I wish there were more shops in Montreal that sell Indian sweets/munchies.
