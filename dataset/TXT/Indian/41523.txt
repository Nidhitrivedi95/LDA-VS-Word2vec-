q-pjLY1R98QTUZY2pbbsxw Been here twice and already I see a pattern. The first time was just after the Groupon came out and they were crazy busy, so I wasn't going to ding them. This time, we were the only people for dinner but they were out of several things.  The service was slow and clumsy.  The food is GREAT but portions are too small. Prices are too high and everything costs extra.  I want to like them more, but the food stands alone as the only good part.  Oh and the interior is absolutely painful. Cheap tables and bright fluorescent lights.  Operating rooms have more ambiance.
