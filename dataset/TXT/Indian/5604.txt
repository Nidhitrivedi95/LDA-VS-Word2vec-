3fisVoVAdjVqhbzT5GYkYQ I mean.... I don't understand why they are charging you so much considering it is a take out place that is so filthy. Haleem $10.50 same goes for Paaya and other curry items. Are you effing kidding me???? Don't tell me you are superior than Shaheen Tikka and Kabab House or Tandoori Times. Both do not have sky rocking prices like you guys.
