UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA good stuff.  gets busy, so seat early. 
I have an onion allergy, so to those Yelpers with my unique allergy to white/yellow/red/purple onions, they have salad (dressing has onion), rice, naan, BBQ chicken, and some grilled chicken you can pick around the onions.  
- a little on the pricey side, but like I said - it's busy.  
- nice clean place
