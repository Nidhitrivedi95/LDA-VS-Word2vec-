oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q I went to Eddie's and to be honest I really didn't care for the atmosphere, but my wife really likes the food here...so we went. I had the Tandoori chicken and it was DELICIOUS! It had just enough spice and with the white rice, it was more than filling. 

Since I work only a five minute drive away, I found myself having the same Tandoori chicken meal for lunch, so that's back-to-back days I had the Tandoori chicken. 

It's probably the only meal I would eat there, because it was more than satisfactory in my opinion.
