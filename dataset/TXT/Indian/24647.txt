H0IE2OnPSLQSxs3atGEIbw So, I ate in the restaurant recently.

The food was, of course, still incredibly good and the food is served on these trays with little candles in them to keep everything warm, but .... but ... the service and the atmosphere were definitely lacking.

The atmosphere was almost sterile.  It was reasonably modern but not in a chic kind of way.  The room itself has potential to be very interesting but the choice of decor just makes it feel dry and uninteresting.  

The wait staff, though, are where the real fault sits.  They were incredibly stiff, never smiled, hardly paid any attention to our table even when we were trying to a) order drinks or b) get the bill.  We'd ended up ordering a bit too much food so, considering this place does takeout, we figured it wouldn't be a problem to ask for a takeaway container.  The miserable look we got from the server said it all.  He did put our food in a takeaway, but he literally mixed everything (side garnish salad and all) into one container and plonked it on our table like it was a bag of rubbish.  

The four stars are because, at the end of the day, the food is exceptional and you can order it for takaway and bypass the stuffy staff.
