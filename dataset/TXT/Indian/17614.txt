DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ Best butter chicken in the city, hands down.  Not much spice but the actual flavor is fantastic. 

The thali, naan, saag paneer, chana dishes are always great as well. The lassi drinks are always fresh too. Relatively fresh desserts also made on-site. 

Always fresh, never dissatisfies, fairly priced.
This is a small, family business and after trying to convince the owner to open a more central location after being 30yrs in business... His answer was still "no, thank you".

I've been to many Indian/Pakistani restaurants in the GTA over the last 12 years and only one other has come close to the quality of food. This place though, for the price never disappoints and I drive 40km to get there! 

Other, more high-end restaurants that have been rated as 4 star on yelp don't even come close (such as Curry Twist).
