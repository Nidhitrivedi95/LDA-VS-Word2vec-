oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw The waitress was super nice.  The food was okay.  Way over priced for what you get.  It was the first ordering Greek food here and got the $15 sampler.  It only came with 1 spanakopita and two dolmades and meat balls.  Then so few pita chips and charge us $2 for a few more chips.  Then the gyro portion doesn't have anything either.  The Indian food we ordered as a main course was tasty.  The chicken was dry and you only get a small ladle full of it.   It will probably be a long while before I go back here, if I ever do.
