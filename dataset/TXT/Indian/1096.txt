-MpXo24qYu4DazQXDrs2oA right next to the DMV. I visited India house today for breakfast,craving for some idly vada and was utterly disappointed. 

Idly was badly out of shape , vada undercooked and took them a good 40 mins to get the dishes out . I also ordered a puri bhaji and it looked good and home made but the bhaji was so bland, I had to add salt and give it a good whip before I ate it. may be i caught them on one of those days and since our service was good I'll give it another try for sure.
