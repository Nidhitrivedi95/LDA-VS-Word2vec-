RSAeqTx82wSZXF6ptK5fYA I propose that Taste of India get a new, fresh yelp! review site.  Taste of India is dead, long live Taste of India!  

The new, post-fire establishment is completely new and different.  The space inside has booths, nice tables, a new and improved kitchen, even better bathrooms.  I cannot overstate how much better it is than in the past.

Most importantly, the lunch buffet has catapulted from kind of bland if serviceable, to downright excellent.  I hate to say it, but it's my new favorite buffet for lunch.  

I'm serious, Rachel, you should close their old reviews and have them start fresh (with my review).  And for all the people who went there in the past and maybe didn't have a great experience (or did) you need to go again!!
