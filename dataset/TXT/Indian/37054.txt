o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I'm giving this 4 instead of 5 because it still is not my favorite Indian Restaurant, BUT it is the best in the valley.
It's a modern take on good Indian food. Chicken Masala was fantastic. It was clearly grilled fresh, everything was top notched, you can tell they did not skimp on flavor or the fresh ingredients used to make the masala as other places do. The Butter Chicken was so savory that we can completely see why the UK is in love with this dish. The only thing negative I can think of is that we should have ordered more than 1 serving of rice. But that is something very, very small. We WILL go back again and order different dishes to fully try out everything this place has to offer.
