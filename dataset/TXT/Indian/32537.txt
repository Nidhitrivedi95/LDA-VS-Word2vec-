I usually just get the classic masala dosa I don't want to mess around too much with a good thing.  If you are looking for variety there are many options to choose from 
I have tasted the chaat masala dosa it is good , little salty
Coriander dosa is good 
Chana dosa is good 

Also get some mini idly to share 

The desserts all have a little savoury note to them but if you like the cardamom savoury flavour in your dessert then go right ahead, I'm told those are great too
