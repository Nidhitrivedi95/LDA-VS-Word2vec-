kkJVhJjF54GOk7ScR_tgIQ Driving back from a long weekend holiday in the Golden Horseshoe, tastebuds started asking for some good ole indian food. Based on our location and reading some reviews from fellow yelpers, decided to try out this place and the lunch buffet...Big mistake.

Decor- this place looks modern and has a nice feel to it. Its clean, although i didn't see any indian decor or feel any indian ambiance.

Value- the lunch buffet was 21.99+tax! Yikes! I don't mind paying good money for good food, but as you will read below the food was just not up to par. 

Food- with the exception of a few items such as the lamb kebob, chicken tikka, the rest of this buffet can be forgotten. Why did the goat biryani have no goat only rice? Why when asked to refill the tandoori chicken did it take half hour only to get pieces which looked dry and reheated? Why is the papad dry and not crispy? The whole buffet was just bland and not fresh at all

Maybe they had an off day? But at 21.99 the price didn't! I wouldn't try this place again.
