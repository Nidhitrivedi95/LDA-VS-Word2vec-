Yes, I know buffet foods aren't great, that's why I was really hoping I could order something off the menu. Nope, it's just a buffet.

Although there were a couple of vegan options, none of them were tolerable. Each plate seemed to be bad in it's own unique way. From over cooked to a poor balance of spice, indeed, there was an array of bad to try here.

But it's not all bad. The place looks nice and there is good seating. Also, is all you can eat. For me that meant picking at a couple plates and leaving to go grab a snack elsewhere.
