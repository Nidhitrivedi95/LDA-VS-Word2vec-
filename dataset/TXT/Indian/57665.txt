yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I actually like this place..I must say it's probably one of the best halal food place I've been in Arizona. I ordered a goat curry and a chicken masala. They're both good. The goat curry was more on the sweet side and I'm used to it (at other places) being on the salty and spicy side. Their garlic nann was pretty good, too.

Downside -- it's quite expensive..I don't know if I want to keep coming here..although the food was good, it was a bit too pricey for my range.
