3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA We went to eat at this restaurant today. It was my Husband Birthday and after reading the good reviews, we decided to go to this place. 
What a disappointment!, the food was cold, the taste nothing to impress, the waiter was rude, bossy and impatience with us. 
I do not recommend it.
