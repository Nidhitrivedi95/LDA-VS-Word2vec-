YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw Had an urge for some good Indian food - called this place for a takeout - the manager took the time to explain the menu and also made a couple of suggestions - I ended up ordering goat byriani and spinach with cheese -both dishes were amazing. Byriani was fresh and smelled amazing my two kids immediately demanded to try some - goat meat was tender and perfectly cooked. Spinach and cheese was outstanding - perfect consistency and great flavor along with a hint of cumin in it. Overall great restaurant - if you dine In ask for Joseph - great waiter and take out is also convenient
