NSaTps4xn23kPyGzjrMa4Q Tip:  If you're coming from Mavis/headed West on Britannia, enter on Plymouth as there isn't direct access into the plaza.  From Plymouth, drive behind the Staples, and turn left into the plaza.

Note:  Primarily takeout.  Just grab and go!  CASH & DEBIT ONLY.

The storefront isn't the cleanest.  Tables are off to one-side, not wiped off, most chairs are overturned, on top of the tables with a few chairs for patrons to wait/maybe eat quickly.

Samosas aren't on display, but kept somewhere behind the counter, so you hafta ask for them.  Prices are good though @3 veg for $1, chicken were 2/$1.  Veg Pakoras were $3.99/lb, a bit on the salty side.

Good thing were that both samosas/pakoras were served HOT.  Most likely they were double-fried, upon ordering, based on the colour.

I really don't eat Indian sweets, so I can't comment on them.
