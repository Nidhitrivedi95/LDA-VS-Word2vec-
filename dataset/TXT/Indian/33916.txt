Vegetarian dishes are forgettable, meat dishes taste disgusting. 
Eggplant dish was drenched in some brown sauce, I guess to mask the lack of eggplant?


The cook is the same guy who used to run "Saffron Tree" on Bay & Gerrard. He can cook some veg curry, but he cannot cook meat. He should not be a cook, really.

Avoid this place!
