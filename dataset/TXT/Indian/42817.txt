RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg This is some of the best Indian food I have ever had. The decor is clean and modern, and prices are very inexpensive. My mom and I are visiting Charlotte and came here this evening. The flavors were clean, fresh and delicious - the specific textures and flavors came out in the food, and there was no overpowering spiciness. Our waiter was friendly, had a very relaxed and calm demeanor, and was extremely helpful when it came to ordering. I've had Indian food in a lot of different places and this was honestly the best I can remember having.
