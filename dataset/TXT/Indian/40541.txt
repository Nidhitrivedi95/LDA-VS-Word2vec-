PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ Ouest of Parc Ave on Jean-Talon you'll find a plethora of indian restaurants. If you are a stranger to this part of town I can understand your anxiety towards choosing the right indian restaurant to wine and dine at. Fear not, Bombay Mahal is the light at the end of this tunnel of eateries. 

I've been going here for years, and I can say that it is one of the most consistent restaurants with the quality of their meals. So maybe it gets pretty hectic (Friday and Saturday nights tend to have a line up out the street - white folks love their naan) and sometimes service is slow but the wait is sooo worth it. I've seen my mother-in-law lick the butter chicken bowl clean, that's how good it is. TRUST ME! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

On an authenticity level, I can't say how similar it is to Indian food found in India since I've never been but I can tell you right now that it's always a good sign when you see Indian families enjoying a meal here. 

Bombay Mahal is vegetarian and vegan friendly and also BYOB (woohoo!) - they also have a great menu for larger groups (5+ people) where you can get whatever dishes you want on the menu all you can eat for $21.95 per person. Not bad if you want to indulge or are eating with a bunch of ogres ;)

Recommended dishes: aloo gobi (cauliflower dish), shani paneer (paneer in a tasty orange sauce), and baingan bharta (roasted eggplant). Yum!

Side tip: buy your booze at the SAQ or the Loblaws on Parc and Jean Talon. The liquor selection in this neck of town is weak in the depanneurs, unless you like drinking Red Stripe or Labatt's Blue then it's all good!
