-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g Very good Indian food. The service is very good. Wait wasn't long. We were a party of about 10 adults. Even though the order was pretty exhaustive, the food was served on time. The best part, special care and attention was given to kids! Will come back again for sure! Cheers.
