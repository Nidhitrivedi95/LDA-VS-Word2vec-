I had the special something masala dosa, and my friend ordered the cheese and tomato dosa.  Yum.  We also had the onion pakora and veggie samosa - really good, and all for less than $30 (a little over $30 with a good tip).

Check it out...the decor doesn't look like much, but it smells and tastes delicious!
