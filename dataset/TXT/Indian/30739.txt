kfwpXBsMQLqhUvscWB6b9g Absolutely amazing Buffett. The best spiced most varied and fresh Indian buffet in northeast Ohio. Hidden in a former donut shop Indian taste has the kindest most helpful owner I've ever met, and family working in the back, and with each bite you can tell the energy and effort that went into each dish. Plan to try take out ordering soon which the menu lists, want to try their Indian spicy! If you believe in supporting local businesses and want some culturally divergent food choices in this black hole of applebees and burger kings I highly suggest you try. If you don't like this food it's not the food, it's definitely you.
