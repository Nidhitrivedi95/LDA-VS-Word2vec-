UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Came to Banjara for dinner during the week. We ordered butter chicken, lamb biryani, aloo Gobi, shrimp pakora and garlic naan. Everything was delicious, portions were good and everytime our water glad was low the waitress would come by quickly to refill it.  The only annoying part of our meal was the flock of 5-6 huddled in a corner. It was great to have attentive service, but I don't like being stared at while I'm trying to eat.
