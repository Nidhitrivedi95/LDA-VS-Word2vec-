UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw Had been for afternoon buffet. I whole heartedly savored almost all the vegetarian dishes. I must say it's the best Indian buffet I have tried till date. I especially liked the Bhel puri, they have a unique recipe I believe. Both the south Indian and North Indian delicacies are equally worth the time and money.
