kbSSGo6zRPSdBT-CwG2cNg Great place for some Sri Lankan cheap eats. This is my favourite place to get some spring rolls. Theyre so soft compared to other places which is what I love. 

Prices are pretty standard. The service is also relatively quick. During lunch hours, especially on weekends, it does build up. Seems like they have some loyal fans. 

It's a grab and go restaurant. There's no place to be seated which is expected.
