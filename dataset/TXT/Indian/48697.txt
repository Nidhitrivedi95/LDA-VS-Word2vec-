The waiter was hesitant to recommend what I ordered because it wasn't his favorite and it was really wonderful (I ate vegetarian -- Baingan Bartha and a side of Aloo Paratha). Fast, friendly service, in a relaxed setting. It smells so good in here I wish I could stay all night!!  Don't miss this place!
