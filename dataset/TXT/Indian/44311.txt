rvHGv9Q7r5QkIYrCZlfoAQ I've been to pukka three times and always loved it!!!! The butter chicken and boatman curry are delicious. Almost all the curries are delightful! Lassi is good! And the apps are also good! The owner is very welcoming and warm and always comes around to make sure everyone is satisfied which is nice... Just too much money for what it is... If you are really craving Indian, pukka won't satisfy
