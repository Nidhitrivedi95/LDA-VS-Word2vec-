RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Awesome ambience.
Great service.
Stupendous food.
You wont hit upon better Indian food or a better Indian restaurant in the greater charlotte area.
Right from when you walk in--the decor, the ambience ---to the delectable desserts at the end---everything seems to hit the right note.
Personal favorite- vegetarian taste platter----assortment of vegetarian appetizers--each better than the others--in one word-delicious.
Also....chicken tikka masala...highly recommended.
And do not skip desert....they look fantastic and taste even better.
Haven't tried the weekend buffet yet...have heard great things about that though....will check it out soon.
