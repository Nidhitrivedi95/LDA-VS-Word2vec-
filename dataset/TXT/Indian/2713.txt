07ZateHZK5iqMxNs3g3r6Q I have attempted to sample the buffet here on three separate occasions.  The first time they did not have the buffet because of Ramadan.  The next attempt the restaurant was closed for AC issues.  Today I visited and there was no one to greet us and no buffet in site.  My coworkers now refer to this as the imaginary buffet.  It's great if you are on a diet.

The food I tried the first visit was pretty tasty, although their tandoor oven was out of order so they could not provide the naan we ordered.

Maybe they should have spent less on the chairs....
