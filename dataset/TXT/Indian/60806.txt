zR12ySz1Ew1qAP-yPJDHAQ Finally got a chance to try out this place, as I've heard a lot about it and it's not far from my house.

The wife and I went around 8:00pm on a Sunday night and it was empty. Literally. Not a soul in there. It was a bit weird at first, but within 5 mins another couple came in as well. But that was it.

The interior and atmosphere of the place was perfect, nice and cozy, great for a date night, and it smelled amazing as soon as you walked in.

We ordered the Elk Shikari and the Chicken Biryani, and shared them between the 2 of us.

Notes:

1)Flavors were amazing. Subtle spices, nothing overpowering, but the more you ate, the more you realized how bang on everything was. Just amazing food.

2)Huge portions. Good christ. We polished off the Elk but had to get most of the Biryani to go, we were so stuff. Honestly if you got an app to start, those two dishes could easily feed 4 people.

3)It was a bit pricey, but the portions are so big and the food so flavorfull, it's worth it to treat yourself.

4)The wine menu was pretty lacking, I'm not a big fan of VQA wines, which is all they have. I had the Shiraz which was better than I thought it would be but I would have liked more selection, especially for that price.

5)The staff were very nice, but kind of slow, especially considering there were so few people in there. 


Overall it was a great experience and I'm sure I'll be going back. A few nit picks here and there (my wife complained that the women's bathroom was really cramped but I thought the men's bathroom was really nice) but overall... highly recommended.
