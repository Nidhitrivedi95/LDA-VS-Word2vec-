g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA This review is based on a take out order that I received via postmates. I have driven past this place every time we go to the dog park. I attempted to visit this place once, but they were closed for break. Their door was unlocked and the employees were sitting at the tables doing nothing. We were turned away. I thought it was weird how NONE of the employees mentioned that they would be open again in 20 minutes. This is my only service experience for this place. 

I ordered the tikka paneer special that came with rice, paratha, raita, and onion. There was plenty of paneer and the flavor was delicious. All that food for $6.99! What a deal! Of course I had to have the chaat - I got the samosa chaat. It was such a wonderful blend of flavors. Mind you, I've never had chaat before, so I have nothing to compare it to. It was quite "hot" spicy, and I was pretty full from the curry - but I can't wait to have its left overs tomorrow! I also ordered a slice of mango cake. I was thoroughly impressed with the cake. It was not too sweet and the cake was so perfectly spongy and moist. I also received a container of white stuff....it had some cheese like substance in it - in the shape of one of those babybel cheeses. If anyone knows what I'm talking about, let me know what it is! I tried it...but I'm not sure my palette knew how to respect it.  


I'm very curious about the pizzas. I'll definitely be back here!
