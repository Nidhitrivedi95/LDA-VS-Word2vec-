o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg The chilli chicken was good and up to the mark. The biryani Was properly spiced but a little less on the number of pieces in it and the masala. The take home option was a bit delayed as it took them almost 45 mins. They did treat us nice with a complementary mango lassi while the wait. Would recommend this place!
