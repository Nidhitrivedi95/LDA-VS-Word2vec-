IbiPt7jzF8Wsu82nHXaJPA Nice addition to the Vegas Indian/Nepali food scene. Steamed chicken momo to start was fantastic. Will definitely get those again. And a boneless goat dish that was seasoned incredibly was also good. Boneless lamb saagwala was also very good. 
Ordered our items at medium 5 spice, and it definitely had some kick. Will probably order a 3 or 4 next time. 
Time it took to get the order out was a bit long, but I will just assume they were taking their time to get it perfect. 

Definitely a place to add to your normal rotation for Indian food.
