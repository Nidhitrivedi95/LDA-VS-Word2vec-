NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I never have been particularly fond of Indian food.  That is due to my tradition American childhood of basically pizza and fast food.  I could never get use to the Aromatic spices that Indian food is so known for.  However, I noticed the great reviews and photos while on business in the Cleveland area and decided to give this nontradition approach to the cuisine a try.  WOW! I must say a hugh thank you to the owners and staff for reintroducing me to their version of Indian "fast causal" cuisine.  From the outstanding decor, the quick order process, easily understood menu, helpful staff, quick service and last but not least amazing food I personnely have a new found cuisine to enjoy and explore further.  The BBQ lamb meal was very tastey and the basmati rice cooked perfectly.  The freshly baked naan brought the meal together.  I will make this establishment a frequent stop, business or pleasure.
