MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g Will list out the pros and cons for this much overrated and expensive place:
PROS:
- Clean/Nice ambiance 
- Variety of Dishes
- Bakery/Ice Cream section
- Location is convenient (probably why this place is running still)
- I had their Chaat, Curries, and Dosa (Dosa and Chaat was good)

Neutral:
- Staff is ok.  The person at the register didn't really seem to want to be there

CONS:
- Prices are very high for the Phx area (and i'm from SF area)
- Food quality is ok.  The Curries are mediocre and the Naan was not that great either (don't go there for their north Indian Cuisine) - there are many other places much better
- They use paper/foam/plastic products. Way too much trash and considering their prices they should be able to afford real silverware/dishes/cups
 
I wouldn't go there again due to the prices and what you get for it.  There are many other better restaurants in the valley that are a nicer, with better food quality, sit down with real silverware and a more attentive staff.
