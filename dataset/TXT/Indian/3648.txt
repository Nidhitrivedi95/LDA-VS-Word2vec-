0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ We are a regular diners at this place, and have found it to be one of the most consistent places to have Hakka Chinese. I have stopped going to the biggies of Mississauga ever since. Their hot n sour soup, dry beef, chilli chicken, chop suey (request spicy), and at times have requested variations in their existing items. I must say that their chef knows his cooking, and honors request without a flaw. I'd easily give them a 5 star if they could expand the seating capacity.
