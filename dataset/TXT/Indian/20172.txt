fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA This guy... Really. Walked in and it looked busy and based on the Zomato and Yelp rating I assumed this was a great place. The buffet looked fresh and busy too. Loads of variety. From there on it went downhill. Came in to get a takeaway. Asked the guy at the cashier what was the better selling Chicken dish, butter chicken or chicken tikka masala. He told me they are two completely different things. Duh. I didn't ask that. I asked which one you thought was a better selling one. Then he continued to argue with me about how Malai Kabab and tandoori and all the others were not kababs. Long story short, silly misunderstanding but he continues to argue. Whatever happened to the 'customer is always right' motto.
Refrained from typing this review out till after we tasted the food. Really dude with food that tastes that bad how do you manage to have that much arrogance and that attitude. Yeah, not going back there again.
I rarely ever give out bad ratings but this one deserves a negative rating really.
Positives: Malai KABAB was decent and so was the sheekh.
