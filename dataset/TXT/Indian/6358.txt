3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA In search of the best Indian food in Toronto, my mom and I decided to try Curry Twist after having driven past it the day before we went to eat there. A humble venue with pleasant decor and aromatic scents. 

We ordered the naan which was hot and fresh, an aloo dish,  the butter chicken, and lamb madras. All extremely fresh-tasting and flavorful with moist meat. The portions seem small as they come in fancy little silverware but don't be fooled -- the small pots seem like they're bottomless. We shared our dishes and left so satisfied. And the service was great too--the young men who served us were nice and attentive so thanks to them for a good first experience as well!

Will definitely go again (if only I lived closer to the junction)!
