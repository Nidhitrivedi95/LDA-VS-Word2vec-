K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g We drove 18 miles for this restaurant and we ordered appetizers which were half cooked and then for main course we ordered vegetables along with naan, kulchas , kulchas came after 45 min and by that time vegetables were all cold, lacha paratha were weird, it seemed they friend frozen roti and served us. I have never seen such bad management where they did not cared for their customers.
