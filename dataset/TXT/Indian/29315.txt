JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Horrible customer service. I will never go back the owner lady is so rude she should not be in front taking orders or deal with customers. The food was okay after a long wait but missing authentic flavor they just named it Indian but it's not authentic Indian food coz no body knows the real authentic food should taste and presentation is horrible on top of that arguing owner lady was big no no for me .
