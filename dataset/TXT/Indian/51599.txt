UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Awesome food experience, especially the combination of non vegetarian foods with vegetarian stuffs. Chicken korma is one must thing to be tried. There is not one dish that I can say was sort of out of line because every single one of them was finger licking good. 
Ofcourse, one should never miss the gulab jamun (indian dessert dipped in sugar).
