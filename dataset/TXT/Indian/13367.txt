bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug The renovations they did to this restaurant are nice. I usually get take out and bring the food home though. The chicken pakoras are delicious. This is the only place I will buy them. However sometimes they take it overboard with the pepper! So if really spicy is not your thing just let them know to make the food less spicy.
