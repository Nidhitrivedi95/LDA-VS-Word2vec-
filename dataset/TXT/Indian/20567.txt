fZGTgKUNKKuOKC2tg4pQFw Came at 9:30 on a Thursday night and the restaurant was empty.  Felt bad but we were starving so we ate quickly and tipped heavy.

The food was outstanding!  Honestly the best Indian food I've ever had.  The Mulligitawney was fantastic and we were dipping our assorted naan in it!  Try the stuffed naan for a special treat. 

We also had the beef Samosas and chicken vindaloo, both great.

There are a lot of Indian restaurants in Pittsburgh, this one stands out.  Highly recommended
