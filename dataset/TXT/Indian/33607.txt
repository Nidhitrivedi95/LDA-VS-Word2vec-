lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw Halal meat is served here. Owners are Muslim. Ordered take out from here.  Had the veal steak pieces (was good), the chicken szechwan (good) and the beef and chicken with cheese (didnt have enough cheese for me).  Food was a bit pricey, but good amount of food/meat for the money.  Nice interior of restaurant with friendly service. The garlic sauce was good too.  Will have to come back again to try out some of the mocktails and desserts
