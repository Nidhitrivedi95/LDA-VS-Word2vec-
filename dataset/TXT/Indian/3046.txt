0d_aewXm7wVlaTW8Glzxdw I think the main fault with this restaurant is the size of the menu. I understand that they want to include both Indian and Chinese dishes, but aside from a few hakka dishes, it's largely a Chinese restaurant with an Indian section on this menu. Compared to Hakka Garden for example, the Hakka elements on the menu seem a lot more forced. Going back to the sheer multitude of items on the menu, I think it just makes it impossible to have everything be fresh. The wonton soup (probably a lesser ordered item) was a disaster. Bland broth and stale wontons. Even a generous serving of salt and paper couldn't hide the fact that it was nearly inedible. 
Another disappointment was the vegetable stir-fry had this gelatinous, almost lumpy sauce that was kind of tasty in a weird way, but I highly doubt this was the intended execution for the dish. I wasn't impressed by the canned mushrooms it had either. 
The pakoras were good (made much better with generous helpings of the chili sauce) and the butter chicken was delicious for the first few bites, but I really don't think it's necessary to deep-fry chicken when it's already in a cream-based sauce. 

There are nice touches here, particularly the mango ice cream that they give after the meal, which is unnecessarily generous. It's a nice neighborhood take-out place but it's a little too inconsistent to go frequently.
