72KojSHoxp8DissRtcXn-g A must try in Toronto: Butter Chicken Mac n Cheese !! New Restaurant @hellojitoronto on St.Clair Ave W serves this delicious cheesey baked pasta. If you are a fan of pasta or mac n cheese, this has your name written all over it!

Attended a dinner at @hellojitoronto which offers Indian/Canadian comfort food. Chef Kirti Singh has combined ordinary pub comfort food with eclectic Indian flavour.

Harsh Chawla and Derek Valleau are the same owners from @pukkatoronto and bring you the same quality of cuisine combined with your favourite comfort food.

Tried quite a few things on the menu:
Butter chicken mac n cheese, naanchos topped with lamb keema & raita cheddar, brisket poutine with masala fries paneer and pulled beef curry! All highly recommended to order when you visit Ji
