0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ There is something about places that are quick to serve. Chilli chicken house is my go to when I want to have hakka chinese and when I want it fast. Never been disappointed with the service. 
Love the beef dishes here. Chilli beef, beef in black bean sauce, broccoli beef. The chicken dishes are good too. 
I really love their lunch and dinner specials. You can order an item off the specials menu with a side of rice and its just the right serving size and price for one person.
