0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg I was really torn with this place. Typical Indian restaurant in a strip mall. Not a good choice for a date night. You have to go up and order and clear your own plates off the table. I gave the lower rating because I hate fast food and like paying the money to be waited on. But the food was very good. My husband is Indian and enjoyed the authentic flavors. The chili paneer was very good but spicy. Also loved the dosa. Would have given a higher star if the atmosphere was better and we were served.
