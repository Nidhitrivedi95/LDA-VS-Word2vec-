gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I think I've found my new favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas! 

They have a good sized menu that has very good descriptions to help you if you aren't super familiar with Indian food.   

We ended up getting the non-veg Thali which is about 22 bucks.  It seemed like not enough food at first and we were worried we'd have to order more but we left fully satisfied with stuffed bellies.  

I really liked how they allowed us to substitute items (I love jalfrezi) and choose what dessert we wanted. 

I also really appreciated that the server had a good amount of patience for us and made sure we were getting exactly what we wanted. 

We can't wait to come back and get a full order of lamb jalfrezi.  So good!
