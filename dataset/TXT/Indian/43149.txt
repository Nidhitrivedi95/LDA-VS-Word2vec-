RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA Upon entering RED FORT I felt very out of place. The staff were unwelcoming, and after 40 minutes one of the three waiters who had consistently served the guests next to me, inquired as to what flavor beverage I would like as my 'WELCOME DRINK'. After expressing my disappointment in their level of service [thus far] I witnessed an immediate change, in both the staff and the overall atmosphere.


 The food was well above par, deserving of an A++. It is the right place to visit if you are in search of a meal that is sure to stick to your ribs (ensure you are full/satisfied). The location is ideal and the price is especially superb if you are a student (as students are given 10% off their total meal price).


 Slow to start that is for sure, but definitely an overall excellent experience.
