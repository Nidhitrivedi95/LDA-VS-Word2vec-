TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Tonight was the second time my husband Duncan and I ate here.  It was even better than the first time.  We had a great deal off of Groupon that included 2 entrees, 2 glasses of wine and rice.  We ordered an appetizer that i cant remember the name of but had a really good cold yogurt sauce, and almost tasted like dessert.  We ordered The Okra and chicken curry both Extra extra spicy. I said I wanted to breathe fire, lol.  It was perfect!  The dinner actually got spicier as we ate.  We also had leftovers to take home.  Thank you we will be back.  And as a side note especially if you use "groupon" people, be sure to tip generously!
