PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA Wish I could give this place negative stars. Waited OVER an hour for an order of chicken curry. The employees seemed to have no sense of urgency at all. They would stop to fill up water containers even though there were about a dozen people waiting. When we finally got the curry, it was watery and the chicken was dry. Not worth the wait or money. Ill never ever go here again.
