e3D-zDL66uIaTFOdjJv8SQ I've been here a few times a long while ago, and recently decided to give it another shot. The location has been home to North Indian cuisine for about twenty years now, what used to be Sangam Restaurant, has been home to Chauhan for about 10 years. 

He used to be a chef at a huge restaurant in New Delhi, then part of the Host's team in Toronto (when it was located at the south east corner of Bay and Bloor in the late 90s). Since the break, Chauhan's specialized in Indian cuisine with a distinctly Punjabi taste a la Peel Region(a little oily and a little more spicy). Though, not my favourite and that's probably what kept me away for a few years. I'm pleased to say that he once again returned to his foundation of typical New Delhi-esque Indian cuisine. 

On my visit here during lunch, I found the service quite decent and the waiter was courteous and all smiles, so kudos on the quality despite the thin staff. 
Though the food is fantastic, fresh and inspiring, I would return more frequently if a bit more attention was paid to the presentation of the dishes in the buffet. It would make the already delicious items look miles more tantalizing.
