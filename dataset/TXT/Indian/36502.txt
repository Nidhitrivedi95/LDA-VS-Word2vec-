NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg My favorite restaurant for lunch or dinner.  I have a toddler son who also loves to eat here!  The staff is friendly, the seating area is spacious and clean.  The food is amazing.  I am a vegetarian and usually get samosas and chickpea masala. I've also had the beet salad which is delicious as well.  There is something for everyone on the menu- whether you eat everything and anything like my husband or are gluten free or vegan.  I eat here at least twice a month.
