Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Its a good place to get ur dose of Indian food when in Vegas. Its almost in the middle of the strip. They had a dinner buffet going on when we went their. They had really great samosas and biryani. They even gave us complementary drink with the buffet. Would surely satisfy indian taste buds.
