bswktkxTqTFdhg8uvcuWWw I can't tell you how ecstatic I was to find authentic Pakistani food so close to Vaughan. The interior was well-appointed and clean, the staff was prompt and helpful, I git a lot more for the money, and the food was just exceptional. They also take more forms of payment than a lot of places in, say, Brampton :-) I highly recommend the nihari it is exquisite and spot-on. I will definitely be back.
