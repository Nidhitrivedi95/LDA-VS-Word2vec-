Ok so the samosas are good and cheap. I will probably be back for those! If I only had samosas, I'd give 4 stars. Partially because you don't need a fork to eat them. 

But I ordered the Daal combo with curry, a samosa, rice, salad and a pop. And I didn't get a fork, or any napkins. Also, I wasn't given any salad. When I went back to acquire these lacking things, I was told I didn't pay for them. Ugh. 

When my meal was finally up to standard, and I was granted cutlery to consume it, I was under-impressed. The curry has a weird aftertaste, the rice was cooked with too much water and is falling apart, and the salad had a base of parsley. 

I had high hopes for this place, but since it's one of the only grange standards that is open on Sunday I'm sure it will do well. Just needs some fine-tuning.
