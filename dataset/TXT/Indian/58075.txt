yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw YUP! Trust be, it really was that bad, in fact, I created a yelp account just to give this restaurant a review. Look, I am not a bitter person, but in the past 6 months or so, i have seen this restaurant go from bad to worse and feel a little annoyed that every time i go and try to encourage this restaurant, their service gets worse and so does the food! They don't seem to care anymore, so... now it is time to warn others... 
I just asked for Poori and curry, but what I got was a half fried poori (it was totally raw in places and it felt like I had ordered it with a side of oil ! Not light and fluffy like it should be.The curry had no flavour, it was only because of the condiments that I was able to eat it .... 

The Aloo Tikka for the appetizers was pretty damn bad too, i mean it was like eating a patties made out of powdered potato or something, Again, no flavour in that, the naan had residue of some sort on them and the okra curry... pfft... im sick of typing.. u get the point right? 

Shame really... it used to be pretty good about a year ago...and I was their number one supporter... NOT anymore!
