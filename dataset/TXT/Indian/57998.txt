yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Excellent food.  I just love ethnic food. especially India Food.  My husband and I call it fun food as it is so much fun to eat.  The Dhaba is our favorite restaurant for this cuisine.  I love to get the combo plate so to speak, the one that has several dishes.    I ate here about a month ago besides several other times in the past and have never been disappointed in any way.  Can't wait to go back again.  One more thing;  it is also a beautiful restaurant and the staff are very sweet!
