TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw India Palace has been my go-to Indian food spot for a while now. I stick to lunch buffets as I don't really mess with dinner at most Indian restaurants; its usually just the same served a la carte at higher prices. 

Palace along with majority of the all the Indian restaurants in town is located in a somewhat shady area just north of UNLV. While the area might suck, IP is probably the nicest building in the area which helps a bit. 

Going into a Indian lunch buffet I know exactly what I want to eat: chicken tikka (the boneless chicken chunks in the creamy orange sauce), saag (spinch dip with extra butter), samosas, rice and naan. Based of this, India Palace delivers a great lunch buffet. The food is refreshed regularly (frequency depends on how busy it is) and the quality has been consistent. My one gripe is that they never give you enough naan and make you wait when you request more.

The restaurant as I mentioned is pretty nice, recently renovated and is great for large groups or more intimate meetings but the parking is terrible. Service is average, they've messed up my check several times and I have had to call them out on it every time. 

Remember the yelp check in for a free mango lassie (only 1 per table wtf?) and the yelp deal!
