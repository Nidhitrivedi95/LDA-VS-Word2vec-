8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Hands down best Indian food in the Champaign-Urbana area. Good location. Priciest of all the options but a great deal considering the quality of food. Let me start with the lassi, which they make. It is the perfect consistency not too thick- to die for. Then, their samosas and fried paneer are just perfectly done and spiced. The butter chicken curry, malai kufta, and lamb vindaloo are all amazingly mouthwatering. The flavor is done just right. The meat and vegetables are pronounced and mix subtly well with the spices. So good. The basmati rice is freshly cooked and the naan is warm and soft. But definitely try their aloo paratha- that is one decision you will never regret! My stomach is growling now... But to finish off they have a nice selection of desserts which includes mango kulfi that comes sliced like a cake! A+ for taste and presentation. So much better than Bombay Grills which tasted like a 7-11 Slushie! I would definitely go to Sitara over any other restaurant in Champaign-Urbana 100 times out of 100.
