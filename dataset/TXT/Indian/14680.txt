cCMyypY73m9GJBKI4RvFcw Finally tried Namaste, at Bill F's YERRAA suggestion, and it was pretty rad.

First of all, they have Tandoori vegetables and a Tandoori Paneer dish. This is ridiculously rare, despite it being the awesomest way to cook vegetables ever. 

Secondly, they have the BEST garlic naan I have ever tasted. Seared close to black in places, puffy and light, salty, garlic everywhere, some ghee but not a ton. Better than the best garlic knots you've ever had. 

But the service was kinda weird: our apps went missing, no raita for me, the spice levels on our entrees were switched, kind of a bummer. The waiter that we had, while cool and conversational, wasn't there when we ordered; perhaps that's why things got so garbled, as the hostess who sat us seemed very unsure of herself. The pepper plate that came with our (free!) parathas was overly sweet for my taste, but that didn't stop me from eating a ton of the tomato and onion chutney. 

This place has the potential to be some of the best Punjabi food in Charlotte. I make the distinction because Woodlands does both North and South Indian so well, that its at a whole other level of awesome. If they can iron out the service kinks, Namaste will become my favorite North Indian restaurant and get lots of my money. We'll see!
