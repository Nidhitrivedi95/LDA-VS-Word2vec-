iDCAMAg7XPBx2g-82AIsgg After leaving the office late, I wanted delicious take-out to go home. Stopped by this place on my way home and noticed it was open until 6am! And the selection of dishes with different spices, sauces, veggies and meats was amazing! 

When ordering, I asked for mild choices, and the owner let me try five different dishes :) Here's the thing: the food was not heated up, and because he used a styrofoam plate, I did not want it heated. At home, we noticed the meat was perhaps not fully cooked... the one-minute heat-up in the microwave was not enough... the texture of the chicken was slightly raw... it probably needed some time stove-top to fully cook the meat. As well, when the food is served warm (as opposed to tasting it cold), the spices are very hot! I ended up spending part of the night awake with stomach pains and having to take antacids.
The next day was better, as I fully cooked what was left over and ate it with plain yogourt to tone down the spices.

Of note: there are no side-dish prices on the board in the restaurant, so you need to check a take-out menu. I only wanted the dish, no rice, no drink. However, I think that four small containers (two veggie, two meat) for $37 was a surprise; I wonder if I was charged the combo price. Either that, or the containers are bigger than they look.
The owner asked me if I would like naan bread, made fresh, that he had available immediately, to which I said sure, but that ended up taking about seven minutes to prepare.

In all, I would say this is a good place, and I may return, but I would be more careful next time about what I order. Some dishes are very strong, with whole spices, as opposed to powdered, and quite spicy. I would also ask if the meat is fully cooked when getting take-out.
