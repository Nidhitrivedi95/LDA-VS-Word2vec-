o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg One of my favorite Indian restaurants in Charlotte. The service is superb, truly professional. The food is excellent with a wide variety of dishes that are all distinct. The staff is welcoming to everyone and very patient. 

Spiciness is variable to one's preference. I usually like spicy food and it is perfect when I order spicy. Definitely will visit again.
