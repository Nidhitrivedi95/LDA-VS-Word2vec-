5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q I will agree with all the other reviews written at this time...the food IS delicious, definitely 5 star! However, the amount of time to get our food was extremely long. My food was received 10 minutes after my dining companion's and our appetizers were brought out separately 10 and 15 minutes after my food, which was almost 50 minutes after we originally placed our food orders. Maybe it's an Indian dining custom I'm not familiar with??

The staff was friendly, but very soft spoken. The place is clean, yet sparse on decor with only music being played in the kitchen. 

We'll give them some more time to gain more operational experience and then go back for more of their excellent food.
