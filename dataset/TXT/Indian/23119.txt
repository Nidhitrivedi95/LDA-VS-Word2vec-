gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A We were all craving Indian one night in Vegas (we were staying a little off the strip) and decided to order take out from this place, because of the great reviews. SO happy we did, the food was delicious (Chicken Tikka Masala, naan, etc.) with a good amount of chicken in the dishes and plenty of rice to have left-overs for the next day. AND we even came back later that week, because we couldn't get enough of the great food. Really nice owner too!
