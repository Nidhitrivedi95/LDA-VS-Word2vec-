tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Holy crap! I was looking for a good chicken curry and low and behold this is it! Since moving down here from the frigid North, I am constantly on the lookout for the good places to eat.  I found this one on my way home from work.  Soooo good.  The buffet is hot, the curry is hotter and the nann is outstanding! If you have been here, you know what I'm saying. If you haven't been here... Don't wait.  Grab the keys, load up the family and come get some great food!
