zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q The chicken tikka masala is really good, but the star of the show is the naan!  OH-EM-GEE, it is gooooood!   I'll be back just for the naan.  As an aside, the menu has three options for heat -- mild, hot and spicy.  I typically like mine in the middle, so I ordered hot, but it was still a little too spicy for me, so I'll go with mild next time.
