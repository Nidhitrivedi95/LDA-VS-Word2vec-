If your a lover of indian food, but are kinda tired of the same old flavoured curries, get yourself over to Avani. The food is absolutely tasty. I have never been to an indian restaurant that takes typical North American flare and blends it so well with Indian spices the ( Tandoori Fire Roasted Rack of Lamb) is unreal. The chilli paneer is also very good. Be careful not to indulge to much on the apps. Roomali Roti...very good.

If your planning on a weekend visit, they don't take reservations, so be prepared to wait. With that said, I was with a party of 4 and I didn't have to wait for more than 15mins.

The service does leave a little bit to be desired, and that is the only reason i won't give this place 5 stars. I mean really, how many times do I need to ask for water, before someone actually brings it..try 5.

The decor is beautiful, very modern with a very ethnic touch.

if your looking for a nice indian place for dinner or lunch, this will surely impress you.
