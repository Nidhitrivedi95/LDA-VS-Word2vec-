The staff was really friendly and helpful. 
I got the Saturday lunch special for $6.99 - it had rice, naan, butter chicken and chickpea curry. 
I found the food quite bland. I didn't think that one could ever say that about Indian food! 
The naan seemed to be more Greek style pita than naan. It was dry, old and reheated. 
Lastly, I ordered the kulfi which was $3,99 plus tax, took one bite and threw it out - it was the cheap stuff that was priced at the price point of the real kulfi. 
I won't be going back here.
