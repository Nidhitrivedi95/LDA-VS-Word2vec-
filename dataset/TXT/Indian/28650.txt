JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg I am an Indian guy and am pretty familiar with different cuisines from India. 

I came down from Boston (USA) for a business trip and tried this place after reading the reviews on Yelp.

To be honest with you, This place is not good at all.. I tried many places in USA, this is worst of all. I have ordered Chicken Vindaloo and Chicken Biryani. 


 Chicken Vindaloo is OK. I have specifically asked them to make spicy and hot. It was bland for me. Chicken Biryani was a disaster. I don't know why they have used raisins in Biryani!! Absolutely wrong. The thing that pissed me off is .. they don't provide any gravy or Raita with the Biryani. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM SEEING A RESTAURANT WHERE THEY DON'T PROVIDE GRAVY AND RAITA WITH THE BIRYANI. Above all, Biryani is spicy but doesn't give any taste.

Absolutely ridiculous.. 
Anyway, If you are not all familiar with Indian food and just want something Indian.. you can try this.
