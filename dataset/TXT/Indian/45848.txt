SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg I tried Bollywood again after not going for many months.  My main peeve, as before is that the lunch buffet is lukewarm at best.  This time I asked to have my plate microwaved and it was much better hot!  They've really watered down the raita and other sauces.  Spice is mild and the food is flavorful.  They have a good selection of vegetarian entrees.  Dinner has been good here before -- I'd avoid the combo special -- the eggplant dishes were superb.  Dinner pricing is considerably more than the $9.99 7-day lunch buffet they're currently offering.  I won't be going back soon.
