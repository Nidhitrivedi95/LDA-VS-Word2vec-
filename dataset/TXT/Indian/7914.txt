6P4ZzCdd_YQqncnQv1jplQ My husband and I eat Indian food on a regular basis. Usually we go down to tempe to the numerous awesome Indian restaurants down there but yesterday we were kinda lazy--and it was raining so we decided to order take out closer to home. I found Haweli on yelp and placed our order: karabi paneer, fish curry, garlic naan, plain naan and EXTRA rice. 

They left out the plain naan and the rice was about 1/3 of a cup which is unacceptable for two entrees--even for one. Definitely no extra rice.

Too bad cause the food was really tasty--not as good as tempe but good enough that we would have gone back on a regular basis considering the amount of Indian food that we eat and that is it so much closer to home. 

They lost two customers that would have spent a lot of money just so that they can save a few pennies on rice.
