FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw This is the best Indian restaurant in Madison, in my opinion. The food quality is exceptional and the price is very reasonable, especially for lunch buffet. The mix of food is well chosen, varying from Punjabi to South Indian to Indo Chinese to West Indian. The ambience is great at dinner time and above average during lunch buffet. Go try the mango icecream if you are a fan of Indian desserts.
