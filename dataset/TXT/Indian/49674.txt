tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Hands down the best Indian Buffet I've had (out of a dozen or so).  1st I've seen here for a buffet:: _fresh_ garlic naan delivered to table, mango lassi, _thick_ sauces, mango pickle didn't cost extra, and buffet at dinner (not just lunch).  On top was good service, a nice number of vegetarian and meat dishes, and 4 or 5 desert options on the buffet.
