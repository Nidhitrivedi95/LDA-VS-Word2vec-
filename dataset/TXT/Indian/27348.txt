ImFTARxxeD-nVZMje1Ckew Great little spot in the Old Port. 

It's a cozy little shotgun resto on PLace D'Youville, with exposed brick and just the right decor level. It doesn't try to be some fancy upscale place, yet makes a great spot for a date. The lighting is a bit on the romantic side. 

Food is excellent - delicious everything. No weak spots. 

Service is fair.

If you're in the Old Port, definitely go for this place.
