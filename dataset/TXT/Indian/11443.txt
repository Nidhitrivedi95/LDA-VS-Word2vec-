AHrfxUnE1LdhtWTtujFMDw Great taste of food. Ordered steamed chicken MoMos. The flour layer on momo is not thick unlike other Tibetan restaurants in the area. Which is a good thing.

Stir fried noodles was good as well as the vegetarian okra dish. 4 star only because the quantity was less for the price. ( noodles and vegetarian dish)
