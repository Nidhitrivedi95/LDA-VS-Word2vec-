abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg Ate at the Rickshaw Bar last night and it was a fantastic experience. I went in with fairly high expectations based on reviews and it lived up to those and more. All the food was spot on and had the perfect amount of kick to the dishes with some spice.

If I went again, I would love to try some other items but very tempted to stick with the dishes I had knowing how top notch they were. If you go, you definitely need to try the brussel sprouts, cauliflower, naan kebab (clearly the highlight), ismaili beef curry and spiced coconut chicken. That was a lot of food for two people but it would be hard to cut any of those items out they were so good.
