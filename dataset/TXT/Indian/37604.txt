OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Very good to excellent indian cuisine in this little hole in the wall.  The tandoori chicken and naan breads are standouts. We were here twice and the prototypical
Curries, kormas, and vindaloos were all very good.
The place is small with few tables and there are a couple of places to eat sitting on the floor, if you wish. Darbar has a nice ambience but can get crowded easily. Its family owned and operated and the proprietors are as nice as can be which is  something rare these days in this increasingly anonymous restaurant world. The price points are good but not cheap. If you are in the area its certainly better than going up to the curry joints on Jean Talon for cheaper,but, not as refined indian food.
