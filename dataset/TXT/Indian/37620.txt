OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I had an incredible experience here. We got seated in just a few minutes despite the place being full. We got to sit in an amazing little den where you sit cross legged and have pillows and small tables. So much fun. They also have plenty of regular seating if you prefer.
I ordered a chicken appetizer, some plates that had 10 items each so you could try a lot of things, and a butter chicken and naan, and mango lassis. It was THE BEST Indian food I've ever had...and I've been to quite a few places! The flavours got better with each bite. I was in absolute heaven.
The service was great. Quick friendly no mistakes.
Will definitely  return here next time I'm in Montreal.
