Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Recently moved into the area and came across this Hakka restaurant. Delicious food with lots of flavour. The Manchurian fried rice & chilli chicken are just a few, If you like it spicy just ask. You can tell the owners & cook truly care about their customers and take pride in the dishes they serve.  Also, this place just started offering delivery.
