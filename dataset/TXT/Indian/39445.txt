OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA My family and I go here every now and then.  We don't go as frequently as we used to because, like anything, you can get tired of the same old thing.  The menu items haven't changed.  Although they have duck on the menu, which was pretty good, you can't seem to order it.  Not sure why the items remain on the menu.  Green beans with garlic are extremely oily from being fried. I wouldn't recommend unless you like oil.  I had read that the pakora here were really good.  Tried them and would order them more often than not.  Chicken pakora are mushy inside and probably under-cooked. Shrimp and beef not bad, veggie I would pass on.  I was there two days ago and chose not to order the pakora since they have changed their prices yet again.   I'm pretty sure you used to get 12 pieces for $10.   Recently the price was changed to 10 pieces for $10.00.  Hand written in the menu as of two days ago (not sure when this change happened), the pakora are now way over priced at 5 pieces for $10.00. RIP OFF. A couple strikes against this in-need-of a desperate makeover restaurant will have me going elsewhere from now on.  Too bad for them.  We are usually a group of 6 and I will definitely spread the word to friends who are regulars.  Their pricing hits me in my pocketbook... we are going to take the opportunity to have them feel the same.   Good luck.  Try No. 1 Hakka on Kennedy Rd., south of Eglinton Ave. in Scarborough.  Glad I pulled over and tried this place yesterday.  Great food, more variety and a way cleaner looking dining room compared to Lin Garden.
