K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw Second time today, first time was takeout about 6 weeks ago, we ordered the butter chicken, saag paneer, rice and naan. The meal was awesome! Couldn't be better! Today my family and I had the lunch buffet, and again, perfect in every way! We left a 20<U+2105> tip because the service was so attentive. The buffet has all the favourites, the food was fresh and replenished often, the restaurant was clean and orderly, waiter was there to fill water constantly and plates cleared quick. Staff was friendly. Great place for a date, comfy seats and setting for lounging and chatting. This is our fav Indian place now, good value!
