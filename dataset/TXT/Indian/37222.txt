o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ So I had a craving for roti, and Bacchus Roti in Parkdale was closed, so I found this place on Ritual. My boyfriend had the butter chicken roti which was delicious. We saw the other reviews and got a mild/medium which equated to the medium spice that we like. I got the curry roti, which wasn't as flavourful, but still good. I saw other complaints of not enough chicken, but our rotis had a good amount of filling. No complaints, but I probably wouldn't crave this place like I crave other roti establishments.
