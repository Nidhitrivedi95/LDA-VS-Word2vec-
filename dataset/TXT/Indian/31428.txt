ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw I have been there several times, mostly on a Friday to take out for Spouse and I.  The food is good and the gravy very rich.  Nice quality basmati rice.  The service is perfunctory, at best, but what do you want for an inexpensive meal?  The place is a bit of a "hole in the wall" but don't be put off by it.  I particularly like the masala mix of the curry there.
