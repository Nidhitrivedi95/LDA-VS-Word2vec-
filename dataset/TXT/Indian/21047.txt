GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA Too good. The quality and quantity of food they offer for such low price is kind of fantastic. This is the only indian restaurant in Arizona where I ate stomach full and charged under $10. Even though the prices are low, the taste/quality of the food is better than many other Indian restaurants. In addition to the good food and ambience, the service is excellent too. They are pleasant, courteous and prompt. This is my new favorite.
