MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw Just had dinner here for my birthday! 
I heard from a friend it was an amazing romantic classy restaurant so without hesitation we reserved a table of even checking the reviews!
Our server never came to check on the food.
I wanted to make a complaint because the food was so bland and had no flavour but he never stuck around long enough to listen.
He was a nervous wreck!
Our appetizer was too salty and the food had no flavour! 
For being in an Indian restaurant you would think there would be spices but there was nothing ..it looked nice and tasted and when you went to eat it .. disappointment ..
Very upset .. especially because we came for my birthday and it was suppose to be a special evening .. and it was not at all.
The owner was running around doing nothing.
The ambiance is nice but like we didn't pay for ambiance ..
