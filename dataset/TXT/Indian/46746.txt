t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Went back here recently with friend in town who loves Indian food.  The food was EXCELLENT as always.  We ordered 4 naans and about 5 entrees, and enjoyed them all immensely.  The bullet naan was thick and filled with tastiness.  The peshwari naan for dessert remains one of our favorites.  We also enjoyed a dal, and some other vegetarian options.  My friend asked them to cook the dal in oil instead of butter and they happily obliged.  

Regarding some of the 1 review wonders who complain about how terrible the service is or how they have gotten sick...I have eaten here at least 15 times and neither myself or anyone with me has ever gotten even a mild upset stomach, and the service is always friendly and good.  

For those who miss the restaurant.com certs (as I do)...the waiter told us (might be the owner) that they are planning to return to restaurant.com, so watch for it I guess.  ALSO...I printed out a coupon from moneymailer.com (I think thats the site...google saffron flavors of india coupon)...it is the site that runs those envelopes of coupons you get in the mail every couple of months or so.  Anyway, you can print the coupon from the site directly and take it in..it was $10 off 40 or 1 entree free with 1 purchased with 2 drinks.  It isn't restaurant.com, but it helps.
