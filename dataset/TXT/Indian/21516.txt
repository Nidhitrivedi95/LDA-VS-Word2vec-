gF6dg51wP6Rs9MXgZ-K12Q I am not a vegetarian and I didn't USED to like spicy food, but this was the place that turned it all around for me. I really like the to go meals but we just tried to eat in this time and it was surprisingly nicely setup. 

According to my Indian friend, this place has everything that you can think of for vegetarian Indian cuisine. 

When I first started going here, I was sweating while eating. Don't anymore but still, some good eats.
