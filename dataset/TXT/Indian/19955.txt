FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q I am a small, white girl, but I'd like to think I know my Indian food. Indian is my favorite type of food and I've eaten a fair share (homemade and in restaurants). And I have to say, Maharani made my tummy very happy. 

Atmosphere - nothing fancy. They could improve on it, but it is clean, spacious, comfortable.

Food - Delicious! I had samosa chaat, which was fabulous! It was the prefect combination of cool, spicy, crunchy and creamy. I had the garlic naan and the Malai Kofta, which was delicious as well. The veggie dumplings were good, had a nice consistency and the gravy was very flavorful. 

Service - Wonderful. They were attentive without being pushy. They were very kind and attentive even though we stayed long after we were finished.

Now I just need to go back to try a dosa!
