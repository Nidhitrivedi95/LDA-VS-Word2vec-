Husband went exploring the strip while I of course slept in. He discovered Tamba and brought me their card knowing that I love Indian food. 

We walked from the MGM at about 9:00 which is a pretty weird scene. The mall is empty except for this restaurant. 

The restaurant was about 3/3 full with more than 1/2 of the people eating there Indian or Pakistani. 

We ordered on basmati rice, 2 naans, 1 began bharta and 1 matter paneer. ALL excellent, literally the best roast eggplant curry I have EVER had. They roast the eggplant in their Tandoori oven which adds a smoky flavor. The texture and heat were just right.  Paneer was perfectly made.

The portions are more than twice the size of what I normally get here in San Francisco/Bay Area.

Pricing a bit higher, but it is Vegas and 10-12.00 a dish is not unreasonable. 

Waiter and hostess and bus staff were all very nice and efficient.
