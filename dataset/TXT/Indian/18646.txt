eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg So my sister used to go here with her friends and then suddenly stopped, claiming that there was a cockroach in her food, so naturally I avoid this place... until I get taken here to lunch with some friends...

I'm open-minded, okay? I'm going to try it out and not say anything to my friends about my sister's experience... so here is my take...

We order appetizers, four dishes, lots of food basically. I tried all of it and wasn't impressed. Lack of flavor. Service was eh. 

So, highlight of the visit -- the restroom. What do I find? Baby roach, still struggling for life. Disgusting. If there are baby cockroaches in this place, that means they are breeding! More to come! I don't like to pay to eat at dirty places. 

Though, they had an extensive vegetarian menu. 

But the people here, the customers I mean, eh. They kinda have an attitude of, 'omg, ethnic food.' Pft. I got the vibe it was like a special occasion for them to eat at this dump... I don't know how to describe it, maybe I'm being a jerk but that's what I picked up on...

Why pay a decent amount of money for mediocre (at best) food?
