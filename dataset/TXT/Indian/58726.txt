YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA Horrible service, which is a shame because their food is great and price is also attractive. I came in here at 2:30pm for a late lunch. They close at 3pm for lunch (reopen a couple hours later for dinner) but the waitress didn't inform me until AFTER I got my food, which at that point was already 2:40pm-ish. A snake move by the restaurant trying to get your money - not happy. They should have informed me that they were closing soon as soon as I walked into the restaurant. I ended up having to rush through my lunch which was hot and sizzling. I still left a tip because my parents taught me better.
