Ibmf1PgWn_5oaGQ1kINmTw We have been patronizing this restaurant since it was on Yonge Street and the quality of the food, especially the vegetarian food (my husband, mother and I are vegetarian) is consistently exceptional. 
A lot of Indian/Himalayan restaurants which have a few similar dishes, have let their standards drop over time. The food has become greasy and all the dishes seem to be soaked in the same oily sauce. I have stopped visiting and ordering from those. Kathmandu has remained every bit as good and even gotten better over the years, with fresh, clean tasting food exploding with a variety of flavours and textures. The Paneer Tikka is a personal favorite.
The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable.
The current chef(s) seem particularly talented.
Please don't ever change, Kathmandu Restaurant!
