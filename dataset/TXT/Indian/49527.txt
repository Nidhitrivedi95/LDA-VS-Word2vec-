tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA First time here mostly because I live in Tucson.  When visiting family we like to try out some new places to add them to my list of favorite places to go.  The weather has been getting a bit cooler and that changes my inclinations for types of food.  So a recommended Indian Lunch Buffet caught  my radar today.  Very nice atmospheric place which gets me in the mood to feel like I am in India.   This is southern Indian food at its best.  They have the usual dishes set out like tandoori chicken loaded with sautéed onions which was very tasty.  Lamb curry was tasty though it seemed to be swimming in oil.  After draining out the oil albeit the lamb was soft and yummy. The Paneer was cooked in a wonderful sauce.  Chicken masala was great with very tender chicken pieces.  Many vegetable dishes that were quite tasty.  Also a great salad bar with raita dressing.  Basmati rice pudding with almonds and pistachios plus a mango creamy pudding.  Both wonderful.   Included was unlimited mango milk shakes from an unlimited urn.  The nam bread came around several times and it was really good. All in all it's a great place for lunch at just under 9 bucks.  It solved my problem for eating another meal that day.  Two huge plates was enough fuel for this day.  The staff was pleasant.  Kind of business like.  They start cleaning up at exactly 2.30 when the buffet ends.  The buffet is from 11.00 am to 2.30pm on the dot.  They close until dinner from 5.00pm to l0.00 pm.
