We went at 8:30 at night and it was hopping busy. A great vibe and no attitude and the food is outstanding. The dishes were all outstanding and the service attentive. We ordered: Scallop puri, Ming bean Chaat salad ( crisp and fresh) ; the shrimp in coconut curry the Khao Shay beef . They had run out of the coconut Panna  Cotta so we settled for the Milk pastry and it was delicious. They have a limited wine selection but what they offer is all well thought out. The Lassie was outstanding.  Going back to try everything on that menu!
