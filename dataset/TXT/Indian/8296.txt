7m8MoWuudrxU98fEw7iBIw Fantastic!!!!  I haven't had much Indian food, but my first visit to Sairam Om was a major success.  Service was very very gracious and friendly, and my Chicken Tikka Masala dosa was flavorful and ample in size.  Entrees are around $10-12, but the dosa was only $7.  And mango lassi was a delicious beverage addition!  Visit ASAP!  I know I'll be back soon.
