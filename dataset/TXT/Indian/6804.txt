4KBLVr3PYilTUUWj3DWwVw I really love this restaurant.  I've been to many Indian restaurants in and around Oakland and though most are pretty good, this one is really good.  The service is fast, and they serve the food on a big silver plate which is aesthetically pleasing to me :)  The rice is particularly great.  I left off a star because they charge for nan which in my opinion should be included in the charge, but that's definitely not a deal breaker.  I do wish more people would eat there because it's always pretty empty and I'm afraid it's going to close if they don't get some business.  A word to the wise: don't underestimate the spiciness.  If they say its really spicy, it really is!
