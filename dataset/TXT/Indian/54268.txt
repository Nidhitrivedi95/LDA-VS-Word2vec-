vX8L0KhrqjqpU6o1tBhAwg Food is pretty good, I love their butter chicken!! But sometimes, it diesn't taste as fresh. What I hate about the restaurant is that the toilets are dirty and they smell, and the service, honestly, is not good. they just throw your stuffs at the table which is really rude. It's sad to see that the service is not good because the food is actually nice
