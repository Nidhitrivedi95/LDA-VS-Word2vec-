UbZePypGiEf11l1X7mv2SQ This is my return to a once loved indian restaurant.
This is the 3rd time back since their delivery fiasco a year ago...what was I waiting to come back?!
3 times in the last 8 days I've comed here to eat their delicious thali and Taj Mahal beer.
Why am I coming back?
Because this place is very good...other than the strange hard plastic covering the tables and the sometimes inaudible wonderful indian music playing... The red and gold curtains all around makes it one of the prettiest indian resto I have ever seen. 
You can't go wrong. This place looks good and is quiet with mostly people from the surrounding neighborhood. 
Thali is a must. Look at my pictures! 
Yummy yum yums!
