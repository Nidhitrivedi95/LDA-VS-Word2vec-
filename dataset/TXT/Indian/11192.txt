abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg Food was amazing, great presentation, friendly staff. Prices are low enough that you can try a few items without breaking the bank. Also had very nice drinks. 

Beef was so soft that if you even looked it would fall apart into a pile of juicy deliciousness. 

Give this new place a shot you will be glad you did.

Side Note to Hipsters: 
Do not be alarmed by the fact that this place may not have a 2 hour wait list. I know how desperately you want to tell your friends and colleagues how you went for dinner at the hottest place in town. But here's your chance to try a great place and say "I went there BEFORE it was the spot". We all know how much you like to brag about that, so here is that opportunity. Your welcome.
