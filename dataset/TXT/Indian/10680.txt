A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA Called Udupi Palace at 353PM to verify if they deliver and if they deliver to my home address (specified exact address and intersection).  Spoke with all of my guests to see what they wanted and called back at 404PM to place a large order.  Placed the entire order and provided contact information and address again only to be told, oh sorry, we don't deliver to your address, the driver says it is out of our delivery area.  My address is 12 minutes away as per Google map.  

When I explained that I had specifically called earlier to check if delivery to my address was possible, I was told a) that the person who initially answered the phone had no business answering the phone as he was new and b) that I am lying and did not provide my address on the initial call.  Terrible rude and unprofessional customer service - look elsewhere for a restaurant.
