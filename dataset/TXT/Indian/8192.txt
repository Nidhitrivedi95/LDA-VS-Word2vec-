7IF5cjvH1d97pzvYPnf9Mg Oh WOW -- this place is great! Everything from the ambience and service to the food -- the fantastic food -- made me happy.

Everything we ordered, from the naan to the raita to the main dishes was as hot and fresh as it could possibly be, and everything was delicious. We tried the tandoori chicken (white meat), as per the recommendations from other Yelpers and it was great, as was the lamb stew -- and I generally don't like lamb anything. We also tried the eggplant dish, which was delish.

The only reason I'm not giving this place five stars is that I found everything to be a touch too salty -- just a touch. 

Oh, and a warning for those of you who can't handle the heat: their food definitely has a kick to it, and I'd say it's just perfect for someone who knows and likes Indian food. My bet is that if you ask for things to be cooked a bit less spicy, they'd do it no problem.
