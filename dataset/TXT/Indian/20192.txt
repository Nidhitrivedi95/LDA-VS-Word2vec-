fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA This is our go to Indian buffet restaurant in the Markham area.  Located near the intersection of Woodbine and Denison, it's one of the few Indian buffets that's still around in the area and there's a reason why it has survived... Value.

Friday weekend night dinner prices are $16/person, kids about $9 for kids 6-9 and $6 for kids 2-5.  There's a variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for all types of tastes.  Because the place is usually packed food turnover is excellent and fresh.  

Freshly made naan is served table side and goes well with all the delicious butter chicken, curry beef, paneer, goat curry, etc...  The fish pakoras are excellent along with the gajar halwa (carrot based desserts) but ultimately take your time and eat slowly or you'll regret it:)  Everytime we go, I have to loosen my belt holes a few notches afterwards, so be warned!

Service is courteous and you pay at the front when you are done.  They also have take out of Indian sweets that you can take home.
