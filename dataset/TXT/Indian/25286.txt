HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Great food, though I've been told it's not the most authentic in the area.  They fooled me -  Each time I go, I truly enjoy myself. 

The main problem with this place is that it's very hard to find the actual restaurant.  It's in the basement of a Office Building.  If you do find it, enjoy!
