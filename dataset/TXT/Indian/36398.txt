NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I am fairly new to Indian cuisine. I just started to dabble in it a couple months ago and was surprised how much I liked it. My go to dish is the Tikka Masala and so I normally order that when we go Indian. 

This place looks fairly new if not brand new and is located on one of the worst possible roads in the area. Chagrin Blvd is the bane of any driver's existence, so to travel it means, you really want something there. We were shopping across the street at Whole Foods when we saw this place on Yelp and it was right across the street. Fantastic, its close... Well fifteen minutes later after battling the ridiculously stupid drivers on Chagrin blvd, we managed to make it across the street and into their lot. Aesthetically, this place was very nice. The décor inside is really nice and the staff was really friendly and helpful. 

I ordered the chicken tkka masala and we also got a veggie biryani with a side of naan. (who doesn't like naan?) Both dishes were fantastic and the naan was delicious. Ordering works much like Panera Bread, you go to the register and order, then wait for your buzzer thing to go off. This gave us time to look around. The kitchen is behind a glass wall so you can see them preparing the food and also see all the food in the refrigerators. Kind of a neat concept but the coolest feature was this wall mounted automatic hand sanitizer. It looks a lot like that dyson hand dryer, but with water. You put your hands in and they are blasted with a water massage.. Very cool. 

The bottom line is the food was great and the atmosphere was hip and clean. I highly recommend this place.
