hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q It was acceptable I didn't like their masala, it was just too sweet.  I like Cafe Tandoor better than this place.  They had a bunch of kids running around and our waiter was little out of it.  We ordered samosas with meat and got vegetarian instead...we didn't  make a big deal out of it but that to me is the kiss of death when you start screwing up orders...won't be back.  Don't recommend.
