First of all, they charge top-tier restaurant prices and their food is simply not good, either in terms of portion size or taste. For instance, the scallop appetizer I ordered cost $12. It had barely a single scallop shredded into small pieces. At Scaramouche, arguably the best continental restaurant in Toronto, a scallop appetizer cost $25. It has 3 whole scallops, with much better presentation, portion, and flavour. You do the math. I spent $60 and left hungry. The burger priest down the street was much more satisfying at $10. 

The service was up to par with the quality of the food in terms of incompetence. As soon as we ordered we were informed that the food would arrive at different times otherwise they would be cold. Are you kidding me. It is the kitchen's duty to time so the table's orders are complete at the same time. Do they only have a frying pan in the kitchen? One of our guests ordered the chili fish. As it arrived we were told that there may be small pieces of bone left in fillet. Are the kitchen staff really that incompetent that they are not confident to debone a fish? The ismaili beef curry I ordered was bland, did the chef taste it before sending it out? And for $18 it had only 3 small pieces of beef in it. It doesn't end there. They forgot two of our orders, 1 snack and 1 main dish. I tried to get our waiter's attention for 20 minutes. Nobody checked on us when they passed by, not a single server. The most important of all is that our server wore a pair of dirty sneakers. Seriously? At a supposedly 'high end' restaurant they try to be?

Never, ever going back.
