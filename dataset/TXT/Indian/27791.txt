My 5 hr flight to Toronto often leads to an evening at Babur and I love it every time I go. Cold, delicious beers, great breads, easy location and top notch ingredients in classic Indian dishes makes this my favorite Indian restaurant of all time. 

Seriously. The butter chicken, lamb rogan josh and plain buttered naan are the best, ever.
