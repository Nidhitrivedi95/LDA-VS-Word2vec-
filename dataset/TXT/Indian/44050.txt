RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This place is great. It was my first experience trying Pakistani/Indian food and sure, I've had the occasional naan here and there but their garlic naan is just pure bliss. It puts you in a different zone when you eat this. Seriously.

I tried a few other dishes but honestly, my friend did all the ordering and I did all the eating. Everything was delicious! Another noteworthy mention is the ambience. They had beautiful saris and other decorations covering their walls and when I went today (on a Thursday), it was quite busy around 7pm.

By the way, try the mango lassi drink - not too bad. Only complaint is that it was room temperature whereas I prefer a cooled drink but that could be the way it's served, who knows.
