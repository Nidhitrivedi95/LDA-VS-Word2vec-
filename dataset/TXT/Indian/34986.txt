Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg I was very happy with my 1st visit so i went for lunch buffet on my second visit in Vegas. They have variety of food in vegetarian and non vegetarian too. Moreover, they also have few South Indian dishes in buffet. Usually in buffet you get served with fresh bread called'NAAN'. But they just put it in buffet and it was dry, hard and cold.
One more thing is that they might have contract with Thomas cook or some other travel agents so they bring their travellers during lunch time. So it's all crowded and mostly you have to rush to get the food and especially South Indian since most of them were South Indians!
It's bit pricy compare to the food and service!
