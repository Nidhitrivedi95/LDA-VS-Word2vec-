FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Amazing Indian food in Madison, Wisconsin. The menu is extensive so it's impossible to any lover of Indian food NOT to find something. The food itself was spectacular. The vegetable uttapam was hot and crispy, and the chutneys which accompanied it were very flavorful. I loved the ambiance of Swagat as well as the service. Great little restaurant in a great little corner of Madison and hope to return and try more in the future.
