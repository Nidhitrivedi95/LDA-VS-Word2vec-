oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q So after hearing several people rave and rant about this place for years,
I finally went there with my family for dinner last night.
Upon entering we saw the restaurant was almost all full which made me feel that it will be good food.
We got the table pretty quick.

We ordered soup and drum sticks for starters.
The starters came out pretty fast but we had to ask 4 servers to give us soup bowls so we could eat. After several requests and minutes of waiting, we got them finally.
The hot & sour soup - the cook/chef forgot to put any salt in it. Plus the chicken didn't smell fresh 
I had to ask a server for salt as there was none on our table. After putting some salt and hot sauce in it, it got a little better but this was the first time in my life that I pour soup in my bowl and eat only half a small bowl and put it aside. Yeah it was that bad. 

Then come the entrees.
Seemed like frozen chicken and frozen fish used in their entrees. Unbelievable quality.

As for All the people who like this place- they probably just have taste for low quality food. That's all I can say.

Will I ever go there again? NEVER
