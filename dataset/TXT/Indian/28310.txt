J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Seems to be a popular place, it was quite busy. The lunch buffet goes until 3:30 whereas most places go to 2:30. The food was just OK, I've had better. The Tandoori chicken was very dry and not much flavor, as well a lot of the items on the buffet were dry from being out too long. Another annoyance was that they do not accept payment by debit - only credit or cash. However, the service was very good and the staff friendly. The locals seemed to really like it but I don't think I would go back.
