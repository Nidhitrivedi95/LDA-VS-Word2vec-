GRIRHR35knxFo0qySwIysw We were visiting Montreal and decided to try this place out. The food was really very good, and it tasted very homemade Indian. Everything from the chicken to the lamb to the thali everything spot on. We decided to do 2 nights in a row eating at this place. The family that runs the place is just awesome and friendly and they gave my kid a toy to take away. A++
