The nan was okay-was it freshly baked? Another dish we tried was of course the obligatory butter chicken, it was very disappointing.  It was very sweet (a reoccurring central Toronto problem) and bland.  Honestly, I don't know what was worse, the disappointing butter chicken or the fact we found a hair in the pakoras and the papadum.  They compt the pakora-we didn't mention the papadum.
