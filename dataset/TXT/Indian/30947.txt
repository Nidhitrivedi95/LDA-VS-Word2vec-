kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w I'm still trying to learn my way around Indian Cuisine, and so far I'm still on the fence.  Today we went with a friend who was a fan of their lunch buffet.  I thought it was a great way to try out more foods.  Still, nothing rocked my world.  While I couldn't tell you the names of all the foods (if I really LOVED something it might be different), I know I did like the peas dish, which I believe from looking at their menu is the mutter paneer?  I also see the dish is $12.95?  For peas and cheese?  At least I know that I CAN eat a variety of Indian food if I go to another restaurant.  As for the service, while it was very quick, it got to be a little bit uncomfortable as the waiter was hovering in the dining area right by our table, ready to grab our plates as soon as we cleared them.  Not a bad experience overall as it it's fun to try new foods, but nothing a crave to go back for.
