s8N66BJ9P-sqhisX47o1Sg Came here at 2 pm and had to wait about 20 mins for a spicy chicken roti. 

Was it worth it?

I believe so. Now, I took the roti to go, so I don't have much to say in regards to the location for a sit-down meal. What I can say, is that the place is small. Really small. The staff is pretty good, as in the one guy behind the counter that took my order, and the place was clean (which is always good for a restaurant). 

Now, the question is, will I go back. Answer, yes, just not anytime soon. The Chicken Roti ended up costing me about $12. It was worth it, just a little too expensive for a quick lunch outing. But, I'll go back again.
