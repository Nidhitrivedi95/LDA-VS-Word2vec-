J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ On the advice of all you yelpers I visited Little India for the lunch buffet a few weeks ago.  Do not fear if the ground floor is packed - there's a calmer floor upstairs, and I think there might be a third stacked up there.  

Service is attentive, which I love.  I think restaurants with spicy food get used to refilling water glasses every thirty seconds.  I could get used to this; I hate having to spend ten minutes trying to catch a waiter's eye when I want dessert or another beer.

As so many other reviewers have said, the food is excellent, with lots of fresh buffet options.  I got  in over my head on the first plate, so never got to try the desserts, but I'll be back some day.  

One small cloud: why is the butter chicken sweet?  It isn't as sweet as the same dish at Savera, but it's still weirdly sugary.
