-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Last night we decided to try this place out, since we use to go to Pasand all the time. Upon arriving, you can tell they did a major renovation of the place. We were the first to be seated in our section, but the LAST to be served. Our meal turned out to be a two hour dinner, our server was no where to be found and the owner was as clueless as the staff. We noticed that all the "natives" were served first before everyone else, which is a HORRIBLE way to do business.
 
The food was decent when we got it 75 minutes after we were first seated. It took 15 minutes to ask someone to get our bill and when the so-called server returned, he didn't even bring one. They are lucky that I didn't dine and dash, but I bet that they wouldn't have even noticed.
 
The service needs to improve or they won't last. But I wouldn't even waste your time or money going here because they honestly don't care about improving.
