llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g My new favorite go to Indian restaurant. They offer papadom, Indian crackers which are gluten free. The madrasi lamb was delicious but I should have asked for a spice level of hot. The basmati rice had good flavor. They offer more of the authentic Indian dishes.

If you are fortunate to come on a night when they offer goat curry, do yourself a favor and try it. The best I have had.
