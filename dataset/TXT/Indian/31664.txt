KWfLQddMBZNoh1bVcgASfA Part of the reason I used to miss Pakistan was the food.. I don't have that problem anymore thanks to discovering this place. The karhai here is the best karhai I've had in North America.. they always make it fresh and it's always amazing. If you're looking for authentic Pakistani food you have to give this place a visit! The restaurants at Gerard street and places in Mississauga  don't even come close to the quality and taste this place offers.
