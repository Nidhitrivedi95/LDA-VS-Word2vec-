GYmdm_Vy7sf9tji7WUcohg Having dined at almost every Indian restaurant in the Toronto area, this one is definitively the best. How Mr. Singh makes his Saag is a mystery but I can't stop eating it.. Plate after plate after plate... I drive all the way from midtown Toronto just to eat here. Its that good.
