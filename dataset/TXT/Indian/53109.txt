I had a nice experience at this place. I probably wouldn't have gone if I had read the reviews but I'm happy that I did.

My wife calls it "the classiest place in Kensington".  This is a rare combo: an indian restaurant that makes a nice Mojito and has live music.

We'd been tempted by this place for a while now but we finally took the plunge today. I had the Cuban Mojito ($9), one of the better ones that I've had.  For dinner, we had the vegetable pakoras ($8) and the curry special ($18) and it was more than enough for two.  The service was pleasant, not terrible.  The live jazz was quite nice. The food was average but good for vegetarians.  It gets extra points for having an awesome patio on a good part of Augusta.  This would be a great place for a drink and a snack on a hot day.

Overall, a little pricey but not a bad choice.
