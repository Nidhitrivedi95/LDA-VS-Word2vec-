_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER!!! Heads up, it's a bit spicy but explodes with flavor. Many dishes have a smokey flavor which is fantastic. The Aloo Gobi is a must and black lentils. 

I like the ambiance, it's very romantic. It does get busy and the waiters seem a little short staffed, but the food is so incredible, nothing would stop me from going back.
Go with a group so you can try everything!
