JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw I would go here only for the gulab jamun and nothing else. I'm going to compare with aroma restaurant which is in same area near the concord mall. I've tried egg biryani here, which tasted very bad, I'm not a fan or aroma restaurant either, but I hoped cholas would be better, it only proved to be more worse. I've also tried mirchi bajji another night, it was too spicy because of the spice powder they sprinkled on it, but taste was ok. Then I had dosa and my husband had puri masala. Dosa was the worst dosa I've had, there was no taste in the sambar too. Sambar had no salt in it and also the potato masala with poori had no salt. We also ordered gutti vankay, which was ok, it had exactly two small eggplants in it. And the texture of poori was not soft m fluffy, it was crispy and fragile. Both times we went there, we had the gulab jamun and it was the only thing that was good, it was warm, not too hard on the inside but not too soft that it cannot hold together, the texture was perfect. I really hoped to find a better place than aroma, because we go to the mall quite often and would be delighted to find a nice Indian restaurant, but looks like aroma still wins. Cholas needs to improve on the taste of the food.
