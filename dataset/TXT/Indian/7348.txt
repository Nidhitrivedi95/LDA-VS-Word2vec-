The venue is very simple but clean, and the menu will be expanding as the restaurant grows. I had the Samosa chat which was truly outstanding - the medley of flavor was exquisite - and the Spring Dosa was out of this world - I'd say it's the best Dosa I've had in Vegas and actually, the U.S.!  The Dosa was generously filled with a delicious mixed vegetable blend and I was stuffed!  I had the Mango Kulfi for dessert since there's always room for dessert. :) Next time I'll take photos. I'll definitely be coming back!!!
