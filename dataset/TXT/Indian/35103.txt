MPvBQgktNUTnzu92espAJw It is a very chic resturant with good authetic indian food. They have a good customer service and if you aren't familiar with indian food like me, they will help you to find a food you like. I had sag gust with ruty which was very good. Make sure to ask for non spicy food, if you can't eat spicy food, my friend didn't ask and his food was a little too spicy.
