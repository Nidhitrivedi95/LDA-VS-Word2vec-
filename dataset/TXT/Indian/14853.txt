cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA I like this place a lot. The food is pretty consistent and I love their mojitos! I have ordered many of the dishes and I can't say I have a favourite one, but so far everything has been quite good. I like that the menu changes every month or so and they offer a good 3-course lunch & dinner special!
