Iqu-RwRA4XfwILKQLKQZew I went here for lunch with my manager and the food we got was awesome!! Cheap and tastey Indian street food. Hands down you must get Chicken Sukka , Samosa Chaat and Cut Mirchi.  When you arrive, it's hard to understand the menu on the wall, because there is absolutely no description of the items.  But just ask for the paper menus- I think there is better descriptions.  I am happy to find out they also have a location in scottsdale by my house- I will be going for sure!!
