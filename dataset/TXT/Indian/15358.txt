COfzp0tze_F8N13zn40zzg Really enjoyed the food tonight! 

Because we were a large group, I felt like the waitress was slow and didn't have common sense in how she delivered the food... but she was really nice. 

My main meal was delivered to someone else at the table and sat there for a few minutes before I asked where mine was and it was passed to me. I loved the food (Chana samosa, chicken tikka masala and naan were all excellent). 

The fact that it's BYOB is a bonus and the restaurant is pretty new looking with AC. Good for fast food Indian and groups looking for affordable BYOB places in the heart of Downtown!
