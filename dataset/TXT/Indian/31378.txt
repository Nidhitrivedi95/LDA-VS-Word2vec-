Ksk5cLav4OtbUtpRGp5b4g I'll admit, I didn't order from India Cafe and Kitchen, but I'm glad someone else did!

Everything was delicious and my table of  Indians were all very pleased with the selection.  Everything was hot and they presented things very nicely.

There was a selection of chicken tika, a delicious paneer dish and much more (also, I was on the side without the labels, so I'm going by memory).  

The cucumber "salad" was a perfect mix for everything to cool things off a bit.

Finishing things up with galar halwa (carrot desert) and gulab jamun (sugar balls) - everything was delicious!!!

It's nice to have some spicy selections that actually taste of India instead of the Americanized version that you run across more often than not.  Next time I'm ordering Indian catering, I'm ordering from here!
