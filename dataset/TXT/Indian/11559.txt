ajHLLUe-A9dTd7WyU12XZQ After hearing from a real-live Indian Yelper that this was Toronto's "most like mom used to make" Dosa, I headed straight here.  After a walk across the Christie Pits park, I encountered not 1 but 2 Indian restaurants side by side.  While Madras Masala has a small white with black print sign, the other place has a HUGE yellow sign. Stay to the right to enter a former coffee shop type of restaurant. The place was full by the time we left, so that's got to be a good sign. The number of Indians was also a good sign. 
Madras Masala doesn't limit itself to South Indian food such as Dosa or Uttapam, but pulls out all the usual curries, naan and such.  
To experience the most we could, we got one dosa, one uttapam and a rice dish.  The Dosa was crispy, oily and had a small dallop of well-spiced potatoes.  The Uttapam was a little under done and wet on the top bubbly part. The sauces were fine, but just not what I have grown to expect. 
You'll never forget your first dosa. If mom used to cook like this, then sure, I could imagine this is your favorite. But, Dosa (San Francisco) was my first dosa experience and so far Saravhana Bhavan still comes closest in taste to what I crave. 
Surprisingly alcohol is served here, unlike some other dosa places. I tried the unremarkable chai. I should have had a wine?
