-z_DR7omzpcR__l7MbDu0A What an amazing place to eat. I saw a variety of meat and vegetarian items at their lunch buffet station. The main offerings on the buffet are changed up a bit everyday.  Some of the standouts are their goat biryani, chili chicken and potato 65.  At another station they offer various accouterments of sauces and fruit.  If you never had Indian food there is no better way to try it out than by going to a buffet.

I haven't been here for dinner service yet but will give it a shot soon. I would recommend getting there before 12:00 PM for the lunch buffet to get a seat.  It's a small restaurant so you could be waiting if you get there too late.
