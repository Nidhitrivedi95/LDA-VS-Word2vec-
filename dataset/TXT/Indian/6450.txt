3q42_KwDXEwfXSvtohknkA Very good Indian Food! We went in at 2:30 the other day and lunch service had ended, but they were happy to serve us anyway, very nice of them. We had the pashwari and garlic naan, both delicious, along with wonderful basmati and juicy tandoori chicken and chicken curry. I had the chai to drink, which I also enjoyed. Will be going back often now!
