iSRVQRoDNgf3IFuMn9r0_g Great tasting Pakistani food! The combos were perfect for a large group of people. Nihari was amazing !! And so was the fry bhindi. Biryani and kebabs were very good too. I would love to come back to try other authentic dishes. The service was really good. We arrived at 11:15 although it closes at 11:30, but the owner served us and kept the restaurant open till we ate comfortably. Great experience
