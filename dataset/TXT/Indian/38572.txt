OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Good service, and good food. We stopped in for a lunch buffet and were pleasantly surprised. This is the best Indian buffet I have had not only was it good  variety, but there was more flavor and spice than other places are willing to put into the buffet options. It really sets it apart from others.
