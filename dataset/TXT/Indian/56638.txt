xYonRlhqbwdHLhPs1PLdCg Flavorful food and friendly staff. The chef/owner greeted each table and was very pleasant. There are still some finishing touches that need to be done to the restaurant decor/signage, but overall this place is worth a try. We found the price for the lunch buffet very fair. We'll be back.
