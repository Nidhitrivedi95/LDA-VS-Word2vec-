v38zwJvJiLv-yC7uEhhcKA This was the second time I ordered food from here hoping my second experience would be better than the first. Sadly i was disappointed again. Raw potatoes in the 'Aloo Gobi' watered down 'Palak Paneer' and rubberized 'Naans'

I called up the restaurant to let then know that I was disappointed with the food but the guy at the other end refused to believe me. Argued back that it was my opinion and the Aloo gobi is the hottest selling item. Raw potatoes are not a matter of opinion.

Never going back there again.
