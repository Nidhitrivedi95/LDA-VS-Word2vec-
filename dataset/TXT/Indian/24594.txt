H_YBTOS23PRhrjWtP7TeJw Indian food in a mid-upscale setting, I was introduced to Marigold by a friend who lives nearby.  If not for her recommendation, I might have missed this place - so thanks K, cause Marigold is delicious. 

Had no problems finding a table for 4 on a Wednesday night, and the staff was incredibly helpful in describing menu items.  Granted with the responsibility to order plates for the entire table (heavy is the crown...), I was going to add king prawn xacutti to the list of dishes I had already chosen.  The gentleman suggested that since the xacutti is very similar in taste to the seafood curry, that he might be able to ask the kitchen to do a prawn masala instead to switch up the taste. 

It ended up being our favourite dish of the night.  The prawns were really big; much bigger than those "jumbo" shrimp you get at other places sometimes.  Full of flavour, succulent shrimp, creamy consistency...yum, I totally want some right now.  I love butter chicken, but this one easily trumped it that night. 

Actually, the butter chicken is what originally brought me here as my friend said it's the most delicious she's ever had.  I think it's made up of chunks of chicken breasts, in a reddish brown butter chicken sauce that's a little less on the creamy side and heavier on the spices and chicken flavour.  

Other hits with us that night were the garlic naan and the free round of pre-dinner pappadums. 

The naan is the size of a small plate, so if you opt to forego rice, order at least one naan per person.  You might find yourself wanting even more to devour every last tasty drop!
