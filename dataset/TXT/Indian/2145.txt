_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg I found this place when I was looking for shisha at the new smoke shop across the parking lot. I went in and checked it out.

There is a small lunch counter inside this grocery store and I tried an aloo gobi to go, potato and cauliflower with rice and naan. It took awhile to be prepared but not too long. It cost $6.55 and tasted very homemade. It was also way more spicy than I expected but I loved that. I had forgotten to request a spiciness level and it was intense in just the right way.

Credit card payments have to be a minimum of $10 or they charge you 35 cents. Seems fair to me.

I'm going to go back there next week and try the desi pizza or something with chicken in it. They have some Indian wrap things, masala, korma and what looked to be some common Indian dishes like samosas, etc. The prices are affordable and it was fun to wander around and look at the stuff on the store shelves. There are lots of prepackaged Indian dishes that I think I'll try. They all cost between $2.50 and $3.50 and look very authentic.
