I'm amazed ( but glad ) that it hasn't caught on where you need a reservation, but to this day you can almost always walk right in and get a table.  The atmosphere is nice and comfortable.  Every dish i've ever had over the last 10 years has been delicious.  If your ever in Vegas, do yourself a favor and get off the strip and out of those high priced mediocre restaurants and hope in a cab, there are so many gems we have found over the years and Mint is at the top of the list!
