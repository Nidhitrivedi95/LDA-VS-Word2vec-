ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Went here with a few colleagues for the lunch buffet. I'm very familiar with Indian food (recently traveled there!) and the flavor of the food was very authentic. There was a great selection for the buffet, and the staff were very nice. I would definitely go back for lunch - my only regret was not stopping here sooner! :) They have a great selection of items that can be vegan/vegetarian and they are very happy to answer any questions.
