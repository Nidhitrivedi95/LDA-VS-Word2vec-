-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg Tried this recently over lunch. Very impressed with the food, the ambience and the decor. Service was good, however our server was not friendly. No smile through the conversation, direct one word answers to most questions. Anyways, that is not the reason for three stars. The only reason is that being a quick lunch, there was not enough scope to review many aspects. Worth a repeat and recommendation.
