I have never tried any a-la-carte items, but their buffet is more than enough AND a great value for just $10. With an assortment of vegetarian and chicken dishes seasoned to perfection with delicious spices, you are sure to find your favorite! I love their tikka masala and tandoori chicken, which is always fresh and juicy. The naan is complimentary and, although it takes a little bit to arrive at your table (it is freshly made every time), it is DEFINITELY worth the wait. This place is so good that even their jasmine rice is on point, every single time. 

I do not know about you, but I love a rich mango lassi with my indian meals...and that's where I think they would do a bit of a better job. Do not get me wrong, their lassi is good but a bit too sweet compared to other ones I have had. And, for $5 a piece they are a bit pricey.

Conclusion? Come to this place, especially for lunch, and enjoy a great meal!
