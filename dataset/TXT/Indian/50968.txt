UoS_IvuwY-8mAq0PY7n0kg As a big fan of Tibetan food, I was expecting a fine gastronomic experience coming to this restaurant, but I left unimpressed. The folks who own the place are extremely courteous, but the vegetarian tofu dishes we ordered were dull as dishwater. We were looking forward to having their momos, but they turned out to be overly starchy. Made with more dough than actual filling. It's too bad, I really wanted to like this place.
