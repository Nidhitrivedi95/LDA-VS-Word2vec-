-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg This is, hands down, the best Indian restaurant in the 'burgh. Udipi is  Southern Indian, so the food is spicy. I've probably had everything on the menu, but the masala dosa will always be my favorite. Dosa (or dosai) are made with finely ground rice flour, which is made into a crepe and stuffed with various fillings. The masala dosa at Udipi is filled with a mixture of spiced mashed potatoes and onion, and served with sambar and coconut chutney. Delicious.  More standout dishes include the vegetable cutlets, which are veggies ground up and formed into a patty and then fried...I know it sounds strange, but these are wonderful. For entrees I like the channa masala, vegetable korma and baigan bartha, but, truly, anything I've eaten here I've enjoyed. If you can stand the heat, order the rasam soup as a starter; this rivals chicken soup as a cure for the common cold. Udipi is 100% vegetarian, but you carnivores and omnivores won't miss the meat, as the flavors are so outstanding here. Try the pickle to really challenge your Western palate.
