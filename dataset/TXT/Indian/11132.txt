abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg Stopped in on a Saturday night with my husband to try Rickshaw Bar. The food, ambiance and service were all outstanding. The owner, Noureen, stopped by our table to tell us about each of the dishes we ordered. Her warm personality and very apparent genuine interest in providing a great dining experience got things off to a great start.

We started off with the pakora fritters (yum!!) and they were amazing! Ordered a second round of fritters because they were so good. We also had the beef curry which was excellent - the best we have ever tasted, hands down. The crispy milk pastry finished the night off on a sweet note. So, so good.

I will definitely be back to try more on the menu as everything sounded so good. I told a few friends about this place and they told me they were equally impressed.
