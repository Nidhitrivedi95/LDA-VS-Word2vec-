UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Stopped in last Friday for the lunch buffet. I'm not very familiar with Indian food though I've always wanted to try it and this place had a good Yelp rating so that's how we ended up there. The food was very good, once I determined what everything was and tried several small portions. The servers were quick to refill our water (we had a large party) and the restaurant seemed very clean.
