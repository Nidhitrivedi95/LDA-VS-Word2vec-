The flavors are not overly spicy but complex and rich.  It tastes like they use some ones mom's recipes with a pinch of this and a dab of that to get the flavor just right.  Many of the Indian restaurant's I've tried taste "flat" - like the spices come from a mix and hot but not flavorful.  That's why, next time I'm in Pittsburgh you'll find me lunching at Price of India.
