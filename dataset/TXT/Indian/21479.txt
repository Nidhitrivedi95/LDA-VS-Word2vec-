GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA After giving this restaurant numerous chances to redeem itself, I finally give up. The portions are super small compared to other South Asian restaurants, it's over priced, and has really inconsistent food. Last time we went our naan was burnt and Chicken Hara Masala tasted bitter. I was super disappointed. Another time I went I was waiting at the counter for 5 minutes because the cashier was too busy on his phone and was completely ignoring me. I really don't get why it's always so busy in there. There are way better restaurants near by. Only reason I used to go was because it's the only halal place near by. Will definitely not go ever again. 
P.S. if you are in the area go to Moroccan Paradise right next to Curry Corner. AMAZING and halal
