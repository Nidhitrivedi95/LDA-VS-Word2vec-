x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ I had Pad Thai delivered from the UberEATS app.  It had almost no sauce on the noodles hence almost no flavor as well as being very dry.  I ordered the chicken but asked that tofu be substituted.  The chicken came, dry and almost inedible.  My husband had the shrimp and it was overcooked.  We will NEVER order from them again or go there.  Just plain bad food.
