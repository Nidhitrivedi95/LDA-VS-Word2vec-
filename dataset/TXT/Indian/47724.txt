TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Went here to support a friend's event and stayed for dinner. The staff was very customer oriented and kept our glasses of water full and were checking in on a regular basis. I tried the bhel puri/chana chat which is chick peas, puffed rice, onions, and potatoes tossed in a tangy tamarind sauce. This was very fresh. My friend tried the fish tikka which was also very good.
I also tried:
dal makhani-pretty good
malai kofta-yummy
bhindi masala-it was good but very oily 
naan-both the garlic and plain naan very light and good
gulab jamun-yummy. this was very fluffy(not how gulab jamuns usually are so this was a pleasant change)
I was told that the chilli chicken was good too.

I would go and check this place out again!
