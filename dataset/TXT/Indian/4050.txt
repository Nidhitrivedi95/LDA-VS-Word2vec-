14m4FbWr2BIgrbSdPBKG8Q It's about time that Kensington finally got a good, quick and delicious Indian restaurant.  I eat here frequently and am constantly impressed by the variety, quality and value of this restaurant.  

The combos are great, and the small is more than enough food.  Their vegtables curries are delicous and different.  Green beans with cardamon and Sweet Potatoe Slices coated in Mint Chutney are amongst my favourites.  The butter chicken is wonderfully fragrant with a bit of a kick and the chicken is always melt in your mouth tender.  They have a tandoor oven on site - which means delicious fresh naan upon request.  

My favourite thing, however has to be their vegtable pakoras.  They are by far the best pakoras I have ever had.  Not to greasy - they are loaded with real vegtables including red and yellow peppers and spinach.  They are so tasty and come with chutney to dip.  They are 4 for $4 and great to share.  

Seating is a bit of an issue - there are some tables outside (mostly in direct sunlight), one on the front "deck" and a counter which you could eat at inside.  But I've heard they are planning more inside as well as possibly opening the back yard up as a patio.
