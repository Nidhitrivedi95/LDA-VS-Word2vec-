bXFWLSQptjB5SUMyZxprfg I'm still on a buffet binge and Indian food sounded like a nice change of pace.  After driving around "the hood" aka the 24th St. and Thomas area after a meeting today, I was unable to find a suitable buffet.  So, I headed back to Chandler.  I thought I remembered driving by an Indian restaurant on Chandler Blvd. at one point and was pleasantly surprised when I found India Gate.

The atmosphere is sort of cozy ethnic,and  reminds me of the Bay Area .  I was seated quickly and I thought the service was friendly considering the language barrier.  I was impressed by the selections on the lunch buffet and thoroughly enjoyed everything I tried.  The food was hot, fresh and with what appeared to be good quality meat (tried lamb curry and chicken vindaloo) and the heat factor was moderate.  The best part about the meal with the garlic naan....pure carb heaven.   It's $9.99 which is somewhat higher than some other buffets at lunch, but I felt the overall experience was well worth it.
