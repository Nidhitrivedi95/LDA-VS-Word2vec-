The prices are affordable, the location is clean and the service is fast.  We usually do take out, which I love, because the serving sizes are large. I love bringing the food home and binge watching House of Cards (or anything on Netflix). Add candlelight and the sound of rain falling outside your open window...makes for a romantic night in. Love it!
