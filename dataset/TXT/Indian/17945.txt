ecid5p4yhTEJbWEJTuzX3Q BEWARE. Unsure what kind of swill my fellow reviewers have been eating that have lowered their standards to such shockingly low levels, but let me tell you that the butter chicken plate I ordered at Chef Guru was probably the worst food I have ever eaten in the past 2 years. You can tell that every ingredient is the cheapest that one could possibly find, potentially canned when possible and reheated at worst. Ive eaten around at a few of the similar casual indian joints in the neighbourhood, and let me tell you this is shockingly bad compared. I seldom write negative yelp reviews but felt compelled to. I recommend going to Curry Mahal on St Laurent just past des Pins for lovely authentic, well priced food and super friendly staff.  I love to support hard working local businesses but what I experienced tonight I wouldn't wish on any.
