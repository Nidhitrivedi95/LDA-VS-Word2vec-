Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w As a relatively new Indian food addict we've been trying out a few spots in Madison and finally made it here on a Friday night.  My review is a 4 due to the food receiving a definite 5, but the actual venue being more of a 3!  

Food was outstanding...we had tandoori mushrooms, a tandoori sampler main dish and chicken madras with garlic naan.  It was all equally fantastic and some of the best indian food we have had!  Prices were as expected for dinner with us both having a drink our bill was $55.  We will definitely be getting food from here again (possibly delivered).

The restaurant left something to be desired...dated interiors, cheesy plastic flowers on the tables, dead silent (no music) so it's awkward unless the restaurant is packed.  The bathrooms are pretty bad too.

Overall...I would call this a dive indian place...worth the lackluster interiors for the dynamite food!
