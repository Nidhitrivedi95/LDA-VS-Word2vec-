GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw I was driving on the strip when I saw the sign of this restaurant. Its located close to circus circus/Riviera. I went there for the dinner buffet, Its ambiance is nice and staff was pretty welcoming and friendly however, its food quality was horrible. I went there for dinner buffet along with my dad as we were craving for indian food. Its about $16.95/person not including drinks. Pretty expensive for the old "baasi" food that they offer.They don't have that many items. The tandoori chicken was very dry, their biryani was overspicy and very hot. There food really lacked quality and it appeared as it has been sitting there since morning.  I also ordered mango lassi that was for $3.95 and tasted pretty mediocre. 
Towards the end I pretty much wasted my money and felt I was duped and I lost my appetite. I DON'T recommend anyone going there.
