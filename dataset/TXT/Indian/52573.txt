UXEqtEXs92COE3UiaSx4oA went again.  This time, no crowd, as it was 5pm and they had just opened for dinner.  The service was good, the butter chicken is still one of the best dishes on the strip, but much of this food - certainly the tandoori chicken and the pakoras - tasted like warmed over lunch.

which it was.

fresh food please!
