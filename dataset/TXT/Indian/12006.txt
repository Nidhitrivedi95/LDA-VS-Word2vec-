auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I ate at this place about two years ago with a friend who was a curry fiend. I remembered the meal I had was pretty good, so when we got some coupons in the mail the wife and I decided to go again.

I'm in no way or form an expert on Indian food as I've always enjoyed the east Asian curries more, so the wife and I played it safe and went with a full order of Tandoori Murgh Shahnaz (marinated baked chicken on the bone) and Jhinga Tikka Masala (prawns with onion and peppers in a tomato cream sauce). On the side was garlic naan and white rice.

The chicken, being thighs and legs, was as good as I remembered. Served a sizzling cast iron plate on a bed of onions and peppers. They managed to render out most of the fat while cooking (thanks to the clay oven), but managed to keep all of the flavor.

The prawn dish was delicious, but for $16 I would expect more prawns or at least bigger ones. The highlight of the dish was the tomato cream sauce that found it's way on top of my chicken rapped in naan.

The service was quick, attentive, and funny. When I ordered both dished with the rice & naan combo add on for $5 the waiter suggested just a double order of naan and a single order of rice. That kind of customer service is very highly appreciated.

When it came time to go we had some left overs that definitely earned a trip home with us. I appreciate it when a restaurant gives you decent to-go containers and these guys didn't attempt to have us shove everything in one big Styrofoam container but gave us smaller ones for each component of the meal. Perhaps a silly thing to comment on, but I like it when my left-overs look just as good as the day I ordered them.

Is this an "authentic Indian" restaurant? Damned if I know, but since the staff is Indian and very friendly I imagine if you flexed your knowledge they'll be accommodating.
