eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg I try to judge a place by how good it is at what IT does and what they do they do well here. In terms of quick and affordable buffet Indian eateries they seem to have it down. 

I work in the area and often need a break from the Biltmore and Esplanade fare. When I head over here I tell the guys in the office and I always have a couple jump to go with me. The guests' first reaction is the same every time; we pull into the strip mall and skeptically get out eyeing the place which is unassuming on the outside to say the least. We open the door and walk in and you get the inevitable, "Wow it smells good in here". You are shown your table and asked for your drink order and then asked to help your self. You will find 8-10 entree dishes + salads, chutney and desert waiting for you that has all been consistently fresh hot, well prepared and thankfully light on the heavy cream that all Indian places pour into every dish to make the, um... crackers eat exotic foods. They bring fresh Naan bread (included) to your table and have a full menu available as well. 

The place is owner run and they are polite and attentive. Indian movie dance scenes run the background on a TV set a volume that does not interfere with your conversation and you can get in and out quick between meetings if you need to. Your guests who picked carefully on their first trip return to the table with a second, full, plate and eat until they complain they ate too much because it was so good. Lunch for 2 with iced-tea is about $22 - quite deal as well.
