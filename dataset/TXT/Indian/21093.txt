GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA If you're not Indian, expect bad service. 75+ yr old white haired Caucasian who asked for take out menu literally given only menus in Indian.

Lots of tiny bones in the goat Briyani. Very tasty but goat pieces small and had small bones = hard to eat.

'extra spicy' sadly is not.
