h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ First about me: I am from chennai, Chettinaad is my favorite cuisine. I cook myself.

My buffet experience: Felt like unwanted guest to be inside eating their food after paying 13.99+tax.

Ratings(1-5)
Buffet quality : -2(yes thats minus two)
Taste: -3 (Not worth paying more than $5)
Number of chettinad dishes: 0

I had to beg for drinking water. They have Dosa in their buffet which no one told even after 35 mins after we started eating, I had to take the shame and ask about that to them and they did bring after that. Which didn't taste great either.

I have been once for dinner there and it was good. So my review is only for buffet. 

Will i go again there: Never... Not even if my best friend says they have improved their quality.

My request to the restaurant: 
1.Please please please change your restaurants name.
2. Do you guys know chettinad is famous for sea-food? How much seafood do you guys serve in your buffet or you have in your menu.
3. Dont cheat by charging more. Charge based on your capacity and quality.
