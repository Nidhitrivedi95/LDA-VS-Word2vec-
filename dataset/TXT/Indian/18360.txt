eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw I'm just praying to god that we don't fell sick after eating there samosas. Just had them and halfway eating we smelled and found it's rotten. And 3$ just for sweet plastic box??? What are they doing?? Just noticed... never going back again! Looters!! I was a regular customer... the staff is slow but it was ok and this is certainly not acceptable by me. Usually the staff at this place give box for every type of sweet and hence they charge which I got to know that today. If you are charging someone for something then you should tell them at least before charging?!? Not going back ever again!
