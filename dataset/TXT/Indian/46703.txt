t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg This place is awesome and the food is even better!!  I am a Brit and my husband is Canadian so we both LOVE Indian food but realize it is not popular with most American palates.  This place has been open for a while and we really hoped that it would make it as it is a little hidden but very close to home so that's another plus.  We were there about 10 days ago and the place was quite busy so we were happy to see that.  I have always cooked my own Indian food before but don't need to do that any more - the food and service is excellent and the staff are very accommodating, do need to carry Mango Chutney tho' - pretty standard add on with poppadoms :)
