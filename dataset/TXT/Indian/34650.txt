Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Lunch buffet for $15 including tax. Came at 2PM and all but 3 of the customers were Indian, so I assumed there was a reason. Had some REALLY good tandoori chicken -- tons of flavor and very moist. Lots of veggie options and 3 meat dishes (all chicken). I'd give one more star if they had a goat or lamb dish, just to broaden the choices.
