MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg My review is solely based on their samosas.

At 5 samosas for $1, really, where can you go wrong?  The samosas are always fresh and piping hot. The red sauce they give...sooo good!  The veggie/potato filling is so delicious and they don't have all that extra dough like some other samosas.

I deducted one star because the service is really hit or miss.  Sometimes they're really slow and I just wanna pull my hair out, other times I'm in and out of there in 5 minutes.

Anyways, if you're ever in the area and need something to take to a party, go here!  Anyone that has ever tried these samosas has never not liked them.
