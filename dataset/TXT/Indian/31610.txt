KVUOj74lBgogrdKcNQH_zQ My friends love this place. But let me be honest I did not like it at all. This place offers variety of food with lot of color in it. Also the chicken dint taste fresh. Well it was expected after counting the number of microwaves. I mean seriously "6 microwaves" to heat the food. This definitely explains why my food dint taste fresh. I am definitely not visiting this place again.

Price- Reasonable

Ambience- ok

Food- ok and not fresh
