9q8JSsHC5lR6Hh16W_5ggg I love Hakka Chinese food. Salt and Pepper is an excellent example of the genre. The entrees we ordered were Chinese Chicken Biryani, Chili Chicken, and Sesame Chicken. The best item was the Biryani; huge portion, perfectly cooked basmati rice, unique spices, and abundant chicken. The Chili Chicken was excellent as well. The Sesame Chicken was pretty conventional, but that's what my teenage daughter wanted. 

We also had soup. The Tom Yum Chicken soup was very good, but lemony. I was the only one who liked it. My daughter had the hot and sour and it was excellent, albeit a bit conventional. 

They lose a star for the typical Desi restaurant service and dirty bathrooms. The men's room had a live light fixture hanging from the wires. Scary.
