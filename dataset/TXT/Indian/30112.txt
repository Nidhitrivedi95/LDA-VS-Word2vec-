JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I went to Aroma over the weekend for their lunch and the food was good with the Indian flavors I tend to look for. So you're wondering why I'm giving this place 2 stars. It comes down to their sanitation! As I went to grab the chair to pull it out to sit down it had sticky residue on them. They were definitely not wiped down properly and that was nasty so I didn't even put my coat on the back of the chair, I stuffed it in my purse. Their glasses and silverware are worn down. The glasses had so much condensation built on them it made th water look murky. The spoons and forks are so bad it didn't feel right eating from them.  Also, the plates they racked up for customers were COLD. Every restaurant I've been to the plates have been hot as they come out of the washer but not these plates. Which makes me feel the plates weren't sanitary. Another issue was placing the Naan (Indian bread) outside the sneeze glass where everyone just walks past it and picking up with their hands....ewww. also, as I'm eating an employee comes around to mop around my table....REALLY? why would anyone mop as patrons are eating lunch and the employees were putting down a rug/runner at the same Time because the floor was slippery. I'm thinking what kind of horse and pony show is this? Now I have germs flying all over the food because they want to put down a rug on the floor. My last complaint is the bathroom was nasty as was the kitchen.  There is no sense of cleanliness at Aroma nor is there any etiquette as to what should be done prior to opening. Also the employees need uniforms.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this place and I won't be going back.
