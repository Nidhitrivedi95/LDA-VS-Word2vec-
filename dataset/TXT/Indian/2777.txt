0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w I've been to Mt Everest countless times over the years for their cheap buffet lunch (believe it costs $10.99 now but back in the day it was only $8.99)

Tried out dinner here last week for the first time. 

I find the menu slightly overpriced. Most of the curries were $15 and that did not include rice or naan. Given this is the ANNEX and the decor/ambiance of this place is quite underwhelming, I think they are overcharging by a few dollars. Other similar type places with much better food (Banjara) have a more reasonable price point.

My date and I ordered the Dinner for Two special ($36.99) which was definitely the most bang for your buck. You get a platter of tandoori chicken, boti kabob and chicken tikka (two pieces of each), a lamb curry, mutter paneer, peas pulav and 1 order of rice and 1 naan. Some kind of rice pudding for dessert too.

Food was pretty tasty, didn't blow my mind but was definitely good.

Service was bothersome for me - very spotty at this place. At times they were over topping off water every 5 minutes, and at other times we could not flag them down to get extra rice or the bill, etc.

Lunch buffet is still a great option!
