O6RnkQnuVyRTXk4e_tADPw I'm a huge fan of the food to this day but their customer service has suffered greatly in the last 18 months. I could list many occasions when their customer service has failed me but I think one will suffice: the last 2 times I've ordered from the Curry Leaf the gentleman delivering the food has been extremely rude when not provided with a tip, sneering "That's very kind of you sir", "I won't rush next time".

For the record, while I tip in restaurants and bars without fail I don't tip delivery guys but I don't expect to be lambasted for it.

I will not be ordering from the Curry Leaf again.
