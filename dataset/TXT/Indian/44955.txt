S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Great food , avg. price. Spicy enough to stimulate your taste buds. Good service. Great  tomato soup , bhindi masala, chana masala , naan, jeera  rice , dal. Great interior. Location and view  from outside dose not reflect that this is located in Las Vegas.  Dull and dark from outside. 
Definitely will go again.
