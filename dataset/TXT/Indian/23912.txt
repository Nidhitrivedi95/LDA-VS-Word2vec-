gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Good place for Indian food, with some decent choices, although the buffet price have gone up a little with not much improvement on the choices. Service is ok, not super friendly and choice of food on the buffet, which pretty tasty is very limited. Would help to have better description of the dish selections since not everyone is a native and would want to know what we are getting. I still go there from time to time, expecting a better experience, but at least the food is good enough to have a (barely) positive experience.
