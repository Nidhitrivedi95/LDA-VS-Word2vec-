kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g I was surprised on how good the hummus was at Bombay Spice.  Having never seen hummus on the menu of an Indian food restaurant, I was curious to try it out.  The hummus had a good consistency and it was yummy on the Naan bread.

Bombay Spice offers many dishes for vegetarians.  The potatoes, lentils, and rice are all good.

The prices are a little high for everyday dining, but the happy hour specials are great.
