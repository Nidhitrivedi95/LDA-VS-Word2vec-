ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Do not judge this book by its cover. It is a gem of a place! Best Indian in Cleveland hands down. Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed! Their garlic naan is amazing, as are a number of their Indian dishes. I'm a a vegetarian so can't really comment on their non vegetarian fare.
