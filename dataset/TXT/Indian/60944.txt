zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA This was perhaps the worst service I have had in my whole entire life.  Our server was very rude.  Rude is an understatement.  He was outright insulting.  It started with the warm beer.  I politely let him know that the beer was warm and that we'd like a cold one the next time.  He said, "It's not warm.  It's 37 degrees."  Then he walked away.  It was actually closer to 72 degrees, but we were in shock with the response.

The night continued this way.  The waiters were combative.  We were nickel and dimed for every single thing.  For example, they brought us four bowls of rice, and then took one away saying, "You only get three."  

Do not go here.  These people are very unprofessional, I can only hope the lack of professionalism doesn't extend into the kitchen.
