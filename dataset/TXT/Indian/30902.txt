KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ Went there a half hour ago on 12/23/2016 at 5:30PM and found the restaurant CLOSED! That destroyed our family meal out! On yelp it was stated OPEN 5PM to 10PM . Sign by door stated closed for kitchen redo. I suggest calling them first as it will be closed for a week or so. Just checked online: http://www.passagetoindiaaz.com to find no notice of closure. I sent them this message: Many, many thanks for not posting ONLINE that your restaurant would be CLOSED.  So great to arrive and then observe others who also arrived but found it CLOSED.  The sign by the door was of great help AFTER many of us arrived. WOuld have been great to know before hand!
