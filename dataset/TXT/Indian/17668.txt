DzYpjCOATXKYi1IsBLSPfQ Yesterday I went with friends and tried a few dishes at this place and was planning to give 4 stars for their food. But after getting a good service,  i immediately upgraded rating to 5 stars for food and their customer service.

Things that i liked:
- food was good and very delicious.
- service was good and reasonable,  served in timely manner.
- place was clean
- prices are more than fair - especially for quality and quantity of food. And totally worth it. This is my new favourite place from now on.


 They served us large portions, with juicy fresh meat dishes... and it only got better because the spices they use are wonderful in both taste and smell. The pita that came with the dinner was also very good  and straight from the clay oven, and you get a choice of pitas. Maybe next time I'd settle for two pitas instead of one.


The staff is also capable of providing good recommendations off of their menu.
They have convenient and a lot of free parking in front of the store.
Overall, a very excellent experience.
