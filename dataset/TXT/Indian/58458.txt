yi1LdN8dBh3TLN1hTTOrGw I've been to this restaurant quite a few times, and the food is pretty good. 
What I don't like about this place are the inconsistent changes to the menu, or so they claim. 
The first time I went  they told me free Naan was included with any entree order, but the next time I asked for it, it apparently wasn't included anymore. The third time I went with an Indian friend, and somehow free Naan magically appeared on the table again. 
The service is good until they hear that you plan on using a Groupon voucher, then they leave you waiting for the bill for 25 minutes. 
I would go back again for the food, despite the mediocre service.
