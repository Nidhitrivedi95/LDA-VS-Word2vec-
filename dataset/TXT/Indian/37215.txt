o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ I ordered 2 rotis for the first time from this place. I asked for mild/medium (2nd in a scale of 6 or 7), which you would think would be a safe bet. NOPE. I'm no stranger to spicy food - I travelled through India and Thailand with virtually no problems. 

But let me tell you this roti is so spicy that I literally cannot eat it. When I complained they did nothing to rectify the situation except offer me a free delivery coupon. Clearly this is an issue with inconsistency.

The person on the phone tried to tell me that the spice levels match those in India, which is a ridiculous statement. There is no standard spice system in India, and last I checked this style of Indian rotis are a North American bastardization of Indian cuisine. A delicious one, no doubt, but not exactly an "authentic"-style food that this person tried to make it out to be.

Own up to occasion inconsistency in spicing, Butter Chicken Roti, and you might make some new fans. But this girl's first time ended with a burning sensation I'm not keen to repeat.
