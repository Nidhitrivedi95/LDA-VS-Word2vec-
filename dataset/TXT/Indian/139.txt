-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g I visited this restaurant during lunch for the first time and had the buffet. The mango lassie was super delicious and the food here was very good, hot, and affordable. The selection at the buffet was decent but I would have liked for lamb to have been available. Overall the experience was very nice, the waiters were pleasant, and the dining area was very spacious. I will definitely be going back!
