ZKSivkZcnH-nfqcIS8PUWA We used the Skip the Dishes app to order delivery from The Spice Room, first time eating here, and man was it impressive.

I can't speak to the in-house dining experience but the food that showed up on our doorstep was fantastic. It took a while to get there (65 mins, exactly as predicted in the app, so they were upfront about it) but when it did it was piping hot and packaged in a really smart way.

We had the Bharta (my usual go-to, it was tasty), the chicken tikka masala (incredible), some plain basmati rice, and some onion naan.

All of it was really good, fresh, not too oily, and full of quality ingredients. The spice level was perfect for us too.

The onion naan was out of this world,  I would order again just for that.

I look forward to ordering here again, the food was just as good the next day as leftovers out of the fridge.
