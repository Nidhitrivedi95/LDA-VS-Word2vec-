P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag This is a very good restaurant! Excellent service, reasonable prices, lovely atmosphere ( even Bollywood films on the tv), wonderful food especially the thalis. I really like their South Indian dishes including the different breads.  For vegetarians All India will be a rare treat.
