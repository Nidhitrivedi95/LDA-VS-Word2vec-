m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew Although, the food and selection are not bad, i am questioning the cleanliness of this restaurant. Was at Joe's Indisn Buffet last Tuesday and everything was fine until I saw part of a steel wool (the one you use for scrubbing) on their rice and whe I mention this to one of the woman she seems not to care about it and did not apologgze.  At this point I kind of lost my appetite and soon after we left and on the way out I saw a cockroach crawling on the stairs.  I mention this to somebody who I know was at this plac before and he told me that he saw a cockroach there as wel...eewwwww!  Needless to say I am not going back to this place again until they clean up their act.
