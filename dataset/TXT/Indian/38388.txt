OOBSQF72cl3jBBpLQWhyzw This restaurant is truly a hidden gem. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was welcoming and the staff were incredibly friendly and accommodating. I will certainly be back and recommend to all. 

The reason it did not get rated a perfect 5 if because of the fruit flies, which were an annoyance while dining. 

Aside from that, incredible place! Will absolutely be back :)
