P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag This place is my favorite Indian buffet in all of Pittsburgh. I only get the buffet here, which is the largest, cleanest buffet I've been to. Vegetarian options galore! My favorites at the buffet (though I believe you should try a little of everything)!

-Hot chai tea
-Appetizer bar sauces: get the fried veggie fritter balls and pour the red, brown, and green sauces / chutneys on them. 
-Chicken tikka masala
-Poori (fried puffy bread) and naan (bread in the back)
-Aloo gobi (fried cauliflower)
- saag paneer (cooked spinach )
- biryani with nuts and raisins 

Sometimes they chance the buffet up in terms of variety, but this is what I come for!

The service has an attitude, or resting grump face. Pay at the counter. Don't leave too much wasted food on your plate or they may threaten to charge you a wastefulness fee. 

I love the Bollywood music videos they play here, but this last time I went, I was bummed because the music of the restaurant was not the music that matched up to the music videos.  More dancing!
