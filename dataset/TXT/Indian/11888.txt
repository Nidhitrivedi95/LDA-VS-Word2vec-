aTRnnM41SxIV-u4rUwceOg If you're chillin' in the East end, everyone there knows that Gasa is synonymous to amazing Kothu roti. Place an order at the counter (or phone ahead) and you'll be handed a piping hot take out dish of the most magnificent piece of Sri Lankan food. It's best taking it to-go as they only have 1 table in a cramped space.

This isn't my first Kothu Roti adventure, but I can tell you that for the cost and quality of the product you'll be stunned. My favourite is the Mutton Kothu Roti. This dish is chopped up roti combined with a curry. It takes about 15 minutes to make (give or take) but it's warranted when you see how hard the guys are working in the back. If I had the heart to knock off a star, it would only be because it's so spicy that my face reddens. Yet, I welcome the rosy cheeks because nothing can deter me from the amazing taste.
