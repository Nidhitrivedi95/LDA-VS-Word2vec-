FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw I wanted to try a different Indian restaurant while in town this week and I think I found the one I would frequent if I lived here.

I would agree that due to ambiance and set up, like others have written, this is not a five star. The food and service help make it a four star.

I had the Goat Malabar, I asked for it to be spicy and boy was it. The spice didn't take over the dish though. It just added to the overall taste. There were a few pieces of goat with bones on them but most of the meat was deboned so I was able to enjoy every bite.

I also got a side of the Cheese Naan. This had a good flavor, but I couldn't really taste the cheese inside so when I go back I will try a different type of Naan.

Overall, I would say worth the visit if you are looking for a good Indian dinner. The menu is large so I am sure you can find something you like on there.
