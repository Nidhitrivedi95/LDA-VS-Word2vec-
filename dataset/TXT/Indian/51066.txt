UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ If you live or work in the heights area this needs to be part of your rotation. The mango lassi and mango milkshake are the best I've had.  Same goes for the samosas and the pakora.  I want to put the green chutney on everything I eat anywhere.  And the meat is always cooked phenomenally.
 
You get the impression many of the curries are made from a similar base.  Saffron Patch and India Garden in the greater Cleveland area have more complex/interesting spices.  But I am only speaking relatively, it is still Indian food, the flavours are still phenomenal.  For me the curry is a little bit too salty/buttery, and it usually feels unhealthy, but I believe this is normal for Indian food.  

When it comes to the immediate-area competition sadly Chutney Rolls has closed.  Worse yet Cafe Tandoor charges for rice, which is just surreal. 

The service can be a bit impersonal, overwhelmed, and confused, but that's also super typical of Indian restaurants.  I believe the stories I read on here.  But I've never experienced them being rude and the accidents have never been catastrophes.  I definitely recommend it.
