iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA I am appalled by the service I received here. I ordered a take out tandoori chicks and chaat to go on a weekend night. When I arrived at home, I realized that the chicken was not at all seasoned and had no tandoori flavor (I'm  quite familiar with Indian food). I was thoroughly disappointed when I called and they requested evidence. I sent a picture but they're quested addition corroboration in order to approve a refund. Worst Indian place in town.
