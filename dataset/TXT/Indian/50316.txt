UBj-25LU5dxJ9meb-TPc9w I am mainly doing this as the old man at the front desk has been growing more and more unfriendly lately. 

He does not even care to give customers credit card receipts with payment. You probably have to ask for it every time, seems like he is saving paper (read penny pinching).

Very arrogant about the quality of groceries sold at his store, ask him about the quality and you will know.

Plus he has some real ill-will for AMEX guys in case if you ever care to check whether you can use your AMEX card. In my case he went on for a 5 minute rant.

Food quality at the fast food place is great, no complaints.
