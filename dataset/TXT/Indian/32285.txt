lGNw9h6npTYgEYPK2U58Ww We were at the Streetsville Christmas market and Amantra had some food set up outside that could be purchased. A meal of 2 items and rice was $9.99. I ordered the channa masala and dal makhani to go as it was starting to rain. By the time I got to the car, the dal had come out of the container into the bag. At home I transferred it to a plate and warmed it up in the microwave. It was on the spicy side but was not bad.
We had eaten in the restaurant in the past and that was a better experience. My kids and I love their fusion fries (chaat fries and sweet chili fries). We all thought their main dishes (butter chicken and channa, were just average.
The staff are very nice and informative and I hope they do well in this location.....they just need to make their main dishes as good as their apps.
