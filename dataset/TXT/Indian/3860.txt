0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw It's been almost 4 years since my initial review, but Kohinoor remains our favorite restaurant. Sadly, we live about 30min away now but we still make the trip a couple times per month. I don't know how they do it for the price they do, but the food is amazing. Quality can depend on time of day and it is usually a little better earlier in the day or right around the dinner rush (as with most buffets, probably). One note: the food here is SALTY. I personally love it, but could understand if that's not your thing.
