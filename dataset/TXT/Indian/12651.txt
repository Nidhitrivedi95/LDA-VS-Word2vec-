B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg I've dined at the restaurant twice, and had take out once. It has been wonderful every time! The food is very good, and the price even better. Though I haven't tried everything on the menu, I have really enjoyed everything I've ordered so far. The only sad thing is that the place isn't as busy as it should be for the service, quality and quantity for price of the food your receive.
