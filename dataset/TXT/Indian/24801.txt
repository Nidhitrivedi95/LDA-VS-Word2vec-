h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA I should have written this when I lived in Tempe for 2 years, at walking distance to this place. We used to go there when we craved Indian (being Indian, that is not often but oily spicy restauranty stuff is always tempting). The place seemed to be run by a really nice older couple.

The menu is very typical of Indian restaurants, but the food is more homey than the very poor food we've had at other places. Indian restaurants in this budget bracket rarely hand out freebies, but we were amazed when every time we were given papad to start off with and a small bowl of gulab jamun at the end on the house.

Have never tried buffet (we avoid Indian buffets like the plague) - always only dinner.  It's not in a very attractive lot, and the decor inside also is a bit cobwebby, but it's never been crowded.
