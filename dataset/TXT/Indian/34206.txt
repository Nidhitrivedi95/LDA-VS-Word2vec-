mfnmy_M3D5ElkgJD_TxoCA Came in the other night and I must say the food was amazing. I had the Cauliflower, Momos and Tacos which were delicious. The drinks were superb. I had their old fashion and cool story bro. For my third drink I couldn't decide so the bartender came over and asked me what I liked in flavors and came back with a personal cocktail just for me.  Service top notch! Food great! And the DJ was perfect! I was able to still have a conversation with my partner.
