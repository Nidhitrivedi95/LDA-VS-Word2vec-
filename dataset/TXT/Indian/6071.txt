3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I was like you once. Looking on yelp for the best indian food option. Knowing that these places on the strip weren't worth their prices but wondering what other joints still offer good food, good service, and nice atmosphere (because, hey, you're vacationing in Vegas and you don't need to be slumming it at some filthy ethnic place to save $10 you'll just lose on a side bet anyways). Well, this is the answer. Do not look at any other reviews because New Dehli is where you want to go.

Just a few months old, it has a slew of positive reviews and -- as great as the food was (there is a mango lassi free with your check in that you MUST get) -- the pride the staff/owners put into the restaurant is apparent with every detail of the restaurant. From the decor to the menu to the EXCELLENT service, New Dehli is what comes to mind (for me, at least) when we talk about "shopping local". This is their restaurant and I saw in my visit that the owners truly care about this place. These folks took out a space in a shopping center (plenty of parking!) and have created a truly sincere dining experience. Maybe it's not something I can explain well -- but if you'd like to understand, swing by New Dehli on a Thursday evening and take in the experience. Never have a rooted this hard for a restaurant in a city I've only been visiting.
