ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA I ate lunch at Saffron on a Saturday, it wasn't very busy, just one other person.  The restaurant was quite nice, a white table cloth kind of place.  But for lunch it was pretty casual.  They have a very reasonable priced, &9.95, lunch buffet so I was able to try out quite a few dishes.  Everything I tried was very good.  They had about two types of rice, about 4 vegetable dishes plus about 4 chicken dishes on the buffet along with a little bit of salad, rice pudding, and carrot pudding, oh and of course naan.  Everything was hot and very well prepared.  I really don't know much about Indian cuisine, but I like art, I know what I like.  The chicken tikka masala was my favorite with the tandori chicken a close second.  The wait staff was very friendly and since it was very slow service was excellent.  If you like Indian cuisine then put Saffron on you list to visit.  If you are not quite sure or haven't tried Indian cuisine, then go for the lunch buffet so you can sample a little of everything.
