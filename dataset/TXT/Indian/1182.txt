-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Best South Indian fare I've had in any city. Worth driving way out there. I promise. The dosas are awesome. So awesome that I haven't tried any other entrees on the menu. I think my favorite is the paper masala dosa, but the special rava is a close second. I also LOVE their rasmaiai - cardamom/pistachio flavored milky goodness. If you don't like cardamom, I'd give this one a miss as the flavor is pretty strong. The idli is also top notch. 

I'd say this is one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems. Not to be missed!
