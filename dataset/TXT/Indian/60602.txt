zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q A little birdie told me this is the place to go for authentic Afghani/Pakistani dishes. I must admit this was my first time trying such a cuisine. Like Indian food it is rich in flavor and quite aromatic. The portion sizes are huge and prices are more than reasonable. We had ordered Tiki Masala (I always thought that was Indian, but the Pakistani version was impressive), chicken Biryani (my fav), kabli pulao, and of course naan.  We ordered 'to-go' to feed a big group (10-15 ppl) and it was a hit with my family, they were very impressed.
