xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w My family came to town and we decided to try Tamarind Savoring India. The food and service can be simply described as OUTSTANDING. We enjoyed two goat and two lamb entrees. The seasoning, spices and flavors were amazing. 

Our waiter was most helpful in suggesting appetizers and main dishes. Each person in our party had a different desire of "spiciness". He was able to recommend dishes to meet each diner's needs - and the kitchen superbly delivered with each level of spice. The level of attentiveness was ideal - meeting all of our requests, filling drinks, etc. without impeding our conversations and limited time together. 

The family has since headed home, but I am already looking forward to my next trip to this restaurant. On a side note, I love meat in my food, it's almost a necessity. However, at this fine establishment, I will certainly try a vegetarian dish at some point.
