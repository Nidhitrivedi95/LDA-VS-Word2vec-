Getting my food was a very confusing experience and it was really chaotic in there. I ordered the vegetable thali, received a huge sack of food and was concerned that I had actually ordered a family sized meal or something. It cost $7.95 and is at least two meals worth of food for someone who's hungry. Quality and quantity of the food is very good for the price.

No seating, FYI.
