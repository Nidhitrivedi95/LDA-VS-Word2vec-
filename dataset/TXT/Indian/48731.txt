We ordered a bunch of dishes, including the samosas, the madras masala dosa, and the navratan korma.  The samosas were really great and came with three little dipping sauces.  The madras masala dosa was tasty - a huge Indian crepe rolled up with yummy potato and onion inside.  The navratan korma was the highlight, with yummy veggies in a creamy tomato sauce with raisins and nuts and other fruits in it.  Yum!

The atmosphere is bright and cheery.  The service was a little crusty, but we didn't mind too much.  I hear they have a great lunch buffet, and they also offer deals on different weeknights, like a $25 dinner for two on Sundays, and Dosa Nights on Tuesdays.  

Great place for inexpensive Indian food!  We'll be back.
