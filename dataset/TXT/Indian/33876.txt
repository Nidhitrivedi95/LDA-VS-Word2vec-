LZWXP-D4YPlzsFjVx6b9XA Outstanding flavorful food. The appetizers and entree were amazing. Our waiter was very helpful in deciphering the menu  and helping an Indian food novice select the perfect entree. The only part of our meal that rated average was the dessert. Will make this place a favorite!
