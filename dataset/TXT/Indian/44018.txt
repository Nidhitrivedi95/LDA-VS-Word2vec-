RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Lahore Tikka House at 1365 Gerrard St. E. is arguably the best (North) Indian #food in Toronto. Owner, Alnoor Sayani has the right idea at the right price. The Chicken Tikka Masala, Karahi Gosht (lamb), and Butter Naan were flavourful and spicy and definitely our favourites. It's very busy on the weekends and great for people watching. The outdoor seating is open in the summer. Try the pink Kashmiri tea, flavoured with Saffron instead of coffee (message me for pics).
The only drawback is your clothing and hair will smell like you hung out all day in an East Indian kitchen, but it's totally worth it!
