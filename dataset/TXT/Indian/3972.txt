0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw Food was good and as usual they kept bugging us about buying a drink.  Water works for me!
The lady at the register was crappy and charged us for drinks even though we didn't order any.  There goes your tip people. There's plenty of Indian restaurants in the area.  Sorry, we won't be back to this one anymore.  You just lost 2 good customers.
