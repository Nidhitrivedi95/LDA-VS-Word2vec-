hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q Weird location but good food! I've never actually been to the restaurant, just sent hubby to pick it up to go but I know where it is and even my hubby said it was a weird spot. Only "complaint" is that their mild is still spicy!! I'll admit that I'm a baby when it comes to spicy but I enjoy the flavors/kick at other Indian restaurants at their level of mild. My mouth is on fire after a few bites from this restaurant. This hasn't stopped me from ordering again, just something to keep in mind when ordering.
