zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I had the somosas, onion kulcha, and saag paneer.  All three were good.  The service was generally good.  I had two minor complaints.  The somosas came out at the same time as my entree, which negates the value of ordering an appetizer.  Second, they were out of white wine except for two selections, and the one I ordered didn't come chilled.
