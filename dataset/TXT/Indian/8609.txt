7X-nlzECvzIyeU_0GnrlMw Note:  This place is Vegetarian.  I didn't really know that until I got there.

Just North of the International Centre, this resto is in a non-shabby, relatively new plaza in Malton...that actually looks like Brampton!

Restaurant itself is much bigger than it looks, quite deep.  And it has a hand washing station.  Not sure if that was meant for both customers and workers.

Menu is pretty straight-forward with a one-line description.  No photos though, so either ask questions or just be open to experience new things!

I had half of the Paneer Onion Masala Dosa & the Chetinnad Masala Dosa, both were really good and came with 3 chutneys (orange-coloured, coconut, & coriander) + sambar.  I would say pretty comparable to Guru Lukshmi, slightly greasier, sambar was a bit too salty, & not as extensive of a menu.  Both Dosa were under $12.  Also had a really good Mango Lassi, under $4.

A Bollywood movie/music video was playing in the background, but not blasting.  Atmosphere was actually surprisingly quiet and calm!  A welcomed change to a busy day.  There were only a few tables of dine-in, as opposed to Guru which is always slammed!

Would definitely recommend if you're in the area and feeling like Dosa.
