-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I've been eying this place for a while, since I don't live too far from here. The rainbow on the sign always catches my eye when I drive by because I love rainbows!I Situated in  a corner in a Strip Mall,this store looks smallish from the outside. When I walked in I was genuinely surprised: this place is a LEGIT grocery store! They even have a fresh produce section, which I really wasn't expecting. 

I came here looking for some Garam Masala for the Chicken Makhani dish a Pakistani friend of mine said I must cook. I couldn't find this spice at my normal haunts, so upon recommendation from the guys at Trader Joes I went to Rani's. I found a plethora of ethnic spices, and the garam masala was easy to locate. I even got some Pineapple jam, which I'm excited about trying.

The customer service wasn't all too friendly, and when I paid for my items, the lady intentionally did not give me the coin part of my change (perhaps that was her tip?). OK, so it was only a few pennies, but it really tripped me out the way she didn't even attempt to give me the change. She only handed me the dollars and then walked away. Well OK, Ms. Thang!

Anyway, if you're searching for hard to find ethnic spices from all over the world, then I recommend coming here. Maybe I'll come back and try the lunch counter next time.
