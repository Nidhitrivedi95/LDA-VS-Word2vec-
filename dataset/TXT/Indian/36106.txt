NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw If you are in the beaches and wanting Indian food, Cinamon is a great option!
I'm used to hole in the wall type establishments and I wasn't sure of what to expect.

Cinamon surprised me - portions were huge, curries not too greasy.
I really like the charred eggplant, and the butter chicken and lamb korma was spicy and delicious.  Garlic naan was huge as well.

Overall, I really liked the food here!
However, it took a really, really - really log time for our food.
We had placed an order to pick-up - and I still ended up waiting a good 30 minutes.

A good choice for dinner as long as you aren't in a hurry!
