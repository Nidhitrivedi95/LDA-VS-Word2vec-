-MpXo24qYu4DazQXDrs2oA I was at this restaurant in August for lunch. Was quite excited that we finally have an indian restaurant without a buffet. Tired of people thinking indian food as just curry dishes that are served in the buffet. Well, frankly after visiting this restaurant may be we should just stick to the buffets, even though they taste nothing like the real Indian food (not even half as good as home cooked Indian food). This restaurant has it all wrong. The taste doesn't belong to the south or North Indian tastes. The rasam/Sambar that was served didn't taste like either, just hot water with some bad flavor. After two months of visiting this restaurant this comes up on my yelp search with surprisingly high reviews.
