RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg It was ok. Just ok. The papadum was stale, and the waiter brought me another plate but it was barely better. The prices are those to be expected in a hotel: overpriced. I LOVE Indian food, but when our order came the temperature was partially warm, partially cool--it's supposed to be hot, like it was just cooked, but I was so disappointed I really just wanted to leave. The waitress was attentive, but I will never be back and would not recommend The Royal Indian Bistro. Maybe it was because it was late lunch (in between lunch and dinner) and we caught the kitchen off-guard.  If I could give 2.5 stars I would, I'm being generous with the 3 stars. I'm not impressed by elephant statues or aesthetics (yeah, it looked fancy but I'd take a "hole-in the wall" kind of restaurant with a quality kitchen instead) because what I want is good food.
