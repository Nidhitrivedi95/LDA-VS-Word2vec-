eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg After searching for six months for the right kind of Indian restaurants that we're used to in New York this place has been just a wonderful place to eat.  What I specially like is the fact that there are so many choices and the food is prepared to perfection. I have been to India twice and I cook Indian food so I know what I'm talking about. I highly recommend this restaurant to anybody that likes Indian food, these are really really really good cooks!
