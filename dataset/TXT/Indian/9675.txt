When my employer moved to the North Shore a few years ago I've missed my lunch hour visits to Sree's terribly. I now brave Pittsburgh's streets on my bike for my favorite 'fast food'.  If one is accustomed to the oily, creamy, high calorie meals one typically finds at Indian restaurants, Sree's will take some getting used to. 

Mrs Sree's low-oil vegan dishes with brown rice and whole wheat bread are the healthiest options one could imagine for just $6. I can get 2-3 tasty meals out of one visit!
