VrftSduLIducNfEzITOL5A Great Indian place a buddy told me about some time ago.  Their buffet is full and diverse.  But their menu items are where they shine.  I recommend:

Lamb Korma
Lamb or Chicken Biriyani
Garlic Naan
Tandoori Chicken

Great place for a business meeting or a social occasion.  The place is not rushed and they have 2 tandoors.  Run by happy family.  

And they deliver!  Pick-up as well.
