ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Great food. Restaurant was clean and well kept in a nice area of town. Dinner menu has many options and they'll ask how spicy you want your food. Chicken curry was great! Server was running the register, seating guests, etc, but service was great as other members of the staff seemed to float around and help each other out. This place also delivers if you're in the area and don't want to go out. From what I could tell this was a popular option, as I saw many meals bagged up and ready to head out.
