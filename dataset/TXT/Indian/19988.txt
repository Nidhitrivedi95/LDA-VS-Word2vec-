FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q We eat here at least once a week. The food never disappoints and the service is great! Prior to moving to Madison I had never had Indian food and was nervous to try it but upon trying the food here - I can't get enough of it! I highly suggest this place (: I'm a fairly picky eater but my favorite is the garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, and spring rolls!
