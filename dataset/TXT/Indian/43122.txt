RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg I decided to try agin with family after almost a year(almost when it opened), given some of the positive reviews of late.
We tried the non-veg appetizer sampler, Chile masala and biriyani. Appetizer sample was the smallest you will find on this side of Lake Michigan in an Indian restaurant, the seeks kebabs were actually brittle (believe that!) and spicy as hell, which hides the lack of other masalas while the chicken legs were hard to munch on. Biriyani actually had semi-sticky rice!!!! 
Staff was very courteous but giving stars for that would dilute honest review of the food!!
With Fast Biriyani closed down, avoid Indian restaurants on the East side as no good one left!!!!
