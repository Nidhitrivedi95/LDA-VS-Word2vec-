HVK_m2JUL24hV-w5q_d2Rg The Indian Kitchen looked a little sketchy from the outside, but the insides are fine enough.

Good service (helped by the fact that my friends and I were the only ones in the restaurant at 5:30PM on a Thursday), affordable prices (15% student discount!) and delicious food. 

The Indian Kitchen has definitely converted me into a fan of Indian cuisine, and I definitely look forward to to eating here again!
