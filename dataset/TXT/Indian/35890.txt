Nm6j_BNOFLiO_wRjPF9GBg While the Butter Chicken was good, the overall selection on the buffet was limited and the service was poor. I came here for a late lunch and was shown a table then ignored while I waited for the waiter to bring water and Naan to my table after going through the buffet. I had to get up and get my own glass of water from the bar area and only then did the waiter lift a finger.  I really cannot fathom how Trimurti gets a four star average here on Yelp.
