xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA We were visiting from Detroit and decided to go there as the yelp reviews were good. First time trying Caribbean food and have to say that this place is AWESOME. Clean and well kept restaurant with steady crowd (even at odd hours). We ordered shrimp roti, boneless goat roti, Veggie platter, chicken stew roti and doubles and everything was made to perfection. It's a family run operation and the food is hearty and made with love. My wife literally requested to meet and compliment the chef (Owner) after eating all that deliciousness. Will definitely be coming here every time we visit Canada.  Keep up the great work :-)
