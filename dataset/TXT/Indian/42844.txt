RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg The atmosphere is very nice, however this place is overrated & over-priced.  I have had much better Indian food at other places in Charlotte.  The service is okay but not the best.  Unless I was in the area and craving Indian food, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here to eat.
