tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Food and Service are always out of this world. I couldn't say enough good things about this restaurant. I went rouge for the first time ever and ordered off the menu with the help of our amazing server. He was so helpful and friendly and I ordered the tandoori shrimp Marsala and it's legit the best thing I've ever had at an Indian restaurant and one of my top ten dishes in Phoenix. For real. That good. 

My husband raved about the buffet. And our ice chips floating in the Taj Mahal beer showed the quality of service. 

Go here. The reviews all speak for the amazingness of this restaurant! Five stars for sure. I'd give them six if possible.
