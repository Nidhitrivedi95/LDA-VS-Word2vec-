7U5-h997PyWX4B8uMk4Tcw Hidden gem for delicious curries and naan! I got take out for the Beef Nihari - tender brisket with good amount of spice, Butter Chicken - good flavor, very orange & bright coloured, side of Small Rice (which is more than enough for 3+ people), and 3 pieces of plain naan. Total came to about $30. Kind of on the pricey side but taste is good.  

TIP: Order in advance to avoid the wait. They cook it fresh on the spot so it took around 15 minutes wait. 

Parking in this plaza is horrible (weeknight around 7pm). I don't know who designed it... there are way too few spots for the amount of stores here, including a Wild Wings.
