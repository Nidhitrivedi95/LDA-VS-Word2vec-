sdO4fyWkFsZYHSj6yVwQIg This place is high on my list whenever I'm in Montreal.  The food is incredibly tasty (Chicken Tikka, Palak's of various kinds, curries).  The portions are not huge, which is a plus to me: I'd rather have quality than quantity and the prices are more than reasonable for what you get.

Thanks to whoever posted the menu in yelp; incredibly useful as it seems to be the only web-accessible menu.
