UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I love this place - a really great local Indian place. I think we've ordered from Banjara 20+ times over the years. What I love about this place is that all of the food tastes different. You know the Indian places where EVERY curry tastes the same?  Well this is not that pace. Naan is great, veg and meat dishes are top notch.  I would skip the samosa not their best piece of work. Curries, tandoori, lentils etc are all great. 

I've only ever got delivery so no comment on service or the actual restaurant.
