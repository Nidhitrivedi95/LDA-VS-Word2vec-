qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ The Bombay Grill was a spicy adventure I undertook per positive Yelp reviews.  The second we walked in, I knew we were in an authentic Indian restaurant - we were the only non-Indian table in the restaurant.

We ordered an Indian Chai and a Mango lassi.  Both were rich and tasty.  The entrees were beef curry and chicken masala, both came with naan.  The plain naan had a layer of crisp on the outside and was soft and warm inside.  It mixed well with the spicy curry and masala, both were creamy, rich, and complex with variety of spices.  The chicken and beef meats were cooked to tender, and both were marinated so well that I could taste a hint of the sauces inside the meat.

I am not an expert in Indian food.  I can attest that the food was rich, creamy, tasty and spicy.  The sauce is thicker than that at Amaya Express Indian Food at food courts.   We requested medium hotness for both entrees, and for fellow non-Indians, this is the same hotness of "HOT" at St Louis Wings and Ribs.

The store is hard to find, and the store front is nothing to write home about.  The interior decor is okay enough - red linen table cloth, freshly painted wall with paintings.  If the owner spends little on wall arts and more on food, I am totally fine with it.
