UaMq3DUhtkoZ5WCEQm2T9g Rude man taking orders, rolled my eyes at me a couple of times because I was unsure what to order and could not understand him. I love south Asian food, but I don't know all their names. If you decide to go, park far away from everyone else because the patrons will dent your car door. Never again.
