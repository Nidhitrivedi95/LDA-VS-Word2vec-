g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ The food is really good quality. We tried the Bhel which was pretty decent. The White Butter Chicken is more a cashewy qorma than butter chicken - very light tasting and needed a bit more kick. But for someone who doesn't take too much heat, this was a very flavourful dish. The Chicken Baida Roti, OTH, had some serious spice kick. It was a generous portion and would require a a healthy appetite to finish. The Chicken Tikka skewers are run of the mill but the Malabar Parantha it came with was very good. My four year old preferred the bread more than the Chicken for sure. We didn't try any of their drinks or desserts but will hit the place again. Prices definitely way more reasonable than Bombay Street Food who are just up the street from them. 

Now for the service - pretty lacklustre I would say. They brought three of our four dishes fairly quickly but the important one that my pregnant, and very hungry, wife ordered was forgotten - they blamed it on being busy. There were not many people there - it was a cold, drafty evening so not many tables were full - they had IMO forgotten about the item altogether but wouldn't admit to it :) No one died this time but, guys, be careful with pregnant ladies :p
