2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw They definitely know what they are doing!A huge variety of Indian snacks, sweets and lunch items.

I got a few things and throughly enjoyed them.Very reasonably priced and the order line moves very fast irrespective of the long lines!

Good job in the running the show.The place is neat and clean which always is an added for family owned joints!

One suggestion would be to add an extra cash register to handle the long lines faster.

THEY ONLY TAKE CASH OR DEBIT!
