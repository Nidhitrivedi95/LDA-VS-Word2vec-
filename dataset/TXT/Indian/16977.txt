DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew The food is delicious! Curry leaf's food has so many amazing flavors. I had the chicken saag and it was to die for! The tikka masala is also a favorite of mine great texture and perfect amount of spicy. I love this place I will be a life long customer. So happy to have a Indian restaurant on this side of town.
