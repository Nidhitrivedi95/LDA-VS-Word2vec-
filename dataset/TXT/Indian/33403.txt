Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q Brand new Indian Fusion cuisine in the heart of Gainey!

I came on opening day, so I expected there to be some hiccups, which there were (ex. charged me for dinner salad instead of lunch....but they remedied that), but nothing that won't get fixed over practice/time.  

The lunch menu is very reasonably priced for this area, which is nice, and they have a fun array of items to choose from.  I considered ordering the Naanwich (tandoori chicken sandwich with guacamole and grilled paneer cheese), or the Tandoori Shrimp flatbread, but I decided to be healthy and ordered the Inde Salad (salad with tandoori chicken, masala chickpeas and potatoes) instead.  Overall, the salad was quite nice. The chicken was juicy and flavorful, and the masala veggies were super tasty. I just wish that the dressing was something a little more exciting rather than a basic balsamic vinaigrette, hence the 1-star deduction.

I am excited to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood, and look forward to trying some of there other creations!
