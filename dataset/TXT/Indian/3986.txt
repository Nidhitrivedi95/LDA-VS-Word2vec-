112pGcb0ZB666d_IwFt4jA I had the aloo matar in a wrap and it was fantastic! Only $6 and a perfect size for a lunch. It was so flavorful and the perfect amount of spice. I don't like hot spicy things which makes it hard to find Indian food that I love but this had spices that were not hot! Very flavorful!
