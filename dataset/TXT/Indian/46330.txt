sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Had the potato roti and the chicken roti one other time.

You could tell that the chicken in the chicken roti was not cooked with the filling because it was really dry. I also didn't like the fact that the chicken were cut into small diced pieces. Made it seem like there was no chicken at all. The potatoes in the potato roti were way over cooked and couldn't taste if there were potatoes in there or not.

The hot spice really carried the dishes because it takes away from the actual taste of the so called "roti". Really be careful with your selection of spice level because it is really spicy. The roti, which is not really roti but a thin layer of naan, did not go well with the filling. Which by the way they should not call roti but naan. Portion wise it was a little too much that you get sick of half way though. If you want a crispy spicy mush, this is the place for you.
