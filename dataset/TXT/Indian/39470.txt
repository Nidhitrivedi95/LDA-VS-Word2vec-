OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA I will never come back here again.  Being a Chinese, I think this is a worst chinese restautant that I have been.  Everything is deep fried here, food are too oily and MSG must have been used.  I guess the reason why it is so full all the time is because that is probably the only chinese halal place in town.
