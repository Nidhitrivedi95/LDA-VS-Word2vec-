gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg This place is as authentic as it gets. If you've ever considered making the move to vegetarian or vegan, this is a great place to start that experience. I went right at the start of lunch time around 11:30 AM. The bright flavors and aromatics of the food here Plus the endless combinations possible with the multitude of flavorful chutneys make every visit an experience. I've never eaten beet root before but it was absolutely delicious andI can't wait to go back for more. All the dishes have A fresh bright  eye appeal. Complex flavors marry bold Currys, mint, coconut, tamarind and/or turmeric and cilantro with subtle earthy flavors like saffron, onion, tomato,  cauliflower, eggplant and root vegetables. Each dish is unique and there are plenty of mellow items on the buffet such as naan bread, rice and a crunchy dosa to balance everything out. The desserts are never overly sweet and everything is clearly marked vegan or non-vegan in case you need to know. The owner, Raj, is gracious and passionate about his food and flavors. He will educate you on anything especially if you ask about his feelings regarding Indian food here in the US.
