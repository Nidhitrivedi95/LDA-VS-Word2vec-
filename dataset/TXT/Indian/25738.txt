I have never given any establishment one star but this place deserves it in spades.

We catered food from here for a party and it was some of the worst Indian food we've ever eaten. The daal tasted like a cinnamon candle, the palak paneer had no taste.  Do you like prepackaged frozen veggies? You can find them in the mixed vegetable curry, you'll love it if you enjoy food that has a texture similar to rubber.

And the final thing that put me over the edge was fighting the nauseating feeling an hour later then spending an hour in the bathroom at 4 in the morning.

My son, my wife all had stomach issues after eating their food.

Avoid at all costs, wish we had read the reviews.
