A-KVm7iKLOe1X1yAQP13FA first thing first. when in south indian restaurant, never try north indian dishes or any other crazy thing. Same goes vice versa, however I have experienced good Dosas in north indian restaurants. 
If you are not sure, then only try Dosa or Idli. Uthapam, Thali may not be best option. Mysore Masala has spicy sauce in it. be careful, even though this is my fav. don't try fancy dosas like spring veggie or paneer. Dosa is always good with mashed potatos n saute onions. So a good masala dosa should fill up ur craving and appetite.
The portion of the food is not enough for a regular dinner. I see that as a common problem with majority of the resturants in Toronto after moving from US to here. But thats not mean the end of it. There are few good reviews for others too. 
The ambience is just to support a visit. However, it may be true for the most of Gerrard street Indian/Paki restaruants. 

Hope u enjoy it!
