YCq8VGDRHO3JkiyUzQbyIw I love Indian food and been here a few times before. 1st time was great and i kept returning to capture that great taste again. This time not so much. Arrived at 11:30am for the buffet lunch to find the chili crispy chicken was cold and mushy. The other chicken dishes were only luke warm.  

I immediately let the owner know. He quickly removed the very full pan of chicken. He returned 5 minutes later with another pan with just a little bit in there. I assumed he just wanted to get some fresh fried chilli chicken out asap. No! Same chicken!


I go to pay at the register and question him about it and I told him not is only morally,  ethically  and inconsiderate of his customers, but I believe it's a health code violation. He said it's fine to reheat because it was cooked once already! I can't believe this is how this guy runs his restaurant.

Be prepared to eat reheated food if you come here. Absolutely disgusting! I truly believe because my first visit was so good and all other visits mediocre that they have been recycling this food for the next day or so. 

I will never eat here again!  The 5 star below mine is an employee who works there! Now this guy is posting bogus reviews.
