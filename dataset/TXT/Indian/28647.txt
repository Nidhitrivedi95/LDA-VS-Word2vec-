JA-O7eaQ_Mkuzu4ctzEzfg There are a few options for lunch diners from the $4.99 vegetarian combo, $5.99 meat combo, or the full out buffet for $10.99 

The menu selections change daily from what I've observed the few times I've gone. 
I welcome the change though. All the dishes has been consistently fresh. 

Sometimes it's curry goat, sometimes beef curry, sometimes they have a kidney bean daal, or today it was yellow split pea daal, sometimes pakoras, tandoori chicken or tandoori fish.

But you can count on thing... Butter Chicken and Basmati rice!!  Always a crowd favorite. ;)

The naan was a lot better this time around, it was soft and fluffy and the rice pudding dessert with almond shavings was also excellent! 

Like the variety and the quiet dining atmosphere here. This is now my go to spot for Indian in the area.

Suggest if you visit at lunch sit close to the windows, it's a lot brighter as I find it's a bit dim near the center of the dining room.
