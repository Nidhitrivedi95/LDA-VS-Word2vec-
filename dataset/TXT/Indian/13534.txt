biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg We went there for a buffet an hour before their closing time. The buffet was ok. What was really bad was the service. While we were still eating, the waiter brought out a vacuum cleaner and began cleaning the floor. It was very uncomfortable for us with all the noise the vacuum was making. The owner was right there and she did not seem to care.

We went there for the second time after a few months. The service was again really bad. We had wait every time to get water filled into our glasses. The waiter also had some kind of eye infection. I wonder how they allowed her to work with that.

When I mentioned to the owner about the bad service her response was - "What ever we do people don't seem to be satisfied" 

The food was OK.
