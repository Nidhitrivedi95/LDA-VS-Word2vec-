1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g I will be honest - I love Nepali spices, flavors and the presentation so much that I admit it would be hard to give an authentic meal a bad review.  The Nepali meals are so delicious. Within a week, I am craving it again. I also love the momos of course and the masala chai is the best I've had in the city. My only regret is not finding out about this place sooner!
