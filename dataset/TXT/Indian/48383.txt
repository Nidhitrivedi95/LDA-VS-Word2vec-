ThZdaQiCbu8mL8rbLNyrgA Saffron is good because they refill the food often so it stays warm and fresh. Also, the service is very friendly and they keep their restaurant clean. The naan was pretty good, and I loved the tandoori chicken, but I wish there was more variety in general and more spicy options.

What I didn't like was the arrangement of the buffet. Way too cramped especially when I am rushing to eat my plate full of food! Also, the table they sat us at was terrible for buffet-ing because it was a booth and hard to get in and out. They need more veggies.

Overall it was a good experience. Recommended for the $8.95 lunch buffet!
