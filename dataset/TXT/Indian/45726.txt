scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg I have been to this place couple of times now for buffet, the food quality is becoming terrible. 

Restaurant is not for indians or those who like authentic indian dishes. 

Disclaimer: I am vegetarian so i haven't tried chicken or lamb entrees. 

Cons
- Not great food. 
- During recent visit, malai kofta was pathetic, other entrees were not that great either. 
- They had rice without daal. I don't think any indian eats rice this way. This restaurant is probably for those who are not that familiar with indian food. 
- they had one dish called aloo zucchini which isn't punjabi or south indian dish. Is this really indian buffet ? It tasted horrible anyway. 

Pros
- Excellent ambience
- Friendly staff
