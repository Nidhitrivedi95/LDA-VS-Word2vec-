GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA I love and hate Curry Corner.

Curry Corner has excellent food. I mean seriously great middle eastern and Indian food. The things I need however out of a place like Curry Corner are simple and not always met--quick service, good food, and most importantly a good take-out experience.

"Take-out experience? What the hell is that, Faraaz?"

It's several things for me, including the amount of food given when taking out versus when eating in. It's also the quality of the take out box material and strength of the plastic bag they go in. Also, if I choose to not throw away my half eaten meal for a week, take out experience includes the smell of old leftovers (refrigerated and left on the counter).

So yeah, I love and hate Curry Corner because the take out experience just isn't up to par. They seriously will give you almost half the amount of food on many dishes. Plus, it takes forever (which is okay because the food at least tastes really, really good). Everyone is all about the Tikka Masala, but they have many other great items that get overlooked. Branch out, order something you can't pronounce, and prepare to have a great meal at a great price.
