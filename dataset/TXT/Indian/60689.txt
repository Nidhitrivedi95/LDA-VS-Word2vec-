zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q We've been going to "Khyber halal" from long time and have had exceptional good meals every time. Although small, the restaurant is reasonably attractive with some wall decoration. If you like authentic afghan style food I would highly recommend this place. The prices are reasonable and every curry comes with 4 pieces of naan . I and my husband like panner tikka masala it is our fav dish here. Recently we visited this restaurant again and thought to try samosas as appetizer for the first time but unfortunately it was horrible. It dint really look like samosa and stuffing was very less and not at all tasty so 4 star is for panner tikka and naan.
