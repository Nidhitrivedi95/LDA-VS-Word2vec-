JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Was there with a bunch of girls for their weekend buffet and I have to appreciate their service. Considering that we were a group of almost  50, Aroma still managed to make it comfortable for us as well as the other guests.

I would rate the food as 4-star. Very nice starters- samosa chaat especially. Some of the dishes were way too salty- sambhar and some chicken curry. But the overall taste and freshness of food was good. And the fruit drink (included in buffet) needs special mention. Loved it.

The food layout was a little confusing though. 2 desserts at the start and 2 at the end confused the guests. One anyway does not  expect 4 desserts at Indian buffets ;) 

Definitely going back some time soon!!
