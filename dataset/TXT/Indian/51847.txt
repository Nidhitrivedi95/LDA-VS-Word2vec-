UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I just left this Indian bistro and overall I was very pleased with my experience. The food was well prepared and the presentation was clean and simple. The vertical vindaloo curry is delicious as is the cream and tomato based curry. (the second dish listed under Indian entrees) the service was friendly and attentive. I will be returning to this great Vegas find.
