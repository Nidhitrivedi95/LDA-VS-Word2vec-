TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw This place is okayish... North Indian snacks like Aloo Chat, Samosa chat are tasty, However Dosa, Uthampam, Sambar can be rated as average. Ordered Chicken Biryani with spice level 8 and its not spicy, I should have ordered 10. This being a North Indian restaurant, the biryani style is different than that of Hyderabad Biryani.  Lassi is the best thing they have. Its 10 min Drive from Strip and have ample parking.
