z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Came here for the lunch buffet. I went at 1:30pm. Si I only had a hour to eat. They didn't have a wide selection of food. Perhaps because it was close to it being closing time. Hence the 3 stars. Even the taste of the food was not so good like the other Indian buffets. You cloud say it was bland. Nothing had a punch of flavor. I guess it's a good place to go in a pinch. But go early and maybe they will have more selections
