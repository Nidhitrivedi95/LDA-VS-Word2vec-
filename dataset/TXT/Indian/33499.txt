LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw This is definitely a diamond in the rough!

Located in a ghetto strip mall, but don't let it fool you. The hubbster and I have eaten here on many occasions and I finally have to tell the world (or at least the world o' Yelp). This place is amazing. I not only say this for the food. I say this for the customer service and atmosphere. It's a family owned establishment and you are treated just like one. 

I have tried their weekly buffet lunch and their weekend buffet dinner. I would love to go for a non buffet, but the food, selection, and price for the buffet is so good I just can't pull myself away from it:) The lunch buffet isn't as good as the dinner though, but I think that is because it isn't as busy. At least the times I have gone that's the way it's been. 

For the weekend dinner they offer appetizers, soup, 2 different kinds of rice, naan, and multiple dishes, plus desserts. For 2 dinner buffets, large Kingfisher for about $30! Who can beat that??? To say I need a wheel barrel to leave the establishment is an understatement. 

We even had our Xmas din din here. It was absolutely packed and it put the biggest smile on my face to know that this wonderful place gets the support and the recognition it deserves. I am proud to write this and to verbally tell people if they are looking for wonderful Indian cuisine this is the place to get it.

Yummers!
