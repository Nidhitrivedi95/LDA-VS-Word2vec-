J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ Little India is pricier than AYCE indian buffets but is definitely a big notch higher in quality. I asked them to give me "Indian spicy" and they did. It was glorious. I would recommend their Masala and Vindaloo curries if you like a kick. Otherwise, stick with Chicken Korma.

The butter chicken here wasnt the best though - thus the one mark deduction. Kind of similar to creamy ketchupy taste. Not that bad either.

There are two stories and usually line ups out the door for dinner hours on Fridays/Weekends so call ahead or go a bit earlier.

Would recommend.
