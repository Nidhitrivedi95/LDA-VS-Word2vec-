4TZjm5eIQq4hKnjFjOyW3w Have been to this takeaway place multiple times. Have had quite a few things, amongst them a veggie thali, Masala dosa, onion dosa, kottu rotti, idlis, medu wadas, daal wadas, boonda, and today an Egg Kottu Rotti. 

The egg kottu rotti is quite different then veggie kottu rotti. There is a bunch of veggie curries added to the rotti and so it becomes moist. Egg Kottu rotti is all eggs and rotti. With some spices and herbs. Quite good. But I find the veggie kottu rotti much better and value. The egg rotti quantity is quite less. 

Do order a veggie thali, the quantity is humongous and the rice quantity is unbelievable. The choice of curries changes every day, but if there is Mushrooms curry make sure you buy that extra. The best I have ever had. 

The onion dosa, a bit better than Masala dosa as the masala dosa is almost all potatoes. 

The servers behind the counter are extremely generous and fill the containers to the brim.
