j9YFHVQqxM_qKHIc4nck-A It is extremely difficult not to give Wong's Asian Cuisine 4 stars, and here are the reasons<U+200B>:

1) Portion - gigantic is the right description.  We ordered a Manchurian Beef Noodle ($8) for take out.  It filled 2 boxes.  My BF and I could only finish 1 of the 2 boxes together.

2) Price - Very affordable.  $8 for a Manchurian Beef/Chicken Noodle.  $9 for a Chicken Pakora.  There were about 15 pieces of pakora (see picture).  Each piece was the size of a golf ball.  Lunch special is $6 per item, available Monday to Friday.

3) Services - The waitress was fast, effective and friendly.  She gave us extra napkins per request.  Like 4 extra thick napkins.  It was pretty generous.  

4) Cleanliness - the exterior of the store looked divey.  The interior looked nothing special.  The washroom (ladies) was, surprise surprise, very clean and tidy.  Yes, the bathroom amenities were no frills and basic, but it was CLEAN as in no dust, no spot or mark, no mess on floor.  I won't say completely dust free, but it beat the cleanliness level of many expensive restaurants.  And there was hot water, hand soap, paper towels.  I was impressed.  Someone cared about washroom here.

5) Food - I am no authority of Indian Chinese food.  Did the food taste the way it was supposed to taste like?  No clue.  I could tell you everything tasted bold. There were strong spices flavours.  The pakoras were delicious.  The noodle was average: mostly noodle, little beef, orange in colour.  The noodle was noted as non-spicy on menu.  It was actually mildly spicy.  Food was made to order.  It came out of kitchen piping hot.  

The food rating is 3 stars in truth.  I round it up to 4 stars, because the first 4 aspects are not just good, but extremely strong.
