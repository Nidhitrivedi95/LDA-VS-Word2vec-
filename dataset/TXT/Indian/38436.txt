OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g I love Indian. Can't get enough. I lived on the curry mile in Manchester, England for 3 years during college and ate it every day. Loved urban turban. I just had the lunch buffet which I try to stay away from due to my lack of control. I am now in a food coma. It was all good especially for buffet food. I really liked the tandoori chicken, prawn curry and garlic naan. When I go back I'll go a la carte. Not that that will help as they have bottomless dishes. I did not see my favorites on the menu (madras or vindaloo) but the server who was great assured me they could do any dish desi style. Mango lassi! Mmmmmmmm. Time to download lose it app!
