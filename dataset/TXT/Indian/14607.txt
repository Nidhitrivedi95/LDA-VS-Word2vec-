C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw Mutton Roll! Mutton Roll!! 

I could eat it all day, these guys do not skimp on the spice and make it as it's supposed to be. We even ordered the Kothu Roti but it was the Mutton Roll that stole my heart. 

I will definitely be back for more.

PS: The service is really good, the guy behind the counter was all smiles!
