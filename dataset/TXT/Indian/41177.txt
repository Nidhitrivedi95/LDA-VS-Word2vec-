PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ Came for lunch and enjoyed it. They had a decent variety of items, and the quality was pretty good. The food wasn't very spicy, but some of the desert items were very sweet. 

The restaurant fills up quickly and getting to the buffet can be tricky if you're seated further from it. You will find yourself moving between tables and traffic going in the other direction. 

The service was good and our servers checked on us periodically. However we did have to flag them down for refills.

Give it a shot, but be mindful of the price and the two hour seating limit.
