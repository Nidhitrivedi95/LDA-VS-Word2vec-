rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ This restaurant would be probably be good if it wasn't too busy, when we came in the restaurant there was no one to greet us, and a long time to wait longer than they told us to wait. The food when it finally arrived was coming very slowly and having many intervals between dishes. The food was fine except it came in very little quantity. The restaurant wasn't too big even the outside area was small. The way to order food isn't traditional either you have to go all the way to the front of the restaurant to order and the price is OK. Overall don't go here if you have a lot of people with you. I recommend small groups.
