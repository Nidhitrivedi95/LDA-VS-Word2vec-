Dh2Z3WNu6M71LbMNHEeg3w The food is not great. I have been there both times for hot and sour soup take out, and the soup is not amazing. But what bugs me is that, both occasions I specifically asked for Hot sauce packages, and both times when coming home there were none. Not even a utensil or anything (which I don't mind if I am eating at home). But the fact that this happened on two different occasions, just shows how little care they put into their customer service. The second time this happened, which was about 30mins ago, I called back just to let them know (not even to complain), and after hearing me explain above, they put me on hold to answer the call of a take out order, and after being on hold for 8 minutes I decided to just write this review instead. I can understand if they are overly busy, but both times the place was pretty empty. Today, there was only one table being served.
