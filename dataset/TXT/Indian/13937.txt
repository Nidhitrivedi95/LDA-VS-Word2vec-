BuC5gidaUkXs0YPZmvQexA This authentic pie shop offers variety of traditional British and some local flavor varieties. From steak and kidney pie to butter chicken pie, they have got it all. And yeah they taste good too. Customer service is great, where the owner isn't shy to share his experiences, tips & techniques and his vision to being the only Pie shop around an area where the clientle might not even have heard of pie's. Highly recommended to walk in and take in the aroma. Would go their again and wouldn't miss a chance to visit to get pie's if am in the area. My go to  place. :) Oh and fyi : i didn't see it but I would like for them to make a Minced meat pie.
