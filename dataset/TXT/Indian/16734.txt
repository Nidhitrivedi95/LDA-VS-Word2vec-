I was in Tempe for a few days, and my vegetarian self always struggles out on the highway, seeking the best experiences I can have, and always fearful of going hungry.   Well, at 9:10pm Friday night, I accidented upon this place, in a goofy strip mall next to a Motel 8, and nervously asked if it was too late to dine since they were closing at 10pm.  The owner was very welcoming and seated us promptly.   The place was a bland sun-drenched pink walled space with a buffet at the back wall.   I didn't have much hope at all.   But when our palak paneer and our Bharwan Baigan Curry showed up, the salivating began.    Perfectly prepared, the eggplant was absolutely delectable.  The spinach and cheese also very delicious.   I couldn't beleive it, this was a definite rival to my fave indian kitchen back home.   I loved it.     We had some leftovers, but no rice to go with it, so the owner gave us free rice so we could have our curries for breakfast in the a.m.   -  a definite must if you like true indian vegetarian food.    Tempe has it's Indian going on.
