DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg I found Udupi in the strangest way.   I was talking with my friend from NE Mesa, and she told me I was right next to her favorite Indian restaurant.  I thought it was ironic that I have been driving by it for a couple months and thought it was part of the laundry mat. Little did I know, it was a little piece of food heaven.   The atmosphere is less than desirable, but the food is fantastic!  The entire menu is vegetarian and I cannot recommend one thing, because it is all excellent. They do not serve alcohol, but you can bring your own bottle and they don't make you pay a cork fee.   I recommend going with a group, this allows you to order multiple items and try them family style.
