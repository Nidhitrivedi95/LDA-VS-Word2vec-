bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug My family has been coming here for almost 10 years now. We always order the chilli chicken, mixed fried rice, beef with broccoli, garlic shrimp. The food is spicy, but quite  greasy at times. They need to expand the restaurant and give it a makeover! But, this is still my favourite hakka indian chinese restaurant in toronto!
