nYKBZdzoA-kjqiK08IPSiA More so than the Food, there was a consistent image in my mind 'til now.
From Meal start-to-finish, I was hoping to see that image dissipate.
It never went away and this simply proves one simple THEORY...

Treat each Customer as if they were your last(or as Family).
By no means were we not properly served, just the service lacked Enthusiasm.
Lacked warmth, welcome, all those connections to make it complete.

Originally I thought to face-off the Malabar Chicken to Southern Fried Chicken.
After a quick observation of texture and flavour components, it's not reasonable.
I will rather compare it to another Indian style Chicken dish instead{1}.

                            Malabar Chicken  vs.  Chawla Cream Chicken
                                    ($9.99)                             ($14.99)

 A version of Chicken Shish Kebob   I     A version of Campbell's Cream Chicken
 Add'l coating of spices outside         I     Add'l spices in the Cream/Milk Sauce
 A variation of Tandoori Chicken       I     A non-curry variation of Butter Chicken
 Dark Meat perfectly cooked juicy     I     Dark Meat perfectly cooked tender
 Mediocre hot-spicy at best               I     Not meant to be hot-spicy at all
 $1.00 per bite.  $$$                          I     $1.50 per bite.  $$$$

                                                   ~~Winner~~
                                                Malabar Chicken
                                                    (by a beak)

{1} Not to be taken too seriously, just a fun concept(Face-off dishes).
