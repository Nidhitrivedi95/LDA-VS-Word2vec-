LwXo16VrGPhhOWc_Wj7ifw I thought this was a restaurant, but apparently it's just a hobby.

Drove half an hour out of my way to a sign saying they were closed "due to a family emergency." Reading through other reviews, this is not an isolated incident and apparently happens with a fair amount of frequency. 

We don't live in a communist country (yet)-  no one is mandating your hours. If you can't keep your own business hours, you should probably change them to something you CAN commit to.

If this were a one-time thing, I'd be inclined to be sympathetic- but clearly it isn't.
