nVw5MK7dBw_JzoH82DCfJw Very good Indian food for very reasonable prices, especially when you consider that it is right on Capitol Square.  You can even get a discount with a student ID!

I got the vegetable korma, which was fantastic.  Sadly, there was no lamb korma, but that is okay.  Flatbread was good, especially the potato stuffed one.  We got complimentary soup, which was nice.  Service was very attentive.  Not a ton to say, otherwise.
