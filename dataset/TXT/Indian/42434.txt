QzM-p93UPqQ3JN-iqgUNPQ Just moved recently and Blue Water was within walking distance so I thought I'd check it out. Walked into the small restaurant and first noticed the beautiful tropical wall mural then the matching blue tablecloths. It was very clean and organized. Staff very pleasant. Chose the Beef curry over rice and the chicken curry roti. Food came out pretty quick and stayed hot till I got home. 

When I unwrapped everything it smelled really good and I was excited to dig in. Tried the Beef curry first; the beef was tender but very dry. The rice was cooked with too much water so it was very water logged and wasn't able to absorb the curry very well. Next, the chicken roti. The chicken was tender but the potatoes were overcooked and mushy. There was something in between the layers of roti that looked like yellow cornmeal which didn't help with the texture nor did it look very appetizing. I didn't enjoy the tastes of either of the curry dishes. 

They do have affordable lunch specials from 11am-3pm that start at $3.99 so I might be back to try more of their food and the potato balls.
