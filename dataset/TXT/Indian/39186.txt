oSS4sjOEjsubAKdTuAErfw Went here last weekend to use a Groupon that my girlfriend purchased months ago.
We've both been to Mad Greek in the past and our experiences were so-so. We weren't expecting much and this time was no different.

After a 10+ min wait, we finally got our waters and put in our appetizer order.
We started off with a Greek sampler appetizer which had hummus, pita bread, falafel, greek salad, and gryo meat. The sampler was generously sized but everything was just alright.  After the appetizer we both had a greek salad and placed our order for the main course. The greek salads were pretty much the same thing that was on our appetizer but in a larger size. However the balsamic dressing was pretty good.

Anyhow, I order the tikka masala and my girlfriend had the alu ghobi. We both opted for medium spiciness. My tikka masala was definitely more towards hot than medium and the alu ghobi was barely mild. Anyhow the chicken was over seasoned so the outside texture was dry/grainy. The flavor of the seasoning also didn't carry through so it probably wasn't marinated long enough. Overall, quite disappointed. The alu ghobi was better and was properly seasoned.

The Groupon also included a dessert. We opted for a pumpkin spiced cheesecake which was good (no idea if it was house made).

While dining, both our neighboring tables complained about errors on ordering and the long wait for their food. For us, the service was also a bit slow too but it wasn't so bad since we had a few different courses.

Overall, when considering the discounts with the Groupon, its not too bad ($34 for the groupon, 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 1 dessert). However, all that aside, this place is way overpriced for the quality of the food & service. I believe the original bill would have been close to $80!
