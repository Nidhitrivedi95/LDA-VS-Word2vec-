MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg What makes this place popular is how they offer good quality food at extremely good prices.

We ordered take out food for a dinner party, 3 kinds of appetizers, 3 curries (big size), 2 sweet dishes - enough quantity to feed 3 families. I was surprised to see our bill came under $50. 

Overall, the main course tasted good. Their samosas were nice as well. There is a lady who takes down the take out order, she is quite helpful in guiding about the sizes and what food she recommends. 

Service is good but they could improve how the queues work, lots of confused faces and little management on that front. 

Bonus points for cleanliness!
