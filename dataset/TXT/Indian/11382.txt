afm4aqhxPYcTs2x_nMEG9w This is my first foray into Sri Lankan cuisine and it was a pleasant experience. Tried two Tamil staples - Khothu Roti (chopped roti shells stir fried with meat, eggs, veggies, and spices) and a Lamprie (a flavorful smorgasbord of your choice of meat/seafood,  eggplant, anchovies, potatoes, onions, sambol and more topped over rice wrapped in fragrant banana leaves). Portions are quite generous with well-rounded flavours - salty, sweet, tangy, spicy. Prices are fair for what you get - about $9-14 a dish. Dining area is hidden behind the front counter, where trays of snacks greet you upon entering the restaurant. Give it a try!
