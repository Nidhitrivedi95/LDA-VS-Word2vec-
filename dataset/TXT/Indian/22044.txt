GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw I went to this restaurant sometime back. I'm an Indian and I would not say they prepare authentic Indian dish, but the food in general was good. I had vegetable briyani, but it was like peas, vegetable & mild spice...more like vegetable mixed rice rather than Briyani...my hubby ordered Lamb Briyani...n it was also kinda customized as an American version. But ambiance of the restaurant was good and it has a bar. Nice environment then most of the Indian restaurant I visited.  There was this restaurant guy who started to smoke so nearby to us when we where having our dinner..I felt that behavior to be rude.
