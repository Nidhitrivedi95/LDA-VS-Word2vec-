7mgNBuU68N5fzdG3JxN1XQ Worst customer service ever! Don't waste your time and money. We explicitly ordered the goat sukkha and asked for roti with it but it took them 20 minutes to make the roti! They have Zero regard for what the customer wants. We explicitly also told them to give us papad before the food because we were extremely hungry. The irony was that the papad was the last thing our server brought out- as if it was dessert. I had lost it by then and asked him to turn around and take that papad back to the chef. Prejudiced and flawed business operations. They favored white people take out orders and treated indian dine in clients as shit. DONT GO HERE!!!!!!!
