qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA $18 for a litre of wine. Wine from a bottle and not a box? Let that sink in. That's practically zero mark up. 

Was it the best wine ever? No. Was it totally drinkable? Yes. Did we get a second litre? Yes. Since there were three of us, I feel this is OK. Not great... but it was the holidays. 

The pad Thai here is generally liked by students, but as a grown up I only go for the cheap drinks here. I'm really mature.
