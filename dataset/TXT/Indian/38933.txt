OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Excellent! We came for lunch and got their buffet. Some of the buffet items consisted of salad, white and lemon rice, Channa Masala, Dahl, cabbage, Korma, 4 different types of chicken, etc. The service was very friendly and everything was very clean. I'll definitely come back!
