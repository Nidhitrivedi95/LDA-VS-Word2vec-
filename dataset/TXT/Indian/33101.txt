llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Have you ever had one of those dining experiences which end with your taste buds telling you "Gimme more, more!" but your stomach says "Stop already, there's no more room!"  Well, that's the experience I had today at India Palace Cuisine. Spurred on by the reviews of Rand and other yelpers, I decided to try this place for my weekly boo-fay excursion.  

Getting there was no problem: it's just a block off I-17 at W. Bell and parking was no problem because it's in a strip mall which is mostly empty. The place is clean, a bit dimly lit which is great for a more relaxing experience, and the staff was friendly - and they remained so even though they were dealing with a lunch crowd that included a cricket team when I went there. I was seated in a comfortable booth and immediately served a basket of piping hot naan bread fresh from the tandoor.

The buffet selection was not huge, unlike in Chinese buffets, but definitely more than adequate. The biryani rice was excellent, as was the basmati. The curries (I just had to try them all) were very flavorful and spiced on the milder (for me) side, but there were also cooling condiments for those who might find the heat level of the spices a bit daunting. There were more than enough delectable vegetable selections to make vegetarians very happy. And the tandoori chicken was good though not great. In all, the quality of the food was such that I kept going back for more until I grudgingly gave in to my stomach's pleas to stop already. Nevertheless I still managed to sneak in a tiny taste of the desserts - a spoonful each of the two puddings and just one ball of ladoo in syrup.

Going back (or was it waddling back) to my car, I decided that I needed to do something to compensate for having eaten so much, so I decided to proceed to the Rio Salado Habitat Restoration Area and walk its trails ... and that will be the subject of my next review ;-)
