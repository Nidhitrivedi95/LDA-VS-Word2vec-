U3Ah385YhvlraXsKcEeZ4g Inside I sat myself of course next to the Cake Fridge as I notice the single server working away.  A Daughter/Mother team did the same while the waitress walked to the back.  Another group walked in and went to the back, that's how I figured out the back has seating too.  When the waitress got back, we got Menus and took our order/drink.  She was very Friendly I found, but she had her hands full even at 50% resto capacity on this Weeknight.

Chicken Bastilla Pie($11.95) served simply, no razzle dazzle.  As the person next time me noted, "Family Style" meal.  It was Comfort Food with a TWIST because this dish in particular brings Moroccan flavours noticed within the Spices used.  You can see the Pie as if you're at home passing it around and each taking a slice.

Cinnamon/Almond/Egg mixture was in an obvious layer that brings a sweetness/crunchiness which tops the Chicken/Mushroom provides the COMFORT side much like a Chicken Pot Pie however it wasn't with Gravy but a Sauce that I couldn't distinguish however noticed a bit of Yellow(Turmeric?).  The Phyllo was done up well like how most Greek Phyllo Pastries are but this one was definitely Buttery Crust.

I'm not wow'd but at the same time it did serve it's purpose of a good nutritional meal if you don't over-analyze it.  It's not a Dinner Date you plan in advance, it's more like last-second decision you walk inside with your Pajamas and eat your home cooked meal(cooked by others) that gives a bit of difference than your Campbell's Chunky.

BP shows me Moroccan dishes aren't just Tagines and Cous Cous.  Thank you.
