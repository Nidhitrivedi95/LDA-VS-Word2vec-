OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I've been here a few times over the past year with different friends whenever we wanted Indian food. This place truly deserve a 5 star rating, and the service is just phenomenal. The waiter who tended our table, was very knowledgable of the menu and kindly recommended great dishes. The only thing I would complain is that the serving size is a bit small for the price they offer, but besides that this place is top notch! Definitely would come back again!
