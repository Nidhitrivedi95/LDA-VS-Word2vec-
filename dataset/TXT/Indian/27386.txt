IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Edit: came a 2nd time, and the quality didn't seem to match the 1st. The butter chicken just didn't taste that good at all. The only thing that I really ate was the mutton. Not sure if I'll return. Ps. they may have increased the prices... now $11.5 ($6 for kids)

Original review:
Came here for the lunch buffet ($10). It was pretty dead (on a Friday)

Pretty decent variety of food including:
Tandoori
Butter chicken 
Mutton curry 
Beef curry

All of the above were good except the beef, which was pretty dry. The tandoori in particular was extremely good

Also has a wide variety of vegetables including eggplant which was delicious 

Deserts include gulacham and ice cream (and fruit)
