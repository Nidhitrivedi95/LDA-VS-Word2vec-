UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I really enjoyed my delivery order tonight! I do think it's the best Indian restaurant I've found in Toronto. I ordered butter chicken, peas pilau, garlic naan, meat samosas, papadums. This is the first time I tried this restaurant and it won't be the last. Portion size was huge, and they put a lot of pieces of tender chicken breast, not just a few chunks of cheaper dark meat like some restaurants. Delivery took an hour which is very reasonable. Peas pilau has LOTS of onions which was different than I'm used to but I enjoyed it. They even threw in a complimentary small rice pudding. I don't know if it was deliberate or a mistake but it was a nice surprise!
