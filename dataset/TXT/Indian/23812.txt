gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A according to my indian roommate...this place is ok. however, when she is comparing the food to her mom's home cooking, that means the place is pretty legit. we stopped by to check out the lunch buffet. you can't really beat it for $8.99. lots of food....plenty of curries (veggie, chicken, lamb), samosas, buttered chicken, etc. the naan was really good, they brought it out piping hot from the kitchen. i'm not the best person to ask about indian food...but i thought it was good. so i would def come back. =)
