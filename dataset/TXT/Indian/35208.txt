MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Reasonably priced and good quality sweets, desserts and chat items. I have never seen laddoo sell for 2.99/ pound anywhere in toronto. I like the mango shake, Chana bhatura and their thaali. There's always a line up but you wouldn't mind that for good quality eh! Customer service is also awesome. Would go there whenever I get a chance :-)
