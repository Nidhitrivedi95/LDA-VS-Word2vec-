P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg This will always be our favourite indian/Chinese restaurant. 

We cannot get enough of the Chili Chicken and the Hakka rice.

I started coming to this restaurant 15 years ago and have witnessed a few renos.   Service is friendly and quick.

A few years ago they opened a new location at Markham Road and Steeles which we have yet to visit but hope to soon. 

China Cottage never disappoints!
