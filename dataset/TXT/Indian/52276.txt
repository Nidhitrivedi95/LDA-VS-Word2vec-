We ordered the Indian tasting menu for two which I think is reasonably priced and you get a lot for what you pay for. Would definitely come back and try other tasting menus. The menu is pretty extensive and kind of overwhelming which is why I went with the tasting menu which simplifies things for you if you want to try several things off the menu but aren't sure where to start.
