DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg God the food is SO good. The gobi manchurian is my absolute fav. I will go back to this place over and over. Trust me, even if you're a meat eater you WILL enjoy the food here!

Only thing I'm never too happy about is that the service of the manager is really not nice. He's confrontive, rude and doesn't like to admit his own mistakes. But since I hardly ever see him, who cares!?

Seriously. Go. Eat.
