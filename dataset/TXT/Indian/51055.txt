UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ We went on a Sunday afternoon, well after the rush, and there were tables open.  The food was plentiful and DELICIOUS!   While initially it seemed a bit difficult for the waiter and the chef to understand my questions about "gluten free" aka no wheat flour, the chef finally got it and was most helpful with what I could and could not eat.   There were so many things that were okay for me, and as a Celiac I do appreciate not going home with a bloated belly, unless it's from eating two huge helpings!
