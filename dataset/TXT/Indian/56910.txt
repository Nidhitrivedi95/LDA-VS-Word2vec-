xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw We got the Chocolate and butter fry bread and it tasted great.  We liked it so much we got another one.  We randomly found this place using yelp as we were looking for some kind of desert place.  On arrival, we were not sure if we got the right place, since it looks like a house.  There were some people outside the place that were selling necklaces, etc..

After getting inside, I realized that this was Native American food.  We unfortunately already ate, but we decided to get desert, so we got the chocolate and butter fry bread.  I am glad I found this place, so at least I can say I tried some Native American food, while out in Phoenix.  It also got really busy as we were leaving.  I would like to come back here.
