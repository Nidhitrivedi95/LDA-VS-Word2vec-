When we walked in, we were told they dont serve ala carte items and only buffet option. But what they didnt tell us was, they wont refill the buffet items. Whatever items we asked, they said its over and not be refilled. The tandoori chicken was too unflavourful and tasted. None of the Paneer dishes had paneer. Idli was too hard and made days ago. They just heated the frozen idlis and served them. The only thing they refilled was plain rice and Naan. Desserts were also bad.

The service is ok but not great. But definitely not worth the price you pay for the buffet.
