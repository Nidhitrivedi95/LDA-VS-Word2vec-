axGUBM5mgmFZQn85bMTVPA My husband and I were craving Indian food and our "go-to" place was not open for lunch. We remembered a friend of ours telling us about Cafe Nirvana so we decided to check it out. My husband and I were not greeted as we entered the restaurant, nor were we even acknowledged for several minutes. Finally, one of the three workers seated us. Having never been to Cafe Nirvana, we did not know that we could just help ourselves to the buffet. A worker brought us two waters, but did not ask if we wanted anything else to drink. I asked another worker if the buffet was the only option and she said that we could also order from the menu. However, no menu was ever brought to us. Buffet it is! My husband went first, as I had to stay with our little one. He returned, telling me to make sure I got a clean plate, as some of them had food particles on them. He hardly had any food on his plate. When I asked him why, he said that there was not much food on the buffet. When I went up to get my food, several of the dishes were empty. We had to ask for chicken tikka masala at least three times before it was brought out. Several other patrons in the restaurant appeared to be upset about this as well as other issues including dirty glasses, old-tasting naan and the restaurant not honoring a coupon. Oh, and I forgot to mention that one of the workers had her two children at work with her. They were running around the restaurant, going outside, and playing with the food on the buffet. What little food that was on the buffet was also being served to the worker's kids. When we went to pay for our meals, we were told that we had to wait 5-10 minutes because the computer was down! What food we did get to eat tasted good, but the service was unbelievably horrible! My husband and I will NOT be going back!!
