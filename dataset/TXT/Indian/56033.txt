Sure, the place could use a deep cleaning and a few ceiling tiles could use replacing, but it's no different than that crappy little hole in the wall dive bar that you go to. 

Raj Mahal has a certain type of charm that not everyone appreciates, I get that. Service had always been warm and friendly, food is excellent, and prices are super good!
