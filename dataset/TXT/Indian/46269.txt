sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Roit doesn't get any better than this and I've looked high and low for a place closer to me but I still go all the way down to this place for a great bit of takeout.  You will NOT be able to go back to west Indian roti after this.

They have tables but they are really a formality and the roti is the perfect takeout food staying hot for a very long time so even if you are just passing by grab a roti to go.

The only bad thing about this place is that they are not closer to where I live, parking can be tricky but its the area.

One word of warning, this place respects its customers and doesn't give the "white guy special" like some places do when they are afraid to give folks real spicy food so scale back what you think you can take.  If you like Medium get mild, if you like hot get medium and so on.
