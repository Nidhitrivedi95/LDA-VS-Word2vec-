abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg My husband and I stopped by after dinner because the name just stood out and we had to check it out! The first thing that really stood out was the decor, incredibly tasteful and modern, yet the beautiful Ghaghra hanging on the right wall added the right touch of Indian! 

We ordered the Beef Tacos, and by the second bite, we had taste 3 different layers of flavours! A must order! We also tried the Eggplant flat bread which was an excellent twist on a vegetarian naan bread pizza! The sweetest part of the night was the Crispy Milk Pastry! It was the right amount of sweetness and saltiness. 

Toronto is flooded with Indian food, but Rickshaw Bar has set the bar really high! This city is finally opened its doors to some unbelievable food! Glad we got to experience it!
