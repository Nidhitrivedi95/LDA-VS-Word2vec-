ZBnu1Iz4ySQ58Ow8JhrsWQ Ok, I have to confess I am a little of a wimp when it comes to spices so I dread going to Indian restaurants but my wife loves Indian food so now and then I brave the fire for her. Coriander Green is outstanding, not only do they serve some of the most succulent Indian food around, they can turn the heat up and down on demand without losing any of the flavours. I am really not an expert on Indian cuisine, but this is a place that I enjoy going back to and the staff is always so friendly and helpful. Highly recommended.
