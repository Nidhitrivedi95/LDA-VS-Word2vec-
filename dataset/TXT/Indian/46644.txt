sw0qwXeGfKEw13xUfRPm2A Well... after a while I decided to stop by this place after shopping at my neighborhood ethnic market. Interior has changed and I think ownership changed too... 

So here I was, clueless about all these 150 menu items. Owner (I guess he was) came by and offered me to try their buffet. I didn't see buffet station so I was a little puzzled - how can I have buffet when there isn't one present. He explained me that it is a "portion controlled buffet' !!! Hell ... you might as well just call it a combo meal and stop confusing people! So I said OK I'll get it since I didn't feel like questioning him about every damn item on a menu.

In a few minutes I got a plate with 6 small cups of different stuff, small portion of rice, some chewy piece of meat and 2 pieces of naan. That's the new buffet! I might as well call my cat a dog in this case :)

So bottom line is: 
- silverware was dirty so I had the owner quite embarrassed

- not much of a value for $14... Guy asked me if I would eat more if it was a real buffet and I said yes of course... but isn't that the whole reason behind buffet concept!!! I mean if I don't want to overeat I'll order an appetizer or something and not a "controlled portion buffet".

Well ... I'm just ranting already but this place is off my list for a while.

P.S. Funny but I've seen Yelp logo on a menu there and now I'm bashing the place.
