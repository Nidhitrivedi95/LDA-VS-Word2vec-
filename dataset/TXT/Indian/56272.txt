xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA The dhalpuri is fresh and soft, I would have given four stars to this place if it were not for: 1. The boneless chicken curry is super dry 2. The Tuesday and Wednesday special is more than one half less the quantity of meat than the regular ones 3. The curry has no potato except for the shrimp curry (they put potato in this, I assume to make it more hearty because there is very little shrimp) 4. The flavour of the curry is very mild, has no kick and overall, quite bland.  Note, that if you pack separately there is an extra charge, which is standard, but lets you see the quantity you get on tuesday and wednesday specials are much less.  The doubles have no kick, and is very oily.  This place gets a three star because it is adequate curry in the area and great dhalpuri.  Also note, that they were randomly closed at 2 pm on their lunch special days.
