P4h8kgy_48oE9vCHJc4BCQ Thoroughly disappointed with the fish and nihari I bought today. Nihari was full of salt and it clearly showed it was old .. fish was as if you are chewing on a over cooked beef .. despite that basa when cooked is all flaky, but their fish was leather .. once again nihari was a sad experience. Ran off to food basic after that to get their oven baked chicken to it. A big thank you to silver spoon for disgusting our dinner.
