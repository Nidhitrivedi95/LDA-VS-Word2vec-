-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ My BF's family wanted to take me out for my 30th birthday. They all are from India and live in Brampton - I wanted an authentic experience with my peeps!!

We decided on Kwality Sweets as they are very familiar with this place. I really enjoyed having all of the dishes on the menu explained to my by my extended family, I defer to them as they are the experts on this type of cuisine ;)

I ordered paneer pakora as my starter. The best way to describe this is like deep fried mild cheese, served with a spicy sweet sauce. This is one of my very favourite Indian fast foods, I just love it and could eat this all of the time!

We also enjoyed gol cuppe, which are little fried puffs that you stuff with a mixture of chick peas and potatoes, dunk into very spicy water, then pop into your mouth for a flavour explosion! So so so yummy!!!

We ordered a tandoor mixed grill for the table with Afghan and Haralyi chicken, and a goat kabob. The meats were super flavourful and tender.

For my main I selected a thali, which is a platter of veggie dishes that you select yourself which comes with rice, salad, dhai (yogurt) and a sweet of your choosing. I chose the aloo gobi (potato cauliflower curry), mutter paneer (cheese and peas in gravy), and the galab jamun (round little sweet ball). It was all very tasty and fresh, I just loved it!

My BF ordered an amazing dosa, which comes with various dips, including an amazing coconut chutney - very tasty! I liked how you can actually watch the dosa chef making the dishes in the restaurant, lots of talent that man had!

To wash it all down, I ordered a special Indian coffee which my BF's mom recommended (not sure of the name but try to order it when you are here - so good!).

You can even order sweets by the pound or ice cream on your way out!

Overall, a very busy place but great to try if you are new to Indian food or have been enjoying it for years!
