0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ My usual spots for Hakka where Ming Room, Eddies and Asian Wok and Roll.  My cousin and I decided to try Chilli Chicken house on advice from another cousin of ours.  We were skeptical at first.  We ordered Chilli Chicken (of course), Shrimp Pakora, Szechuan beef and hot and sour soup.  End to end the meal was deeeelish!!  The portions big and were shareable, the food was served hot.  Most of all the food was tasty.
I'm taking my wife there tonight for a date.

I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want this Gem of a spot to get too well known.  Ah well... my opinion... You want Hakka you gotta go here!
