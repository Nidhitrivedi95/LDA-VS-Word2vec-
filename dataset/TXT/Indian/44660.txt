S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Had this place last night and it was very good.  Ordered the tandoori mixed grill, chicken tikka masala, & paneer kadhai and all three dishes were hot and flavorful.  The service was a bit slow and since there were only few other tables being used thought it would've been better. Maybe they were a little short on staff since it was a Tuesday night.  Would've given 5 stars if the service more on the spot.
