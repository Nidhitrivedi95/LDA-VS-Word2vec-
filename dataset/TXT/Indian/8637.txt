7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA Arrived here kind of late- very slow getting seated, and very slow taking the order (kinda ignored me for a while to the point I was ready to walk out), but once they took the order things speeded up a lot and service was decent. Food was OK- butter chicken was good, garlic naan OK, bengan bharta was marginal. Decent, but not best Indian joint in Toronto.
