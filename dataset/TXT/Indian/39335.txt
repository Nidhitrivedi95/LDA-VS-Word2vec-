oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q Met a good friend for dinner on Tuesday night.  I have heard for YEARS that this place is an amazing place to eat Hakka food and FINALLY had a chance to dine there.

Had recommendations to try the Crispy Beef in the past.  

We ended up ordering:

Sesame Crispy Beef
Chilli Chicken
Vegetable Pakoras
Vegetable Fried Rice

What can I tell you?  The Crispy Beef is the best crispy beef I have every had IN MY LIFE.  It is just THAT danged good.  Crispiest ever, bursting with flavour, not chewy, morphin-omenal down the hatch I took it.  Wow!  This dish alone makes me want to go back for more.  I could not get enough!

Veggie Pakoras, were truly delicious.  They reminded me of Nawab Grill's Garlic Balls and they were great.  Loved every bite of this.

Chilli Chicken and Veggie Fried Rice were good, same ol' but yea goes with the rest of the meal.

Excellent experience.  It go pretty busy  there as time went on in the evening.  The service was decent, again not the greatest but whateva, the food was amazing.  I will most definitely will be back in the future and bring along some new folks to try it out.
