Qfn9qbWKPsfkFZDQzw7kCQ In all of Phoenix, this is my favorite over all Indian place. We try to go there once a month since we live in the East Valley so its about a 45 minute drive. But when we get there, we have amazing food.
Our favorite are the Tandoori Chops and the Lamb Boti Masala w/ Garlic Nan. The Tandoori Chops are to die for and I haven't had better ones yet. 
Simply amazing!
