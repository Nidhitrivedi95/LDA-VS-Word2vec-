DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew I literally dream about Curry Leaf's malai kofta. The food and flavors are so exceptional: balanced, thoughtful, nuanced. Excellent. We've tried many of the curry dishes and a few of the appetizers. Korma is my husband's favorite and now that I've tried the malai kofta, I never order anything else. The gobi manchurian appetizer is beautiful, from the lightness to the flavors. The samosas are good. The naan is airy and warm, just wonderfully made. 
You can tell that the chef is an artist and takes pride in the food.
Four stars because food is slightly overpriced for the amount you're served.
