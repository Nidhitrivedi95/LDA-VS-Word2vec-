You can get a decent sized curry dish and rice (or two pieces of naan, if you ask) for $4.50!  Seriously can't beat that with a stick.  I love the daal, which changes daily, and the chana saag.  This truck is VERY veggie friendly. 

I usually come here once per week, more than that if they weather's nice.  Definitely give it a try if you're in the area!
