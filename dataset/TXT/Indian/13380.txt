I've been here numerous times over the years (before they renovated as well - when it was a little dive joint).  

The décor is nice - an improvement over what it looked like before.  Now it looks like a restaurant you can take a date to..lol (I did not).

The food is Chinese/Indian (Hakka) fusion and the variety you will find here will please everyone.  The portions are huge so definitely sharing platters that you will have leftovers with.  Seriously you can't beat the prices for the quantity and quality.   You can also order take-out - and pick it up - they are pretty fast with that service.   the servers are attentive if not a little brisk, but what does it matter when you are stuffing your face with chili chicken and fried rice?

The parking lot is small and always packed.  A overall solid choice for food in Scarborough
