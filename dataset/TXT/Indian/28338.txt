PRO: First time I came here I thought the food was great, all were tasty and bursting with flavor. 

CON: Food taste is inconsistent. The next time I tried it again, their Butter Chicken became too sweet, not spicy at all. The other dishes tastes okay only the second time I ate here. How disappointing. Butter chicken shouldn't be that sweet, it became like a desert coz of the sweetness.

PRICE:

CON: Inexpensive but you won't get the value of the money you paid.

AMBIANCE :

PRO: They play Indian music and the design is good (as if you're dining in India).
CON: Tables are too small, and the gap between the other customers' table from your table are very less. When you try to stand up and get more food, you have to move slowly so as not to bump into their tables while they're eating.
