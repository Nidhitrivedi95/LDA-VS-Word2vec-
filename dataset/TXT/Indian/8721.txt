 It is located on King Street, in the very busy entertainment district. You have to walk upstairs to get to Aroma, and once inside, will find a cozy and classy set up. The prices range from cheap to spendy, and if you are with a big group it's best to order a number of dishes as they are all big enough and rich enough for sharing. 

  I had a cold when I went to Aroma, so I can't comment on the smells of their food (the first thing I always notice when I step inside an Indian restaurant). However, the food was quite good. I recommend the samosas, malai prawn, and their butter chicken.

 Another great thing about Aroma is their lunch buffet, daily from 11:30-3pm for only $9.99! All you can eat Indian!!!!
