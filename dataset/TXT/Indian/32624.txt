LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA Ambience & Decor: Ethnic with a modern twist.  High ceilings & sectioned seating plan. 
Service: Service is very efficient & good, the staff are welcoming. 
Food: Fabulous, one of a kind dosas. Delicious chutneys, Jain food, lassi, coffee, tea, desserts. Good atmosphere, nice decor. Worth the long drive to Mississauga just to go to Guru Lakshmi. Good for family & group.
The menu is extensive and very interesting - definitely worth the revisits. They keep adding to their menu - they are adding millet dosas (ragi) which are very healthy & good for diabetic people.
