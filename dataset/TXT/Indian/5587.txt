3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Another TeamBuy adventure!
We bought 4 vouchers to take my husband's parents to Kama's dinner buffet.
I was excited to try this restaurant because of the good Yelp reviews and I am happy to report that I was not disappointed.

Their decor with its bright yellow, golden and white colors was not quite my thing, but I pretty much loved the rest. 

Service:
Very friendly and attentive without being intrusive.
Our waitress made sure that our water glasses were always filled.
Our used plates were taken care of right away.

Food:
I found that Kama was offering a good variety.
They had several vegetarian options (warm and cold) as well as salad, a few chicken dishes, one lamb dish, one beef dish, two types of naan (garlic and regular), several chutneys and finally a few dessert options (rice pudding, fruit custard and four ice cream flavors).

My favorites were the Chana Masala, the Lamb Chop Masala, the Tandoori Chicken and the Butter Chicken.

Room for improvement:
- The naan was a hit or miss. 
I had a piece that was very good and a couple that were so dry I only ate them because they worked well as a base for the sauces.
- No changing tables in the washrooms. 
(Changing your child squeezed between the sinks is never fun.)
