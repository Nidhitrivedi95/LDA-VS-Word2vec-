h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA I've never had Indian cuisine before and a friend of mine has been craving it since he left the UK. So, we opted for Royal Taj. Since I am an Indian cuisine virgin, it wasn't a bad place to eat. 

My friend and I had the Tandoori Chicken dish. I thought it was really good!! I ordered the "half" serving and it was quite filling. I even had to get a to-go box. The Naan bread was really good! 

My friend told me something was missing with the dish. He said "the Tandoori Chicken dish usually comes with curry sauce..." (from his past experience). For him it wasn't that good compared to the Indian cuisine is Britain.

But for a "virgin" like me it was GREAT!!
