2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw The problem with this store for me is not the quality of food, which is pretty good, but the service of the staff and the management. I have been going for this store for a number of years and it has never changed. I feel the underlying factor is a sense of arrogance they feel knowing that people will come to their store regardless of how they treat them. There is always a rude attitude when they talk to you, they never greet you or apologise for any delays no matter how long you stay in the line to get your stuff. They have a two line system one for the over the counter items and the other for the freshly prepared food. If you stood in one line for a long time and ordered a mix of over the counter and freshly prepared items they would bluntly say that you can't do both here and ask you to go to the other line. Which I feel is very bad customer service. And its not just the guys who are serving you but also the people in the management who usually take your payment at the end. They treat you the same if not worse and this really does not sit well with me. 

Last week I noticed a gentleman who ordered 200 samosas and I was shocked to hear that if you wanted those samosas in a box (instead of a bag) then you had to pay $2 extra. I know it's a convenience and a business but that guy is ordering 200 samosas! Again another blunder in customer service in my opinion. 

You usually won't notice such things if you go once in a while but if you are quite regular you start to notice these things and it bothers you. I wish they take an effort to fix this to provide an even better service to the customer.
