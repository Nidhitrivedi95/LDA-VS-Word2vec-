80NTyBDwAtppP3oL84PN7w One of the best Bangladeshi and Indian restaurants in Edinburgh.  A good range of dishes on the menu and nightly specials.  The interior is immaculate and the staff are polite and attentive.  The food is excellent, try their special biryani.

I have eaten here many times and also made use of their delivery service.  I will keep coming back.
