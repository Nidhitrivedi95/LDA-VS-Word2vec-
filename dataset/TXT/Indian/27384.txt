IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw Tried this on the basis of other Yelp! reviews.  It is not bad, though I would not give it a higher rating as the buffet is quite small and rather limited in selection.  The naan and vegetarian offerings were very good as was the butter chicken.  Tandoori chicken was a bit dry.  Raita was sweetened, but good.  The spinach and mushroom combination was a standout.  Only desserts are gulab jamun and ice cream - no rasmallai, gajar halva or rice pudding.

While the quality of cooking may be just a little higher here, I still prefer India's Taste (buffet is same price) due to the larger buffet selection.

Friendly and attentive service.  No ambience to speak of.
