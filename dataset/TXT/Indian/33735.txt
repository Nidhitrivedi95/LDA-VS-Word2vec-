lVTn2NO9-FGfxKjfleZUqw Bombay Street Food was a great experience for the family!

First of all, the the ambience is amazing - unlike any Indian food place you will ever visit. Authentic photos, lighting and decorations from Mumbai markets, 

The food is also very authentic. I had Dahi Puris and Masala Haddock, which was broiled haddock filet marinated in a fish masala, topped with tomatoes, cucumber, red onions and coriander. It came with a side of daal chawal (basmati rice topped with aromatic red lentil stew)

The rest of the family had pav bhaji and keema phav which was also very tasteful. I highly recommend it!
