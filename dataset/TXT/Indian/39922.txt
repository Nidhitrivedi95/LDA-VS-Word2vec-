pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I was here for a buffet. Service was good and the staff is friendly. 

I tried aloo dosa, idli and vada with sambar and groundnut chutney. They tasted just like homemade food. Vada is cooked well and had the right amount of oil that didn't make it greasy. 

Coming to the entree, I liked the vegetarian options they offered. Especially paneer Tikka masala and brinjal curry are my favorites. I should say that the non-vegetarian options I tried disappointed me. I had biryani  which didn't seem to have any meat pieces in it and then the chicken tandoori tasted bland and lacked seasoning. 

Finally the dessert items are a hit here. Especially the gulab jamun and mango pudding. Gulab jamun tastes just like homemade food with right amount of sweet. Mango pudding for me was just like mango lassi with a thick consistency. 

It is a good place if you are looking for some great vegetarian food and delicious desserts.
