ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg We have only been here once, on a trip to Charlotte.  We sat at the bar and were impressed with the bartender, Jarisa.  She was attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu.  We tried a couple of appetizers, one with chicken and one with lamb. They were both very good, seasoned richly and to perfection.  For our main course, we shared the lamb vindaloo.  Soooo good.  The lamb was not gamey tasting at all, and the spice was good, although not for wimps--hot!  It's not on the menu, but they will make it if you ask.  Overall, a great time.
