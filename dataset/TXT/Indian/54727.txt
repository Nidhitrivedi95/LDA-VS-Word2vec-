The service was fantastic. The decor subdued yet tasteful. And of course, the food was fresh and delicious. Sometimes, when you go to a restaurant in a touristy area, the food would be less authentic and drier. But to our wonderful surprise it was delicious. 

In context, my husband and I have tried our shares of Indian food from London to Boston to the Berkshires. So, we can honestly say Taj of Scottsdale is one of the best.
