TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ This is the best Chinese food delivery I've had in Toronto. In fact, I just went on a 1 week trip to Hong Kong, and other than a few outstanding meals there, this restaurant was just as good as any of the restaurants I tried there. 

We had the following

Hot & Sour Soup - Show stopper here. If you go this restaurant, order this. I'm not even a big fan of hot & sour soup, but I was told to order this anyway. I don't know what they put in this thing but it was the best hot & sour soup I've ever had. 

Hakka Chicken Chowmein - Another incredibly tasty dish. Make sure you order it! A little bit more spicy and effervescent than your traditional cheese noodle dish. 

Chilli Chicken - Spicy but also very good!

Manchurian Beef - A little bland compared to the other selections, but I still enjoyed it 

It took almost an hour and a half to get to our door, but we quickly forgot about it after we tasted how good the food was. 

Food for 6 people including tax, tip and delivery was only $60, and we had leftovers for the next day. At this price point, you can't get much better!
