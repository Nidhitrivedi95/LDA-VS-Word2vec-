S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA I went with my husband and 4 year old daughter after shopping, and this place was amazing! Very authentic home style fare that has something for even the most picky eaters.  My 4 year old, who can be very finicky, fell in love with the paneer tikka masala!  My husband (who has never had Indian food) ate everything available. Everything! TWICE! I don't get that kind of reaction with my own cooking (don't judge). The owners were there and came by to say hello as well. Overall it was a nice atmosphere and we had a great experience.  We will be going back again for sure!
