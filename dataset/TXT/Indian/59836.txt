ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg We now have a new favorite Indian restaurant. The food was especially good, particularly the samosas which were large and crisp. We eat a lot of Indian food, and this place is fantastic! We also loved the Bollywood films that were showing on the TVs. They have a lunch buffet, which we will have to come try soon. It is family owned, and the service was exceptional. Don't miss this place!
