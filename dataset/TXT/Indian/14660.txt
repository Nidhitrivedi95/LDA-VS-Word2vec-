CB99Ifh4OnBTnuNdRjj_fQ Why did Christopher Columbus cross the Atlantic? To find the flavorful, aromatic spices right here at Soma grill. 
If you ate anywhere else for lunch today, you lost out.

I feel sorry for people that ate at Subways, Jersey Mike's etc. etc. THIS is real, authentic cuisine and spices are blended so perfectly. 

It was cold today and I wanted hot soup and I got it. Not spicey "hot", temperature hot and the spices are more aromatic than "spicey". In other words it doesn't mean heat like cajun. 

What's nice is they ask you - on a scale of 1 to 5, what spiceness (peppery) you want it. My wife and I chose level 2. 

Why this place wasn't packed beats me.
