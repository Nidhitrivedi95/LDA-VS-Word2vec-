hFay_o8K1YfqFiMFoSPv5Q Well I just got back from my first visit to the new Mertz location of Bombay Grill and I was very pleased. Our server was great. The food was amazing. The naan was delicious. There was a bit of a wait for the food but it was made to order and it was worth the short wait. We ordered the vegetable pakora and it was a little more well done than expected but was very nice. The chutneys were delectable and one of them was nicely spicey-hot. I had the Chicken Saag and it was great.  It is rare that something comes out as hot as I like but this was. My colleague had the vegetarian dish with peas. I forget the name. It was tastey. I recommend this place. It's on a side street (Mertz) and a little hard to find but it is well worth it.
