gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I don't always eat Indian.....but when I do - I prefer Mt. Everest Las Vegas. 

After eating at Mt. Everest , it's all downhill. ha ha get it? that's right my friend, you will never have it as good.  
So far I have only been here for the lunch buffet. Here at least once a week. sometimes twice.  My only previous experience eating Indian was when I lived in nyc for 20 years. There is probably 2 million indian restaurants there....one for every cab driver. Let me tell you my friend, even the best one there could not compete with mt. everest. I remember the last place i used to eat at, called CHOLA. Supposedly it was great. Always packed with indians. Their food was always greasy and made me feel tired afterwards (probably from chemical, or cheap quality?)

Mt. everest is NOT like any other indian restaurant you have eaten in. The food is NOT greasy!!! The quality of the ingredients is fresh, and of high quality. I don't know how they do it...EVERY dish at that buffet is a solid TEN. 

I wish they would raise their buffet price to keep all the riff-raff like you yelpers out. Sadly, this place gets jam packed at lunch. 

The best part is that a corona is only $3.50. I really appreciate it when restaurants don't try to RAPE customers on liquor prices. Actually the food is the best part.

wait the best part is the great indian music videos on tv there...wow, those guys know how to deliver a show
