7ovjGF8h05Fc9pRXgInLcw Post graduation ceremony of my little sister, decided to eat somewhere nearby, also 4 tummies were asking for Indian food. Checked in Taj Mahal. It took a while to be seated. We were four people. The restaurant is half filled and there is only one person working. We ordered food, and the lady was under the assumption that we are all sharing our food, so she doesn't ask what my mom wants. Finally, she gets the order right. 30 minutes later our food arrive. I told her that I didn't order rice, but she keeps persisting that I have to eat with my matar paneer and dal tadka. I said no, and she keeps insisting and doesn't let me finish talking. Then finally she asks how would I eat my curries, I said paratha, I ordered paratha...Then she says, oh yeah; she doesn't even apologize. Super bad service! My matar paneer was tasteless, and my puri was overcooked. My mom's shrimp biryani was dry, my father's tandoori platter was salty and my sister's vegetable curry with paratha was under cooked. Bad food! Save yourself from the waiting of the wrong and impolite service. I feel bad for the ingredients that was in the food because they were not well utilized.
