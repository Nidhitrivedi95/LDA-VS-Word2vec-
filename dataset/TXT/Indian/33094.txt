llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Having read all of the rave reviews, I decided to drive out to India Palace for some good Indian food.  I just moved to Phoenix and was really looking forward to it.  I got there about an hour before the lunch buffet ended, so I didn't expect everything to be perfect.  The food was pretty good, but not like I expected given the reviews.  The mango lassi was excellent, and the rice pudding was good, too.  Everything else was okay -- several dishes were spicier than I am used to, which was good.  The naan was good, too, and the service was prompt and friendly.  But the rice was either not fully cooked or had been in the pan way too long, as it was a little crunchy, and some of the sauces seemed watered down.  The buffet lacked the variety I was looking for.  I may be back if I'm in this part of town, but I wouldn't drive there again.  Decent food at decent prices with good service, though.
