UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I'm usually here for lunch, and they do a very nice buffet every time I've been here.  There's a nice mix of vegetarian and meat dishes, and I've never seen the exact same menu two days in a row for lunch.  Dinner here is good too, they do a nice Tandoori chicken, which is how every Indian restaurant should be judged in my opinion, at least if they offer it.  Overall, very happy with this place, and they also have a limited bar menu, plus wine and beer.
