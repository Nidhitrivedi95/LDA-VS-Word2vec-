8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ I ordered delivery from the Butter Chicken Factory tonight for the first time. Being new to the area I am searching for my regular butter chicken spot. 

I think I have found it at the Butter Chicken Factory. After having a really bad experience at the nearby Rashnaa Indian Restaurant I was eager to see if the quality was better from the Butter Chicken Factory. 

My order was promptly delivered within 30 mins of ordering. I had; 

 2 orders of butter chicken
 1 chicken masala  
2 rice 
2 garlic nann 

Bill came to 58$ with free delivery $65 with tip. A little on the steep side. 

The quality of the food was good. It was hot and flavorful. I was impressed with the creaminess and authentic taste of the butter chicken and the spice of the masala. 

My only complaint is we only received 4 pieces of Naan in 2 orders and only one rice even though we had ordered too. 

We called back and they sent more rice and naan without charge. 

I will definitely be getting takeout from this place again.
