PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw I called on the way home and asked for a pick up order. I wanted two plain chicken kabobs. He said 20 min. They were ready in 15 and exactly what I wanted. Just chicken, no onions or peppers. (I'm throwing them on top of a salad) they were so DELICIOUS. Cooked perfectly, and beautifully seasoned. I'm glad I grabbed a menu on the way out! Can't wait to dine in soon!!!
