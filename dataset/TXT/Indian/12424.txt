So what is Kathi Roll? I wasn't sure before I visited TKRE, aka The Kathi Roll Express that newly opened couple months ago near Yonge and Bloor area. Kathi Rolls are Indian Parantha (Whole Wheat flatbread) grilled with freshly beaten eggs and then filled with choice of meats or veggies. TKRE is open early till late night and even delivers in the area.

With the name of the restaurant, I was surprised to walk into the place and see lots of tables inside TKRE. I thought it would be more of a 'Take to Go' type of place but there are def lots of tables for you to enjoy Kathi Rolls inside the restaurant.

They def paid attention to interior of the restaurant with beautifully painted tables and graffiti on the walls.
