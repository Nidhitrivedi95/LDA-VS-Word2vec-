DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA I was hungry and needed a quick fix on my way home one afternoon and I decided to come here instead of Aloha Kitchen.  I played it safe and tried the lamb curry.  I have to at least try a lamb dish at any Indian restaurant I go to.  Samosa Factory didn't disappoint.  

Although I went solo I was still treated very well by the owner and staff.  I didn't know the menu too well but was not intimidated about trying something new.  The staff brought out a bread like dish and a veggie samosa (I believe) for me to try.  They were all delicious.   

I was really satisfied.  Maybe I like the buffet style for lunch just to try new and other dishes.
