YhfXd8VmcmCo_4ea_wqgLQ hi,I'm indian,I'm  new in Parc ex.n wanted to take my mom n her friend to a gd indian restaurant. so i went here. i asked for cha n it was watery.  i spoke,they changed it for another.  it's not bengali cha. if ur taste is based on bangali,u won't like it. but it was acceptable. so i ordered two vegi thali . one to eat in n one to go. i ordered 2nd vegi thali . i also ask two vatura,those puffy roti,to have a taste it with my mom. we waited until 5 nonindian was served to get my plate. actually more than one waitresses was attending tem. while i was waiting n watching 5 others being served.  i finally got my plate with one vatura,wen i asked for 2. so we finished one vatura 2nd one came after a while. i couldn't enjoy anymore, waited too long. felt forgotten, 

if one vatura takes 15 minutes 2nd, 3rd don't take as much time bcuz the oil is already hot. i know tat. if they had time to serve 6 clients while we were waiting for 5 mins order, i don't  need anymore explanation abt there client relationship. 
 
"DO NOT GO". I complain to the maneger,he didn't give a sh*t. no sorry.  i will tell all my friends not to go to this restaurant.
