SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg Oh where, oh where can you find decent Indian food in Vegas?

Bollywood Grill, that's where. In fact, I would argue it's the best Indian I've had outside of the UK (where Indian food is as common as Mexican food in L.A.)  and may be a close approximation of India itself.

The menu keeps up the Bollywood them of the decor, separating items into Previews, Opening Scenes and Hits. And tasty hits they are, especially if you're a curry fan. 

I had the Chicken Karishma and it was perfect, served with a separate bowl of rice and the curry itself sitting on a bowl atop a flame right at the table. 

The Trailers were worth coming early. The pandoras were incredible.

Helps to also have a very eagfer and helpful staff who will help explain the items on the menu without any mocking or disappointment. 

One of the better local dining experiences I've had.
