HcqI_ONIaXwzYR7cxFpdUw Terrible service. The price of the menu didn't reflect the actual price, the man at the register told me the menu was old! Yet it was still in place taped to the counter? Once done the chicken wings were no bigger than my thumb to say the least, with minimal flavor. To top it off my friend bought a drink from the convenience store next door and we were prompt kicked out of the restaurant. It was better leaving the restaurant it was filthy and outdated.
