F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw Worst food poisoning experience ever! My mom and I went here for a late lunch yesterday and are still suffering the consequences. We ordered chicken pakoras with hakka rice and kung pao chicken. The taste was ok. Nothing great. However, the after effects were enough to swear off hakka food altogether!
