m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw Had dinner there tonight with my mother and son. Food was phenomenal but I think getting there right as they opened was a mistake.  Our drinks were filled once and only once and getting the attention of our obviously very busy waitress was a challenge.  I actually felt guilty for asking for a to go box and apologized when she brought it.  

Reading the other reviews I can see how this could be a delightful place however we did not have a delightful experience.  

The food is why I'm giving 3 stars it was a 5 star meal with a 1 star waitress.  

I plan to go back and hopefully update this review in a positive way.
