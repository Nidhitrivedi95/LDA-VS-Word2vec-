YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q I would have rated something lower than 1 star, if I had a choice. This kind of restaurants should be shutdown. I ordered biriyani. I am an Indian. It was not biriyani at all. The chicken pieces were gross. At least 5 days old. I feel lucky I am alive after tasting couple of spoons. I threw the entire thing.
