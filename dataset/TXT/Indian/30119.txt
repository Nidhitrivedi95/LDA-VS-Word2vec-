JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I'll start off with the positives. A friend and I had never tried Indian food before and saw all the good reviews for this place. The food was sooo good! The portion size was good and the spice level was just right. That being said I felt absolutely  out of place here. Our waiter  was nothing less than rude and unattentive. Anytime I would say thank you for anything he just looked at me...no your welcome or anything. I will say there were two gentlemen who did keep coming to check on us and I'm assuming they were owners or managers but they were the only reason we stayed. They were great. As good as the food was I will never go back.
