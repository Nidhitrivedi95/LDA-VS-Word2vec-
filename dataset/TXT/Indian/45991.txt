SLg1Azq0kePm0ZWnIkHhhg This place was absolutely HORRIBLE. We bought a groupon. The first two times we showed up during business hours there was a sign saying CLOSED.  We finally caught them when they were open on the 3rd try.  When we walked in we were not greeted for about 2-3 mins. There were ZERO people in the restaurant. The layout is more like a ballroom and not a restaurant. Finally someone appeared from the back. Didnt say a word but waved us to a table and dropped some menus. 
 7 mins later she came back and stood near the table and said "Hello". We decided this was our cue and we placed our complete order. She claimed the Groupon was worth less than the actual value. We just said whatever you think is fair. About 1 min later she returned with our drinks. Then we didnt see her again for 27 mins. In this time a man came in and out of the restaurant appeared to be installing computer software and printing equipment right in the middle of the restaurant. The appetizer then arrived it was a Prepackaged obviously microwaved appetizer that looked NOTHING like the photo in the menu. About 8 mins later our meal arrived(approx 35+ mins from seating to food). The food was delivered without a word spoken. 
  The meal was the only slightly brighter spot. The food was typical indian food and had standard flavors and typical size portions. The processing of the bill was incredibly painful struggle. This took 4 trips back and forth to the table and still the hand written check was not coherent. We were happy just to get out of there.  This place needs a lot of work.
