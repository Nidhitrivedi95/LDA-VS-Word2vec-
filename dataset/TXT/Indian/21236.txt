GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA This was my favorite restaurant as I was a regular customer... but when I went for dinner two weeks ago... the waiter Shawn was extremely rude to us. He did not rEfill our water and bring our complete order of naan to the table. I ordered - total of 6 naans, which he brought to my table two at a time. We were a family of 5 and could not enjoy our food because the naan kept getting finished. Resulting in Shawn getting very loud with us and threatening to call the cops on us. all we did is ask him if he could please bring our final two naans so we could finish dinner. Then he packed the two naans and told us he had it ready for us to take home . My 6 year old and 3 year old were in tears begging him not to call the cops. And what was the reason?! Because he was telling us he gave us SUPERIOR customer service. And when we nicely told him it would have been fine to bring our naans together at once he started getting loud. Also I'm Pakistani so beware if you go to this restaurant because they will not treat you like a customer. I wrote the curry corner owner on Facebook and they did not follow up with me as promised so, apparently they don't appreciate there   Regular customers. So Hilal grill is my place to go for authentic Pakistani food.
