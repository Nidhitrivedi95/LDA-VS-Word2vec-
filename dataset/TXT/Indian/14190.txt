C_chktl5jFeRqu1C0rmScA Both I and my wife tried out the place last night one of my good Sri Lankan friend recommended the place. We were looking for an authentic Sri Lankan place. The Fish Biriyani and Fish in Banana Leaf was the highlight....service is quiet good...definitely will go back and take my friends who craves for some good fish dishes made South Indian/ Sri Lankan style
