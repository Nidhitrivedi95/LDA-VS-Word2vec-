yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg First time here for me and one of several times for my wife. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and another dish with chicken and spinach along with a little dessert at the end. Our senses were poised for a good time as we approached the restaurant. The quality of the food did not let us down. It was perfectly spiced and seasoned and gave the impression of a carefully and skillfully prepared meal. My wife was not very fond of the rice pudding, representing an area of compromise between us as I differ. Upon noticing that my spoon was now invading her cup of rice pudding, the owner provided my wife with two other alternatives to sweeten her pallette. My wife and I spent a nice weekday dinner escape and found quality food, service and care for us as customers all for what "the average Joe" can expect to spend at a high volume and taste deficient place like Applebee's. That's why I'll be back to the Star of India and I may yet again have two servings of rice pudding if my wife allows me.
