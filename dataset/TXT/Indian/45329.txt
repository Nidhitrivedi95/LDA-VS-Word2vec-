s6IPjR2nSJqhXcGJ49Ckiw I'm not sure about their sit-in dining but we ordered delivery from this place tonight and it's the worst delivery food we've ever had. I'm rarely compelled to write a Yelp review but went straight to my laptop before even finishing the food. The portions are so small and while the website offered nan bread with dishes, it didn't come. They didn't do Indian or Thai dishes well. Both the Mussaman and Spinach curries were watery and the butter chicken had four or five sad looking pieces of chicken floating in a very soupy broth. The Som Tam papaya salad was filled with lettuce, which anyone who ever has this tasty and spicy Thai salad knows is not part of the dish. If an Indian restaurant is going to take on Thai food, they should learn its ingredients. Sadly, as noted, they don't seem to even know how to make Indian food. A huge waste of our money.
