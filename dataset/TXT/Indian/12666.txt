B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg You MUST try this place. Being from NYC I am spoiled by the food and authenticity of Indian food so I am a sceptic when it comes to Indian food when I travel. 

I can't say enough good things about the flavor and food overall. I typically get chicken curry, chicken Tika or chicken marsala but tonight I tried something new....chicken kadahi. Yummmmm! 
I like spicy. I asked for a spice level of 4 out of 5 (just in case they were actually spicy) but I say it was more of a 2 for me. So, if you like spicy....go for it.

BTW, if you pay cash you get 5% off at lunch and 10% at dinner. Nice!!!
