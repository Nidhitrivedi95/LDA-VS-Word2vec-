KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ To be honest, this is some terrible Indian food. The only good item I had was water. Rest everything was tasteless, this food is meh, pretty much to say that everything is bland. Even the gulab jamoon in the buffet was super cold. Don't know about dinner but, buffet is a no go for me, at least it was cheap.
