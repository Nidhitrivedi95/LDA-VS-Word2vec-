N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg I liked this place and will recommend it vegetarian food, esp for folks who are missing Indian food

Got the masala dosa which was good, but Samabar and chatni can be improved a lot, minimally should not be cold chatni 

The shaai paneer was sweet and the rice was undercooked. Room to improve but deneitly good enough to quench the thirst for Indian food
