MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ We had a family dinner there with a one year old, a three year old and four adults.  Excellent patient service with excellent food.  A thoroughly enjoyable evening.

Update - 5/14:  In checking their menu on line it appears as if they took a sharp price increase.  SO much so it caused us to go to another Indian restaurant and get another dish or two for the same price.  I;m sure the food is still great but they've lost us as customers.  Too costly.
