Situated in the centre of the busy and bustling Nicolson Street, Suruchi is just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square and is a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach.  The restaurant looks pretty small from the outside, but inside it stretches back quite far and is able to accommodate a lot of customers. 

Suruchi's menu offers a wide selection of authentic Indian cuisine and I ordered the seafood soup to start which was truly amazing - made with really fresh ingredients and tasted super fresh - yummy! I then had the butter chicken for my main which was equally as amazing and the chicken was cooked perfectly and there was no excess layer of oil on the sauce which I sometimes find with Indian dishes. There are warnings on the menu indicating which dishes are mild and which are hot which always gets a big thumbs up from me as you won't get your head blown off by an unexpected chili. 

The prices are really reasonable here with most main meal curry's costing about six pounds, and there is a lunch deal available too where a two course meal costs £6 - what a bargain! Suruchi is a really great Indian restaurant serving beautiful food and it is definitely worth a visit.
