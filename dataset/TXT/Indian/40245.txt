pJrM4yAZo0Gs63D9UCyCSQ Went there again after an amazing first time and unfortunately it will be my last. Staff was barely present as we had to continuously get up to ask for service. Food was good but not amazing. We were a table of 10 and  they had sat us near the uninsulated window where we all had to eat with our winter jackets on. We asked to be moved while the restaurant was still empty as we had 3 young children with us and the answer was no. Hopefully they step up their staff game again.
