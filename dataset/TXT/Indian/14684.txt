CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A Found this place and wanted to try it out. It was my first Indian Restaurant to try here in Madison. Was taken here on my birthday with some friends and the service was just awful. We waited forever for someone to even really acknowledge us and get our orders. They didn't really come back to ask if we were needing anything and we had to go hunt them down to get our checks. Pricing was a little steep for the service and the food. Okay experience, nothing too exciting.
