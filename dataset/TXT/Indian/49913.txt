U_yacPCk8HgE1ywATmQUrg This place is crazy addicting. During the summer time, there were weeks were I got it 3-4 out of the 7 day period. Butter chicken is awesome, so is the chicken korma roti.  Get it with rice, and it's just as good! Very rarely the sauce can be bland (which just happened two days ago) but I guess it depends who prepared the sauce at that point, maybe just a bit of neglect, but this only happened to me 3 times, and I must have ate there over 150 times. The staff is very friendly, especially the owner (I assume the one with the moustache and always rocking nice shirt and pants). 


I highly recommend!
