uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA As someone who is very familiar with Sri Lankan cuisine, I was very pleased with most of the items here.  Their curries etc often are a tad on the greasy side but their dry meats ( tandoori style roasted chicken) is excellent.

Great selections of rolls and buns.  Very cheaply prices and well made.  Fairly friendly staff
