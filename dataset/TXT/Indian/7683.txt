66DKb6APF96InEKrUVIbZw We came here tonight with a groupon deal, with my parent's in law... The food was good but the waiter was not friendly at all. Nobody except us were in the restaurant and the waiter didn't take time for us or make any smile. It seems that we were disturbing his peaceful evening. We suggest him to take another waiter/ess more friendly than him. 
The restaurant smell the toilet cleaning product too...eurk
However the food was good so... we would like the ambiance to be as good...
