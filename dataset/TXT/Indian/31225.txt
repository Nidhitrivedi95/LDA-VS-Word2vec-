KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw I went in today, Mandy was my server at the counter. She was awesome! I got the beef burger, it was good. I upgraded to the chat fries... Worth it! 

I look forward to go back and try to the butter chicken mac and cheese. 

I did have a small mix up with my order, but the staff were super helpful and took care of it 

Good service, good food!
