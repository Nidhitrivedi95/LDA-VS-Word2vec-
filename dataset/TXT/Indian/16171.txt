Dd1w7xR7Xs3bthwusgy33Q This is a good place to have actual Indian food. They dont have a full menu, its more like a snack place! I tried the pav bhaji and paneer roll. Pav bhaji was nice, a little spicy and the Paneer roll was exceptional. I am not a big paneer fan and yet I loved it. Also try the masala chai, its very good!
