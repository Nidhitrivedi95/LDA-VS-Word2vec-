c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Food is good but man service is damnnnnnnnnnn slow. It's happened to me twice now.  Once for take out. I called ahead and have them 30 and when I got there they took another 20 !!! And this time done-in and we everything we ordered were already prepared besides the naan so i don't understand why on earth they took so long. We waited 20 minutes for already prepared food. Ridiculous. We were the only family in the resteraunt and a few take out customers.
