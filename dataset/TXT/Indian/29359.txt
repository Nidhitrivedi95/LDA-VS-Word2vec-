JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ Delicious Indian food, and very kind staff. We hosted a Young Professionals dinner event and received wonderful service. The thali plates are great! The manager is generous and friendly and treated us as her own guests. By dinner time, the place was full of Indian families dining and it was clear many of them are frequent patrons. Highly recommend it, especially for vegetarians!
