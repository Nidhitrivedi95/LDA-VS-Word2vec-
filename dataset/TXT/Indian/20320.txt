FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA Wish i could give 0 stars! This was the first time we decided to take a to go from here and its the last time too. For the first time we got cheated with our order. We ordered 2 plates idli (they told us that each plate 3 idlis). but after we got home we saw there were only 5 idlis in the box. I am not sure how much they profited by not giving us 1 idli? 

Staff attitude is really bad too. while ordering we asked for one boc small box of chutney as they gave us 1 tiny cup only. and as we had ordered 2 plates of idli we asked for 1 more, they refused to give us, saying "what we have given good enough quantity, we cannot give more" not wanting to make a scene, we just left the place. 

This is the worst place ever. Be sure wht you order and what u get
