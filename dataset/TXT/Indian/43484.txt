RoGAy8b2j0Oa7TJgpotM8A This was our first time coming to this restaurant. While we ordered takeout, the hostess/waitress midway did not complete our order. As another gentleman walked up behind us, she completely ignored us and started helping the other customer. After the other customer was seated to a table (also ordering takeout), I had to ask how long our food will be (10 min.). After we waited in the lobby area (there are no benches for people to wait  if ordering takeout or waiting for a table), the hostess finally came to tell us that we could have a seat in the dining area. Not a good first impression, as the person who ordered after us was treated as VIP. Staff requires better training in helping at the front desk. Also, the restaurant has ample seating and only two tables were occupied, so not sure why the hostess rushed to the other customer. Food took much longer than 10 min.
