_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA Came here for lunch and there were a good number of people dining but we did not have to wait and were seated promptly. I ordered the chicken thali and asked for the butter chicken.  On the menu it seemed to give you choices for item a or item b but the server did not ask me to choose between the items so other than the butter chicken I'm not sure what else I had. Regardless the food was fairly good. The butter chicken was flavourful, the Naan bread that came in the meal was so soft and fluffy, and the dessert was really good. The portions were fairly decent as it left me in a good place between being hungry and stuffed.

The chef came by several times to check on us and even brought us some complimentary chicken which was awesome.

Overall it was a pretty good experience and I will definitely be back for some more of that naan bread.
