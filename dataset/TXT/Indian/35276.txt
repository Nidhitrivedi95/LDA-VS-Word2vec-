MsVb9bO8WG3BGeAys4-Waw Are you looking to expand your epicurean delights? If so this is the place to go. It is one of the best Sri Lankan carry outs I have tried when in Canada.  The combination of flavors and textures are amazing. The mutton rolls are divine. The spicy meat filling with just the right amount of potato, wrapped in  delicate pancake then breaded and fried to an crispy golden brown.  The fish patties are good also. They are the Sri Lankan version of an empanada but with a more delicate crisp wrapper.  Great with a side of ketchup.  My favorite though is the String Hoppers, typically called Add to dictionary. Is a rice noodle that is steamed to perfection and eaten with coconut sambal and soothe, a milk gravy made with onions , green chilies, tomatoes and turmeric powder.  They also sell a varieties of curries.  I have yet to try those yet but do plan too. This is a must go to place if you are going to be in the Mississauga area.  Great food and nice staff.
