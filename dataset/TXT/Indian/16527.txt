DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA We've eaten at Tadka twice now, and they definitely do not disappoint!

Tadka serves very good Northern Indian cuisine, in a hip, low key atmosphere. Portions are huge; large enough that they could be shared by 2 people. The waitstaff are very nice, attentive, but not intrusive.

Tadka is easily our favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland.
