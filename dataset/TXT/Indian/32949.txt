llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg I recently returned to Swad to give the lunch buffet another try. It wasn't bad last time, but there were some things that didn't sit totally right with me. On this more recent visit, my experience was much better. We arrived earlier in the serving window and the food was much fresher and well stocked. Service was more attentive, though there was a small hiccup of ordering drinks and not receiving them until tracking down a server 15 minutes later. 

Spice level was still on point (a couple notches up from the mild, spiceless buffet offerings of many restaurants), but the naan had a more flour-y flavor than most this time around. 

I'll happily return for the varied offerings and reasonable price point.
