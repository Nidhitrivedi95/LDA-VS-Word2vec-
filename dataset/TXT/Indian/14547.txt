C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw Not your typical Sri Lankan restaurant for sure. The kottu roti is quite different than what you would typically find in Scarborough/Markham. Went with a group of friends and we all tried different things (Spicy Chicken,Butter Chicken, and Seafood Special Kottu Roti). Food comes in a small box and is accompanied with the traditional limes. Large amount of food but the price is higher than what you would typically pay for Kottu Roti. However, from my knowledge this is probably the only Sri Lankan restaurant on Queen Street so it makes sense for the price variance. The place is very small so its not expected that you dine-in but there are a few chairs if you choose to stay. Food is really fresh and it is probably a good place to introduce to Non-Sri Lankans for the first time as the spice level is not that hot (you can always ask for hotter if you like). If your feeling like something different and have a spicy tooth in downtown, definitely recommend trying this spot.
