GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA On our way out camping we decided to stop in to this Triple D visited est and while mine was super good the hubby wasn't as lucky.
 
 The curry looks great but I was really feeling the Tandoori chicken so I went for the sizzler player. The beef kabobs were good with a nice spice mix but the two offered was enough for me, the consistency was off. It seemed like it was ground beef made into a patty? The Tandoori chicken and the other option, don't remember name was both very moist, with quite a bit of heat to them, and really delightful. 
 Hubby ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala. I enjoyed it enough, he didn't like it at all. I think the waitress misunderstood his request for the spiciest menu item as it had none and the mix of spices especially the mint and yogurt didn't sit well with either of us.... He finished MAYBE half.
 We also ordered the garlic naan and later on the hummus as the naan had absolutely no flavor, nothing like the one we enjoy from the store even, so we needed a dip to get through it. The hummus however was amazing and very garlicky. 

 Overall it was ok, we are from out of town so if in the area again we would opt to try a different eatery
