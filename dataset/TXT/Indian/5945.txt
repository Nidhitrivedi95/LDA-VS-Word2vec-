They have a full page of vegan options and also many vegetarian and non vegan/vegetarian options as well. They are so attentive and make sure you don't need anything. The restaurant itself if very clean and gorgeous! The food was beyond words! Never had Indian food before and this was the perfect place to go. Definitely will be going again!!
