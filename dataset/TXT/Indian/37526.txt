OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A I wasn't expecting much since I'm not much of an Indian food enthusiast but my taste buds were amazed by the food here.

This is a very tiny restaurant with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It did feel like an authentic experience and I would recommend this place to anyone going for Indian food.

P.S. you can choose to eat at a table or on the floor sitting on cushions!
