-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw Yummy food! ...truely delicious home made food.

No heavy masala/Spices.

Complimentary Tea was the unbeatable for sure.

Prices were reasonable. Ordered thali...and is suitable for kids as well.

Tried jilabi and rasagulas...not too impressed by rasagulas however jilabis were yummy...
