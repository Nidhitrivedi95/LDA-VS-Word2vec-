fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA I only gave 1 star because I can't give a 0.
I used to enjoy the food here until I got take out one day. I asked for the meat selection and literally they scoop everything for you. And when I chose my meat dishes, she literally picked out the bones and gave me lots of gravy. Since then, I have never stepped foot back into this cheap a$$ restaurant.
