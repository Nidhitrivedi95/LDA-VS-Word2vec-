hDaookbWWFR3bEm-1_orrw It was the first time for my husband and I to try Indian cuisine.  We both liked it very much.  Yes, we will be coming back to this place!!

We ordered the Non-Veg Assorted Snack (Seesh Kebab, Fish Pakoras & Chicken Pakoras) for an appertizer.  The Seesh Kebab was minced lamb mixed with spcies cooked on skeker in clay oven, not like the normal kebab you think it is.  The taste was different, not my cup of tea.  But the fish and chicken Parkora was very good.

For our entrees ordered up a Karahi Lamb-Boti Masala (boneless tansoori lamb in a tomatoe and butter gravy) and Chicken Biryani (basmati rice with chicken cooked with nuts, herbs, raisins, and spices).  The Karahi Lamb dish was served as medium and the Chicken Biryani was served as mild.  The lamd dish was too HOT for me (but then I am a super lightweight), but the flavor was good.  I loved my Chicken Biryani, the aromatic rice, herb, and spices was just wonderful to smell and taste.  The waitress suggested the Garlic Naan bread.  It was like a pita with small chunks of garlic and herb.  It was very tasty too.  

We got to chatting with the owners.  They were very patience to explain what everything was and give us different sauces to try (cucumber yogurt, minty cream, etc.) with our dishes.  They also brought out a sample of the Kheer (rice pudding), my husband inhaled it.  He loved it!
