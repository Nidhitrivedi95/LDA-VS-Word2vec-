2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Whenever I'm in the area I grab a whole lot of samosas here. At 5 for $1 they are a steal, and chutneys are $0.25 for sweet and $0.50 for spicy, with larger sizes available though I've never gotten them. They also do spring rolls 5 for $1 and have a huge selection of fried foods, sweets, and savoury snacks. Also, they have a hot food section that has a separate line up, which does curries, biryanis, rotis, etc. Today I decided to try the 3 veg curries with basmati rice for $2.49 and I have to say it was a pretty good deal. They let you choose from about 6 or 7 different vegetarian curries. I had the daal, spinach, and mixed vegetables, all three were good. The spinach had a bit of a burnt flavour to it, which I think was intentional. 
Came Friday afternoon at around 1:30pm and barely had to wait which is a plus! I've been when the line up is nearly to the door, and the wait time is still reasonably fast. Because this place is so cheap and popular, samosas are super fresh!
