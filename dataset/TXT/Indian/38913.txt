OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g Very dissapointing......... I went with fam to the lunch buffet. The rice was burnt, most of the trays were near empty and they didnt even fill them the entire time we were there. The 1 and ONLY staff was very unprofessional and over talkative without caring about service, not to mention ify music that you couldn't think over.. This place gets one  for not even caring about anything. This one is in the failing 90% for sure.. With better staff and service this place has a chance. THE FOOD WAS .... GET IT TOGETHER GUYS... GOOD LUCK.
