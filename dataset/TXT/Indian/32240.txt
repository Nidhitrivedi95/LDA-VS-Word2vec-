LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg We got takeout from Indian Paradise through Eat24, and had a good experience.  We got the chicken Tikka Masala (ordered it extra Spicey), and it was fantastic!  My wife has q new go-to takeout dish, and I agreed that it was top notch.  We also ordered lamb madras, which we thought was decent, though my wife didn't love the lamb meat.  I thought the madras sauce was good, but paled in comparison to the tikka masala.  We also got some tandoori chicken which was very good, and a super generous portion.  The portion sizes were all generous, and they give you more than enough rice on the side with your order.  The last thing that we ordered was garlic naan and green chili naan, both of which were below average for Naan (I've had a lot of phenomenal Naan, so I'm a bit biased), and this is one place that we both thought they could do a bit better.  Overall, we had a good experience, and loved our dinner, and the yummy leftovers the next day.  We'll be headed back again in the future for the Tikka Masala alone :)
