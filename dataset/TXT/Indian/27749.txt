irCBE0vRZ9oQZ26qMR-5HA Don't get me wrong, the food here is always great and the prices okay... The staff is kind and always offers samples but on my most recent visit the sample offered must have been straight out of the pot and scalding hot. Gave my tongue a nasty burn. They gave me water, sure... but damage done. 

Be very wary of the temperature of the samples no matter how the cup feels.
