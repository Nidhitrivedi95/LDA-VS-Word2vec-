W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg Simply the best South Indian food in Madison so far. Their pongal vada is to absolutely die for! Just the right amount of dal, ghee and cashews :) And their dosas - wow, they have over a dozen varieties - all scrumptious. I also like their Madurai idli - spiced and fried goodness. Their sambhar and coconut chutney is also good. 

Not really a fan of most of their other dishes though. I prefer the other Indian restaurants in town for North Indian food. So, this is quite complementary since I don't really like the others' South Indian fare!

Their service is decent and the owners are nice. Not giving 5 because their quantity to price ratio is a bit low - understandable for an upstart, but hopefully they will fix it in due course.
