aDWOXQVSvRPOpqcJ1ja0_Q Definitely not the cleanest place in the city, but the burritos make up for it!  I've had the chicken burrito a number of times, and recently tried the mixed vegetable burrito.  Both are AWESOME.  I can't even describe the flavour, beyond the fact that it's some sort of Indian/Mexican fusion (more Indian than Mexican), and it's just awesome.  The guy who works the cash and the grill (at least on Saturdays, when my husband and I tend to go) is very nice.

I ALWAYS leave this place wanting more.
