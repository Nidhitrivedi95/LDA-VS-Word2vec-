OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g If you are visiting Vegas, this place is a must! This was my first Indian experience and I'm hooked! Our waiter, Jose, was hilarious! He helped us order and told us all about our options. He was very attentive and provided fabulous service. The owner was there as well and he spent time visiting with all customers which was awesome. When he heard it was our first time at an Indian restaurant, he brought us samples to try and told us the back story of how certain items were traditionally made. Very cool! Awesome experience- definitely going to go back!
