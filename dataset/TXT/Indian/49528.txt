tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My family went here for lunch as we had heard and read positive reviews.  We were not disappointed.  This is a great place to go to be able to enjoy a variety of Indian dishes.  The food is very good and the naan was delivered hot to our table.  The naan actually comes with the buffet meal, a big plus.  The restaurant itself isn't anything fancy but it's clean.  It would have been nice if the waiters would have smiled or been a little more cordial.  Some of them looked like they hated their job and really didn't want to be there.  In spite of that I would still give this restaurant high marks.
