Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg We ordered the Methi Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Creamy Coconut Chicken, And Creamy Paneer. All the curries were way too watery and the chicken was obviously not fresh and reheated. 

The samosas were way too spicy and the apricot naan had an overwhelming thyme flavor. 

Will not be returning.
