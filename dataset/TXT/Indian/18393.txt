eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw Vegetarian Indian Restaurant. Went in a Saturday around 7pm and the wait was around 30 minutes. The restaurant  itself is small but very nice decor and modern. The food was great, lots of curry options, rices, Indian and Hakka food, great way to try different foods and see what you like. Dessert has traditional Indian and standard Canadian stuff like ice cream, fruit, chocolate fountain. Best part fountain drinks are included in buffet price.
