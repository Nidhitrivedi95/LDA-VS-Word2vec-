dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q I popped in for lunch recently and did a take away buffet meal.

I found the food good but a bit pricey for 1 take out meal ($14).

Would I go here again? Yes but not for take out. The decor is great and really well done. They've done a great job of setting up a nice ambiance for their clientele.

It gets a thumbs up from me. But the price point for take out was a bit steep.
