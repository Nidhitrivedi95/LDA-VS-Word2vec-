cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw I ordered the lamb biryani to go over the phone at about 3 pm and it was ready within the 5 minutes it took me to get there. I asked for some extra mint yogurt and it was put into my bag with no extra charge. 
I can only comment on the biryani seeing that it was my first time and it was delicious - even after the 20 minutes it took me to get to eating it. It came with some sort of a hot sauce which was really nice. 
I will definitely return to try some of the kebabs.
