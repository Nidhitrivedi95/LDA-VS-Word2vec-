3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Had dinner here last night and went a little overboard on ordering. I ordered 3 entrees  Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikki Masala, and Aloo Gobi.  All of which were amazing.  I had them set the spice level (how spicy) to 7 on the 1 to 10 scale and it had just the perfect amount of heat for someone who like things on the spicy side.  I also ordered the Naan and rice which also very good.  The staff was very friendly and always made sure I had everything I needed.  So if you are in Vegas and looking for good affordable Indian food i highly recomend Delhi Indian Cuisine.
