llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I had the lunch buffet today and was thoroughly satisfied. I've been here before but it's been a while. It was among the best Indian buffet meals I've had recently. I've given a few other Indian buffets 4 stars but this one is a notch above. 

All of the entrees were flavorful. They had curry lamb, you don't see that often on a buffet. The curry chicken was unique and delicious. The Tandoori chicken was moist. I liked all of the assorted vegetable entrees. The lentils were great, and I liked the sauteed cabbage and their version of spinach. They also have a small fresh salad bar. 

I especially liked the dessert. The gulab juman was on point. It was nicely chilled and cooked perfectly like a cake doughnut soaked in syrup. Some places make them too dense and serve them warm ! Craziness. I sampled the rice pudding too and it was excellent. I only drank water but I noticed they have a full bar. I might try them for dinner some time.

When I was done eating, I washed my hands in the bathroom and it was immaculate inside. That's always nice to see.
