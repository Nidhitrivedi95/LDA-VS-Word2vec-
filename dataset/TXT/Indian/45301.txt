S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA The food here was delicious!  Especially loved the Chicken Tiki Masala and the Biryani.  So, so good.  Went here with a party of 4 for a friends birthday and boy did the waiter (who I think may be owner) was so funny and helpful with ordering and did not make us feel dumb when we were unfamiliar with the cuisine.  He actually brought us samples of things we didn't order just so we could try them. We got medium spiciness on our items and I would consider it a fairly mild medium compared to most curry type food I've had.   Fabulous experience!
