llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Ordered here for the first time and we had madras lamb at least that's what we ordered... Anyways it was take out so I guess they messed up our order and gave us beef instead of lamb. I really wanted to like the place since it had such good reviews but the taste just wasn't to my liking. This could have been due to the disappointment of eating beef instead of lamb, but the madras just didn't have the same balance between the spiciness and the coconut that I've tasted at other restaurants. The naan bread was the only plus.
