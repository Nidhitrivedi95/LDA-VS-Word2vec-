PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ The best Indian buffet in town. There is a lot to like here and I'll always choose this over mandarin. Our visits have dropped dramatically though since we started seeking out al la carte Indian counterparts (and found a new fav). Good for families who may want some non-indian options as well (e.g., pizza/fries).
