S4qUsi44l5D9BbUCkhwQEA My friends been raving about this restaurant so I tagged along with them for dinner. Everything in the restaurant is new and clean. This place is run by two brothers and their dad is the chef. Only one of the brothers were there and he was very attentive and I liked that he engaged in conversation with us. Granted my friends are regulars here and the owners know them,  Golbi introduced himself & was very friendly. I started off with the vegetable samosa which was delicious. It comes with two sauces (Tamarind & mint chutney). the green sauce reminds me of a green chili salsa and the red one is sweet & tangy. Both compliment the samosas very well. Then I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo and asked for Indian Hot since I love spicy food. I ordered a side of rice with my dish or you can order a side of the garlic naan that is just as good. If you got an appetite then get both :)  Overall  the food was delicious, service was great and it's a great new addition to the Chandler area. The owner also is working on getting his alcohol license so expect to see some great beer selection coming soon!
