sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ Probably one of the best roti I have ever had in my life we had the butter chciken roti big enough for 2 for 11 bucks and it filled me up. You can choose the level of spiciness and they also have the same dishes with rive as well. Very tasty looking forward to trying their other roti. They make all the roti from scratch very small place but the dishes come out very quickly amazing
