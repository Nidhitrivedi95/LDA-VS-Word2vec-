ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA We decided to deviate from our favorite Indian restaurant and give Jannat Indian Cuisine a try and I am glad we did. It is now my new favorite. The waiter, Harry, was very friendly and attentive. Service with a smile. Sonny the owner made sure to greet us.  I really appreciate the personal touch that added.   Had chili paneer, butter chicken and my husband had goat saag.  All was Delicious!! We will certainly come back for more.
