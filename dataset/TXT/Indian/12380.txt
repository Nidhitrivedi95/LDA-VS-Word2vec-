axGUBM5mgmFZQn85bMTVPA I was in the restaurant on the day that the previous posted said that the "staff was very rude" for asking her to leave due to her child having a screaming fit. This is not the case. The staff was very understanding and sympathetic, but the "mommy" could not have cared less. She has that typical Charlotte parent attitude that her children have the right to be spoiled brats as long as she is a paying customer. I heartily applaud the staff at Cafe Nirvana for coming to the rescue of the other customers and getting her and her brat out of the place!
