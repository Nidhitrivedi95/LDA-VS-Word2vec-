GtrrBtrfZgvqGF930JwYOg The BEST food and service! I have tried the chicken tikka, Baluch balti, samosas, and Nihari; all are so delicious! Unbelievable! 

Today, I wanted delivery but door dash stops at 8pm so I called the restaurant and the owner was such a gentleman that he promised to deliver the food himself!!! That's unheard of in most places and I  greatly appreciated it.  

The BEST family owned place and a MUST visit.  Post mates charged me $14.25 for delivery charge so forget it and never use it; door dash is the way to go.  Great food and excellent service!
