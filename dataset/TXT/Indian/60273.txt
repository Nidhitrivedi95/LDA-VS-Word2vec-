ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA 1. An Indian joint usually serves lousy buffet... WRONG in case of this place. Every single time the food is amazing.
2. Servers are okay. Ambience is ok...Nothing extra ordinary about them. Which kinda compensates for the good food.
3. Try their Dum Biryani... It takes 45mins but is worth waiting every single of those mins.
4. All in all, it gets all 5 stars for the food. And it is not even that costly!
I would suggest first timers to try the buffet.
