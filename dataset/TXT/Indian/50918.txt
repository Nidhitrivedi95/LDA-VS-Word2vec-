UmcOChw3fm-GgbpK2o_t5w One of the best things about this place is it's changed it's name to 'tikka tikka'. I could never bring myself to go when it had the awful name ' spice lobster '. Very cheap prices and busy ,so busy in fact that they forgot about us and gave our table to someone else then remembered us long enough to try and Charge us for extra drinks. All in all pretty good if you remove questionable service
