RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I'd heard good things about the place, and went there with a lot of expectations. I ordered Palak Chicken, Garlic Naan, Lahori Kulfi and Kashmiri Chai - none of which made me feel they were worth the time/drive/money. The food wasn't bad per se, but nothing to write home about either. I am sticking to the stuff I ordered becuase they had a pretty diverse menu and it's highly likely that they might excel in some other dishes.
