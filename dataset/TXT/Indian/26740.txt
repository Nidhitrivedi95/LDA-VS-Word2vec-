iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Marigold Maison is one of the newer Indian "foodie " restaurants in the Phoenix area. Located in an area populated by strip malls and run of the mill fast food fare, Marigold Maison is elegantly presented from the outside and does not disappoint on the inside. If you go for dinner a reservation might be a good idea because the place fills up quickly, since it has a small to dining room. There is also a small outside patio area wine bar which is enclosed (smart idea on their part). If you go there for your favorite wine or beer after work, they have a pretty good list of libations that are paired perfectly with their delicious appetizers! Space is limited. The menu features many traditional Indian dishes, along with some inventive new takes on Indian for health conscious foodies. When we went there, the waiter was attentive although very busy. The food we ordered, came out faster than I expected and it was delicious, well presented, but not steaming hot. We were so stuffed I barely had room for my favorite dessert Galab Jamun! YUM.  A banquet room is also available but was not used at the time we went. We were nearly the first ones in at their 5pm opening but it filled to capacity by the time we left. The only drawback I thought was they only have iced Chai, and just "hot tea" in place of authentic Indian Chai tea made in a saucepan. Our tea water was barely lukewarm, and the whole concept of traditional hot Chai after a meal seemed lost in the Phoenix area's love of iced teas and coffees. All over though I really liked the food and atmosphere, which would have me returning to eat there again.
