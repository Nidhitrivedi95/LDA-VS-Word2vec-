UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw Ate here on Super Bowl Sunday, food was over salty and cold. I was dissappointed after reading all of the fabulous reviews. What made things worse, after we ate we both felt very bloated. Then i started to get a headache which turned into a severe headache. The kind i normally only get from MSG.the headache lasted well into the evening. I was so hoping this indian buffet was going to be great. Now that the all vegetarian south indian buffet in Tempe. Has seemed to lose it way. With the same borning dishes over aand over again. And looks like this place is not going to take its place. 

Didnt think Indians used MSG in their food, do they? Well due to the headache and bloated stomache. I dont think i would return. . Perhaps if they change sigificantly i would venture back.
