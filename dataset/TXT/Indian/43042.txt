RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Been here twice so far, and both times had a great experience.  I would give a 5star if some of the prices were a little bit lower and the service was faster.  The first time we went we waited over an hour for our meal, which wasn't a big deal since it was a date night and they had almost every table full.  We got curry chicken with basic naan, garlic naan, and veggie samosa's.  Everything was really tasty and done very well, and our service was good aside from the longer wait than anticipated.

The second time I flew solo and brought a book expecting another wait but was there earlier and one of few tables.  I got the Chicken Saag (spinach) with regular naan which is one of my favorites at most Indian places, and definitely wasn't disappointed.  The order came out quick, the meal was delicious, and I was surprised to finish it by myself.  I easily could have made it two meals, but I was incredibly hungry, so the portioning is great for a single dish.  

I'm excited to get back there again and try another dish!
