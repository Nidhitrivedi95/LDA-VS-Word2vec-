K6Q4jshtcZZg6giPn5NQLw One of our usual dinner places. Really good naan, fresh rice, hot papadums and a number of vegetarian dishes from which to choose. Love the navratam korma and khumb mutter panner (??spelling). There is some inconsistency with flavour though as some days are better than others. We often take-out, but we've always received good service in the restaurant.
