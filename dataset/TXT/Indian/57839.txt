yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I am spoiled for Indian food now. This place is the best. It smells awesome and the decor is nice. I've eaten here twice, once for lunch when it was slow and it was very quiet and once on Friday when it was busy and it was a little on the loud side. No matter, I love the food. The Lamb Korma is to die for and the Tikka Masala is awesome. The Kashmiri Naan is so good. I love this place.
