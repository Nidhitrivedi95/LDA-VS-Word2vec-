Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw I'm not an experienced Indian gourmand but I came here for the "best" Indian food buffet according to several reviews.

My experience....adequate sums it up. Limited options for the buffet. A few salad options to begin with. Rice, naan, then your standard masala, beef curry, butter chicken, lamb, tandoori chicken. The butter chicken was best but the food overall was far from authentic.

Not too spicy which can be good or bad. Hot and replenished quickly. Overall, if I have a craving I may be back but not anytime soon.
