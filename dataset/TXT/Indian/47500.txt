TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I tried this place back in July while on vacation. It was a pit pricey but the food was absolutely delicious. Some of our favorites were the chicken masala and the chicken tandoori. The garlic naan bread was really good. We tried a lot and everything was good. Now the service was amazing! Our waiter was attentive and nice! The decor is great because it doesn't look cheap! The inside of the restaurant is nice. The parking isn't very large.
