HAqFrpN8ukzFZuSgTvLijw my friends and i got. takeouts and we went here as a recommendation from a friend. 5 dishes for a total of 52$ - very affordable with huge portions, however, taste definitely needs an improvement 

Hakka noodles - good but similar to all the other noodles I've tried. think Shanghai noodles with less flavour

Crispy beef - by far the best crispy beef i've had! huge portion and tasted amazing! not too crispy and dry which i think is a good thing. the flavour was on point - a hint of sweetness but retained its savoury side 

Shrimp pakora - dry but fairly tastety. full shrimps rolled up in a dough-ball and baked. had a hint of spice to it

Mapo tofu - was disappointed with this dish. in my opinion, it didn't have any flavour and bland although it looked good

Chilli chicken (gravy) - not spicy at all and again, the flavour was not there
