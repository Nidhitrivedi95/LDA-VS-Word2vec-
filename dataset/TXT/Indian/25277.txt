HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Food was good , nothing extraordinary and fairly priced. I have tasted better indian food than this. Service was good and interior was clean and tastefully done. 

I did read the reviews before going there and still was not sure of. Since most reviews are written by the people who are not very much acquainted with indian food delicacies and they dont know much difference between authentic and ok food.  Being an Indian, I know instantly if its really how the dish needs to be cooked and tasted. Anyways In my ratings, above average and I would go back.
