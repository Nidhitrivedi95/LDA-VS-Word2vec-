CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw Amazing offering at the lunch buffet, over 20 different salads alone! The service was impeccable; friendlier and more prompt than most restaurants. My server brought me garlic naan without me asking (my favorite Indian dish on earth), and brought me a carafe if soda water when I asked for a little bit extra to mix in with my gin.

Phenomenal value for a lunch buffet (under $12)!
