I've heard both Bombays and Casablanca are both owned by the same people: but Bombay is the place to go for lunch! You and a buddy could get away splitting a dish for $8. Very cool! 

The food is pretty good. Not the best in town (Casablanca or that new one in Urbana is better), but good enough for a quick lunch.
