We didn't have reservation, but they were able to seat us ASAP (informing before we sat that they would need table for prior set reservation 1.5 hours layer). Restaurant was clean - service was great (attentive without being overly burdensome) - food was absolutely delicious. I was even able to get chapati, which I haven't properly had in over 3 years. 
Yes, our chosen dinner menu was limited, but only because I am not a big eater whereas my SO is. Regardless, everything that came out was superb. 
We wholeheartedly recommend sans reservation! 
PS- If you don't have wine, go across the street for a lovely Chateauneuf. Was pleasantly surprised to find that (& other wines) at the local kwikie-mart.
