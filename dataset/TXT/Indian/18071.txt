Eecewruq14ycZwV--OdOSw It's a good place - I've been there a few times. It's a bit slow with the service though. As a note, they don't serve halwa puri. It's listed on their menu (not on their website) and if you go there they will tell you they don't have any. If you're looking for halwa puri, look elsewhere!
