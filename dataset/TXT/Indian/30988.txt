kG0N5urz2lkPEBDPjqFR3w Sooooo ... my husband and I ordered take out from there and I ordered the Mutter Paneer. However, when it got to the house it was Palak Paneer. I asked my husband why I got the wrong thing and he told me that he asked about it when he picked it up and said "we ordered the mutter paneer" and the person who was working said "oh it;s the same thing" ........... what? If the people who work there don't understand what the difference is between their food that is terrible. As was the Palak Paneer. I didn't bother calling them because if it wasn't a priority then it wouldn't be after we picked it up.
