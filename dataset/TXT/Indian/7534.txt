5vxp6inj3sY4Eb2MFyOOPg So tasty. The most dominant flavor here is yogurt. Yogurt with mint. Yogurt with sumac. Yogurt with pumpkin. Yogurt with lemon... ahh, so good!  Totally delicious and if you like anything that's Indian flavored or Mediterranean, this is your spot. The food is different. I don't eat Afghan food on the regular. This -- gonna be my regular. Totally delicious and beautiful restaurant inside.
