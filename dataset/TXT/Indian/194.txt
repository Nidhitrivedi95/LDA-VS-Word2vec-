-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g We came here for lunch with a Groupon.  We ate off of the regular menu (instead of the lunch buffet so we could use the Groupon).  Everything was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.  The waiter was wonderful, attentive and brought us a bit of an appetizer and dessert (on the house).  The prices are right on.  The daily (yes, even weekends) lunch buffet looked very substantial and yummy.  It is only $6.99---I can't wait to come back and try it.  Spread the word---you have to visit Nandini if you are into Indian food.
