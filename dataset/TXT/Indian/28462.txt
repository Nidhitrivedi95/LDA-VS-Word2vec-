J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ My friend brought me here when I had never tried Indian food, and this place definitely made me love Indian food. I have been craving butter chicken every day since! We went for the buffet and it was DELICIOUS, decent variety of food from my limited experience, and I liked pretty much every single thing I tried. I loved the naan, the butter chicken, and the service- I only wish there was a tiny bit more variety in desserts. Will definitely go here again.
