Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg We went for a late lunch after helping my brother move to his new apartment in Lakewood. I thought the buffet was just awesome. I agree that the place lacks ambiance, but it makes it up with a buffet that serves food with a hint of spice (most Indian buffets are so bland that it makes me want to cry). And I was very pleased with the prices. No, I wouldn't take anyone here to impress them, but for delicious, quick lunch I'm totally sold.
