ScdtR67jO-p_ZIpVbZPRfw Hands down the best Indian food I've had.

Having lived and eaten my way around Ohio for the last 20 years, I always compare Indian places back to Amar India (Dayton) and Aab (Grandview). This place trounces them both!

First, the service: this is a place where you can tell business is a point of personal and family pride. The main waiter is involved in ownership and really took the time to talk to us about the menu with an enthusiasm that was fun and refreshing. In fact, the guy was so excited it was our first time in, he brought us out some Indian milk tea and a dessert later on, on the house. He was genuinely interested in our opinions of our dishes and checked up on us throughout the meal.

We ordered the famous garlic naan, chicken saag, and chicken tikka masala. It's impossible to make garlic naan bad but the latter two dishes were incredibly flavorful, savory, and balanced. It was the type of meal you constantly look over at your dinnermate with wide eyes mouthing phrases like "whoa", "wow", and "holy sh$t".

The prices seemed fair ($30ish for 2) and we left with enough leftovers for probably 2 lunches.

This place crushes and we feel lucky to have found such an incredibly great Indian restaurant.
