t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q For at least a year now, I have seen various Groupon deals for this restaurant. This place is near Costco. Whenever I visit Costco, I end up eating at the food court. 

I decided a few Saturdays ago to drop by Hakka King and check out the food. It was roughly around 3 pm.

It is a family-run restaurant. Two women were sitting at a table. One of them was eating. The other got up and asked me whether I was ordering takeout. I indicated that I was hungry and wanted to dine in. She asked me to pick any table.

Once I did, I was promptly given a menu and a glass of water. Nice service!

I ordered the garlic chicken. It came with a bowl of rice.

I loved how much chopped garlic you get in this dish. It wasn't spicy. It would have been more enjoyable if it had some heat. However, I enjoyed how tender the chicken was. The sauce worked nicely. My indication is how much rice is left. I left nothing.

I got a fortune cookie with my bill. It was strange that, after cracking it open, not only did I get a fortune with a set of lottery numbers, but it gave me a link for a second fortune. Huh?

Anyway, I will return to try some more dishes. This area does get busy, as there are many businesses surrounding this restaurant.
