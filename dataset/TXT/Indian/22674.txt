GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw My friend and I found this place as a small hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant. We were the only ones in the restaurant so service was not an issue. It took some time to get our food but I felt the meals were freshly cooked and tasted great! Overall they have great food, but if you're wanting to be in the midst of people this wouldn't be the place for that. I would definitely opt for the take out however. I believe the signature dish is the lamb curry and the portion sizes were quite filling.
