t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg I will definitely go back to this place.  Before Saffron, I have been to only 3 Indian restaurants which disappointed me enough to be wary of the cuisine altogether.  I am so glad my husband took me here for 'something different'.  Walked in, had a saffron martini drop (an original creation), and decided, yup, this is gonna be goood! appetizer:chili chicken 5/10 spice: Wow.  Bread basket:  garlic and cheese naan:  my son scarfed that down. Had chicken tikka masala and lamb masala: yum.  Staff were very nice, restroom was clean.  A bit of a drive from the strip, but from this experience, was well worth it.
