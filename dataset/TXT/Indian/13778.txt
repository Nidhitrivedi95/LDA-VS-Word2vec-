BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ Came here with a groupon. Had their vindaloo chicken (spicy) and coconut creamy chicken (very mild). I enjoyed the vindaloo, there was adequate amounts of chicken with a mixed variety of veggies in the curry, and I finished the whole thing. :)

We only tried the dishes on their indian menu. Next time, I would come back to try their Nepalese menu items. For value, it cant be beat.

Mango lassi was a tad liquid-y, would be good to add some small mango chunks for a thicker consistency like I usually prefer.
