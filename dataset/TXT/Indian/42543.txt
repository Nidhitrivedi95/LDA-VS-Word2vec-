r7JM2s-kkcFf47H7yl0PUw Sometimes with Yelp you can get a bit carried away with the idea of a place that the reality can let you down. It wasn't really the case, although I think I would shy away from describing the food here as incredible, but it at the same time, extremely good - and what is more, entirely up my vegetable-strewn street.

As I was incapable of making a decision on such an aubergine-heavy menu (oh how I love you so), and the boy lost without meat options, we chose both thali options, to get a few different taste sensations. As we did - with a green pea, aubergine and potato dish coming out on top for us, followed by chickpea and potato as well as a mixed vegetable bhaji (?). The rice was perfumed with spices, the chapattis burning hot from the oven. I wasn't blown away by the samosas or pakoras, and found the dhal lacking in flavour, but overall, the quality of food was high. 

Have to give a nod to the service as well, very friendly and pleasant to be around. There was an introduction to some of the dishes on our plates when they arrived, glasses of water part way through and offerings of complimentary drinks at the end, which we were too stuffed to accept. 

I will also note that although I did enjoy the poppadoms (had more flavour than others I have tried) and the multitude of chutneys - a fiver for the pleasure was much too high - as noted by a reviewer for another restaurant, there is a large markup on puffs of air, and I definitely experienced that last night, and we paid nearly eight quid on one beer and a fresh orange and lemonade, which also seemed rather steep to me. I have to note though, prices for the rest of the meal seemed much more reasonable, but it will be sometime to remember for my next visit.
