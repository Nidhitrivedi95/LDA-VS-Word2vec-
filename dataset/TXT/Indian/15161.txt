CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw One of my favorite Indian restaurants in Toronto. I always start with the full meat appetizer - this is a mini meal so make sure you have 3-4 people if you order it. 

For entrees I've had the tikka masala, the okra, saag paneer, and tandoori chicken. All have been top notch. 

The garlic naan is a nice touch too. The mango drink at the end of the meal is a nice way to finish depending how spicy your food was. 

They do take out as well. Not sure of delivery.
