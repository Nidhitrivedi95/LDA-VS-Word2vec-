LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw Wow. Visited the strip today and picked up some take-out for a late dinner tonight.  I will say that this was the best take out food we've ever eaten.  This was the first time we have been to Salem's (It is pronounced Sah-leems', we asked the guy.)

As others have noted, it is large inside, casual, and cafeteria style.  Very basic but very clean and we will definitely eat there at some point in the future.  Selections today were all varieties of chicken and we ordered a half rotisserie chicken dinner (the chicken was gorgeous, how often can you say that about chicken???) that came with rice and veggies.  Also picked up a gyro and some spinach pies.  We shared everything, did not finish it all but tried hard because it was all absolutely delicious.  

We loved it and will be back.
