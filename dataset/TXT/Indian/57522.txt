Ydo_fjixKeEmPtgHs8IPMQ It was payday, and we had a broken oven, so a takeaway curry was inevitable when you think about it. And now I've finally found my favourite Edinburgh joint to order one from - hurrah!

I whooped when I saw dosa on the menu - love me some spicy pancake. The chickpea filling offered two choices, sweet or spicy. I opted for spicy - it was so tasty, but the initial spice had so much kick it gave me a sneezing fit - oops! The husband got a paneer masala which came with a generous amour of cubed cheese goodness in a rich and delicious sauce. Our pilau rice was delivered in a bag rather than a contain, which we thought was weird but it didn't detract. We also ordered a veggie pakora and thought "oh, we'll go for the large as we're sharing". Unwrapping a huge bag filled with crisp pakora bites we realised our folly - we were still snacking on the leftovers 2 days later!

All in all, a solid curry that delivered on flavour and portion size. A little slow in getting to us (over an hour as I recall) but as we ordered through Just Eat we were given an update on the delivery time, so at least we knew.
