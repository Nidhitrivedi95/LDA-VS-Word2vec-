ocgIMnZ5J-zOhTxBkRIgHg Chicken biriyani for $4.99, I was skeptical, but was blown away after tasting. Literally just walked in and bought a container to try with a curry before heading out to Vaughan Mills. 

Tons of flavour in this biriyani, cooked perfectly! Butter chicken curry was very good as well.
