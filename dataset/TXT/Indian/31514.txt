KvRh-exPg_KegOM_HXeskw A small little Indian place, yet amazing options on homemade ice creams.
They have a small menu for Indian chaats and curries/biryani.
Ordered -
Veggie Kothu paratha - tasted good, pepper was little on higher side. No sides was given with it. Good evening meal though.
Vada pay- had this thing after ~4 years maybe. Was about to cry.. Lol. Give it a shot, it's good.
Veggie Cutlet - guessing it's a frozen ones and not freshly made. So not a big deal breaker here.
Gulkhand and Coconut ice cream - Best and best and best.. Really loved it. In fact they have new flavors added/experimented. Don't blame me if you don't find coconut ice cream one day.

Small place, Good ambience. FYI - there are no restrooms .

I would rate this place 4.5.
