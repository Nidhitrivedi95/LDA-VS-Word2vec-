3BJhHBe9xEKe8jaIDd8SWg Dropped into Kensington market about two weeks ago and felt hungry. Needed something quick that I could take with me and enjoy while waking around with roomie and Tibet looked like it would fit the bill! 

Walked in, ordered my food and was told it would be a bit so I went back out and wandered around before coming back. 

Ordered the chicken burger (actually a sandwich, roasted chicken with veggies on yummy bread) and I think you could choose your side - I got fries. Tasty! 

Also ordered a carrot/orange fresh juice - I wasn't the biggest fan but I don't blame them for that, I'm just a picky eater personally. 

Decently priced. 

Only gripe I would have is that the emphasis is more on the food then on service - one of the servers bumped into me every time she walked past... It was a bit of a narrow space but she could have gotten by without shoulder checking me every time.
