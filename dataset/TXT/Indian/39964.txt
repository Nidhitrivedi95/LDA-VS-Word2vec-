pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw After hearing all the good reviews about this place from friends and fellow yelpers, I had to try for myself. I came in with high expectations, and walked out with great satisfaction! This must be the BEST Indian buffet I had in Pittsburgh so far!

The atmosphere is very dynamic, bright, clean and family friendly. I came here for the $12 dinner buffet. There were so many choices to choose from and each dish was cooked to perfection--fresh ingredients and quick refills. I wanted to try a little bit of everything, but my stomach surrendered too soon. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have samosa though. 

Overall, I highly recommend Taj Mahal to those with a passion for Indian cuisines and a huge appetite. Dinner buffets are only available Monday, Thursday and Saturday. I will definitely return here again in the near future to finish up some unfinished business (the other half of the buffet I didn't get to try).
