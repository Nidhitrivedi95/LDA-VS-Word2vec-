3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA My friends M&H come here as they are a short drive from the Junction; when they suggested we go here for dinner last Saturday night, I was in.  

This is a more upscale Indian restaurant.  There is no buffet.  We enjoyed 2 apps, 3 dishes and naan plus 3 drinks for about $100.  The food has a good homemade taste to it and was a bit different than what might be called the "generic" dishes you get everywhere else.  (Not that there is anything wrong with generic butter chicken!)  

Personally I was more impressed with the spinach and cheese than with the lamb or chicken--my inner vegetarian should have won out here.  The naan was especially good and more than I could finish...perhaps a first.

Service was friendly and efficient.  The wonder was particularly warm and friendly; it is no doubt why my friends dine here often.

I think this place really works on a date or with a small group (2-4 people).  There is enough going on in the Junction to justify a trip out for dinner.
