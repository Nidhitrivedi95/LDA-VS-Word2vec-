XZxJ4fG-4a3PP9VP5jvDWw After having tried Ghandi's Roti, I knew it was a must to try Mother India.

I went with my other half, and we ordered the Masala Dosa, I ordered the Vegetable Korma roti, and he ordered the Butter Chicken roti.

With my Mango Lassi on hand (how could anyone not order this at any Indian restaurant?!), the server kindly told us to eat the dosa first, as it is not good when cold.

Ohhh, my goodness, was I glad we ordered this!  I highly recommend for anyone to order this when you come in here for a visit.  It was just so tasty, and the lentils were perfectly cooked - just a little crunch!

The man friend enjoyed his Butter Chicken Roti - neither of us have had butter chicken for a while, and it was nice and creamy, and the sauce was lovely with the rice.  He gave it a 4/5.

I had the Saag Paneer at Ghandi's Roti, which I would give 4/5, even 5/5 (I remember I was mega hungry that time), but the Vegetable Korma roti was...OK.  3/5.  It wasn't that it wasn't good, but maybe I had not ordered something that satisfied what my stomach really wanted.  But no matter, I had the dosa to devour!

All in all, I thought Mother India's rotis were the same and just as good as Ghandi's Roti, but because it is a sit-down type restaurant, the ambiance was much more pleasurable as compared with Ghandi's Roti.  Take it for what it is - one is a restaurant, the other a take-out joint.

I will come back, specifically for the dosa!
