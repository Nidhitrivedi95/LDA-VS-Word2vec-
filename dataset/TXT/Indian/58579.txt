yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ Kind of a different place for where it's situated. You have the lunch atmosphere is pretty typical, then it get's quite a bit nicer during dinner time. Still not 'fancy' by any means, but respectable.
Although it's called Casablanca, it's really more of a mix of levantine food and Indian food, which is a pretty great combination. 
The kebabs and various sandwhiches are all great, and the dinner-fare is also on the same level - the curries are the best I've had in town, surprisingly. The fries are, as many other reviews mention, pretty great, and the naan and sauces and chutneys that come with meals are always good.
The prices are a little steep, especially at dinner, but it follows the sort of atmosphere it's going for.
I've always had really great service here - free food thrown in once or twice, attentive waiter, and quick food. Definitely one of the better choices on that strip on Green street.
