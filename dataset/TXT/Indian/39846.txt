pGR5DKBdLz_QpEvDDel_MA We didn't plan the visit to Spice Heaven on Danforth. It just happened. We were trying to find a restaurant where to eat at on Pape/Danfroth, but we kept walking more East, until it got pretty dry in the food department, but we were saved before rain by Spice Heaven.

Besides the heavenly food, We will always cherish the lovely server who was in that night. I think he was the owner. He was so diligent, sweet, kind and attentive, like no servers before. 

We were hungry for biryani and fish, also ordered naan, which was fresh and nicely crisp. A huge plate of biryani was delivered to our table, which was the only one occupied on a Wednesday evening. Few people stepped in to take their take-away orders. Biryani was good, but a little spicy for me, who is not very good with spicy food. So was the fish. After server noticed we were struggling a bit, he brought yoghurt, which helped to enjoy the food more. Fish was nicely cooked and as the name of the place says, spice heaven, the flavours were great! We enjoyed our visit there a lot, as you do not get the whole restaurant often just for you. We ended up having a nice conversation with the server and he sat down with us and shared some cooking tips and facts about his home region in India. 

We left with an amount of food enough for our lunch tomorrow, full stomachs, peace of mind and an amazing feeling of humanity and kindness. Thank you!
