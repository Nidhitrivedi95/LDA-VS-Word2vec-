JoHDOuZ1BnFi63PgC_zYeQ We have eaten here twice. Friendly, helpful staff patiently explained dishes on menu, brought food promptly, refilled glasses without being called, and checked on our needs. Fish and shrimp stews in Amaravarti sauce were excellent. As was the Paneer Dosa appetizer. Roti was good as well. Highly recommend this restaurant and will likely return regularly. Plenty left over to take home. Carry out containers are substantial and won't leak on the way home. 
As of this writing, 10-25-17, they were still awaiting their liquor license.
