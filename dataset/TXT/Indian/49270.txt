tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA After reading a few reviews on the place I had to try it. I've passed by it for years never paying much attention to it. 

I must agree with past reviewers...the food is good. But, sometimes it's not always just about the food. The service was outstanding. I was greeted at the door with a smile, and when I met my party at the table, the server was right on top of serving water and asking what we would like, if anything else to drink. 

I felt like a giant to our server, and the gentleman was extremely kind, courteous and helpful in explaining the different dishes presented at the buffet. The food was flavorful! 

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good Indian food.
