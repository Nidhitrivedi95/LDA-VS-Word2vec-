Nevada
Origin India Restaurant & Bar
Las Vegas, NV

Throughout the year Origin India Restaurant participates in a number of fundraisers and events. "Origin India has continuously donated gift certificates to its restaurant for all of the events where proceeds benefit the Nevada Restaurant Association Educational Foundation," says owner Raja Majid. There are several such events each year and Origin India donates $100 every time. "The company has also offered their venue, services and food and beverage free of charge for events and meetings for attendees of up to 100," says Majid. Additionally the company's chefs have taken time to attend teacher workshops and do food demos for instructors to take back to their students. Also, Origin India often hosts political fundraisers for candidates that support the local community.
