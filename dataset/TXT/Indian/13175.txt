B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ I like the Bamboo Garden, an odd little restaurant tucked into the strip mall between two Chinese buffets and next to an Indian restaurant that shares the same ownership.  The food is  India-Chinese, which is different-- Chinese food with an Indian take on the cooking and flavors; I really like it.  One of my favorites for lunch; it's never crowded, the decor is nice, and you can try the various things from the buffet and see what you like.
The food is buffet style.
