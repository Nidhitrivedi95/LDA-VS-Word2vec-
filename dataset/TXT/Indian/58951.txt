YtfQQHdcQ_bGl2V0Agxw1A My go to Indian resto in the city. Yes it's expensive but consider what you get.
Dishes with differentiated flavours (unlike a lot of others that all taste like the same base sauce was used for everything).
Really high quality meats and vegetables treated with respect.
The vindaloo is relatively hot (for me) but most others would find it quite hot but the flavour does come through. Do remember this is Indian food and if you eat Asian cuisine it will be hot. Don't like heat? The Golden arches are looking for consumers like you. Please don't try and dumb down the food by whining about mild being too hot.

Finally I discovered a stunning Shiraz. Wakefield is available at the LCBO and has got some great reviews on WIne Align.
