DjlOWc6p2jkit9zMSFa_ew We just enjoyed a five-star meal at this lovely restaurant, served on the garden patio. The menu is well-planned; the dishes are creatively, skillfully and beautifully prepared, complete with delightful amuse bouches. The host is extremely knowledgable and charming. The prices are extremely reasonable for this high calibre cuisine. This is the best East Indian food I have ever had in Toronto. A wonderful discovery!
