-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Pulling up to this place the 1st good indicator, lotsa Indians outside with obvious full & happy bellies. 
The atmosphere could've been any restaurant. Nothing Indian abou it, but that's fine. It was clean & didn't smell like sweaty feet.
The buffet is just a few tems & I tasted them all. Very good! The nan was great & plentiful & the service efficient.  BUT the draw if this place is that it's really inexpensive...$7. I'll keep this place in mind at the end of the month & needing to rob the coin jar.
