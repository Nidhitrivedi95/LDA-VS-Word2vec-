The paneer seems like it was freshly churned - nothing like the excessively chewy varieties I've had elsewhere. It's hard for me to order anything besides the matar paneer - so flavorful and a huge plus that it comes with raita- but others' dishes have been equally amazing. The chana masala is a crowd favorite. Definitely try the poori - delicious fried bread the size of my head that is a perfect accompaniment! Reheats well too.
