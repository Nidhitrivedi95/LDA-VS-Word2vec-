rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ Cafe Delhi is a breath of fresh air in a town that's been overrun by pizza shops (is there an ordinance that requires one on EVERY block???). I stop by weekly for an enjoyable lunch experience. I've tried almost everything on the menu and I haven't found anything that's not to like. I did find the goat dishes to be overly gamey & it is served bone-in, so be prepared to get your fingers yellow. I do enjoy the lamb curry, chicken kurma and the lamb wraps. The only bad points are the soda is usually flat and ice seems to be a commodity. 

If your looking for some tasty Indian cuisine give Cafe Delhi a try.
