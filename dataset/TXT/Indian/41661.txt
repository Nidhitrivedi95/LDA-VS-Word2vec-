Q4VYrJr_UPixyLXSnA4O2g Got the chilli chicken lunch special for $7.95.  It comes with rice, soup and salad.  It was ok...not spicy enough even though I asked for extra spicy it tasted like a mild.  Chilli chicken portion was on the smaller side but had a good crispiness.  Sauce is a bit watery ...maybe I'll order it dry next time?
