Our waiter was very friendly and helpful, and made us feel very comfortable right from the start.  We had Onion Bhajia, Rasam Soup, Channa Masala, Lamb Biriyani, Butter Chicken, Shrimp Coconut Masala, Veg Kurma, and Naan.  For desert, we tried the Rice Pudding, Russ Malai, and Mango Ginger Ice Cream, along with Chai tea.

The only dish that underwhelmed was the Shrimp Coconut Masala.  The shrimp were small and overcooked/chewy.  The favourites were the Channa Masala, Lamb Biriyani, and the Rasam Soup (which only one of us had).  The deserts were amazing, especially the homemade ice cream.  The Butter Chicken was okay, but could have been a bit more tender.

Overall, we really enjoyed our meal, the atmosphere, and the service, and we would return to try more items on the menu.  The whole meal for four people, including four beers, came to about $124, taxes included.  With a good tip ($22), that's about $36.50 per person.  We had a coupon discount, so it was even cheaper.
