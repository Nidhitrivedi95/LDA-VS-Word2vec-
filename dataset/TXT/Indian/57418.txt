The heat in the lamb vindaloo is the kind that doesn't last too long, but it is very intense and flavorful. It came out of the kitchen super hot, and I learned from the last time I ate the dish that the absolute worst thing you can do when eating spicy food is burn your tongue on it while it's hot. So I took my own advice this time, took it slow, get a mild appetizer and some naan to enjoy between the bites, and had a fantastic time. The hostess offered me a cocktail special called an Indian Sunrise that had mango puree and spiced rum and some chili powder in it (I think). It was awesome. I'm so happy I live near this place!
