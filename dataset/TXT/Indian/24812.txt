h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA I always wonder why there are few cars in the parking lot of this restaurant whenever I drive by because this place is pretty good!  They have a menu with great variety, and for those of you unsure about Indian food, no worries.  The menu describes what's in each dish.  The portions are pretty decent as is the price.  The naan is huge, but a little crispier than I'm used to having it back in Chicago.  The mango lassi was also a little less dense than I prefer, but it still tasted awesome and was quite refreshing in this heat.  The owners appear to be kind of mom-and-pop-ish, and they're really nice, too.  I'll probably be back.

Warning: If you make your food spicy, even if you think you can handle spicy, it's gonna be spicier than you think.
