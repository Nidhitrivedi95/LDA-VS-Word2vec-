ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg First time here with 2 of my close friends. Made reservations and was seated immediately. They have the biggest wine selection I've ever  had. Ordered the saag! It was delicious. I forgot to ask for extra spicy and the waiter didn't ask spice level
Either :(  very small space but I loved it. Atmosphere felt like dinner at a friends house! The only con is staff is smaller. It was only 3 waiter working in my area. I wait 20 minutes each time for a glass of wine on 2 different time.
