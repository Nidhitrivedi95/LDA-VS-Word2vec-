t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Restaurant was nicely lit and clean.  The staff was also very nice and helpful.  The food was pretty tasty and dishes ranged from about $8.00 - $12.00 for a generous portion.  However, after 45 minutes upon leaving the restaurant, my stomach was a little queasy.  Not sure if it was the food or something else.  Overall would give this place a 3.5/5
