You can trust this place as it does not take the typical indian AYCE approach. Instead you have options from all over the indian hemisphere with multiple different curry styles- both vegetarian and non.

The best part is the service is great here- as both the servers and owner will create dialogue to keep tabs thru-out the course of your meal- but in the most subtle and non-invasive fashion.

The food is the perfect blend of spices. Really good. 

Avenue road has some gems. This  place is one of them.

Tip: For cost effectiveness look for the dinner for 2 combo's if you are doing delivery..
