PR1LvgAgtxYMIBKVSB-McQ Best Indian food, period.  We drive all the way from Ottawa for a piece of this authentic experience and often bring some of it home to freeze for later.  We've tried the other top rated Indian food restaurant in Montreal, and none even came close.  We've loved every single dish we've tried there, but with our top favourite being the Chili paneer, followed by (not in any particular order) the Palak, Shahi (A bit too sweet, but still delicious), and Mutter paneers, Baingan Bharta (oily, but very flavourful), Veg korma (YUM), Chana Masala, and Daal Makhni.

Oh, and the prices are very reasonable! $7.99-10.99 per curry dish, with most dishes being $7.99. (I speak for the vegetarian curries, I am not sure about meat ones).

If you don't know what to order, try their Thali's which come with 3 different curries, naan and salad.  The Naan is always fresh and piping hot.  Service tends to be quick.  What's not quick is waiting in line and getting a table - it gets jam packed on weekends, with the line sometimes going out the door.

You can bring your own wine here too.

Tip: Order ahead and pick up to avoid the long wait for the table and super crowded/noisy restaurant on the weekends.
