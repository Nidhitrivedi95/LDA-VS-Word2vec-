nKpBO-XDKv_n6n-JR2Z1Jg I came here for lunch and was pleasantly surprised the decor is better than most and food was good we ordered the meat thali which came with chicken briyani butter chicken and chickpea currie it was also served with raita(a yogurt based sauce with fresh herbs and diced carrots and cucumbers) naan and salad the briyani was quite good and better than most Indian restaurants and chickpea curry was incredible that's something I usually don't like but was done incredibly well here the chickpeas were so soft they almost melt in your mouth my dining partner ordered the lamb briyani which I did not try however it looked good and was HUGE portion
