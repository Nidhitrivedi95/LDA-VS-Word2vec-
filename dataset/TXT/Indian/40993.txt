PXS-ptzCqz26yG-mfqUWGA One of the worst ever places. Being in Vegas for a week made me crave for indian and found this small place. Ordered the food  to eat there and my friend and I were sitting in the food court in the meantime. Went back 10 mins later and the guy had packed our food in a to go. I asked him to serve us in plates so we could eat. He gave us plates and said we kept calling ur number and u didn't show up so we packed it. 10 mins really?? He gave me a flimsy disposable plate hard to hold the curry and food. Asked him for a stronger one and he refused. He kept insisting that they don't give plates for to go orders and I kept telling him that I ordered to eat there. Finally on my face he said he won't give me anything and I should leave. All this rudeness and attitude for disposable plates?? Clearly if I wasn't super hungry I would have thrown the whole order on his face. They don't care as 90% ppl visiting them are tourists. What a shame.
