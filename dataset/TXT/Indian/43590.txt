rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ I stopped by again, this time on a Tuesday afternoon. They are closed on Mondays.

The food is wonderful, bold with layer upon layers of flavor.

I had the Lentil Soup with fresh pepper and parsley, a nice complement to the Chicken Chettinad.
Its boneless chicken in a thick black pepper sauce, with coconut & mild spices.
I spiced it up a little... 

The staff asks you to give a rating or 1 to 10 (with ten being the spiciest) when you order, which is genius in my opinion.

The front of house staff is very young, inexperienced and seemed a little bored being there. Please don't hold it against this little gem.

It does not have a liquor license, so its BYOB. There was another couple enjoying a bottle next to me, as the state store is only across the parking lot.

The place is clean and bright and warm and friendly and I wish them the best with this beautiful concept.
