qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA WORST customer service experience of life.

It took about 4 years (or 30 min) to get our drink orders even though we were one of three tables on a Sunday...the server has the worst attitude in history. Gave my friend a broken glass and then rolled his eyes when she requested one that wasn't going to cause her to to have to go to the emergency room. How dare she?!

I had to take off early and they wouldn't let me pay my bill (which was a pitcher of beer and one corona). There was 5 of us and they forced us to have it one on cheque...fair enough but I was paying credit card and didn't know what my portion costed and also had no cash. I was directed to the ATM  since I couldn't pay for my portion on my credit card (great to pay $2 fees which I was happy to remove from this jerks tip..) 

Our server should get fired or quit. 

The good - it's cheap...

The bad - literally everything else.
