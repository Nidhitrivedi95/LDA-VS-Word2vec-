qmcIsZjLpxd0V4RekSozmA I've only been once, but I'll certainly be returning. A smaller, unassuming Indian family restaurant serving South Indian food.

We went off the beaten track and ordered food I'd never seen anywhere else before - battered mashed potato (stunning),  chili Idli (stunning), and lamb Tanjore (very nice). We also had a paneer dosa that was fantastic.

Their home made lemonade was lovely, certainly worth trying.

The food was very fresh, the service was fairly quick considering that the meals were being prepared fresh - we saw the dosa being made (very much like a fresh pizza).

Marked down from 5 because of it being a cash only establishment, leading to some pocket searching between us. They really do need to get card payments sorted out.
