PQTtKaBK_WdvLm-zp4fQ1g This is our first South Indian buffet meal, although we've consumed many of the Northern variety. The food was extremely tasty with wonderful spice levels. The chicken biriyani, chicken tikka masala and vindaloo were especially good. The servers were attentive and quickly removed used plates. Several varieties of chutneys and sauces -- all good. Well maintained facility with excellent cleanliness. Recommended!
