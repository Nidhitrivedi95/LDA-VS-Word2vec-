2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Half of the menu is Vegetarian, and it's all delicious.  Quality and flavour is similar to Queen West's popular Ghandi Roti, so this place is a welcome addition to the Harbourfront 'hood.  Traditional Indian fillings include peas, spinach, paneer, chickpeas, potatoes, eggplant, malai kofta, etc. The roti bake is excellent. Spice levels are on the high side, so stick to mild or medium unless you can reeally  handle the heat.  

Portions are large, and run about $8-9 for the veggie options.
