I can't get over how great this restaurant is, or how great my experience here was. I had the perfect birthday dinner here.

My boyfriend and I came here around 7pm on a Wednesday and there were not that many people in the restaurant. We were EXTREMELY well taken care of by both a waiter and the manager, who repeatedly came over to answer our questions about the menu, refill our water (I drink a LOT of water and my glass was never empty), and asked how our food was or what they could do for us. 

Each menu item is made for you, based on the spice level you request (1-10). The food is DELICIOUS! I am not super familiar with how authentic Indian food is, or if this was authentic or not...but this was amazing. I got the Chicken Curry and the prices were very reasonable for a large amount of food. The garlic naan and white rice that came with the meal was delicious as well. 

It seems like a lot of people come here for takeout, but the inside of the restaurant was really nice. I have literally no complaints and would recommend this restaurant, and I have to many of my friends. 

I will definitely be back for some wonderful Indian food by a staff and manager that legitimately care about their service, customers, and food.
