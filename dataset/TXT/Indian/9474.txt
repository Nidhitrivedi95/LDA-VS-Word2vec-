8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I go here weekly and am never disappointed. Sometimes the service can take longer that I'd expect, but they are always busy -- so it's not like they are taking too long on purpose. If you are vegan you can ask for special preparation of a few dishes, where they won't use ghee. Overall a lovely place that has really added to the awesomeness of downtown Urbana!
