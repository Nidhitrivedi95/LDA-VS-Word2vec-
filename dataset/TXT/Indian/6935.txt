4ritTGFnNxmKnKm-UX3kPQ After a five hour flight, I was in the mood for some good Indian food. After searching for a nearby restaurant, I came across this place on a map and It is certainly a diamond in the rough! It's hidden along a busy road near a shopping center, but the sign is pretty big so you can't miss it. Although the service was a little slower, the restaurant had a really nice homey vibe. I ordered butter chicken and garlic naan. Both were absolutely delicious! The sauce was flavorful and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The naan was garnished with fresh garlic and came out very crispy! Surprisingly a side of rice doesn't come with the meal, but that's really the only downside. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. Well worth it!
