yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug If I could give negative reviews, I would rather do that. It's been an hour since we are sitting here and all We have gotten is Appetizers. Initially when asked they were out of 2 Appetizers that we wanted - Lamb Samosa and Mo-Mos which is one of the main reasons I came here on the first place. They were also out of the Reshmi kabob, rude waitresses, worst service, no apologies, nothing. By the time the food comes, I would have been to 2 other places..do not waste your time and money here. That's what I would suggest.
