BXeXS9EaNN03AptFwElvjA The first thing I noticed about this place was the smell - felt uncomfortable right after walking in. 

Foodwise this place is probably a 3.5 star. Had the Mango Lassi - tasty mango yogurt drink. 
Chicken Masala Roti Wrap - portion was a bit small but nothing to complain given its price. The spice was not really my thing though.

Service could have been better. It was my first there and seemed to me that the staff here knew some of their regulars very well and tended to be very talkative and friendly with them. But they didn't greet me or say anything when I walked in and then had no reaction or smile when I thanked them or anything. Not rude but could definitely be more friendly and welcoming.

Probably not coming back.
