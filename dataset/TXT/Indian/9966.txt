9dhhtQrXQz5Q5VR8Sjjt5A Slow service. There were four tables and we waited a little long before we got our appetizers. Mild Indian food. I don't know much about genuine Indian food but this one is too mild and has buffalo sauce/chicken wings. We took a table d'hote to share. CC combo with chicken and shrimp. The portion is generous. The naan is perfect. The curry is average.
The ambiance is great. 

Worth the money or not? I would like to try their spicy dishes before I jump to conclusions.
