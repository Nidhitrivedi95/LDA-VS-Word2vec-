CRgCV0KUx40uW_j_b0p-MQ Food is always great here. Love their butter chicken and they have the most fluffy naans. Their portions are huge and one curry is usually enough for two people. Their service is great. Their dining is not busy though. Usually when we eat here, me and my husband are the only one eating in the restaurant.
