UAXz2KC1aXpxzV-MLdXbmQ My wife and I have tried many Indian restaurants in the city and this is still our favourite. We have had to wait longer than we would have liked for our food on a few occasions but when it arrived the wait is always forgotten because the food is so good! The Fish Biryani is insanely good and is our favourite. It's more expensive than some other Indian spots we visit but the Decor/Service is also more upscale.
