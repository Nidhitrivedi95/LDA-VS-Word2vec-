VuW81oFt6-X9-vMYFYJY6Q The meat here is not halal. Too bad because it looks like they have a lot of tasty dishes on the menu. Owner should consider making it halal.

I had the Mattar Paneer. It was really good. You get a big portion.

I gave three stars instead of 4 or 5 because their prices are too high.  Its $3.49 for ONE garlic naan?  Thats ridiculous. And the amount of naan and taste does not justify the price. 

Because of the cost of food here, I won't be returning unless I go and buy my garlic naan from another shop. But who is gonna do that?
