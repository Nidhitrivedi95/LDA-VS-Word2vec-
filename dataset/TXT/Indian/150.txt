-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g By far the best Indian buffet around. 
The only place I've tried where the "spicy" actually has some kick. The Chicken Vindaloo was wonderful. 

Plenty of vegetarian options and they are also tastier than average buffet offerings. 

This place is really under appreciated... It should have been packed but before Noon on a Sunday very few were there. 

Highly recommend if you like Indian cuisine.  Don't overlook this great tasting food!

Update:  our third or fourth time here, and I seem to appreciate it more each time. 

Honestly people, if you like Indian food, don't miss Nandinis!
