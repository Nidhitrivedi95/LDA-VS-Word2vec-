auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ After my appointment, I was hungry and decided to give this place a try.  They had a big sign out front that said "Best of Vegas 2013."  I was excited to try it.  They were only serving buffet bar, so that's what I got.  My waiter was not very friendly.  He did not look happy to be there.  The buffet bar had about 10 different items plus rice and a vegetable samosa.  I was a bit disappointed with the selection.  I tried a little of everything.  Nothing really stood out.  It was all just ok.  The goat curry was mostly bones and gristle.  Ugh.  If this is the best Indian food that Vegas has to offer, I feel sorry for this town.
