HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A Upscale, dim lighting, candles -- you know the drill.  I'm still making my way through all the various South Asian venues, but this one has had me come 3 times already.  Why?  Because I can get them to make it spicy... and not just spicy hot!

There are more things to curry pastes than chili, and, relative to the other experiences I've had in Cleveland, they keep their food pretty zesty.

I'm a sucker for a good Saag Paneer, and their Paneer is quite delicate and fresh, at least the 3 times I've been.

I miss having indian fast food around my pad, but I'm here in Cleveland now, and must make do with what's here.  Saffron Patch has become my go to for a curry fix.

More Mutter Paneer please!

Make it 7 out of 5 Spicy!
