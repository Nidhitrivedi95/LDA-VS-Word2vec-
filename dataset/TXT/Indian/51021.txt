UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Cozy, tasty, inexpensive. Nice place. You will have to know basically all the food that is there. You don't know what you are eating. Everything is either labeled "VEG" or "NON-VEG" . This is NOT the place for folks who don't like spicy food. If you like spicy food this is the place for you. Otherwise, everything was amazing. If you eat there, have the non-veg chicken. It is reddish and REALLY good. There is also the veg green sauce you don't want to miss out on. And the non-veg red sauce with bits of chicken inside that is the BEST food ever. The Naan there is really good! It will calm down your mouth if it is too spicy. Eat a lot of the Naan if you go there but don't like spicy food. This place is amazing and I highly recommend it.
