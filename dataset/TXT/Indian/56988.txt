xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw Came here with a co-worker, trying something new for lunch. Food was delish, but we weren't excited about the price. I spent over $10 on the ultimate frybread (green chili beef, beans, sour cream, and lettuce) and a drink. His total was over $6 for a bean and cheese frybread (and he was still hungry when we left). Maybe we're just cheap, but ouch!
Small space, jam packed, and obviously a popular spot (with a super small parking lot)!Someone that looks like your Grandma making the frybread in the back, which was light and perfectly cooked. Staff was friendly and on top of things and our orders came out quickly. 
Free refills on the iced tea (tropical), but charge for refills on the soda. 
We'd probably come in more often if it were cheaper.
