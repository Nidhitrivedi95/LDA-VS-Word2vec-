DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Came in due to being on this side of town, the restaurant is very very nice and I had pretty high hopes to try some authentic Indian food with tons of flavor but it wasn't the case. The service and the environment were perfect and pleasant, the food itself had almost no flavor at all, tasted like the the stuff you get from the store. It all looked great but disappointingly the chicken korma and vindaloo I had tasted like nothing. If you're looking for real AUTHENTIC Indian food go to Mount Everest, it's all family owned and the flavors there are real Indian flavors and pack the spice punch you're expecting.
