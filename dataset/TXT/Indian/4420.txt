1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g Family owned and talented owner/Cheif. The Nepalis food is beautiful. you get the feeling you are eating food made at grandmas house. (if she was from Nepal) The Resturaunt is on the second story in a busy street across from park in North side. the door is... well kinda crazy. but don't let it stop you... let it add charm... then cling the stark steep stair well... will just add to your adventure. Upstairs its super roomy and the owner actually built the booths! he is a jack-of all trades. Do also try his homemade hot sauce. He cooks in Gee (refined butter) which is traditional. For me this means I can eat very little on the menu... but I often get his lo-mein with extra brocili and tons of hot sauce (seems masala based). Word from my friends is his "Chinese food" is zesty and special too.
