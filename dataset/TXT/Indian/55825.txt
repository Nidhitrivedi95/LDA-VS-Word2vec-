xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Wow! I'm not usually one to give a restaurant 5 stars after trying it only once, but this place totally deserves it! 

We went here with a couple of friends who are regulars and their baby. The staff was so excited to meet their new edition and all came over to say hi and get some facetime with cutie. 

We ordered some appetizers to share which included the vegetable pakora and the idly manchurian. Both of these were delicious. I really liked the idly manchurian which had a nice kick and texture. 

For my entree I ordered the paneer tikka masala and an order of poori. This was the best tikka masala sauce I have ever had. I was enjoying eating just that over rice, even though there was plenty of paneer in the sauce. The poori was much different than any other poori i have ever had, but it was also delicious! 

I can't wait to go back, but knowing how good that sauce is I am probably already roped into ordering it again!
