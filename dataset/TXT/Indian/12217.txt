auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ Tried this one out the other night for dinner. Everything was good. Service was good, food was good. I would say that some of the dishes would rate a 4, and some are 3.  The Tikki Masala was a 3 for sure as I have had better.  It was a bit too creamy and lacked on the flavor side.  The chicken was a 3 as well.  The Naan was a 4 as well as the Aloo Ghobi (vegi dish).  Overall, I would come back for the lunch buffet, but will venture out for dinner.
