ktf_QNZaJ1IvnXrncZCQqw Chicken biryani was tasteless and the chicken pieces dry and all bone. I thought the name of the restaurant would suggest they specialize in biryani but that is not the case at all! Not authentic and tasted very blend. My friend got a vegetarian plate and the amount was so minuscule, it didn't even fill up the container. If you are in the area its worth it go walk a little further on Dundas to Dalhousie to Curry Kitchen. There biryani is much much better and twice the size. Service was not great either.

Might as well have gotten plain rice with bones on the side.
