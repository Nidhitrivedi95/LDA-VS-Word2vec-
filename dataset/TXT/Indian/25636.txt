hubbaEcYPYEZu5Ziz6i0lw Terrible!! First attempt at this place I walked in stood around for 10 minutes no one came out to greet me or even acknowledge me. Second attempt I ordered take away, food was ready In a timely manner, Only good thing. Food was so bland I had a spicy level of 7 medium hot, there was no kick nor flavor. Then my mix grill had a foul odor. Couldn't even finish my meal ended up tossing it.
