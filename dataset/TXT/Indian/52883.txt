On a snowy feb night past nine I had the mutton masala...the flavor, spice level and tenderness of the meat swept me off my feet. I also had chaat and a fried donut. Both delicious. 

My boyfriend who loves Indian food and is vegetarian loved his paneer. It was actually spicey enough for his standards which is hard to do!

The service may have been a bit lackluster but the restaurant was clean and food was lovely.
