Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ Not too impressed with Hakka No.1 

Pretty expensive for the quantity they gave 

we ordered Veggie Hakka Noodles with less oil 
chili Chicken with gravy and Vegetable Pakoras

Hakka Noodles - super oily but tasted decent 

Chili Chicken had a weird aftertaste 

Veggie Pakoras were actually really good though
