TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw Tandoori chicken here is awesome. I've been several times but it's been 2-3 months so when I went back I was suprised to see they changed ownership. We were greeted by a sweet lady who took our owner. After our food was delivered quickly, she serenaded our table and 2 others karaoke style. Gurl can sang! Nice, cute touch so I'll definitely come back. The buffet here is a really good deal so you can try a little bit of everything. I d pay a few bucks more if they offered my favorite here - lamb vindaloo!
