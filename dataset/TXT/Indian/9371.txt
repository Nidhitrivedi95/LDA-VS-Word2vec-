8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg I am definitely a fan of the food at Sitara. The quality of the food is good, and the flavors are spot on. I've done both eating in and take out, and I would suggest doing take out if you're short on time because the service can be a bit slow. I personally feel like the entrees could be just a little bit bigger, and I wish they would add onion chutney to their chutney offerings.
