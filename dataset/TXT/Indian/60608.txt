zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q I love this place. My go-to is the paneer tikka masala, which is more aromatic and tomato-y than the sweet stuff you get from frozen dinners or at Indian places. Also, I love eating vegetarian as much as possible. When I'm craving the good stuff and am willing to sacrifice innocent animals for the purpose, I go for the goat biryani. Guessing by how frequently the place is packed with people, these dishes are perfectly representative. I also recommend the hummus appetizer if you're looking for some tasty to go with your numnum.

The big warning to take in if you go to this place is that if you aren't a leftovers person or won't be able to pack leftovers, you should really plan on sharing a meal. I tend to go here and eat until it hurts and still have enough for lunch the next day. I like to go and split an appetizer and plate with a friend, and I always leave more than full.

Last note, the service here is wonderful. The owners run the shop themselves and are very friendly and appreciative of your business. They get busy, so it might take a moment or a friendly ask, but the staff is so responsive. If you love experiencing the world's cuisines and have some time in Phoenix, I would highly recommend Khyber Halal.
