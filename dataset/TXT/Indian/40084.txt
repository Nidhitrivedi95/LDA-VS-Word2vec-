pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Up on McUgly Road not far from the mall is some very good Indian food and what is arguably the largest Indian buffet in Pittsburgh. I was very happy the first time I went here, and overate, which is just too easy to do. I have only been here for the lunch buffet, as I don't live close by and it's not convenient for me to, say, stop by for dinner some evening. I would have given The Taj 5 stars, but for my one complaint, which is that the food is high in fat and very rich, even for Indian food. Of course, this is what makes it taste so good, but at times they go too far. Other than that, the food is well prepared with obvious talent and care, and I do crave it between visits.
