VqJXm1NjJFYTNKtNp-h_DA I've been to this place a few times and I have yet to be disappointed.  

At Drupati's they offer a wide variety of everything you can think of.  I usually get some curry chicken, buss up shut (paratha roti), aloo pie's, and doubles.  Now of course this isn't all for myself, it's meant to be shared.  But when I do share it, it get's thumbs up across the board.  The chicken is moist and flavorful.  The curry is nice and has a little kick to it.  Their doubles are great and aloo pie is off the charts as well.  They also make some of the best buss up shut I have ever tried.

It's tough to find top quality West Indian Roti shops, but Drupati really shows you the heart of Trinidad when eating at this place.
