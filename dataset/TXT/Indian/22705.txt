GR3AESDGAXnhz1IHpSu0Cw I'm updating this because the owner called me. I'm not sure how he got my number ?!! Yelp? I gave him an extra  for customer service.
Anyways, I like that he cares enough to call and is concerned with my less than average rating.
He informed me he is still the original owner 15 years it's been. And of course the menu has changed but the navrattran korma which would also be the butter chicken that I had years ago (which was the BEST) is no longer.
Disappointing yes..but the fixed price menu I keep reading about might be worth checking out.it is a great deal for $25 as I remember the restaurant had a higher price point but then I got better quality for it! Lol
I feel I should try it again and try a few more dishes.  And give them another chance
