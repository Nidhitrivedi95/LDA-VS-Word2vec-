xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w One of my favorite places to eat!  The food is always fantastic, I've tried the majority of entrees on the menu.  Wait staff is attentive and efficient, keeping your beverage glass full & checking in to see if there are any extra needs.  Only complaints are: the spice level I request is usually very different from what I receive (I get milder when I requested spicy) & the place could use a good scrubbing.  But, the food is consistently wonderful, spicy or not - Enjoy!
