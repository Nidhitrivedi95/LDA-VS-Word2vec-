CcuKo38SwW54TDlMWAMi7A I go here when I don't go to the Square for the other Indian places. Always my favorites are the chicken tikka masala and carrot halwa. The mango ice cream is always good. The chutneys are varied but mango chutney is extra. The naan could be better. The only other negative is the restroom. Its unpleasant.
