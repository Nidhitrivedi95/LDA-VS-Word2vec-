RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w This place used to be absolutely amazing. The food was some of the best food I've had, and definitely the best Pakistani food. However, this was BEFORE, but since 2014 they seem to have changed owners. The food is terrible, they serve less of it, and the prices are more expensive. It's disappointing because this place used to be awesome. If you've gone here before 2014, don't come again as it's NOT the same delicious place that once was.
