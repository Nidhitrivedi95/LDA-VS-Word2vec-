7xfeQhen2wLnvFuQNvmTAg I have been searching for a Madras Chicken as good as a great family Indian restaurant I had grown to love when I lived in D.C. The search is over. The spice is perfect. The mild heat tantalizing. A perfect blend. I ordered the Madras, a Chicken Hot and Sour Soup and a Garlic Naan. A sprinkling of stardust must be in the Chef's spice cabinet.
