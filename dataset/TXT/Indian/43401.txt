RNbGxVLDu6SBQXkq-7MBow I ordered a lamb biryani and was awful. It was extremely salty that no other flavors can come through. For a place to be named "biryani king" -- one would assume that they serve decent biryani -- no. not at all. far from it. And for a place to offer only takeout they forgot to put cutlery or napkins in my order.
