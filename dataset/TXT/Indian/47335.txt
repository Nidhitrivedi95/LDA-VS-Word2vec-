TBzgzTFSa7pJXiLD7emYaQ This is one of those times where your mom's lessons about not judging a book by its cover reigns true. A little restaurant in a totally divey strip mall (seriously, it's always on the news), but the food is downright amazing. Try the crispy beef it's unbelievable. The hakka fried noodles were also great, not spicy enough but delicious flavors. A good array of appetizers and different dishes. I've had take out multiple times and it's always been fresh, reasonably priced and fully eaten.
