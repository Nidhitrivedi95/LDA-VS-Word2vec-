c65l1HepL-5Zqh_2fJ7ezw Just ordered the butter chicken roti for takeout. With a $2 tip, i spent about $14- not bad. 
The roti is big and comes in a piping hot container- not complaining, at least its fresh. The roti is so big that I could only eat half of it- very generous portions! 
I was disappointed that cutlery was not offered, however, a plastic fork would have likely melted in this heat. 
I should have asked for spicy, because the medium was kinda plain. The last time I asked an Indian place for "spicy" I was breathing fire for hours, so wasn't feeling brave enough to test these guys today :p
Overall it was good. Very fresh. Lots of filling. Not dry at all. 
Food was ready in 15 minutes, as they had said it would be. 
The gentleman in the store was friendly and polite.
Will definitely be coming back to try out some of the other menu items.
The price for the amount of food is impressive... this is quite possibly the biggest roti I have ever had in my life!
