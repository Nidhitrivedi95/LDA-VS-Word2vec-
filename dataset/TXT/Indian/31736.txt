kXXeD5QOg3GKyyl9QWMifg Its name is modest and its exterior decor is cheesy -- covered in mediocre photos of breakfast food. I walked by this place so many times and never considered walking in.  But one lucky morning my boyfriend recommended we try it out. And Jesus Christ, this made it to my list of Top 5 Greatest Sunday Mornings Everrrrrrr.

I have never felt so happy in a restaurant. All the walls were pulled up and a cool breeze was sweeping through, shooing away my hangover. The sun was shining, the servers were smiling and people were chatting away. Everything was so colourful and bright -- just like a breakfast place should be. God, I love breakfast so much! 

It's usually very busy here on Sunday mornings so the service is slow. In fact, one of us always  walks to the cash register and orders through the person on cash, rather than waiting for a server to take our order. Sometimes it takes a while to get our coffees -- other times it's quick. There's one adorable server who always brings us our food. I wish I knew her name because she is literally the cutest person in the world and has this sincere smile that just makes you so happy and excited to eat breakfast!!!

My boyfriend and I always split an order of French Toast. The French Toast here is divine and they give you maple syrup on the side. If you're really hungry, then order the "I Can't Talk/I'm Eating" special. I'm not sure if that's what it's called, but it's something along those lines. It comes with eggs, meat, a salad and potatoes. I love ordering the Mix Grilled with over-easy eggs. It comes with toast, bacon, sausage, salad and potatoes. 

So far, this is the cheapest breakfast joint I've been to in Kensington Market.
