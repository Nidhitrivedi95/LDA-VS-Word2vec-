YNut5B1o3FDtcdzwf9F_bw Ordered a plain Naan and chicken curry, order should have been under $8 and somehow owner charged &12.88 and after opening the meal(to-go) here is how the naan looks like - broken pieces! Also chicken curry I ordered was made with egg curry masala.

I hate to say this but they won't be here for too long.
