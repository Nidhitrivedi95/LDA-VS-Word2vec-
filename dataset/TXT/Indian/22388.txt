As expected food court food prices will be elevated

Food: 4/5
-at $12.99 you get a large naan, generous rice and cubes of chicken tikka masala
-the masala was a bit closer to a watery consistency than a creamy consistency
-wish there was a bit more protein for the price point
-entire meal was closer to $15 after tax and a drink. I'm thinking a buffet may have been a better choice
-food is made to order so expect a wait
