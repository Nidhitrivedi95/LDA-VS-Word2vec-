tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA India Oven has a fantastic buffet.  There is a vegetarian section, a non-vegetarian section, a dessert section and a drink section.  The food is very delicious and you will likely overeat when you come here.  But you will walk away full and satisfied and thinking about when you can come back.  I particularly liked the saag.

One small piece of advice to the owners . . . don't take our plates away while there is still food on them.  This happened several times during a one-hour meal.  We really felt that you were rushing us out.  Not cool.
