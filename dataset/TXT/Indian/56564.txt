This a TRUE taste of India!  The food is as fresh as it gets SO you will have to wait a few minutes. (There is a wonderful Indian store a few doors down you can visit while you wait).  You can also call ahead.  Either way, it is absolutely worth the wait.  I ordered the Chicken Korma and it was DECADENT!  The spices and flavor were fresh, full and numerous. 

If you do decide to eat there, which you can, there are about 6-8 tables if you want a place to sit down and enjoy their flavorful, authentic food but most people take it home/work.  

The owner was an absolute gentleman.  When he told us we would have to wait a few minutes for our dishes he looked worried because I could tell he took pride in pleasing the customer, (Customers FIRST).  It was NOT an issue because with the Indian store a few doors down and we told him we would see him in a "30 min".  On our arrival back he was ready for us and said, "We're bagging it right now but I have something for you." He came up to us with a small tray of what he called "Indian French Fries" (not on the menu...YET) and let us try some of them and they were a tasty little treat.  He truly LOVES what he does and even told us, "This isn't just a business but this is our passion." AMAZING. 

We will DEFINITELY be back!  Looking forward to it!
