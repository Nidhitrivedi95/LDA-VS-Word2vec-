g9gAuOEXBbWnLlu2uOftwA Hi,

Today we went this restaurant and ordered veg and chicken puff and some sweets. It's totally old food, not able to eat anything. Not worth for the money. I will never visit this place again.

Dear Chat and Pasteries,

You guys provided wonderful food , after getting familiar your food quality totally waste. Please consider the money what u are getting and provide quality food.
