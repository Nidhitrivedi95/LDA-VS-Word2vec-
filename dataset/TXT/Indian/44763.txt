S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA A few people from my office regularly patronize this location for lunch, so today I came in to give it a shot. I would have NEVER known this place existed if I didn't work near by because it's hidden in a really run down looking plaza just next to Morton's, but inside it has an awesome hip ambiance, low lighting and swanky Indian music!! I left full and happy! I will be back again for the lunch buffet. I can't handle a lot of heat in my food and to me, this was PERFECT, not too spicy and not bland either, lot's of flavor. I LOVED the fresh baked naan bread (I got plain). I have been to another Indian place in the area that gets higher stars on Yelp and I personally like this place way better! During my visit I noticed a lot of Indian patrons eating as well, I take that as a good sign. I totally recommend.
