-yz0XHYoG1WOUm78K0vktQ So I used to go here for weekend breakfast.

I have eaten their Chana Bhatura, Pao bhaji, Thaali, Chai, Pakoras, Tikkas etc.

Every time I go, their servers have a very disappointing look on their faces. They don't appear friendly and professional.

One time (my last time) I asked for server to take my order for Chai, he told me that he would return in a minute to take my order and then he never came back.

I wanted 15 min. looking around in a hope to see him and order for some more food. But they lost the business.

Since then, I haven't gone to this place again.

Pros: Tasty food!! No doubts
Cons: Pathetic service. No care for customer

Would I recommend this place? No Way!!
