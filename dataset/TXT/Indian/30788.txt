KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I've been to Passage to India a few times at this point, and I have to say that I've been amazed by how consistent the quality of their food is.

Consistent in the fact that it's terrible, that is.

Passage to India is a pretty standard Indian buffet, largely in the fact that it's awful, but different tasting enough from most 'American' fare that most of this venue's patrons are going to be none the wiser. 

The food served in the buffet is often bland, stale, and the ingredients are generally third-rate. The service is about as bad as the food, and every waiter I've encountered at this place is either unhelpful or unfriendly. In short, this place is to Indian food what Taco Bell is to Mexican food. Take your $12 elsewhere and you'll probably be guaranteed a superior culinary experience.
