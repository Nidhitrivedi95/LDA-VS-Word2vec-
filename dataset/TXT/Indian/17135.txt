DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Great food with great price with awesome atmosphere, especially when you are away from your native home INDIA and you are seeking for some really great indian food then it's one of the best place in US. I personally went to dozens of Indian restaurant in different state but I like the food of this restaurant the most. 

Their kadaai paneer is best. We also tried samosa and paneer chilly in starter and they are fabulous. They also have bar and if you are mojito lover then you should try it over here. It was great.

So if you are hungry and want some Indian food and this restaurant is 2 hour far from you then also you should go for it, because its worth it.
