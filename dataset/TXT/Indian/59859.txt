ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I must have ordered on an off night. Must admit my bar is high when it comes to Indian food, having spent time there. My order was placed through a delivery service. They called to tell me the desert I ordered was unavailable. This was early in the evening. Also ordered were vegetable pakoras and vegetable samosas. I was craving curry and a little heat. I got none. This food was bland and flavorless. Very disappointing, probably will look elsewhere.
