The daal was ok, there are to many big pieces of onion and green peppers in there. The daal wasn't so cooked I was eating some of the daal that wasn't boiled perfectly. The paneer is just like so much cream and not a lot of flavor. It needs more flavor and spice. I would maybe try it again but for now I'm going to have to explore other place. The garlic naan wasn't that cooked either, and they were undercooked pieces in there without garlic on there.  The onions and the chilies were not fresh. The onions were defiantly really old also like the chilies. I don't know if I would go back unless the  food changes. It is a pricy place to eat also, 15 dollars an entree that is kinda on the high side.
