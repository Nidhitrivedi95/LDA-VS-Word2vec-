RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Absolutely, hands down, the best Indian food in Charlotte. Love the waiters, they know us by name. The beer selection is wonderful. Our favourite waiter even lets us order stuff that's not on the menu. We love Indian and know a lot of their dishes that sometimes you can't find in America. Everything about this place is great. Atmosphere, bar, food, service... Just love it! Now I'm craving it...
