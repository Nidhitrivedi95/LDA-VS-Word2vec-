4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Not so cooked chicken,  chicken malai was raw . Food quality was mediocre . 
When I ordered for my coffee after buffet coffee machine server told me it's broken and when I asked for tea she said its 1040 it should be ordered before 1030 seriously ! ( even when u say ur coffee machine is broken ) as far my knowledge goes their Buffett is open till 1030 how do u expect anybody to take Buffett and finish coffee at same time .
Not recommended at all .
