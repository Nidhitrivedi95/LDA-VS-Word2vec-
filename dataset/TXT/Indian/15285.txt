CobgKbm4uQrz5TINSFXQbQ This place has dope dosas! They are so crispy, even though the norm seems to favour the soggy dosas in these parts. Definitely recommend the paper masala dosa (ask for the masala aka potatoes on the side if you want the crispness to last) and a mango lassi to go with it. Super affordable, yummy and filling.
