5XqlvHsByE4GFgTZtZDXgQ Has vegan/veg options. My favorite place in town. A mom and pop shop with delicious hearty food, and great prices to match. (Authentic food!) Careful of overestimating your spicy level, and for the love of god try the naan and the desserts (not vegan unfortunately). This little place is a favorite of students and local business folks, you might catch people on their laptops there as there is wifi. The lunch special is most people's favorite, and the food is fresh / made that day. If you go in later in the evening there will be a short ten minute wait for your food (depending on how busy it is) and it is WORTH IT. If you're choosing between this and a sit down fancy Indian restaurant near by, I'd tell you to choose this.
