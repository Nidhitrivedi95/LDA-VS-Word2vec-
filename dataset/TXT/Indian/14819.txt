cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA My friend and I jumped into this restaurant by chance on a rainy Tuesday afternoon. It turned out they were taking part in Summerlicious so we only saw the set menu. There was only one nervous-looking young man serving everyone (just a couple of tables) but he seemed to manage ok. The chopped up samosa appetizer was good, the butter chicken was delicious the mutton was good too, I just had trouble eating it because it was so hot (even with a side of a yogurt sauce that I requested and then some sugar - apparently some Indian people eat their spicy dishes with sugar - who knew!) but the naan was warm and the mango cheesecake seemed quite fresh. The chair I was in was really rickety so I switched it with another one and that solved that problem. The place is smallish but modern and has good sized tables that are spaced out nicely. The floor was kinda covered in food bits, I don't know if they were short staffed that day or if there was a really messy bunch of people sitting there, but the rest of the restaurant, including the washrooms, was clean so I'd be confident eating there again.
