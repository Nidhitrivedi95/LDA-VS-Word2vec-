3K9u2FpHG9b7tWogqyEyWQ I've never had home made Indian Food but in my mind this is what it taste like. I've had Indian in London where it is very popular and it's supposed to be good but this beats anything I've ever had. The chicken dum biryani and the chicken Tikka masala was delicious and so the was garlic naan. I read reviews that they gave you complimentary naan or dosa and they didn't while we were in so maybe it was because we were there for dinner. Other than that this was a very delicious meal
