ye0-f9tgMC2UFyraGcJWLQ First off I think that everyone reading this needs to go show them some love!  There were only two sets of diners during lunch the day we were there.  I'm not saying it's perfect but it was quite good.  We had a groupon which made it a great deal.  The prices were good for the groupon but otherwise a bit steep.

The service was excellent and my coconut curry chicken was very good.  They charge you for rice, which is a bummer.....but the rice was very flavorful by itself.  Portions are adequate and mine was extremely tasty.  

My companion was not as impressed with her food.  She got a vegan dish which had to be remade due to chicken broth being used (the server caught it and had it remade.)  However, she asked for it to be 8/10 on the spice scale and I could eat it (and I'm a wuss!)  My dish was supposedly a 5/10 and I was fine with it.  So I don't understand their scale for hotness.

Overall it was a good lunch.  Just not sure if it was good enough to go back for!
