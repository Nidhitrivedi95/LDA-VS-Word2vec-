hA5XQUJBdAb72yHCponG2g Affordable pricing and good taste. Aimed at capturing the student customer segment. Quantity is good enough too. A roti comes accompanied with most main dishes, leaving no stomach unhappy. They do home delivery for the nearby areas too (min order of $20)

Bottom line: Worth the price tag and good flavour/taste
