Stopped in on a freakishly sunny weekday afternoon in October and sat on the patio.  There were probably only 4 other full tables at the restaurant since it was around 3pm. This is definitely a great place to enjoy when the sun is out because the patio is quite large.  

Orded a round of Mango Daquiri's and split the Grilled Masala Prawns, the Grilled Masala Squid, and an order of naan.  Service was prompt - my drink came out in about 5 minutes, food about 10 minutes after that.  Drink was delicious and fruity. Food was flavourful, with a good mix of spices and the seafood tasted fresh.  Both dishes were served on a bed of greens with grilled vegetables, which were also great.  There was not a morsel left on either plate when we were done!  Naan was also good, and came out piping hot.  

Including tax and tip our food and drinks came to $20 per person, which was totally reasonable given the quality. I will be back the next tim I'm in the area.
