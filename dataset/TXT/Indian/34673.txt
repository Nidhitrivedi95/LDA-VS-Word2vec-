Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Yeah, I went 5 stars. Why? Because the staff was great when I showed up and was the first one in for the lunch buffet. Fresh naan delivered to the table? Yes, please.
Then, the place started filling up. Next reason: I was the sole Anglo there, everyone else seemed to be from the sub-continent or at least know their way around a tandoor. The long buffet had a variety of great dishes, veggie and carnivore. It could have been sliced up more for my taste, but that's why we hit the chutneys.
It's a little pricey since I don't wallow away from the trough overstuffed and miserable but I'll be back. Great place.
Look inside the crazy Hawaiian-themed outdoor mall/whatever it is.
Beautiful place, clean, lovely, large, comfortable.
