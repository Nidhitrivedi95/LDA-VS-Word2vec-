Yoc9_4sv6AT1AIohPPiGbA It serves pretty decent traditional South Indian dosas and idlis. They come with the sambar and two chutneys - green and red, both good. I've tried several types of dosas and all are worth trying. It also has $5-any-dosa offer going on most of the time which makes it cheaper and preferable than other South Indian restos. The dosas are more filling than idlis at the same price. The ambience is ok but the dosas are totally worth a visit. It also offers a North Indian Thali which is pretty delicious and value for money. But its made in the restaurant adjacent to it "Delhi Palace". Its better to order the Thali from Delhi Palace since you can customize it and take advantage of ASU student discount.
