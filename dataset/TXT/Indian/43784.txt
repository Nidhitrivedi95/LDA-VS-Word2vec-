RTmIbq33chUSa-etGiF8Lg Now I don't have much of a history with Indian restaurants, but what little I do has not been very good. So when coworkers suggested "Indian" tonight, I was outwardly on board but internally a little skeptical. After having Bombay Grill--well, my attitude's all different.

Nothing special about the decor; it was all about the food! For starters, papads (fried chips made from lentils) and samosas, complimented with green chili and plum sauce. As an entree, I had the "Lamb Aloo Ginger Curry"--sticky rice came with it. Ordered some naan, which held it all together really well. Wash it all down with a Kingfisher lager. Seriously, purrrrrrfect.

I walked in unsure, feeling a little off. I left Bombay Grill totally excited about Indian food. Yeah!
