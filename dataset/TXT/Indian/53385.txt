VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg First visit today and I was very pleased! First impression, the decor was warm and inviting, and the aromas in the room really got my stomach rumbling. Ordered the lamb biryani, chicken Tikka Masala and garlic naan. Everything was SO flavorful and aromatic. Tender meats and delicious everything. Menu was a bit overwhelming for a first-timer, but great descriptions for everything so I have an idea of what to order next time. Wish there was a location in central phoenix/downtown! Love Tandoori Times!
