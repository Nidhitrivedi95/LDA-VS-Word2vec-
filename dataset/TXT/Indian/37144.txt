o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I picked up carry out on a Sunday afternoon. I was craving Indian food Saturday night and found this place on Yelp. It was the closest Indian restaurant to my house and had good reviews. I was very happy I found them.
The staff was very friendly, but I was there for take out and was not waited on. But she seemed attentive to the other seated customers.
I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Hakka, Garlic Naan, Mango Lassi, and the onion and ratta "condiments?"
I thought the food was excellent. I ordered medium hot, but next time will go for hot. I got the eye sweats but not to the levels I seek.
The chicken was moist and the Tikka as tasty.Just a little light on the seasonings compared to what I would have made at home. Bottom line is that I really liked the food and will be back.
