XGMI18dOgrOo_r7Wz54Xnw My experience of this place wasn't quite a bad as that of the previous reviewer's, but it definitely wasn't the culinary experience I had hoped for when the flyer came through my door a few months ago.  Myself and some mates decided to come here one evening for a curry and the food was pretty disappointing.  To their credit, the service was friendly and the food didn't take long at all to arrive and the place was clean.
From the menu they seem to serve just about everything with spinach for some reason! There's nothing wrong with this unless - of course - if you don't like spinach.  The starters seemed pretty pricey, some of them costing over £6, so we went just went straight for a main.  I ordered the balti chicken palak which, naturally, had spinach and herbs and a plain naan.  The chicken was good quality and the naan was nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  The sauce let the whole side down, however.  The spinach tasted like it was waterlogged or something and it was like chewing through mushy green straw.  Having said this, the flavouring of the sauce was actually pretty good.
Himalaya is actually quite a good restaurant, it just needs a few tweaks to its sauces and a bit less watery spinach.
