RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I have been going to this restaurant for last 11 yrs, and it is still the best Pakistani restaurant in town.

Order these items and you'll never be disappointed:

Haleem (crushed lentil and beef stew)
Nihari (cow bone marrow stew)
Lamb biryani
Garlic naan
Falooda ( drink with chia seeds noodles and icecream)
Pistachio Kulfi ( pistachio gelato on a stick)

Service here is friendly and food here is tasty and greasy!!
