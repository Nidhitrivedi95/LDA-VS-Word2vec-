zKSKmkBxfrltJau_4s1ZHA The food was alright although the menu had very limited options. We were here on a weeknight, so it was totally deserted.
We ordered a Dahi papdi chat, Paneer makhni, Chapatis and a Mango lassi. Dahi papdi chat was terrible, it was literally some papdi's floating in dahi. Rest of the food was good although the presentation and the quantity could have been much better.
