sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ There really isn't much to say about this as I'm sure by now you've read a million great reviews about it already. So I'll tell you now. Believe the hype. I've been here many times, and thought I should finally write a review ha.

Portions are meant for two.

Price is reasonable.

They don't hold back when it comes to roti stuffing.

Very limited seating.

Personally, I love beef/goat in roti. I just think it absorbs the seasonings and whatnot a lot better and the way the meat breaks down is just perfect. I preferred the goat roti over chicken. But both were really good. Mild-medium was just right for me.

My ONLY concern was when I came back another time and the roti had shrunk and was oversalted. But that was on a bad day and I forgive them.
