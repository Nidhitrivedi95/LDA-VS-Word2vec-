a3nywjjHRweFT-4rOap12g We ordered a variety of dishes and all of them except the bhel were mediocre. The service was good. The makhani dal didn't have much cream in it. It was a simple lentil dal without any cream and other beans. The palak in the palak paneer was not cooked thoroughly. The pakoras were very hard and had extra amounts of baking soda in it.  I wish it was a bit more appetizing.
