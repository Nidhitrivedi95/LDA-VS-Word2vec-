0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ We are from Etobicoke but goes to Mississauga for bubbletea next door from chili chicken. Randomly one day took takeout then came back tonight for dinner.

Two dishes w tax was 22$. It is super cheap. Definitely not 2 $$ but more like 1 $ for price. 

We got the general tao chicken and hakka chow mein. Best general tao chicken my husband has ever had. The chow mein w chicken and shrimp was good too. (The gravy beef dish we got last time wasnt good. I like their dry dishes way better!)

Pleasantly surprised how good the food was and it was so cheap. Last night we ate at an Italian restaurant called Cellar Door and it was 80$ for half the food. 

We had to take home a doggie bag because the portion was ridiculous.

I guess I am used to the shitty service and dirty washrooms of downtown chinese restaurant...so I was super surprised when the service here was really good and the washroom was clean. They spoke English perfectly too. (Not trying to be racist here...I am Asian...but there are a lot of good authentic asian restaurants where the waiters do not speak English very well).

Overall. Definitely would go back. Awesome food. Good service. Clean restaurant. Now when we crave hakka chinese food we dont have to drive all the way to scarborough!
