r4RCtOZxp0nXpuoN_Usd1w This is a great place for lunch!!!!!! I have been there 3 times now and I always have a good experience. I always eat the buffet, the chicken and lamb dishes are always really good. I don't care for the paneer (not enough chunks of paneer). When you go you'll have to try the Indian Chi Tea it's the best I have had in Madison. Overall it is one of the best restaurants on the west side.
