qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Some of the best Indian food I have eaten in a long time 

Atmosphere is very relaxed and friendly

Naan bread was freshly brought to the table and  buttered.

Selection was fantastic. Food was fresh and meats were not cheap cuts either. Sauces were rich and filling . I definitely over ate. Fish pakoras were delicious as was butter chicken 

There are items for kids or people who don't love Indian food : pasta salad, ceaser salad, spring rolls and friend chicken ect

Didn't try the desserts but they looked good 

Lots of fresh fruit as well

I will come back next time we are back in this area again !
