RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w The biryani was great. The bihari kabobs and naan were amazing. The lahori kulfi was the best I've ever had, even better than the ones I have had in Lahore. I don't particularly like the ambiance. Its a big place, seems like a former car garage/mechanic shop turned into a restaurant..it has an interesting feel to it.  I choose food over ambiance most days so I would definitely go here again and again.  I highly recommend this restaurant. There was a reason why it was on the food network!
