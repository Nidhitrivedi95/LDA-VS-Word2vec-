gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Not an expert on Indian cuisine but I love this place. Very tasty food.  The waiter (owner?) has always been very kind and has dishes prepared as I like them...

 I never see any crowds here and never have seen more than a few tables with people at them, I don't know why and its a shame.    But thumbs-up from me.

I really hope it stays in business.  I've visited other local Indian places, this one is by far my favorite so far.  Really good quality Indian dishes, especially spicy ones, can be hard to find and they go downhill really fast if not prepared with care.
