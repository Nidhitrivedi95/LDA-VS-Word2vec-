3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA Went for the lunch buffet, wide selection of chicken dishes, chicken tandoori, chili chicken, was quite appetizing, the curry chicken, not so.  The chicken curry seemed too watery to me.  The spices were off a little bit on the light side in all the dishes.   but overall, I liked it because of the large selection and the large dining area.  The AC was off so it was a bit muggy and uncomfortable.  Overall, based on the food alone, the taste is decent but not inspiring.  It's good because they put so much effort in it, but I don't think it's quite 4.5 stars.  I'd say closer to 3.5 to 4.
