UwIsqUFQBDMNofkTrAP_pw This is our 1st time here. Family oriented restaurant. Other table's food look just as good if not better. Makes me want to try each and every food item here. Fast & friendly service.

We ordered the following:
#8 Gobi Manchurian-tasted like sweet & sour cauliflower, but cauliflower florets tasted like potatoes (as heard/seen on tv). Very tasty!
#48 Kothuparottas with CHICKEN-ordered this influenced by others reviews. Love the yogurt that comes w it.
#68 Lamb Curry-delicious as always.
#54 Channa Masala-Garbanzo beans. Very good.

All dishes tasted good. 
They have at least 4 cooks at the back. Not a job for just one chef.
