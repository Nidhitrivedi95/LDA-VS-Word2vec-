WtFiIRFyyemKtS1x6TfuKA Sunny days have me hankering for island food so i decided to visit a former favourite, Bacchus Roti.

So disappointing. They get 2 stars for a clean space and efficient service, but only someone who has never had good authentic roti would think that oily mushy mess of potato, bland curry and meager servings of shrimp in one case, chicken in the other (barely discernible) was good. This is not the Bacchus roti I remember from an earlier time and this explains why it could be completely empty at dinnertime. My quest for Caribbean flavours must continue down the block   - westward, like Columbus.
