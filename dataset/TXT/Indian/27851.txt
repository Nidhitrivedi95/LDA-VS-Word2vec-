iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w Amazing food. I don't know how to describe my experience. As it was already pointed out the dining experience is personalize. The chef came to see us and she was an absolute gem. But the best part, obviously, was the food. Such an amazing experience. Extremely tasty, fresh food. There was so much taste in each bite. I hope to be in town one day again
