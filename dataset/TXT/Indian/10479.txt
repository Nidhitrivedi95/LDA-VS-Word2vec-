9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw Oh my god, I love Indian food, and if I'm starving, I'll totally daydream about the big rotis I can get from here. I'm thinking about them right now... *drool* It is like a meal and a half, for me.

I hope this place is here forever, because I don't think I can get a closer or more tasty Indian curry fix as this.
