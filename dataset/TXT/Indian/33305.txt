llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g This Indian restaurant is likely the worst Indian food I have ever eaten. My husband is Indian so I know good Indian food when I eat it, and this was definitely not it. 

Let's start first with the appearance. I walk in and I'm greeted by beautiful decor (huge plus on the styling) and I think "man this food is gonna be so good!!" I'm seated and the table is dirty....ok not a big deal because they can just wipe it down right? Wrong. Utensils and napkins are also dirty?? Um aren't there sanitation codes places have to live up to?! 

I hit the buffet and immediately notice there is no substance to any of the dishes, like they're literally WATERY. Ok so the thing with Indian dishes, most of the sauces are thick, like tomato based or chickpea and they're awesome to dip your naan in. 

Literally all of the buffet dishes lacked any and all substance. The ground lamb was gross and watery, the chicken tikka masala was gross and watery. The kadhi was labeled 'yogurt curry' but it had this bitter, strange, rotten taste. The gulab jamun was stone cold (for those who've never eaten, it's like a super fatty donut that's warm and delicious). The custard was clumpy, tasted like it was off the shelf gits (Indian store brand). The vegetable pakora was cold, all batter and no vegetables. The lamb curry was more water than lamb or curry. The naan was cold, tea was watered down, and their plain old water tasted awful, like it had been sitting in possible rusty pipes.

I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I gave it a fair go by trying multiple different dishes and I was appalled by them and even more so for the buffet price. Their food overall is disgusting, and I can guarantee I will not darken their doorstep again.
