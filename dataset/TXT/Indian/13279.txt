bBUMib8l6Me1ZB1_Qkezkg I had the saag paneer which was the tiniest portion I've ever seen at any Indian restaurant. It also had very little paneer. I supplemented this tiny dish with  a piece of naan which was HUGE! I felt like the the ratio of saag to naan could have been better. The biryani was pretty good though.
