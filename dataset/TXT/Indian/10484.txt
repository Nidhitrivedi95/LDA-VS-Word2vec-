9wQHmZrkx0MtEN2AlZ0HVw Pretty good curry (I got saag paneer), although I didn't like the roti wrap itself. I really appreciate that "hot" was actually really spicy! 

The samosa ($1) was not good and I definitely don't suggest getting one. The dough was really thick.

There was a lot of seating, which was nice. Prices are reasonable given that the rotis are big enough to serve two people.
