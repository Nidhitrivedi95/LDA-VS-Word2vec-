kzqx6Z2sse8PV3hVCVEw4g Lunched ther today and asked for iced tea; got a glass of dark tea, barely spiced...period. Ordered chicken biryani and the dish included four raisins, three slivered almonds, two small fresh spinach leaves and loads of chicken neatly cubed and somewhat dry. My partner's eggplant sat in a sweet sauce, perhaps the same as the one offered with the samosas. I like healthy food, but I also like tasty food and I expect vegetables to dominate the meat. I will not return to this restaurant; I appreciate the effort to cut down on fats, but the scarcity of spinach and condiments in the biryani is unforgivable. Strikes me that it came out of a large precooked pot in which the ingredients had not been thoroughly mixed. Lovely presentation if that is your number one priority. I'll take the Tandoori Times any day over this!
