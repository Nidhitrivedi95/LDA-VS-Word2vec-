ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ Lunch buffet on weekends; can get packed on weekends; serves South Indian food only.  Great experience to get a snippet of a cultural and local hot spot during my visit to TO.  Self-service buffet; small selection but you will be full amongst the chickpeas, rice, idls, stewed veggies and the puris and dosas the servers will pass around to your table.  Additional charges for extra drinks.  Two choices for dessert at buffet.
