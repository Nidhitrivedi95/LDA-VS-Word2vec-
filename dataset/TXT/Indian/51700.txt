The food here was good like the kofta and kabobs. But the service here was horrible. Everyone didn't hassle to get orders and things done. Staff waited until someone complained to finally get something going and that too took at least 10 minutes. The place is really small but again food was good especially if your craving Indian in Vegas 3 out of 5 stars
