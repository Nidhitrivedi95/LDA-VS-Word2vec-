0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg So good! We had never been here before and the people working were so helpful on giving us advice on menu items. We had the chicken tiki masala and the Prawn Goan Curry. Both dishes were similar to each other as being coconut based but different spices. We also ordered garlic and buttered naan bread. We don't like spicy food so they toned down the spice for us. Both dishes were rich, full of flavor and so delicious!!! We will be back soon!
