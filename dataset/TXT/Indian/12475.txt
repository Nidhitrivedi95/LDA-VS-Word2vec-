Since most of the previous reviews all seemed positive on the food, I wanted to give the place a shot. My wife and I split two rolls: the butter chicken and the silken chicken. With butter chicken being the mainstay on any Indian restaurant in the city, we had a pretty good reference point for comparison, and it fared extremely well. The defining characteristic of all the food we tried is that it is extremely flavourful without being overly rich, and cheating with copious amounts of butter or cream. The silken chicken was unlike anything I've tried and absolutely delicious. For both, the chicken was all quality white meat, tender and moist. Rolls also come with a cilantro dipping sauce. While you're there, make sure to order a lassi.

Nice atmosphere with Bollywood movies playing in the back, and the owner was friendly. Looking forward to coming back to try some new rolls!
