JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I love this place. I usually go on a Saturday or Sunday for the buffet . I especially love their soup Rasam. I would literally go just for that. The buffet has a pretty good selection. The service so is great. I usually only get the buffet and water so I can't speak for ordering a specific  meal or drink . The price Is very reasonable . I try to go here whenever I am out near Concord Mills! It's located in a shopping center like lot so there is plenty of parking.
