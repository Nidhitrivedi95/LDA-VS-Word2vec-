4scx_rtI9RZfFHWUxqPuHw We ordered through straight2yourdoor, so maybe that's why the food was so bad, but ... Plenty of people have figured out how to make food taste good, even after a 5 minute car ride.

For 4 people getting one entree and one piece of naan, plus one $4 appetizer, our whole dinner cost $90. And it wasn't good. The dough on our momo was chewy and the naan was like trying to rip off a piece of cartilage. The curries were all watery. I was so upset I just spent $90 on that!

I don't think many people in Madison have had a lot of Indian food if this was good to them ...
