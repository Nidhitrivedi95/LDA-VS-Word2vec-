bJh8M_myhysvMq4hXCAhDw Another solid and quite decent restaurant which we've used on several occasions in the past for corporate bookings.


 Its not the biggest place in the world - the downstairs area is the main restaurant, and theres a fucnction room upstairs for private bookings (which is free to hire) but its tastefully, but unspectacularly, decorated. The menu choices are varied and theres probably something to choose for everyone. Its also very reasonably priced, both for group rates (a party of 15 of us paid just over £10 for three courses) and individual rates.


 The food itself is always very nice. I'm not a huge fan of Indian as a rule, but I always enjoy eating here whenever we do. Some of the hotter dishes are so hot your head may burst into flames, but there are plenty of milder dishes to choose from if thats not your thing. The wine list is adequate and theres a range of beers, soft drinks and so on to choose from at the bar too.


 Its a family run place, and service is always very good. Recommended.
