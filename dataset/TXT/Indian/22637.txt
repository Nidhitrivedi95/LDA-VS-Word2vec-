gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg This is my new favorite place. As a vegetarian, it is so awesome to be able to go to a buffet and try ALL the things - and I did ^_^ The dosi (potato crepe) was great, but as we stared at it, perplexed at how to go about eating the huge crepe that mostly closely approximated a ginormous burrito, the owner came by and showed us how to eat it with the proper sauces and accompanying soup. I will say that a meal could be made just out of the dosi + soup. The eggplant dish was awesome, the butter sauce was great. The only things that were just average were the naan and pankora (fried vegetable appetizer). Still, I will admit I actually came back and got take out the next day, too, because it had been 24 hours and I missed it all so much.
