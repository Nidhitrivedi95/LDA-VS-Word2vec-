UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg The best way to check how authentic a place is what it claims to be is to order the specialty.
I read it was run by a couple from Nepal and Punjab - so I ordered Nepali and Indo-Chinese - Chowmein vegetable and Chilli Paneer - takeaway.

As soon as I opened the boxes, I knew the food had authentic flavor and fragrance.
The taste was good too. I had ordered "mild" because of what I read in previous review but I think I'll want to step up to "medium" next time.
The quantity was good too.

My only complaint was the food was too oily. Maybe I'll mention that when I order next time because I'm definitely going back for the authentic Indo-Chinese/Nepali food!!
