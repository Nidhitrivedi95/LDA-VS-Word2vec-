DjlOWc6p2jkit9zMSFa_ew Very tasty south Indian flavours with a twist - not the usual dreck that is produced by 95% of Indian restaurants in this city. Everything is carefully prepared and emphasises local ingredients. Ambience in the restaurant is lacking but the wine list with reasonable markups makes up for it!
