We walked along Gerrard Street for a few blocks, and this seemed our best option of the restaurants already open. The inside was a bit surprising, bright red tables with retro red and white décor in the front, and a cafeteria style serving area at the back where you choose from the available foods, all served on shiny white divided platters.

I ordered the chicken biryani, a good-sized portion of chicken and vegetables mixed with rice and yoghurt on the side, a little spicy but not too much. My friend had a meat thali, which included I think 2 servings of meat, along with potatoes and vegetables and naan. Overall, a good satisfying meal, with the total bill only about $20.
