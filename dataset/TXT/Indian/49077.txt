TTpgjbrSyxwHHzE5bIF-Rw First appearances can be deceiving!  Hubby and I were feeling a bit nervous when we pulled into the Sahara Commercial Center - that place just looks sad!  But oh, everything brightened when we walked into Namaste and tried their $9.99 lunch buffet.  Every single item tasted excellent - we filled our plates with all kinds of delicious things like butter chicken, navaratna korma, aloo palak, masala mutton ... and then the waiter brought us a basket of fresh hot butter naan to the table.  Oh yeah!  But it got even better, several minutes later, he brought us a freshly cooked plate of uttapam - yes you read that right!   We love South Indian snacks and it's just not so easy to find that here in Vegas.  That little touch pushed us into masala bliss!    The other cool thing that will draw us back for a dinner is that they serve quite a few Goan specialties, such as chicken xacutti and Goan shrimp curry - all quite amazing and different from their Northern Indian style counterparts.  Happy eating!
