scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg My husband and I are new to being open minded enough to try Indian food, we are typically pub food or bust when it comes to going out to eat. We came here with some friends who are way more adventurous than we are, and boy are we glad we did! I don't have much to compare to, but my butter chicken dish was AWESOME. My husband also loved the lamb curry. We split cheese naan, which complemented the spice from the food well. I really like that they also give a choice of spice level - 3 was perfect for me! It was enough heat to taste but you could still get all of the flavors of the food.

Service was speedy and he made some jokes with our friends who are regulars. The space was clean and had a nice decor. Again I don't have much to compare price too as far as Indian restaurants go, but for the amount of food we received the price seemed fair. We will be back!
