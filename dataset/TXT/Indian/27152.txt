Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag This is absolutely the best Indian food my wife who is from South India and I have eaten. Wonderfully prepared and elegantly served.  

We had the masala shrimp, spiced soft shell crab for appetizer and masala dosa for the main course.  The lachha paratha went perfectly with the meal.

Ronald is a gentleman and a pleasant server.  This made our last night in Vegas just perfect!
