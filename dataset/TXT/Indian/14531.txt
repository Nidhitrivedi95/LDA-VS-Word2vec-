C4HVXYYyiBeSUnrpnEZz5g Fusion Bar & Grill has a small but good menu with Indian, Mexican and American entrees. Two of us had hamburgers which were excellent. The fries were delicious. Our other friend had mushroom and chicken fajitas that she raved about.  The service was excellent - they were very willing to make substitutions, etc.  They have a Friday lunch buffet of Indian dishes.  I hope the restaurant does well.
