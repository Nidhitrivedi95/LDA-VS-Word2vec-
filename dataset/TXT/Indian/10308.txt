9OHxN88qy_BSmY_8yqWQ5w We tried this restaurant for the first time while we were in the area.  Our usual go-to place is The Host in Mississauga however,  we wanted something a little less formal.  We arrived just after 4:00pm on a Sunday and there were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant.  We were seated fairly quickly.  We ordered a variety of dishes including:  a Tandoori platter (chicken beef and fish tikkas), makhni paneer, beef biryani, channa masala and naans.  The food arrived after about 20 minutes which was pretty quick.  The platter was plentiful however didn't seem quite fresh.  The fish and the beef kabobs were really dry.  The channa masala was fine in flavour yet was served luke warm instead of hot making me think that it was not prepared fresh.  The makhni paneer was waaay too (tomatoey?) tasting with not enough spice.  The beef biriyani was full of beef chunks which was a surprise but again,  not quite hot- just luke warm.  All in all,  the food was just ok- not bad enough to send back,  not good enough to warrant a repeat visit.  The major complaint about this place was the atrocious service.  No one checked on us even once after we received our food despite there only being a handful of tables occupied.  We had to flag down servers constantly in order to get a water re-fill or order tea, ask for the bill etc.  It was also quite pricey.  After spending over $100 for lunch,  I expected more.  With a plethora of good and cheaper indian restaurants in Mississauga and Toronto,  I don't think we will be back.
