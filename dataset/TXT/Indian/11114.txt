A9W5rhp49EX-BYpALGLJdg This is hands down the best indian food I've had in Canada. I've personally tried The Host and other similar restaurants in the area, and this downright crushes them. 

I had the chicken tika masala with naan, and both were amazing (the naan in particular was the best I've had). 

Great service and overall amazing place.
