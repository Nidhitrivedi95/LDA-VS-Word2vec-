h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ If you are looking for true southern Indian food, this is the place. We walked in an hour before they closed and the place was packed with Indian families. Us and one other couple were the only non-Indian people there. 

The food was amazing, vegetable pakoras, masala Dosa, coconut special Dosa, curry and garlic nan... Everything was GREAT!
