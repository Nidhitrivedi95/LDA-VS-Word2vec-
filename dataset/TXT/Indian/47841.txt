On the night we were in they were very busy so service was a little slow but, they were very hospitable and that more than made up for it for us! I found that this place is a place that is like a hidden gem in Vegas. It may not be in such a great part of town but, trust me it's well worth every second...great food, bar, wine selection, vegetarian options, great people who work there, a place we will definitely be returning to again and again!!!
