tnd0GWjSEntWbG6wpLu61g Food is delicious. I recently had the chana masaledaar, which is a vegetarian dish with chick peas and veggies. I asked for spice level 7 out of 10,  Love spicy, and it definitely had a kick, but was not overwhelming.  i have tired many of the vegetarian appetizers and meals and have never been disappointed. Atmosphere is a little lacking but the food and service are excellent.
