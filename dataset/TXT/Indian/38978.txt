OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g What an amazing place with mouth watering Indian and fusion dishes. Despite being  a vegetarian and picky about my food, I was completely amazed at the choices and authentic taste this place offers. The staff are courteous and so welcoming that they made my experience a 5 star one. I intend to come here again and hope you will too. I assure you that you won't be disappointed
