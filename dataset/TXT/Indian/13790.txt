BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ The food is tasty but the service is impossibly slow.  Bring a snack to eat while you wait for your food if you're hungry.  The serves actively avoided our table as we tried to wave them down to get the status of our food that took more than an hour. Overall this meal was not worth the wait.
