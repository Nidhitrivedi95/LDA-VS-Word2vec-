fp24IseF5LGD1Iev7d0PVA They have a decent selection of items. Some of the items are pretty good like the golab jamoon. Some items were kind of cold by the time I took it back to me seat like the butter chicken. I like how the hot naan comes to you.

The other thing I didn't like that really brought down the star rating is the manager/owner is kind of a prick. We had a reservation and right on the dot, your entire party isn't here I'm going to take away some seats. Really asshole?
