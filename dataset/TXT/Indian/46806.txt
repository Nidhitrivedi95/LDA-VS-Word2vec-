t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg Great options for non-vegans and vegans , which is perfect for my boyfriend and I. I'm vegan and they are very accommodating to my dietary needs, as well as allergies. The food is very excellent! My boyfriend and I come here at least 2x a month it's so good. It is a little pricey but it's definitely worth it . You can order half orders but with full orders you'll have left overs. Best Indian restaurant I've been to, my boyfriend and I swear by it.
