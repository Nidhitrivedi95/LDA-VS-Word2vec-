z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA Took my family here and had a terrible experience. We started with an assortment of Indian breads and the Pakora appetizer which wasn't cooked through (sticky batter in center). Whole place was empty, yet it took 45 mins for four entrees to arrive. Waiter got one order wrong and was apologetic but then it took another 25 mins for the correct dish to arrive, and when it did it was missing the side it was supposed to come with. Only flavorful thing on the entire table was the palak paneer. Still, I've had far better elsewhere. Nothing about our experience was positive. Well- maybe the ample parking. Otherwise, it was a total waste of $100. All four of us agreed as we were walking out that we would never go back.
