gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw I love everything about this place!  The ALWAYS great food is almost incidental to the family environment and wonderful feel of this restaurant.  This is the REAL thing.  The first time that I ate there I was transported back to my Sephardic Grandmother's dinner table. And that is a rare compliment because my Nona's food was authentic, lovingly served and full of history and sustenance. 
They serve history and stories full of heritage at this mom and pop restaurant located in a vibrant corner of the emergent East Fremont corridor of downtown Las Vegas.
Come for the food but stay for the welcome to the kitchens of the Old World.
