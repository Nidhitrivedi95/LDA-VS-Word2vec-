P7ZzfO3zOmF5y82RBiJHmg This is one of the best Asian restaurants I've been to.  Their specialty is Haka and boy, is it good.  Their sauces are the best part of all the meals.  It doesn't really matter what the protein is, it's all very good.  So far, there has only been one occasion where we order take-away and one of the dishes wasn't saucy enough.  
Check it out! It's extremely good.
