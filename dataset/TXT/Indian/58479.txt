Like Sam, I have a palette that prefers non-spicy food, so I ordered a mild curry when I visited here for a friend's leaving meal.  It wasn't at all busy on the night I visited.  The waiters were vigilant, and it did almost feel like we were being watched as we sat and ate the meal.  The food was very tasty though, and appeared swiftly after ordering.  This was no doubt helped by the fact that there weren't many customers.

This place didn't bowl me over like Kismot, but it was still a good night out with some tasty food.  I would like to go back some time, and I suggest you bear it in mind as a place worth visiting.
