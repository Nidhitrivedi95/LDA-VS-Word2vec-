gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I went here seeing 4.5 stars at yelp . This restaurant is not even 1 star . Food is terrible & service is worst. They offer only plain naan , neither rotis nor garlic naan . Appetizers samosas pakoras were not fresh , must be previous days left overs . Do yourself a favor and go to mint for a satisfying indian buffet.
