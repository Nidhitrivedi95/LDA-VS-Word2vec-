g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ Put in an order for delivery yesterday. Man on the phone was rude and disrespectful while taking our order. Then it took 2 hours to deliver the food to us. After eating the food, my husband wasn't feeling well (we both decided on different dishes).Now my husband has been violently vomiting all day and unable to keep any food or liquid down. So in a nutshell, he got food poisoning. I do not recommend this place.
