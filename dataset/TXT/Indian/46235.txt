sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I finally had my first roti from here. I had some nice co-workers who braved the lunch hour rush and picked up our orders. I've had Mother India a couple times before and even though they may be owned by the same people, I think I'd have to say I prefer Mother India. It's not a massive difference but I've tried the Saag Paneer roti from both places now so let me compare:
Mother India is slightly less saltier. After eating Ghandi's, we were all gulping back water even though there was little room left in our bellies for water. Ghandi's Saag Paneer roti contained potato and I'm not so much a fan of potato in my roti. I feel it adds too much starchiness. I loved the rich savoury taste of mother india's saag paneer. dribbling now at the thought even though i'm still full from lunch which was 6 hours ago.
Don't get me wrong, if my co-workers go for another Ghandi's run, I'll definitely partake but maybe I'll suggest they drive further down queen and try Mother India instead.
