auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ I've only dined here for the lunch buffet a few times. It's a pretty good deal to sample several Indian dishes for $10.95. You get a choice of fresh, warm, traditional naan or garlic naan with the lunch buffet. A lot of the buffet items are vegetarian, some vegan, several types of curry - (vegetarian, chicken, goat), basmati rice, salad bar, and a few desserts.

I usually stick to the dishes I'm familiar with - tandoori chicken, tikka masala, saag, basmati rice, samosa, etc. but I'm always willing to try new dishes. I tried some potato & cabbage side, rice with almonds and raisins, vegetable curry, chicken curry in a tomato based sauce, etc. This is probably my least descriptive Yelp review. Forgive me. I'm not too familiar with Indian food. I wanted to take pics of the descriptions at the buffet station but I didn't want to be that dorky Yelper who takes pics. Even though I didn't know some of the dishes I was eating, I enjoyed my buffet. I think some of the curries could have been spicier but they were still fine and tasty. 

The restaurant is well decorated & charming with the traditional Indian decor & vibrant colors. The service was very attentive & welcoming. I think 4 or 5 different servers helped me. One guy suggested I use two different sauces for my samosa when he saw that I just grabbed it without a sauce. It was a minty sauce and a tamarind glazed sauce?

I was full off 2.5 plates, garlic naan, and kheer for dessert. I'll be back and hopefully I'll remember the names of the dishes I've had. If you happen to know what I had from my weak descriptions & food pics, please educate me. ;)
