UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Authentic Indian Food! AYCE lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for around $12.

I had a little bit of everything and to tell you the truth dont remember the names of any of the dishes Lol. 
Poultry seemed to be their main ingredient meat wise. They were all good and a few were great such as the Goat, and you cant judge it unless you taste yourself.
 
The funniest part i must add to this review is my friend had never ate Indian food before and had the shits a couple hours later. I had the exact same dishes that he had so moral of the story is.. if you have a uni-cuisine stomach, dont go hard on new ones Lol.
