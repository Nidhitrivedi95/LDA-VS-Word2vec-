UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ I love coming here after class for their lunch buffet! Although the restaurant is quite small, they have a fairly decent selection of lunch buffet items, ranging from chicken tikki massala, naan, palak paneer, rice pudding, salad, etc.  

Since the restaurant is so small, it's often difficult to find a seat. I recommend coming before noon to beat the lunch hour madness!
