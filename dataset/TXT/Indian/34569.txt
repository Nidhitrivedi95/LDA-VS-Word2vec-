We go to Vegas about twice a year and we always make a point of going to Tamba's lunch buffet during our trip. If you like Indian food this place is amazing, the food is fresh and delicious, the ambiance inside is super nice and the service is great! Not to mention the price is so good for all the wonderful food they offer!
