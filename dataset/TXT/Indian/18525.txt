eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Flavors were decent. They had about 7 different tubs of dishes to scoop from and a salad-type bar on the side. All the flavors weren't too different from one another - one more herby or one more spicy. The chicken dishes were well seasoned and relatively moist. They give you naan upon seating and you can ask for more. The naan is plain or... buttery? I typically love love love rice pudding, but this place makes it... interesting. It tasted ok, but it was thick. It had other goodies in it like almonds or something. 

Staff was attentive, but don't expect any smiles or warm fuzzy freindly feeling. Also, check your silverware... I changed out my fork 4 times because there was still dried food on it. The last fork I got still had dried food on it... but I was actually able to scrape it off with my napkin for this one. yeah...
