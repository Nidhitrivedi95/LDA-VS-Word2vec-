BZ_j2EpBANxiNA1cBr-b6Q For a christmas meal out with friends I booked Zest due to location really rather than any form of recommendation. I am glad to say it was a great choice - the interior had been recently freshened up with the slight smell of paint still lingering. It was pleasant atmosphere and the food was even better. We had a selection of dishes and mixed them between us. Great flavours, service and price really respectable at about £25 pp for 2 courses and couple of drinks each. Would easily recommend and will be returning again.
