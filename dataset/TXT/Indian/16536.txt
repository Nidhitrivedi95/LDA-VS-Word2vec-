DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA After a horrendous experience more than a year ago, we have been to this place few times now.
Food quality has definitely improved. The taste, flavors and overall quality of food is now very good.
We have had their buffet as well as a la carte Punjabi and Indochinese food. And there is consistency in quality.
This place did have one of the best ambience of an Indian restaurant in the Cleveland area.
They do have new serving staff which is a good change.  But they do have that one guy who casually puts food on your table without a smile or even saying anything.  They still don't check on you to see if everything is OK like most restaurants do.  
Just ignore the poor service and go for the food!!
