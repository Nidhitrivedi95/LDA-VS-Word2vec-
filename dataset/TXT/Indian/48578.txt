TQcDrdS8Dbbrayu78G_myA My girlfriend and I decided to make the journey here on a Saturday evening. I say journey because this place was located out in Scarborough, and we were going from downtown, so overall it took about 40-50 minutes to get there - but it wasn't the worst. The bus from Victoria Park Station (67A), pretty much drops you about a 2 minute walk from the place, which is great.

We walk in and immediately we get a feel of Pakistan. The place was pretty packed, loud conversations, traditional clothes, and a fairly family affair. I assume part of the reason for the rush was that it was a weekend, so it was understandable. We were just 2 people, so luckily it wasn't too long of a wait - about 15 to 20 minutes. 

Their ordering system was unlike other Pakistani restaurants I've been to and more fast-food/self-serve style. You order at the cashier, pay for the food, then pick it up from the counter when they call out your name. It's a nice system though - it means fewer waiters hustling around the restaurant, and you don't have to wait to pay when you're done. 

Now to the food; we ordered: seekh kebab, silky (chicken) kebab, chicken biryani, chicken karhai and one naan. The total came out to around $24 for all the food, which is actually half-decent. Our order was ready in about ten minutes, which is great. In terms of taste, I would probably rank the food as: (1) karhai (2) seekh kebab (3) biryani (4) silky kebab. Don't get me wrong though, that doesn't mean any dish was bad, that's just a personal preference thing. Everything was really pretty tasty. One naan seemed to be sufficient for the two of us, and it was a milky naan so it was soft to break and eat. 

Because of Patna's distance from us, it probably means coming here is a 3-hour affair, with travel and eating time, so I'm not sure how often we'll come but it's definitely something I'd come back to.
