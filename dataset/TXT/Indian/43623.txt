rqLksDzegxNXMWwZk3eZnQ My mother and I went there for dinner on a weekday. The food was very fresh and flavorsome. I had the tandoori chicken with naan and she had the lamb curry with naan. Definitely the best naan we ever tried! Looking forward to going back and trying some more of the menu. Price is decent.
