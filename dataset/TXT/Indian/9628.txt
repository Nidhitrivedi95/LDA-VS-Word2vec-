8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ I was pleasantly surprised by this place, they have been around for a while so figured it must be decent and came to find out that other then some very slow service the food and the place itself are very nice.
The Butter Chicken Factory is a small but cozy place and they have very good indian food for very reasonable prices.
I would recommend this place to any Indian food lover.
