ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Came here for their lunch buffet.  The restaurant is located in a strip mall with an awkward parking lot, but once you get into the place, the entire dining room is filled with the aroma of food.

Yes it is a buffet, but they kept it very well stocked and very neat.   The food was good (I ate too much naturally).  Lots of vegetarian options.  Now, I am not an Indian food expert, but I felt pretty satisfied with the price and the food.

Servers were very nice and kept our drinks refilled and the tabled bused even though the lunch crowd was growing and busy.

The place is pretty cramped and doesn't have much atmosphere, but face it, it really makes the food the star.  There is a nice mural of the Taj Mahal on the wall but other than that, nothing too tricky or gimmicky here.
