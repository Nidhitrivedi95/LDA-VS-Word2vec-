-Good service
-Serving size is larger than usual so two can dine by getting an app and a main dish
-The veggies, rice and fries that came as part of the dish were great

The so-so:
-We ordered the beef steak (veal was out) which was someone chewy (Affy's steak is much better imo)
-The brownie is overrated! It's decent but I have had much better brownie/ice cream combos (moxie's white chocolate brownie)

Verdict:
-Will likely come back as the flavor of the food was good (except for steak) and therefore will order a chicken dish instead (hard to screw up chicken)
-it's a new restaurant and hopefully it'll only get better
