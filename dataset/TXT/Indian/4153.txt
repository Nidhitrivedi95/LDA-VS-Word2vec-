The cashier said its 30 minutes I said that was fine. She laughed at my face and said " really? You're going to wait 30 minutes ?" I felt rather uncomfortable.

40 minutes passed and I asked if they were ready. She said no an extra 15 minutes. And the lady beside her said under her breath. " we told you 30 minutes and we told you you couldn't wait that long" little did she know I understand her language as I am of Asian decent 

Service could be better and in my opinion I bet they  even  make the samosas. But because the butte chicken and naan was so good I'll give it 3 stars.
