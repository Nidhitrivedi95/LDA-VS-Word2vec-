li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ ok so here is the skinny on a place I have been anticipating for quite some time. Hurry 4 Curry is small, basic, and completely neat-o.

Ordering is done via touchscreen televisions and and paid for by swiping your credit card. If you want to pay cash, you can do so at the counter. You'll slow things down for sure, think of the visa commercials. They are pending a liquor license right now.

The people working there were nice, and offered to help me with the ordering process. Sorry, if you can't figure this out, you need to go off yourself immediately and stay out of the gene pool. 

The food is premade, and in 5 pots in the middle of the kitchen. When you order, they go get a plate, put some rice and some main dish on it and bring it to you. The food I got was tasty, albeit a bit underspiced. They are planning on staying open until 9pm nightly. I thanked them for their ambitious plans and let them know I hope they don't give up like a lot of places do. 

If you live in the city, and like this place, I ask you to do the same. It would suck if I got used to this for dinner and they changed to say, 6pm closing.
