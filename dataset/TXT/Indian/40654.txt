PvufhE6-sy2pCTQu9yvjiw I ordered biryani plate and was disappointed with the meat to rice ratio. I found about 6 pieces of meat in an entire to-go box of rice. Rice is super cheap and I paid $11 for a plate of rice practically. The food is delicious nonetheless. This is also the first time I have ever ordered from this restaurant. Perhaps they were just low on the meat I ordered at the time? Idk.
