The Paneer Makhani (same creamy, tomato sauce as butter chicken) was the star.  Baigan Patiala was smokey and fragrant with tender slices of eggplant and mashed eggplant and spices. Chicken Pasanda was also excellent and full of saffron flavour. Ras Malai had a perfect, delicate texture and just the right amount of creamy, fragrant sweetness. Definitely the best Indian restaurant I've been to in a while, and the best in North Toronto.  A strong recommendation.

Great for couples or small parties of 4 (maybe 6 max) as dining room is very cozy.  Definitely make a reservation for weekend dinners.
