ZPhQyUO9MY5xNEcTqZOrTQ Best chole bature I've had in North America! Their desserts are outstanding as well. Very fresh & melt in your mouth. We discovered this place on a Google search a few years ago & keep coming back. They have interesting Indian paintings. The staff is friendly & the place is neat except for the bathrooms.
They just need to bus & clean up their bathrooms more often & have a better system for stacking used dishes rather than blocking the entry door to the bathroom with trash receptacle piles high with dirty dishes.
