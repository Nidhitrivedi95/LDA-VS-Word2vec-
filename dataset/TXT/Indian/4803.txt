2GryItAj3e0uOQ5m42-wDg First time I have ever left a bad review or contacted the health department. There was cockroaches scurrying on the ground to the left side of the buffet. Told the waitress and she didn't do anything about it. When I went to pay the $38 for 3 of us that didn't eat a lot because of loss of appetites. They didn't care at all. I reported it to the health department. Now I am reading on here i am not the only one who seen them. Wish I read the reviews first. Disgusting!!!! You couldn't pay me to ever eat there again. With numerous complaints think they would clean it up.
