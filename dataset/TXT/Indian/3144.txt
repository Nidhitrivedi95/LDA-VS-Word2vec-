0DyDT4NJNaIuDpT7nTIjxg My friend and I went here for dinner tonight. I was highly impressed!! The service was great. Everyone was especially helpful at getting us a table. They were extremely busy, but they were on top everything. The food was amazing and the naan was great. They had so many different  entree choices that  I had a hard time choosing, but I think that is a good thing. I ended up with the Paneer Tiki Marsala. I was super happy with the choice. If you are in the mood for some great Indian this is the place to go! I will be going back
