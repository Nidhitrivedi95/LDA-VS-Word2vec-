kF6uM_KKWvBMGFdxMe9k2A It is a really good Indian vegetarian restaurant especially if ur in the mood for dosas. I would recommend the pau bhaji dosa it is amazing and unique and its not too spicy. The masala dosa is also good if you want a simpler choice. And if your not into anything spicy, get the cheese dosa. The service is nice and quick too.
