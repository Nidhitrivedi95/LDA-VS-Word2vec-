UvWWzU2g-Wq-c3wAcSeDPg We love this place.  We've only had dinner here so can't speak to the lunch buffet.  The staff is very friendly and attentive but not overly so.  The food is awesome.  We are vegetarian and love the combo platter appetizer.  We've had the baked eggplant, channa masala, dal makhni, gobi mutter, and bahindi aloo. All excellent with fresh ingredients and perfectly spiced.  I don't agree with the negative comments here - this place is great.
