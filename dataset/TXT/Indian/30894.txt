KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ We came here for the lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon. We did come toward the end around 215 pm.  They did have a decent spread of food. The buffet included veg and non veg appetizers. Main course included Lamb curry, tandoori chicken, couple vegetable entrees, chicken tikka masala as well as chicken and vegetable biriyani. They also had a separate salad/desert bar.

The food unfortunately seemed like it had been there on the warmer for a few hours. The chicken was dried out. The biriyani rice was also quite dry. We were 8 adults so some of the items ran out. When we called the staff of they could re stock some of it they said the chef had already left and there was nothing they could do about it. This was around 245 so technically food should be kept available since they advertise the buffet being open till 3 pm. Regardless the food over all was average at best. Could use more spice and seasoning. 

I would recommend that you go earlier in the day if you wanna try the buffet.
