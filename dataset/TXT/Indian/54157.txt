vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw As I stand here holding my fiancé's hair, I can't help but wish the staff at this restaurant had done a more thorough job of observing her food allergies. We clearly stated to our waiter that she has a serious nut allergy and he insisted that all the food we ordered was safe for her.... Somewhere along the line someone messed up or she wouldn't be throwing up right now from the food we shared. The best part was when they insisted that we had made a mistake and everything on their end was clear... Clearly, our mistake was coming here in the first place.
I'm just beginning to introduce my fiancé to the pleasures of Indian cuisine, and after an amazing start with her at the Tikka House in Little India, this was an unfortunate follow up.
I have to say that food allergy aside, the food was really below average, there are much better Indian food experiences to be had in other parts of town.
We won't be back or recommending it.
