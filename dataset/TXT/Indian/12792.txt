B2KSgKekQfeOFHWH7g68Tg Honestly, not very experienced when it comes to Indian food, but this was really good in taste and serving size. More of a 3.5 star experience, but no option for that, so no wrong in showing a little extra love. 
We had the lamb curry, goat curry, two types of naan bread, along with a chutney and a yogurt sauce. All were perfectly spiced for the level we ordered (mild & medium), and the bread was excellent. 
Ordered online through a delivery service, so I imagine it's even better going straight from kitchen to table. Definitely will be eating here again.
