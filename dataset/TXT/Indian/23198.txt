gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Look I'm no Indian food connoisseur. What I ate there seem to taste OK.  The big problem for this place is that the bathroom was infested with roaches and they have a glue trap on the floor with a bunch of dead roaches on it.  I don't care if Martha Stewart was in the kitchen cooking I can't eat from a roach infested place. I will say the staff was very nice so unfortunate
