HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A I really enjoyed my first trip to Saffron Patch!  I wish I had discovered it earlier because it is so close to home. I am not well versed on Indian food so I don't have many places to compare flavors and ambiance.

We tried the fried cheese for an app - can't go wrong there! We had a chick pea curry, black lentil special and a chicken masala. All were excellent - asked for medium spice - came out just spicey enough, but won't knock me down. 

I plan to return again (and again) soon. Maybe for the lunch buffet!
