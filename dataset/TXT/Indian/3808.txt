0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw There is no better tasting Indian food than Kohinoor. They have a great low price for all you eat lunch and dinner buffet. Also I like how the dining area is comfortable and dark in a nice way. I have been to over 20 different Indian restaurants and this place has the best flavor. Great Service and open until 11pm!! What more could you want?
