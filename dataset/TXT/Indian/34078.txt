m6nLTIrEJHtHSYJjVavnzw I don't think I would ever be able to stop eating if I came here. Everything is SOOO good. And the service is great too! Everyone is super nice. I LOVE  Super spicy food and they gave me the right amount of heat! This was my second visit. The first time I had the Chicken Saag at it's spiciest and a vegetarian dish with garlic naan and rice. Today, we had the chile naan, rice, a lamb dish, and fish chili! Everything was delicious! I have been to other Indian food restaurants but they were never as good as this. Cant wait to come back and try more dishes. Everything is just so yummy!
