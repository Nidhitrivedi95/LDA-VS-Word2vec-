Aol8whdcT7BfnhUCnfa1lw So far I've been there 4 times and always enjoyed my experience. Service was friendly and helpful with great suggestions when you ask. I did like that I was able to swap any option in there combo dinners, man places don't. If you like spicy dishes try the Bangalore Phai chicken. Naan was incredible and so were the Samosa.
There is one Down town as well..both i would recommend.
