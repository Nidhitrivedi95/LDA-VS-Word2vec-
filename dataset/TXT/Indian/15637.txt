cuXCQM-9VwpZlSneEY1b3w I'm no expert but I thought the food here tasted really good. 

For 3 people, we ordered the Veg Samosa Chaat (not actually a triangle shaped pastry with stuff inside like I was expecting but oh so very good) the Chorr Bazaar ka Tikka (chicken and other things, some may find this dish super spicy), Aloo Ghobi (a tasty cauliflower dish), the beef short ribs (so tender), coconut rice and Naan (very fresh, just out of the oven). For those who want spice, you'll probably be disappointed with everything we ordered other than the chicken tikka. For our family, it was just the right amount of spice. 

Unlike others, we found the service very good (later in the evening, crowd was thinning out). We didn't know what most of the things on the menu were, and the hostess spent a fair amount of time explaining things, answering questions and making recommendations. Very helpful.

No idea about pricing compared to other Indian restos but comparable to other offerings on the Bayview scene.

I'm glad I tried it and we'll for sure go back.

PS... the no tipping policy is no more -- they now take a more conventional approach to tipping. I kind of liked the non-conventional approach but apparently not everyone agreed so the owner decided not to do it anymore.
