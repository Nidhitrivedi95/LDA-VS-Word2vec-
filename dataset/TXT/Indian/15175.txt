Went for buffet last weekend. I only go to buffets at places that do a lot of business because I like to make sure it's fresh. The a la carte menu at Dhaba is quite pricey butt hey will make your food spicy for you. There's no ignoring the heavy spice level on the buffet delights, either. By this, I don't necessarily mean HOT spice, but full rounded flavours that aren't made milder for North American Palates.

They offerings were actually quite good and remained hot despite the fact that we arrived close to 2 pm. Some of the salads were decidedly not Indian but there was a nice cold shrimp salad with dill. Butter Chicken was a little sweet, but the chicken was tender smoky. Saag Paneer was not bad-- but as usual, most of the paneer was fished out. Veggie Dumplings (Malai Kofta) with a warm yogurt sauce were delish. Eggplant Curry had wonderful flavour but there were pieces of CORN in it. WHY DO PEOPLE PUT CORN IN EVERYTHING?? I like me some corn on the cob, but I hate little bits of it in my food! Samosas were hot an yummy but he Veggie Pakora were a little limp. Not sure why Fish and Chips were there-- maybe for kids who don't like Indian Food?

The service was great and the offerings were plentiful. One of the better Indian buffets in the city and a much more economical option to their pricey a la carte menu.
