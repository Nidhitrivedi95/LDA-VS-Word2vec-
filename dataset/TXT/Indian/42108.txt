Qfn9qbWKPsfkFZDQzw7kCQ When I enter a south Asian - Indian or Pakistani restaurant for lunch I a really want a buffet. I got the coconut chicken curry which was really good. I did however upgrade the plain naan to a kheema naan , the naan itself was great but I found the kheema a bit salty and the next time I would recommend just to get the naan as it is . Other than that it was a good experience.
