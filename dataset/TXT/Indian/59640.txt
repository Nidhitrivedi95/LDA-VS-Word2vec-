Zcd2yYA5ck-38duDOg6dww My hubby and I came here for our "date night" and this place didn't disappoint us at all! Highly recommend to those who want to try different/ authentic Indian food from the streets in India. Food is generally on a spicy side though and would advise those who can't handle spice to let the waiter know in advance. 

We would definitely come back for more...
