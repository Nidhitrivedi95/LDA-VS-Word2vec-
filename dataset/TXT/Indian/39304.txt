oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q I've been here several times before and always loved it, but the last few times I have noticed a drop in quality and cleanliness. The last time we were there, there were TWO hairs in our dishes (one in each). When we asked to talk to the manager, he sounded skeptical and suggested it was someone else's. How it got on a plate was a mystery, I suppose. We really didn't appreciate the suggestion that we had planted it there considering that we have been regular customers since this place opened. 

Eddies - get yourself together and go back to the way you were! There are other, better Hakka places and if you don't improve your cleanliness (at the very least!), you will lose your loyal clients.
