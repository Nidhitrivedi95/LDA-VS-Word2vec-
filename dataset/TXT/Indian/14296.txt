c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg This place has great South Indian décor and a good variety of South Indian specialties on the menu. Tough tasty, I found the food a bit too spicy. (I guess that's the way it is supposed to be in India, but it could be a little to severe for Canadians or Canadianized Indians). The Shrimp Masala was excellent and so was their Sukha Mutton. Service was quick.
Make sure you have enough place on your table before you order the Paper Dosa.
