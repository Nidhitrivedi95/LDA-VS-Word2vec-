KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ I ordered take out and was not disappointed!  I have been craving butter chicken since I returned from a trip abroad and have yet to find anything decent. I stumbled across this place and was pleasantly surprised! It was delicious! It was pretty expensive but they give you quite a bit of chicken, wish there was more rice and naan bread! Also wish they would make a lunch specials (smaller portions/ cheaper price) if so, I would be here everyday! I have yet to try any of there other dishes, since the butter chicken was very addicting! I'll be back again and again if not just for the butter chicken alone!
