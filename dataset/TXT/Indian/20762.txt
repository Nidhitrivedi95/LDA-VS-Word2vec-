I've eaten here a few times and had a few different dishes. Basically big hearty portions and the vegetables are flavourful and still have a snap to them.
Order the dhalpurri, but split it in 1/2 and save the rest for later because it's biiiig! Not too much gravy, so you're not fumbling over something soggy. It's hearty and the potatoes are well cooked. Wished the goat wasn't sold out.
