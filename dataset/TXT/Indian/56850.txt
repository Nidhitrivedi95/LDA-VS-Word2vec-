xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw My boyfriend and I were visiting Arizona and as we were visiting the Heard Museum he told me  what Fry Bread is and how he hasn't had any in years, but that it's delicious. So I went on Yelp and found this place.
This is your "made with love" kind of place. Feels like there's a grandma in the back making the food. It's just SO good.
I had the fry bread with beef stew, and my boyfriend had the Ultimate Taco. Delicious. We ended up coming back the next day where he had the same thing and I tried the Hominy stew. It was my first time trying Hominy and I honestly wasn't a fan of it but the broth was still really good. I just liked the beef stew better. But the frybread! So good. If I had to describe the taste I'd best put it as a Zeppole and Naan bread had a baby. 
The pricing is also great, about $8 for the stew and bread together which is very filling. About $3 for the bread alone. I later on stopped by a fair and saw them selling fry bread far more expensive, so get it here instead!
