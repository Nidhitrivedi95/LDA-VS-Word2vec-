5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q Ordered takeout on a weekend at 8:30pm. We had several major concerns. 
1. While I ordered using Eat24 - the restaurant seemed to cancel that order and instead insisted on a "cash" transaction. It seemed unethical. When asked they said "oh that's for promotion ". 
2. The restaurant was completely empty - another big concern. 
3. The food was far below par:
A/ paneer tikka had 4 tiny pieces, and to our surprise, a small piece of chicken. It seems that the cook scooped out the chicken and added a few paneer pieces. I think it is a cause of concern, specially since vegetarian folks may have certain expectations. We are not vegetarian however. 
B/ the Chennai goat curry was inedible because the meat was tough. 
C/ even the gulab jamun was hard and extra sweet. 
D/ the rice "Kheer" was bland and we did not touch one of the 2 we had. 

On top of it the server was rude.  All in all - disgusted. Never again
