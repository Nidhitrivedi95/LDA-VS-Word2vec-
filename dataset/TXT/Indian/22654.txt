I'm not sure that I've been to another place with such a wide variety of dosas. I highly recommend the chettinad dosas, the vindaloo dosas, and the red onion uttapam. The flavour profile of these dosas is very different from a lot of the dosas I've tried at different places. I'm looking forward to trying the gongura and the achari style next visit. The idli and the vada look very enticing.
