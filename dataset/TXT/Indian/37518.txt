Wow. Rudest service EVER!!!
So, I'm in town visiting and ordered from these guys two times this week already by text. (2nd time two items out of six in the order were wrong, and one was missing.)

Tried ordering a third time. Text them the order. 30 mins later, no reply - text again to see if they got it. By the time an hour passes, still no reply, so I call in. 

The lady can't find my order. So I give it to her again. She asks for the address, which I give her. And asks for the postal code. I don't know the postal code because I'm just renting this place a couple weeks, and tell her this. She seemed irritated right off the bat to have to talk to me at all - like, sorry that giving you business is an inconvenience for you (?!). She tells me it's impossible to place an order without the postal code. I point out it's been fine two other times, it hasn't been a problem before, and I don't know it. It's on a major street, very near to them - not even like its obscure or anything. She virtually YELLS at me that it's IMPOSSIBLE to place an order without it and HANGS UP on me.

Floored. She went from mildly irritated to right off the deep end in about 3 minutes. 

I wouldn't even order from them if I could, now, cause based on that complete psycho overreaction, I'm confident they'd spit in the food or worse if they were even mildly annoyed with you.
