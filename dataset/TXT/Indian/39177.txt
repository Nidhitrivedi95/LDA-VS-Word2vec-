We were incredibly disappointed and would never go back. The samosa were very good.  Two of my daughters had the chicken curry. One said this doesn't taste like chicken.  I tasted it and actually spit it out on the table. The chicken was actually bad and had a foul smell. The waitress apologized, but didn't seem to be that upset that the chicken was rancid. They did take the two dishes off of our bill. The rest of our meals were OK.  Doubt that I would go again. Food was overpriced and service very slow.
