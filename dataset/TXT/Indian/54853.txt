WNI1VWmXV_liHnF7u2MklA One dish had hair in it, which our server initially tried to convince us was a piece of ginger, so we held up the long piece of hair for his closer inspection. He agreed it was hair and brought us a replacement dish. The butter chicken contained pieces of chicken that were so over cooked and dry, it inedible, so we left that dish. They did nothing in the way of offering us complimentary dessert or not charging us for the dish with the hair. Will not be back.
