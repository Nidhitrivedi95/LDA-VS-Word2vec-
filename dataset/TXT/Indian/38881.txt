Elegant ambience, freshly made authentic food, presented with care. Aspects you will find only in a few scattered upscale restaurants in the big cities. 
And make an effort to talk to the owner and the chef if possible. Their foodie passion shows through. 
Our particular recommendations for vegetarians include Vada Pav, a Mumbai street food elevated to another level, coconut curry modified on request to fit vegetarian taste buds. 
A hidden gem, which provided a pleasant surprise for us while visiting Las Vegas.
