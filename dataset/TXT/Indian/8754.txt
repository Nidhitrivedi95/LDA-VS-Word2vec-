Their fish malabari and saffron paneer are not things I've seen at other Indian restaurants that are flavourful and delicious. They have a kitchen that looks onto the restaurant which is nice, because I've read that people who work in kitchens with a "view" have better workplace mental health. The tables are set nicely with tablecloths and are neat. It's a good versatile place to come with family, friends, or on a date. In the daytime or evening in the summer, some of their tables have great views. That being said, my one critique of this restaurant would be that their wait staff is pretty high-strung. They seem constantly panicked and I've never had a conversation with them that extends beyond "ok what do you want" and "ummm I'll take...". Considering how often I am there I should have build a rapport with the staff but have not.
