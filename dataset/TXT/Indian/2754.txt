0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w I have tried a ton of Indian food but never had the pleasure to Nepalese so I was instantly excited to try out this place.  The decor was nice and understated. Waiters were super attendant and polite!  So off to a good start.

What we ordered:
Momos
Jhane ko dal
Aloo tama bodi
Lamb Briyani
Raita

When asked how hot - we selected medium. Im not a fan of super hot - I much prefer deep rich flavour. We were assured that medium would be the right selection (mild - too bland, and hot would have too much heat). They were right. The medium was perfect - deep rich flavours and just a hint of warmth which is perfect on a cold day.

The food itself was cooked to perfection. The lamb was cooked enough to be "cooked" but still melt in your mouth soft.   Aloo tami bodi was a potato dish with bamboo and black-eyed peas in a rich yummy sauce. The momos came with a lentil mustard sauce that my companion ate with a spoon (it was that good).

Even with many alcoholic drinks the final tally was quite inexpensive! Which is rare for a unique dining experience downtown.

I give it 4 stars only because I have no base of reference to know if this is the best of the best of Nepalese food - but it was definately fantastic and I will be back again (and again and again).
