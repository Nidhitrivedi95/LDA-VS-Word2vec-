TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw My experience with dining at Indian restaurants are pretty much buffet, buffet, non-buffet, and buffet. India Palace is probably my 2nd favorite right now but it's probably still a 3.5 star place. It's located on the south side of Twain some where between Swenson and Paradise.  It's not in the best locations but it's not that far from the Strip or University which is always good.

They offer a lunch buffet M-F for pretty much the same price as every other Indian lunch buffet north of $10. The selections aren't huge but for what they offered mostly delicious. Again I'm not that experienced with Indian food so I don't even know what the dishes are called so I made a plate of everything I liked and took a pic. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/india-palace-las-vegas?select=vWiliowVruUMaseO6VB4sA#HZgrIxObIsFSwoe5_ea8lQ There were a couple dishes which seemed spicier than the other places I've been to and I really enjoyed. The garlic naan here was the best I've had. The red chicken was spicy just the way I liked it. There's potential to be my favorite place but I couldn't, I only really liked maybe 3 or 4 of the items on the buffet.

At the time there was a free lassi with Yelp check-in unfortunately they only accepted one for our entire party but I got it haha. The mango lassi was good, great way to end the meal.

The interior is nice with many tables and a few TV's playing Indian movies. It seemed like a pretty full bar. Their parking situation isn't great. Sevice was alright. I'd be back, during day.
