UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA This place has amazing Indian food but the restaurant tried scamming me on my credit card. My bill was $59 and change and I was pretty generous with the tip. Left a $12 cash tip. The day after I looked on my credit card statement they gave them selfs an extra $12 tip and I was over charged even after giving them a generous tip.  So I called Mint Indian Bistro told them about my situation and was told that I would be refunded what I was over charged its been over 5days now and I still haven't seen what was over charged back on my credit card. I'm glad I checked my statements and I wonder how often this happens to other guests that dine at this place.
