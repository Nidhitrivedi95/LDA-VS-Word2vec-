iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA Was driving back home from North Phoenix and thanks to Yelp found this little spot near PV mall.  Did my usual takeout, order a glass of wine, read a few chapters of my current novel.  Wish they had a bar area to sit at and read my book, but they accommodated me perfectly at a 2-top.  I nearly always order eggplant Bartha, garlic naan and raita.  Their's was excellent.  And a nice bonus, they include four of their condiments (tamarind sauce, cilantro/mint/chile, their own hot sauce and raita) with the order. If I'm in the area I will be back.
