arDp3i7B_ULDsbZcYk_57A I ordered the butter chicken roti and the sauce had too much water in it and didn't have the best butter chicken flavor in Toronto. It seemed to have less cream than I was expecting. It did have a lot of chicken which is hard to find around here. Overall it was alright. The service was top notch. Price wise it's on par with everything else in the area. I'll give it another go!
