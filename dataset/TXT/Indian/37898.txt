ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw This was my first experience eating at an Indian restaurant.  It was a group dinner that was served family style and I had no idea what I was eating.  We didn't order off of menus, someone picked the dishes and we all sampled everything.  I wish I asked what the heck I was eating because it was awesome.....however, I was too caught up in the great conversation I was having with friends and my Wife took care of putting stuff on my plate to sample, so I didn't get the names of the dishes.

The service was very good.  They made sure our plates were always full.  The only downside is that their credit card machine is old school and takes forever to close out a check.

I know this is a useless review for 90% of the people out there, but for those who haven't tried Indian food, I recommend giving it a try.....I was pleasantly surprised and can't wait to go back and try more dishes....this time I'm taking notes.
