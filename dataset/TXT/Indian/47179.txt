TAnzFr9NixvCbvUdJMWL5Q This is, hands down, my favorite Indian food restaurant in Phoenix. We ordered samosas, chicken lollipop, paradise special chicken biryani and dum ka murgh. Oh and garlic naan. The flavors in the food were so rich and multifaceted and I loved everything we ate. But my favorite was the dum ka murgh. We ordered it medium spicy, which was perfect for us, and the heat really tasted like it came from the blend of spices and not just an addition of red pepper flakes. We will definitely be back. And we'll be bringing friends.
