JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng Wow! This is the best South Indian food in US. I travel a lot and have done a lot of Indian places including big names in LA, NY city and Dallas etc. No place beats this. 

Very true to the name, Aroma of spices and fresh cooking is evident as soon as you step the foot in the door. Spacious, open, well lit and great food/customer service. Wow!
