5OHW43gqdoWOGWDmUmps6A I ordered their combo of 2 chicken dishes including their butter chicken. It came with a little bit of rice, naan, chickpeas, and rice pudding. I also ordered extra somasas. I thought that the food was very salty (and I usually put salt on everything.) The samosas were quite greasy, and they don't give you enough tamarind sauce for the samosas. I asked for some extra rice, and the woman at the counter did not want to give me any-- I asked for extra rice, so I can eat it with the sauce. To be frank, I have had a lot better food and for less money.

I was quite disappointed. I will try another Indian restaurant in the future.
