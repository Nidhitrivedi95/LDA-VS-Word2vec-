gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A 2 years later and this is STILL THE BEST INDIAN FOOD IN LAS VEGAS!!! Its a must-do every time I come to Vegas (which is about twice a year)

I am always amazed when I come here. Always get seated immediately, service is friendly, fast, efficient. Food is INSANELY good. I don't know how they get the nan so light that it practically melts in your mouth. Prakash, the owner, will always greet you and make sure that you are well taken care of. He is a kind and gentle soul, and genuinely cares about his patrons. Wish all restaurant owners were the same.

I don't know what else to say - I just can't recommend it more highly!
