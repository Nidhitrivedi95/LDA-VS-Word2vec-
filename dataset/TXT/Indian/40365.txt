pns5NH--mhuCC1vK-xbYsA A+  Wow, I was unprepared for the unbelievable food I just had!  The samosas were perfect and my curry was on point.  Traveling from out of town. I was faced with hundreds of decisions of where to eat (mostly chain places). Glad I chose a family run authentic Indian restaurant. Will add this place to my list of favorites.
