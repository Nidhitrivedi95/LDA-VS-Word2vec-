ViF5Kd7pBF1JJhlvEy1kpA I'd rate customer service 4stars- the guy was very welcoming and even explained to us what the different dishes were. But since I'm sure most of us are interested in how the food is-that's what I'll focus on. We did the buffet which was good but could be better. They had four vegetarian/vegan options which was great; however the paneer was incredibly spicy and salty. I would say though that the naan was perfect! I love the rice that Indian restaurants serve but since we were there an hour before the end of their buffet time, they came out with a different kind of white rice. Besides the salt factor, the food really wasn't bad. I've seen a few more options though at other places for buffet. The place does have a nice, unique setting though. Makes for a semi-romantic evening out but it also reminds me of a dance studio with the check out counter on a stage and the number of speakers.
