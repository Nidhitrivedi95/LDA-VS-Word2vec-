lVdrCvhjbk-E_6AeJo5ovw Although I agree the portions were large, the food was bland and lacking any distinct flavour. The meals are extremely overpriced. I had their Kobe Special Steak for $28 and it was horrible. The steak was a horrible cut and chewy. Definitely not worth the $28 that we paid for it. It felt and tasted like a low cut steak you would buy at the Food Basics down the street. A dinner for 3 was $110 tax and tip. I was the only one who could finish my dinner, with the other two patrons not able to get through half of it. The servers are a little too attentive, removing our glasses of water even before we paid the bill. Definitely will not be returning.

What really annoyed me more than anything was the use of processed cheese on the steak...like really?
