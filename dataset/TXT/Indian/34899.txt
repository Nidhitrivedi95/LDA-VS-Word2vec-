Usually, it's associated with trying to make more from you off something else (once they get you in), or just offering you something at a discount because it was way overpriced to begin with.  Then there are those deals that are so low because it's crappy food (like many of the prime rib specials.) Well, Tamba doesn't fit into any of those categories, but they have a genuine deal: a $12.95 lunch buffet!

And it's not the type of buffet that you're accustomed to running away from.  There are a variety of reasons I stay away from buffets these days, but Indian buffets tend to be an exception. Quality food, and wait for it...fresh food. Shocker!  I had salad with mint chutney, potatoes, rice, marsala, chicken tandoori, and a few other things I can't all remember.  Most of the items contain a description above it, but when I was struggling, one of the employees noticed and gave me a suggestion in a kind matter.  He didn't make me feel dumb at all for not knowing what some things were.

It's a pretty nice restaurant too, quite large and relaxing ambience, really dim.  It's nice to feel relaxed at a buffet, rather then rushing through buffet lines or worrying that the person in front of you is gonna get it before you.  There was none of that here (at least when I went).  I'm surprised it wasn't more crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but I'm not going to complain.  The waiter filled my drinks up frequently and was really polite.

When I want a quality affordable large meal in Vegas, I know where I'll be having lunch.
