cu1CvIzOyf-R91pT92NShw Don't bother ordering an appetizer before your main course because they bring out each course whenever they feel like. We were also asked if we would like our drinks (Royal Falooda) brought out as a dessert and after specifying that we'd like it with our appetizers, came out with the mains. Don't bother complaining either because they will just stand there, look at you dumb, say "oh" and walk away. So visit this place if you like to enjoy your appetizers hot and main food cold because it will just sit there.
