UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg Banjara Indian Cuisine sits neatly tucked on the south-west corner of Christie Pitts park, in a location once occupied by a second-rate coffee shop called 'Coffee Tip'.  The mater paneer is creamy with a hint of sweetness, the daal curry melts in your mouth and the bainngan bharta has just enough spice to motivate your hand to reach for a kingfisher.  The naan is perfect.  The atmosphere continues to improve since their opening in or about 2005.  There is no doubt that Banjara is the best indian place west of Yonge - and a case could be made that it tops the list city wide.
