yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw I took the advice below me on yelp and made a reservation. We came in ten minutes early and our table was all ready and set to go. The service was pretty good, which I was thankful for because the reviews below me scared me. However, it was 530, pretty early for a Saturday night so it was not busy. 

We ordered some garlic naan, the lamb boti kabab, and the gosht rogan josh (another lamb dish). The naan was tasty and warm. The lamb kabob was amazing! The pieces of lamb were HUGE and super tasty. The gosht rogan josh was extremely tasty as well, however I would have preferred more meat as opposed to so much curry along with it. However this food was amazing and by far the best Indian food I have had in Phoenix!
