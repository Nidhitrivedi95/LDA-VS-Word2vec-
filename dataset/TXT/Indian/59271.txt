yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug Amazing Indian buffet with twice the vegetarian options than regular Indian buffets. The garlic naan is the best I have tried.(Freshly made). They bring it to you to your table, it is not out out the buffet but I is still included in the price of $12.99 per person.   The spice level is just wonderful, it is a little higher than mild (which stands out from most buffets) Definetly best Indian food in town.  We went at 1pm and there was not wait. Clean place and friendly staff.
