0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Best restaurant in Mississauga. We love the sweet & spicy crispy chicken and green beans.  The owner is a very quiet, kind man and he is always ALWAYS there. The servers are attentive and friendly. Be prepared to wait longer for takeout food on Friday and Saturday, as they have become very popular over the last few years. Otherwise, takeout usually only takes 20-25 minutes.

It's the best! You won't regret it.
