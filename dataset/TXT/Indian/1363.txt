-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Delicious South Indian, all vegetarian food like none other I have found in Pittsburgh!  A little out of the way but well worth a visit.  Usually the place is full of families and other taste-seekers.

Try the channa batura for an enormous puffy fried bread (aka "meteor bread.")  They also have nice dosas and interesting appetizer platters with lentil doughnuts and other fried spicy treats.  They also do a nice pulled Mysore coffee.  Interestingly, they don't ask how spicy you want your food....but usually there hasn't been a problem and I am pretty weak.
