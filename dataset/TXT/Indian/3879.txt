0zTLMQOZhiCp9GFtegiFsw This is a family owned restaurant and very welcoming. Paul and his wife are super nice people and constantly check up on you. There was quite a selection to choose from. Their chicken rice was SOOO GOOD!! The palak paneer was tasty and the naan was serve fluffy and warm. It's honestly very homemade and SO GOOD. They do make a nice and sweet mango lassi. They do turn it up on the spice level but luckily for me, there are mild options to chose from as well. Definitely a place to try for sure!!
