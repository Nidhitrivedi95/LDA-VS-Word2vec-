cVdBHFoDjJZX9JOh-1GWHw worst Indian food I have ever tried. soup looked like it had been boiling much too long in the microwave. rice was clingy and almost wet. not tasty. asked for a spoon for the soup but they didn't have takeout spoons. got metal spoon which was so dirty I wouldn't have put it in a dishwasher before rinsing it. only person I saw working there seemed annoyed I woke him  ( laying down on bench and appeared to be asleep when I walked in around 5 pm ) . had to pay cash because he didn't know how to work debit machine. won't be back.
