Sd1UqBycilIJO-m9Cmmz8g I live pretty close to this place, and have called in orders for pick up a few times. The food is quite good, and the prices are comparable to the other Indian restaurants in the neighbourhood. I am not sure why this place has received such poor reviews. To be honest, I actually prefer the food here over Banjara, as it is less rich and does not make me feel sick after I eat it (like Banjara does). I recommend this place, and hope it gets more support from the community in the upcoming months.
