ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Came here for some take out the other day and had the ol wtf?! moment when I got home. Here's why...
The Cabana Salad with added chicken tikka ($10.50) was disturbingly poor. First off, for it to be even a $8 salad (w/o the chicken added) is insulting. It's similar to a side salad you get at McDonalds (yes, this exists). It even had shredded cheddar cheese on top. I'll repeat this. CHEDDAR CHEESE and chicken tikka. Together. WHY? To boot, the tomatoes were wilted, the chicken tikka was dryer than a popcorn fart and I would comment on the dressing but they forgot to give it to me. So, know this going in, they can't even make a salad right... and it costs over ten dollars.  

The rest of the meal was a step up (how could it not be?) from the salad. The Chana Masala was average (a bit greasy) and the naan was baamb. 

My advice? Grab an order or two of naan and dip it in your fave sauces at home. Better yet, find a place that makes great naan and something else to dip it in. NEXT!
