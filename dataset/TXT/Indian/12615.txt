AZs4XoJ5Tliiu_yC2rZ0-w The samosas at Gazebo are perfectly airy, crispy and light, with well-balanced spice, and the dipping sauce is spot-on as well. The price is right, too, and most of all, the family members who greet you are lovely. On other occasions I've had their ladoos, which were as close as I've had them in India, if I may be so bold, ha. I'll be going back to happily make my way through the menu. I highly recommend this little takeaway gem, hidden away in a suburban strip mall not too far from Square One.
