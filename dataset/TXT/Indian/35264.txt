MrwnT4FCdcLd_GmQPGJMyg Ok this is my review for 07/04/15 - We visited Samosa Factory with my sister and  other family  after hearing very good reviews from my sister.

Food Quality - 1 star
1. I would say it is totally overrated. I realized after a quick bite from my Thali. Well food was mediocre range and total disappointment. Not sure all reviews ...

Cold Thali ? - 0 stars
1. Yes we realized at 11.57 am purchased Thali was cold and I thought it was just mine. Immediately every one said same that the food was cold. My sister went inside immediately to let them know that food was cold and asked if it was today's food. The reply we got was the person at the counter says --- of course we are always fresh food. He than looks at the food warmers and all burners are off and the water was left in cold. No wonder our food was let in cold.

2. What pissed me off was they never offered us to even consider to replace our thalis since it was there mistake. Well they are busy and they gave me a weird look as "who cares dude please move on ?"

3. My sisters Father in law got sick after an hour threw up...so confirms the cold food left over all morning.

Sweets - 5 stars
1. Sweets are awesome.. no doubt they are best. All tasted very fresh and good. Jalebi top notch, milk cakes, and other sweet dont know names but all tasted the best. 

All of the above adds up 1,0,5  and my rating is 2 stars. 

Advice - Please be courteous and after we mention the food was not warm and that too admitting there mistake should have avoided my uncle from food poisoning.

Any ways.. this is my review.

Thank you.
