DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg It really doesn't get better than Udupi!  Their food is amazing.  I recommend the lunch buffet as you get a great variety of food.  Dinner is great as well and the Gobi Manchurian is a must!  They recently went through a slight remodel and the place looks great.  Service is absolutely phenomenal.
