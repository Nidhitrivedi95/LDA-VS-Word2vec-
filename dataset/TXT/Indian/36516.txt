NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Indian food (fast casual concept) with family and friends.  Excellent food quality for the experience and style of restuarant.  You order at the counter and then wait for your buzzer to go off to retrieve your meal.

Large upright clay ovens lined up in a row behind the glassed-in kitchen gives you an open look into the cooking and prep process for your meal...great idea!  Watching the folks prepare the hooked meats to a perfect char and the process for oven-grilled Naan was fascinating.  Now on to the actual food!

The chicken tikka masala had great flavor and the chicken was very tender and juicy.  The tikka sauce was perfect for dipping the Naan, and served on the side so you could control how much to put on your main dish or simply use as a side.  The samosa order contained three small vegetable-stuffed samosa with a bright, fresh mint sauce.

Great meal in a unique atmosphere.  Will definitely return.
