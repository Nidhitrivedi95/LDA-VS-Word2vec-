3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Tasty no doubt. Just got take out though, so obviously can't comment on the service. 

Food was fresh and not greasy. Ordered a paneer dish, the eggplant bharta, and a chicken dish with two naan. The daily chicken special was the best dish- however sadly I have no idea what it was if I wanted to order it again! 

Found it a bit expensive ($43) and not as flavourful as the Indian I'm used to on Gerrard. Dammit. Bring on the grease?
