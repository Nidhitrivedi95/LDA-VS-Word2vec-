-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Very clean and spacious restaurant. You walk in and it smells so good! Nandini has THE ONLY buffet I will eat at. Normally I don't like buffets but over lunch, their buffet is a fave of mine. It's inexpensive ($7.95 I believe at the time of this review) and has great food and most of my favorite Indian dishes, plus it comes with naan delivered to your table.  The location is convenient- just a mile or so off the 101 at Broadway. The owner has been there every time we've gone and he's extremely friendly and talkative. I highly recommend this restaurant!
