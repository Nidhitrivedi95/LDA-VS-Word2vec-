vfSyQNaDyenryrYIC4Nu6w It was my first time trying authentic Indian food and I must say I got pleasantly surprised! I usually find it difficult to get vegetarian food that's good enough to satisfy me, but this little place makes me want to never stop eating. I liked it so much I took the metro and bus for an hour and a half the next day to bring back some for my mother and I. It's been three days now and I still can't wrap my head around how cheap everything is! What usually costs one person is plenty enough for two. 
This place is really a must, trust me!
