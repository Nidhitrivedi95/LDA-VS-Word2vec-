OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg The Host offers a good selection of food, including my favourite palak paneer with garlic naan. They have a nice patio, which is perfect for those hot summer days. Service is superb and the quality of food is pretty good. It's not my favourite Indian restaurant in the city, but it's definitely in my top 5. If you happen to be tired and hungry after a shopping spree in Yorkville, stop by The Host and have a nice meal. I don't think you'll regret it.
