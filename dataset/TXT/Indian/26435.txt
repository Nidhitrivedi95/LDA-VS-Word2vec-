ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg As an self-proclaimed Indian food connoisseur, I was very impressed with Copper.  I thought it was a good restaurant for folks who are new to Indian food and the staff was very helpful to my co-worker who was with me and had never tried it!  

They did not have the standard Indian lunch buffet, but it was affordable, large portions and you got a salad and naan.  I personally like the variety of the buffet, but the environment of Copper made up for not have one. :) 

I loved that the restaurant is in an old house, too.  There is a covered patio that was very nice to enjoy the view outside.
