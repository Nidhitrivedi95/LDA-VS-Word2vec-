QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg Amazing food, the best I have had in Pittsburgh so far. We got their Chicken 65 and Paneer Chili for appetizers, which were very very well prepared. For entree we got their Lamb Kadai,Butter Chicken, Palak Paneer and Channa Masala. I am usually not a fan of lamb at all, but I really enjoyed theirs. We got spice level 5 for everything. Some dishes were spicer than others, but all within reason, with a good kick to them. The staff is very friendly as well. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone I know.
