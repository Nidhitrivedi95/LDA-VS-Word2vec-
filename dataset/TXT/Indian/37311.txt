o8k9D05WpwgK-8BV7OH-xw I'm really sad to say this since Zykaa was one of our most favorite restaurant in the area since its opening but I gotta say that after tonight's experience, I highly doubt we'll go back. The food has become incredibly oily (I know Indian food isn't fat free and I can compare with what it used to be): shiny rice that tastes oily, oil puddles on the naan (??), etc. The service has never been quick and it was never a problem for us but tonight, we were there for 2 hours and it took 45 minutes after we were done finishing our food before the dishes were taken away. Our stomaches are definitely not happy with all this oil, even after almost 3 hours and an hour of walking to try to help digestion.
