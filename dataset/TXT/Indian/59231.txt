yy7pPm_QGVRm6exD__Htug The service at India Masala was good. I went with my friend because he said the food was so good...different taste buds. I found the food (the buffet) to be average. That's because I've had so much better. It's tough to find good Indian food in the area, and I've tried. This also is the case when there are Indian people cooking the food, so I don't get it.
