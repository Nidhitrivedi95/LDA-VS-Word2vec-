5v_nv9JgJtWHLPw8grPn-w I'm writing this review on behalf of the hubby who thought the oxtail here was amazing. In fact, he ranked it #1 on his list. I thought it was good too but oxtail in general isn't really my favorite so it wasn't as big of a deal for me as it was for the hubby who's a huge fan. This place almost always sells out around late afternoon/early evening during the week. We swung by around 6pm and they were already sold out of everything (I think they just sold not too long ago because the store was still open).
