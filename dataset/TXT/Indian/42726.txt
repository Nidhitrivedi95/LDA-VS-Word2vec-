RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg Went for a date night last night. Loud, over served regulars tried to get in a fight with a polite gentleman who asked them to try and limit their swearing. Then manager bought the regulars a round of shots. When this was mentioned to the staff. The response was " they're regulars, the other guy isn't" which was a very odd response in my opinion. Not going back.
