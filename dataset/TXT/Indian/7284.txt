5KsvP10z9InBcI6hhqjjKg An Indian buffet, what is there to say? Lukewarm food, half of which caters to the chicken-sh!t losers afraid to eat ethnic food. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food and this has to do with the spices and seasoning used, also the "slop" look of most dishes throw me off a bit, but I like it well enough but I can't go on a tangent of authenticity since I know little of its history. However the food here is passable. The service is HORRIBLE and smelly. I know, I know sounds like I'm stereotyping Indians here, but seriously 2 of the server smelled like they hadn't taken a shower in a few days and were unaware of this nifty new-fangled invention called antiperspirants or deodorants. It was disturbing. If the wait staff's hygiene is not monitored, I fear for what's going on in the back of the house.
One good thing... fresh made Naan bread.
