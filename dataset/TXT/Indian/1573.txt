-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Definitely the best buffet in town. Also very tasty south indian, one of the best I experienced in America. It actually reminds me of the Chutneys group of restaurants we have back in Hyderabad in India.
This place deserves  a 5 star and the only reason I gave a 4 is because I was refused a take out once recently which was quite surprising! My guess is that the waiter did not know what he was talking (he told me they do not offer take-aways during lunch time) but otherwise this is one of my favorite indian restaurants and I strongly recommend this to everyone who loves indian food.
