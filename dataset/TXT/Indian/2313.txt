Food is cheap. For about $6 I get a small chicken vindaloo with a samosa and Coke. I like spicy, but I ask for a 4 out of 10 so it doesn't take me two hours to endure the meal. Really hot. 

He takes calls ahead time and writes nothing down. He says that if he forgets your order, its free. 

Wish it had a better appearance, but at least you get the sense that it's the chaotic order of one man, as opposed to a lazy rotating crew.
