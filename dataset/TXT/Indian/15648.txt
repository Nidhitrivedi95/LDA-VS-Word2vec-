cVdBHFoDjJZX9JOh-1GWHw Zeera is a great Indian restaurant in Pickering. The choices of this type of cuisine is limited in the area but so I not only like that it offers what is missing but also that it delivers quality food. The location is pleasant and cosy though it's located in an unassuming plaza. I would recommend the butter chicken naan and rice. The fish tandoori is also wonderful.
