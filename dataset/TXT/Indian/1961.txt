-z_DR7omzpcR__l7MbDu0A Confession: 3 days after my first time here, I was back for more. I don't know what more I can say than that... I have been going on a tour of Indian restaurants around this area, and this was the fourth place I have been. It does not compare with the others. I truly found it to be the freshest and most flavorful Indian food I have come across, and those were just the vegetarian dishes. I love their desserts. And the staff was so nice. I will definitely be coming here as often as I can whenever the mood for Indian food strikes.
