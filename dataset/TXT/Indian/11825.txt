arP20rlnrGuX1Xker6xPzw I come here all the time for the ice cream. The lines are long in the summer, and the place is cramped, but it's definitely worth it. The ice cream is creamy and smooth. They have so many different flavours to choose from. I love the twist they put on it by adding nuts and jelly. The sherbet is delicious as well. During the winter, I don't really go. Their short eats are the same as any other South Asian place. Didn't have any special ring to them.
