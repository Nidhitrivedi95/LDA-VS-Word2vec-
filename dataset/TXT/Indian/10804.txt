A029GQG1S3ekPit6cObcBA I'm pretty impressed with the Chicken Tikka Masala here! I've gotten it multiples times and it's always good. I'm picky about meat, the chicken in it is really good and not fatty or gristly. The samosas are delicious as well. I forced myself to branch out one time and got the chicken curry, it was pretty good but I didn't feel like it had as much flavor as the Tikka Masala. I would like to come try the buffet one day, but so far have only gotten take out. Definitely worth giving this place a try!
