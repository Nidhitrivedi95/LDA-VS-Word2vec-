xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Mine was a to go. Food tasted good. No doubt about that. But the quantity of the food provided was hideous. They asked me to wait for half an hour "if you don't want half cooked food", as quoted by the guy who took the order. 6 pieces of chicken manchurian was given to me in a box. It did not even fill half of the box in which they gave it to me. And the quantity of the fried rice I ordered was the same. Either give them in small boxes so that the customer doesn't feel dejected or at least fill the box upto 75%. And yes, it does not take half an hour to cook this quantity of food. This place is disappointing.
