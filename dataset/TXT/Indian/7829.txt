6mI2kt70hiOb0UaNYXfS8w My girlfriend and I came here for Valentine's Day. We really enjoyed the idea of having a special menu for the day. It was a set menu, other than having a choice for vegetables (we ordered lentils) and 2 meat dishes, all of which were delicious. I ordered the beef tenderloin with curry and mushrooms and she ordered butter chicken and both were not too spicy. It included an appetizer (samosa and chicken), Nann bread, rice and 2 different desserts. Overall, the environment was very cozy. The only drawback was the waiting time before each course, but then again it was Valentine's Day, so it was expected to be busy.
