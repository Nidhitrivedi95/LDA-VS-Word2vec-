OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to EVER! I am Indian and I am very critical of Indian restaurants, this place blew me away. Not only was the food fantastic, the cozy atmosphere and wonderful service made the experience so much better. The prices are great and it is one of only two restaurants in the city operating a coal burning tandoor, so that chicken, lamb, fish and naan are deliciously flavored with the rustic taste. Please stop by if you are in the city, it won't disappoint!
