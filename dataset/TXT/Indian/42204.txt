qjaMwPcTyq5_JLcZpmTqNw Good humble Malayalam food place. The fish in banana leaf and chicken meen curry was pretty good. The malabar chicken biriyani was surely a disappointment. The coconut pudding is surely the eye candy of the place and taste good, it's a nice spin off to tapioca pudding (thai prep). Service however failed quite bad. If one has to call the server's to order dessert after a long wait then it's just bad. Moreover we had to wipe our table clean so that we can have a nice clean table for our dessert. They surely can UP their game by bringing some professionals and take feedback on how they should serve customers. Otherwise good place, surely will try again.
