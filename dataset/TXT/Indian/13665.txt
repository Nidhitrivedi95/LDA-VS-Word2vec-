It is comparable to lunch buffets I've really enjoyed in the Bay Area or Manhattan, both in terms of quality and variety, and very reasonably priced at $8.99.

The buffet includes a dosa and I think also a drink. I had the Tofu Manchurian, a nice chana dish I haven't had before (not Chana Masala), plain rice (there are several other choices for rice), an okra dish, some nice fresh salad, and some IEEE NaF on the side.  The masala tea came unsweetened, which is how I prefer it.   The kheer was quite tasty. And that's just scratching the surface.

If I lived in Chandler I'd want to eat here every day!   Heck, if I still lived in Tucson I'd be tempted to go there for lunch once in a while   As it is, I'll definitely be back next time I'm passing through at lunch time.

By the way, some reviews have said things about the food being cold.   I didn't have that experience--it was all the right temperature for me.   Andrea and I arrived before noon, so kind of on the early side.   I found the service to be prompt and friendly.
