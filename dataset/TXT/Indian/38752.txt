OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g My second time here and it's only gettiing  better 
I am a  lyft and uber driver and I was introduced to this spot by accident and what a great accident 
First time was the buffet beats all buffets in town, today was the al carte menu 
Both experience were too quality Indian food and I am.off Indian origin. 
All my guest if they like Indian I will get them here 
If you have not been here do yourself a favour eat here truly the best Indian in Las Vegas
