J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I love the atmosphere of this place! A great place for dates with the dim lighting and red decor. The restaurant has that formal dining room look bit for a great price. And the food tastes great! It's not oily like many other Indian restaurants. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I had samosas, and the aloo gobi.
