yLKoESPQ8BN7dn6ADzZicQ why 3 stars you ask ??? it's not my fault that yelp equates 3 stars with 'A-OK' and 4 with 'Yay I'm a fan !'. 

so, A-ok, it is.

The food is pretty good, actually it's better than bombay, but it's also more expensive. So, if you're not a student and want to avoid the college crowd ( cuz you can't help being an arrogant, pompous, prius-ownin, always-bitchin, never-workin, thinkin-you're-better-cuz-you're-twenty seven-years-old ladette) this is where you wanna come if you're craving some curry.

For the students who come here - you better hope you have a date to impress or at least it's your birthday.
