_LSwdNmiFSzRZQfG4g-qwA To give you a frame of reference...  I've been traveling the world for the past 2 or 3 years.  Indian is "comfort" food for me, so I've been to at least 20 different Indian restaurants in recent memory.

To my surprise, 259 Host was one of the best.  The service, the food, and the atmosphere exceeded all expectations.  Maybe I was really hungry - I don't know :)  The naan, the appetizers, the vegetable samosas, and the main dish were great.  Unless it's a fluke, this is one of my favorite 3 places in the world for Indian food.

I spent at least 10 minutes chatting with the waiters because I came early, and they were free to talk.  The place seems to be well-managed, and I'm pretty sure that it'll rank high on Yelp as more people check it out.

If you're in Toronto, please try it, and write about your experience.  Am I the only one who thought it was great?
