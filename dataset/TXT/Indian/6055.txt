3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA The best Indian food we've ever had! Thank you Yelp for helping us find this place.  Everything was SO delicious. Some of my favorites were:

- Palak paneer (spinach/cheese) had the perfect amount of spiciness, so delish!

- Tandoori chicken was so juicy and smokey, not dry like other places. 

- The goat meat in the goat curry was so tender and flavorful. 

Can't wait to come back next Vegas trip.
