The food here has been fantastic every time we've come.  Sometimes it's a pain in the ass to find parking, so just be aware that you might have to park further away than you might like (it can be a rough neighborhood).  Still, the food is totally worth a stroll through a dangerous neighborhood.  For real.

When we first came here, we thought our server was being REALLY rude, because he was looking at his cell phone while we ordered.  Turns out, this is how they input the orders, and they all have fancy iPhones to do it.  This is actually helpful, because they never screw up your order, which has happened to me at other Indian places in town.

The only thing that sort of bothered me last time was that they dramatically decreased the size of their kheer (the price went down, too).  It's like a little shot glass now.  Totally not worth the decreased price of $2.99.  Should be at least a dollar less for how tiny it is!  I took a picture because it was so hilariously small.
