TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I was bought here a while ago with a friend. I've never eaten Indian food. I'm hooked. This buffet style lets you check out other flavored and spices. I'd come here before 3:00 pm. The buffet starts going down hill. I've never ordered off the menu. Why? When you have so many great flavored at the buffet. I like this place. It's clean cheap and good. So many flavor hit you palette it's not even funny. I'd recommend this place to at least try it out. Olmoosedog out.
