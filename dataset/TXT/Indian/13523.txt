biVQDp3K_vNP1eK5wGZOJg I was craving for indian good very badly and kabab place is actually not too far from my place. I ordered chicken tikka masala, and samosa .. For pick up, and omg .. Chicken tikka masala was great and chicken was tender , and samosa was nice and fresh . Great food all together ..
