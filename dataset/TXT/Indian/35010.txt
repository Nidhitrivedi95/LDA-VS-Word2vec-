Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Tamba is an authentic Indian restaurant - hidden in a small plaza across from the Monte Carlo Casino.

Clean, Dimly lit, smaller tables and with Indian decor throughout - this place had a casual yet intimate atmosphere.  The service was fast and friendly - the staff seemed to genuinely appreciate our business.

We ordered authentic Indian dishes - Prawn Mackne, Classic Chicken curry & .  The dishes were generously proportioned, full of spices and flavor.  Combined with the Yelp discount - 2 dinner entrees, 3 drinks & an appetizer came out to a rather modest price of $65.00

Tamba may not be on anyone's 5 star list of restaurants - but we enjoyed an unexpected yet exceptional dining experience.
