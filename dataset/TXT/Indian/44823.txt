S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA Came across this place when I visited Las Vegas just before Christmas and wanted to find a place to have Indian food. Ordered a Chicken Biryani carryout order since dinner buffet was almost on the verge of completion.
Let me explain here - I am a food lover and can instantly say by the look of Indian restaurants on what kind of food to expect. There are different versions of "authentic" indian cuisines floating around and I must say this is not one of them.
Biryani was sweet (authentic biryani is NEVER sweet) with cashew and raisins.

Good luck with this place.
