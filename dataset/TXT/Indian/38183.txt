Oi_VMdVbXHuyLi2gxjqd5Q Have been getting takeout once every few months when passing by...There are better options at other holes in Scarborough...

If you go in too early, the food tends to be leftovers from the previous night, and it'll rot even before you reach home...

That being said, the food is usually cheap and quality isn't very bad...

The food is either fridge cold or room temperature, and it's not really meant to be eaten any later than a few hours, but has to be microwaved before consumption...

While some servers just top up the boxes, others will load the box to the brink of breaking...

Beware of the Rotis and Naans, as they're usually cooked beforehand...

The worst options:
1) Noodles/Chowmein
2) Roti/Naan
3) Fried Rice

The curries are a decent option and the vegetarian options are good too...

It's a too shabby of a place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to buy food here...
