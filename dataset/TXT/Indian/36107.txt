NVQt8iaP4wjtUSHBvIxIXw Awesome Indian food. Best in the beaches without a doubt. Prices are very fair and it's owned by the nicest family! I am a regular here and have never been disappointed. Takeout is quick and their are great combos. Only downfall is that they don't have their liquor license.. And I find Indian food always pairs well with a beer.
