They don't really cheap out on size or flavour either: they're crispy and rich on the outside and tasty with a bit of a kick on the inside. Everything else I've tried here has also been excellent (and cheap) from roti and pakoras to the large selection of Indian candies and sweets.
Be prepared for long lineups around mealtimes, but you can call ahead to set up large orders. And the parking lot can be a little crazy. I've only ever once had them run low on samosas and had to wait a few minutes which is fairly remarkable considering the hundreds they usually sell as I wait in line on a typical visit. 
Worth a stop for a snack if you're in the area.
