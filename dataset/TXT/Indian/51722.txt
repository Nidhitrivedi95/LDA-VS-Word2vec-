UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Mint is the best Indian buffet in town. I love the original location down by UNLV, but this one is even better. It's more spacious and has more food choices. My only complaint would be that it takes a very long time to get the naan bread - the first time we went, we assumed that we were supposed to wait for the man at the buffet to make it fresh for us because they didn't take our order at the table. The second time we went, the host took our order for bread, but we didn't get it until toward the end of the meal. 

Overall, the price and value is good for all the food you get.
