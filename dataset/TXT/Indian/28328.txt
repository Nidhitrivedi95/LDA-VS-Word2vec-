J9BmILDpV1Pr3GKU9XhjTQ I'm quite fond of what India has to offer on the culinary side. Little India, being around the corner of where I reside, was the first Indian restaurant I gave a chance in Toronto. I have been a frequent visitor since and they haven't disappointed me with their food yet. 

The service might be inconsistent and Indian awkwardness is never far away. However, their chicken tikka and madras and vindaloo dishes make up for it. Order a plain paratha on the side and some pakora's and samosa's to get started and you won't be starving that day. 

Four stars, because three and a half is not an option and Little India definitely outscores the other places on the Indian strip on Queen West.
