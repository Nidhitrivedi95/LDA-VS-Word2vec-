jte_XM9Zo7TX86jlKwq5gg I am Indian and this is the best Indian food I've had in Madison by far. Great selection of South Indian dishes from various states that are all really well prepared, which has been almost impossible to find at other Indian restaurants in the area. We tried the following dishes on our first visit, and all were really tasty: sambar vada (wasn't on the menu), chicken chettinadu, dosa, Gobi Manchurian, Malabar Parotta. Really kind and attentive staff as well. This is my new go to Indian spot in Madison and I will definitely be back.
