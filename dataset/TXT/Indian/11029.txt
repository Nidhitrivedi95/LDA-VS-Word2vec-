A7IQT6RYVSWkvEAbiLCdtQ For the first time in long while I found an Indian Buffet worth a review. I saw the reviews on Yelp so I decided to give the place a try. For a ten buck lunch buffet it was pretty impressive. Salad bar. Ice cream, Indian desserts and four hot tables loaded with delicious Indian cuisine.  Wide selection from chicken Kebobs to deep fried Indian fish. Did I mention ten buck?!  Great for veggers and meteors.  We got there right at 12 and it was great.  No line ups but most importantly, fresh food. Naan made to order. Must tries are the Goat Curry, chicken Kebobs and fried fish.  I hope this just isn't a grand opening thing and they keep this spread going all year round.  Comfy modern decor sets it all together nicely.  Go check this place out and tell me what you think. I give it a big three stars. I will be back for consistency checks and hopefully the same quality of good delicious chow!
