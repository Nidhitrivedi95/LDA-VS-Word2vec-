zK_6fn5ZLSkW7OhRD30IBw If in Edinburgh you must visit the Kebab Mahal. The food is tremendous and the best Indian food you will taste in the whole of the city! The price is just as amazing as the food! I defy you to find anything cheaper. The atmosphere is brilliant and very popular with students with the University near by. Stop by and check it out! You will go back again and again.
