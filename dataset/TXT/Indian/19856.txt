FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Eh. Not impressed at all. Given that I only came here for the lunch buffet, I'll allow it 3 stars. I will say that I am Indian and have grown up eating good Indian food, so maybe my standards are skewed. I can be a huge snob when it comes to Indian food. I rarely go out to eat it, but decided to come here after seeing so many good reviews for it on Yelp.

We came here for the lunch buffet ($11.95 on weekends, $9.95 on weekdays) on a weekend. The service was okayyy...kind of barely there but we were there for the buffet so I guess it didn't matter. The food was mediocre. Nothing was particularly flavorful or spicy. The chana masala was super runny, and the naan was drenched in butter. The chicken and goat pieces in the curries were not good cuts of meat. Typically you use a whole cut up chicken, but it looked like they just used boneless breast or thigh meat. This takes away a lot of flavor and the pieces don't absorb the sauce well. The goat was just all bone and fat. One of my favorite dishes is kadhai paneer, and theirs was so-so. Nice vegetables, not too overcooked, but just lacking in flavor and the paneer didn't taste very fresh. On the upside, the food wasn't super greasy and seemed better prepared than food at another Indian restaurant I've tried in Madison at a work lunch. Maybe the reviews for this place are so good because it's better than anything else in the area.

I wonder if maybe the buffet just isn't very good and it's better to come for dinner instead, but the dishes are really expensive for Indian food (~$12-15/plate, with an extra $2-3 for naan!). I've never paid that much for Indian food anywhere! It also worries me that they have North Indian and South Indian food on the menu. How are you supposed to know what to order? I've never been to a restaurant that can do both well. 

If you're looking for good, authentic Indian food, maybe stay away from the buffet, but I can't tell you if it's any better for dinner.
