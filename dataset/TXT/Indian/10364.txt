9q8JSsHC5lR6Hh16W_5ggg Service is horrible .... Place was empty and still the service was horrible. The young lad looked like he rolled out of bed and when he asked how was everything I told him food was not anywhere close to what I have eaten he was silent , he said nothing .... Then why do you ask ????? We ordered for veg hot and sour soup with chicken lollipops as starters, the soup came but the lollipop came after the manchurian rice was left on the table with out any of the other main dishes ordered. The broccoli and beef had no taste, it was boiled food with salt and pepper, the lollipops are not like they used to be saucy , they are dry now. This place is no longer my go to for good Hakka.
