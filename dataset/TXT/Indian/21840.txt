gJm6XxUQ7uHlrh8Y8fRiuw 4 stars for food...the super gyro and falafel were great.

2 stars for service. The place was packed, and only 2 employees.  I think the owner was working the register and there was 1 harried looking kid in the kitchen.  On a busy Saturday, that wasn't the ideal. Food was coming out to tables out of order, partial orders, and amid confusion.  Took 25 minutes to get our food.

In the end tho, the food was great.
