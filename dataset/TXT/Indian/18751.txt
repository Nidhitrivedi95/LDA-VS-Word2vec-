eJWTlUL96op0xa8dVPIGzw Om nom nom. I've not been to the other Bombay Bhel's, so my review might not be as useful as some of the others, but I felt that the food here was decent. I ordered take out as I didn't have time to enjoy a sit down meal (toddlers, amiright?), but husband and I was happy full by 2/3rd of the meal so we would call it a slight win?

My biggest irk: I couldn't find prices online anywhere. The website posts a menu, but there are no dollar amounts attached to it - so I've posted their take out menu here. Also, I ordered a Thali (based on other reviews), and I was surprised to find out it cost me 17 bucks. Or something, I still don't know how much the Thali was - simply because it's not even on their take out menu. All I know is, I ordered a chicken thali and a palak paneer, and the meal came out to around $35. Which is a bit bonkers, but how can I argue? I didn't know the prices ahead of time!

The palak paneer was good, but a bit rich - the paneer was yummy. The chicken thali was very filling - husband was very content with sizing and assortment (he loved the dessert the best). I thought the tandoori chicken was well flavoured and juicy.

Would I order from here again? Probably, but it probably won't be my first choice as I'd rather pick up from somewhere else. If ever I decide to dine in, I'll give it a go here.
