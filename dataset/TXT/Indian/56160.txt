xMhpJZaj4QT1Soh76-E2CA OMG! One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to EVER. Fresh. Not greasy. Owners are very passionate and enthusiastic about serving you. When we ordered naan bread, they gave us this one HUGE garlic naan. It was probably the best naan bread I've ever had. Pillowy, soft, with layers.

Anyhow, I'm really encouraging you guys to try this place. It's awesome. Prices are good too. Very affordable. Not pretentious.
