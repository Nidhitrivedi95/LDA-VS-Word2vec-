-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Inconsistent is an understatement. The first time my husband and I came here the food was great and the service was very attentive. The only complaint was the ridiculous pricing for the tiny ration of food. This time around the service was extremely slow and lacking which doesn't make sense for a not busy Saturday dinner service at a restaurant. My husband had to get up to ask for a beer. He also then had to get up a second time to get a cold glass for the beer. It also took forever to get our appetizer. The appetizer came out just a handful of minutes before the meal. 
Now the first time I ate here the aloo gobi was great. Portion was small, but it was a flavorful assortment of cauliflower and potato and tomato. 
This second time around, the aloo gobi was watery, bland, and at the most there were two little bits of potato and hardly any cauliflower. The rest of the mixture was just straight up red onion. Not to forget, there was absolutely no spice. I ordered it medium and got ridiculous bland. I also don't think it helped that the food was served lukewarm. 
Not sure the hubby and I will be back after the two extremely different experiences we had.
