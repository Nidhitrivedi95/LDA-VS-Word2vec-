QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg My favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The staff is extremely friendly and will go out of their way to make you happy. Lots of smiles and thank yous, which I love.

The food is consistently excellent. Just wish they had buffets in the evening once in awhile. Other than that, try this place and you'll be a repeat customer for life.
