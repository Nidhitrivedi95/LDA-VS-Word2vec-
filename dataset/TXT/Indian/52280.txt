UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I can't sing enough praises about the food here. Simply amazing. Came in a little over an hour before closing, which can mean old food and crummy service, but that definitely didn't happen. Had the Dhal, veg samosa, garlic butter naan, veg biryani, chicken masala, and spiced hot tea. Everything had a 1-10 spice option, I went with 7. Superb! The dhal was absolutely loaded with flavor and spice. I love that Indian food (when done right) doesn't even need meat. Next time I will order veg masala because the flavor was such that meat was totally not needed. The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. I don't give out 5 stars easily, but if I could give a 6, I would. This restaurant truly takes me back to The Flavors I experienced in India, and I would recommend it every day of the week!
