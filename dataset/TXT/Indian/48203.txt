I've been to Saravanaa Bhavan multiple times, a couple of years ago. It never was my "go to" place for dosa, but after an extremely unhealthy-greasy feeling at Guru Lukshmi one time, Saravanaa became a recent first-pick. 

My dad and I decided to try the weekend vegetarian buffet. The restaurant gets super busy and for the South Indian food lover, this could be paradise. However, for a person like me who goes for selective items only (dosa, idli, chutney), this didn't exactly strike much of a chord in my heart. The dosa was subpar and I found the supply limited and fleeting. Every 20-25 minutes, the staff put out dosas that were gone in 5-10 minutes. Same story with idli. 

It was fantastic having all-you-can-eat coconut chutney though. A lot of places skimp out on that one in particular. 

Overall, an okay experience. I probably wouldn't return for a buffet. I'd like to select my kind of crisp dosa next time.
