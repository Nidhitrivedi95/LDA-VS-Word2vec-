-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g We have been looking for a great Indian restaurant since we moved to Phoenix three years ago and we finally found it.  We enjoyed two mouth-watering dinners, Tandoori Chicken and the Chicken Curry, with a side of garlic naan. Tasty with just the right spicy heat.  Glad the owners call it CUISINE because they are right in every respect. The servings are generous and the left-overs were just as good the following day for lunch.  We plan to go back soon.  Another wonderful family-owned restaurant that deserves a great review. Please consider another place in the Arcadia area of town. We need to have Nandini closer to us to visit weekly.
