CqWAtOvZgwb_oxVq1f0ORQ When you drop a chicken utensil carrying some chicken gravy into the paneer - you have lost me. I am a vegetarian - if you are doing it, do it right. People who serve the food shouldunderstand the "BIG DEAL" about having them separate. I cannot trust that you have it clean now? Can I? Also, why would you keep veg/non-veg close by to create this confusion? Keep them a little apart - and satisfy the customers. Food is fine, nothing ahaaa! or ohooo! about It :D
