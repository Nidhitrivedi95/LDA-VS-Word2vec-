o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala from here for takeout last night and it was among the best I've ever had! I ordered the hottest spice option and wasn't disappointed--enough burn to make it exciting without overwhelming the awesome creamy tomato goodness! I can also attest the samosa and garlic naan were excellent! The latter was generously covered in garlic and appeared to have been baked in a brick oven.  It paired perfectly with my entrée. The restaurant itself looked like a cool place to eat. It had a kind of hip urban vibe to it--glazed concrete floors with cool Indian characters (Hindi?) on the walls and the super friendly staff were in the process of decorating for Diwali.  I'm definitely coming back and going to try to get my friends to join me sometime.

Quick update: I'd originally given this place 4 stars. I just finished last night's leftovers and now feel the full five is fully justified!
