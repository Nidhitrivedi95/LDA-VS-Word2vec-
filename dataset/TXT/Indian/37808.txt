ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw The food here is amazing! We loved it so much we ate here two nights in a row. Both eggplant dishes are delicious, we had the potatoes with cashews and raisins which was to die for, the naan is perfect, and there are lots of vegetarian/vegan options. The wait staff is very friendly and on top of it as well. The restaurant is beautiful.
