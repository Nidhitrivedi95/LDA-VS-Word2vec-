RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Best Indian/Pakistani food I have had in Canada. The prices are little high but I think it is returned with the atmosphere of the restaurant. 

So my favorite dish is the chicken tikka masala. The food is a bit oily but that is only a minor drawback of an otherwise fantastic meal. The food is full of flavor and color and it is obvious that all of their food is made from scratch and in house.

Be sure to have the Kulfi before you leave. A frozen treat that ends with a little surprise!
