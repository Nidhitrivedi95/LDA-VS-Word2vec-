t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg This Indian restaurant is a gem and is definitely worth visiting, especially if you live in the NW part of the valley.  I took my family and my sister's family from California and all seven of us absolutely loved the dining experience.  

We started off with vegetable samosas, which were full of potatoes, peas, and maybe some carrots.  While the pastry could have been a tad thinner and lighter, it was delicious nevertheless.  For $5, we got two large samosas.

For our main course, we ordered chicken tikka masala, chana (chick peas) masala, tandoori chicken, garlic naan, chili fish, and garlic shrimp.  The last two items were part of the Indo-Chinese section of the menu.  Every one of the dishes was well-prepared, nicely presented, and very flavorful.   

The restaurant was clean and spacious with ample parking.  I have been to 8 or 9 different Indian restaurants in Las Vegas and this one is one of the best.
