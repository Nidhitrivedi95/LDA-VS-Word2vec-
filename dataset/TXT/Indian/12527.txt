aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ Food here is terrific, I tried the chicken platter and Lamb roti. Was great amount to share between two people. Mango Lassi was great, not too sweet but quite tasty. I would skip the kulfi ice cream, consistency was strangely sticky with no real favour. 

Staff was very welcoming and friendly when we arrived but then disappeared. Ambiance of the place is fun with great design but still pretty low key. 

Prices are good value for dinner $40 for dinner for 2 but maybe too pricey for lunch goers. They also offered alcoholic because including $5/glass for wine with dinner. If def come back!
