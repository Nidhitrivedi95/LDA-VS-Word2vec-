-BrMNg4MbpftOUTjOMVp9g My boyfriend and I went here today for lunch, and it was my first time having Indian food. He had been here before and recommended it, so I agreed and was pleasantly surprised! 

First of all, the service was Goldilocks level - just right. The restaurant employees were always there if you needed them - pouring water, taking away used plates, et cetera. One of them, upon hearing me say that I cannot handle too much spice, even helpfully walked over with me to the buffet and pointed out dishes they had which were not spicy, as well as accompanying sauces. They all had big, welcoming smiles on their faces and seemed genuinely happy to see us and welcome us to their establishment! Although their presence was always known, they were not overbearing in any way, shape, or form. They were calm, serene, and happy.

Next, the food, which was *outstanding!* For my first time having Indian food, I was pleasantly surprised! Although the first time I filled up my plate I found the food had a tad bit more spice than I would have liked, I found that the amount of flavor made the spice level tolerable! Though, the next time I went up, I stuck with the non-spicy breads and these delicious little balls of fried potato in a delectable sauce - I forget what they were called! The chai tea and strawberry smoothie were also delicious. I'm sure we'll be back soon! The quality and quantity of the food is well worth the money.
