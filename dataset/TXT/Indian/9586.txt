8td1xV3B0hJc3wYpGmjtRQ Not happy with Butter Factory Chicken. Ordered at 8:07pm and the order didn't arrive until 10:07pm The drivers excuse was I didn't come down at the ground floor and the buzzer wasn't working. I gave him a look and my husband pointed my cell phone on the bill and asked why he didn't call. We specifically instructed our buzzer is broken and to call us. The driver just handed my order and I didn't bother giving him a tip. As he walked away with an glare, he instead responded back by giving me a middle finger.
