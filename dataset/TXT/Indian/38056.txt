ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Came here for a lunch and definitely ate off the lunch menu. This is an expensive and classy restaurant disguised behind a lackluster front in a semi-crappy strip mall. We wandered in here lost thinking we would find a cheap Indian joint, instead we were treated to fine dining. After being initially shocked at the prices, I ordered some Murg Bharti off the lunch menu which came with some naan, salad, and rice. The dish was good - creamy and flavorful. And the prices for the lunch items really weren't bad at around 13 dollars per. I got mad though because I ordered normal water and they brought us a 7 dollar bottle of whatever. Give it a try, just keep in mind this place is fancytime.

Edit: I came here again for lunch May 07 and they had corrected the little water issue by offering both. I even got some extra papadums for free. The other items on the menu were just as good so I'm upgrading to 5 stars because I believe this place is the best you can find in vegas.
