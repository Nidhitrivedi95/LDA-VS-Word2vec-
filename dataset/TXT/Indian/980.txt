-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw If you want only vegetarian food, then this is a good place. I happen to be an omnivore, so I'm a little biased (booooo!!!) Anyway, I've been here twice, so that says a lot. This place is good, just not a lot of selection in their buffet. How many times can you cook lentil different ways? LOL! In fairness though, their food is tasty and the place is bright. I always come for the buffet lunch so I can try a lot of different dishes and I think you should too if you are not familiar with Indian cuisine.
