tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I recommend this restaurant to anyone who has never tried Indian food. The buffet is a great way to try different things without breaking the bank. This was my first time and the food was delicious. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Definitely coming back with friends and family.
