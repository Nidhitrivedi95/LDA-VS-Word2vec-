Yh8xSwsPSJgVatvXulmh5g Rashnaa is a restaurant providing Sri-Lankan/South Indian cuisine.  I have to say it is in the rather surprising location of Parliament and Wellesley.

The kothu roti, which takes traditional south indian thin roti (veethu roti) cut up, mixed with spicy gravy, meat and fried egg is pretty decent.  However, I have to say it will never come close to the authentic stuff from Sri Lanka.  Even the roti used is not as good.

Not a fan of their thali's at all.  Please go to a real south indian restaurant like Udupi's on Gerrard.

3 stars.  Half decent SL food and a decent place.  Nothing to write home about.
