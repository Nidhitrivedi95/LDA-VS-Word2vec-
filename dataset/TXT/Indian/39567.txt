P2uPCEBP2VZsApnvEHCgag Have not been for dinner yet, but the lunch buffet is awesome! Large variety of dishes, many vegetarian options - and vegan labels! The buffet items are typically not spicy, which is understandable, but they have fresh chili peppers with the condiments so you can add your own heat. Brilliant. On my first visit, they had a turnip dish on the buffet which was by far the best root veg dish I have ever had - the turnips had totally absorbed the aromatic spices (think anise, cinnamon, cardamom) and melted in our mouths. Amazing.
