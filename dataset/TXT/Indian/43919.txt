RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I am always amazed by why people like this place. Take it from someone who understands Indian/Pakistani food - this is terrible! It's shameful these people get the kind of business they do. I've been 3 times to give them a chance, and each time it's been awful. They obviously make a lot of money given the crowd and the prices of their dishes, but it's just going into their pocket. Substandard quality and styrofoam/plastic and lining up to order is not why we pay these prices.

Horribly oily and greasy food, non-authentic and quick-alternative flavours is what they churn out. The kebabs seem fried rather than from a tandoor. I could go on and on.

This is the best. We asked for a spoon to take out some whole chillies from our dish. The waiter puts his hands into our dish and takes out the chillies. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

One extra star is for the authentic street style decor. Avoid this place!!!!
