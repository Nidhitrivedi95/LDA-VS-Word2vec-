FlPAGqTovHc4mEIKJ7Q8Nw Food was excellent! The lunch buffet had great variety with many non-vegetarian and vegetarian options that were all fresh and tasty. Service was excellent and the restaurant was very clean and welcoming. Highly recommend the cheese naan and chicken tikka masala. Of all the Indian food I've had in Wisconsin, Swagat easily takes home the title of best Indian food.
