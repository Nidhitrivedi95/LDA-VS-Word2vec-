eGP9T_kj0iM5h3MciSQjSw I visited the Mississauga location of this place before and it is nothing compared to the Brampton location which is AMAZING in my opinion! It is an all  vegetarian buffet but there is a huge variety of dishes if you want truly authentic Indian cuisine (which is so much more than just "Butter Chicken"). Yes there is no butter chicken here but I don't think that matters because there is still a huge variety of dishes and wonderful desserts. There's everything from Pani Puri, Papri Chaat (My personal favourite!), fresh Naan and Dosa's, Vada, Dhokla, pakora, samosas, several traditional curries as well as Desserts like Ras malai, Gulab jaamun, carrot halwa etc. 
I believe the prices are $14.99 for weekday lunch and $18.99 for weekend lunch with dinners being more expensive. I did go here on a weekday lunch but being December and near the holiday season, they charged me $18.99 (weekend price) for lunch which I didn't really care but just keep that in mind if you plan to visit this place close to the holidays.

So why not the 5*for this place? Well although the food is good, I found that some dishes were not as fresh, particularly their paneer dishes. Maybe I have a higher standard because I'm used to making my paneer fresh at home but I found the paneer kind of rubbery and dry here at Brar's which sucked because I love everything with paneer in it and that is most of the curries at an all vegetarian buffet. Another thing I thought could be improved is if they had proper labels and instructions near their dishes. Especially for things like their Pani puri and Papri chaat where you have to basically assemble the dish. I, of course, know how to because my mother has prepared the dish for me several times but for customers that are new to Indian food, I can imagine there being a lot of confusion about what to add and what all the sauces/spices are for.
