B5xWYgJDSN4RPPk4DlUajQ Odd combo to have combined Indian and Chinese restaurant. I was craving naan and some chicken tikka masala and I wouldn't be denied. So I strolled in around 7 pm and the place was deserted. Great! Faster service for moi.

I was greeted immediately and decided that I wanted carry out. The host took my order and told me 10 minutes. My order was actually ready faster than that.

The food smelled delicious. By the time I made it back to my hotel it took all I had not to scarf it down in just a few bites. The chicken tikka masala curry was delicious! Creamy with just a hint of spice. The garlic naan was the perfect combination of butter and garlic. Yum! 

I'll definitely be back to sample some of their other dishes.
