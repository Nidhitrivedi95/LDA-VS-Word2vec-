aXnWWp6Reaep4-0iKWlYHQ I've had the papri chaat on multiple occasions. What frustrates me is the inconsistency in serving size. Sometimes they heap your plate up and others they barely give you a few bites. 

The butter chicken roll is tasty however they don't cook the chicken in the tandoor as authentic butter chicken is supposed to be done.. This left me missing that lovely char flavour/taste.
