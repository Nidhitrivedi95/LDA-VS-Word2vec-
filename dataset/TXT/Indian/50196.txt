uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA Definitely will never eat here again, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. 

The chicken vindaloo was watery in texture and taste, the vinegar aspect of the dish was over powering, and it was not spicy at all. 

The potato samosa was decent and the chutneys were not bad. The samosa was over done on a few places, almost to the point of being burnt. 

The delivery guy was also rude over the phone telling me he couldn't find my apartment because I didn't have a building number listed (we don't even have building numbers, just apartment numbers)... I've gotten food delivered from at least 10 different places since I moved here and NOT ONE has had a problem finding my place...
