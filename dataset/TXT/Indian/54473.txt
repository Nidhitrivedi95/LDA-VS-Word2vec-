W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg I really want to like Minerva like many of my family members who have not had experiences similar to ours while there. The food is pretty good compared to the other Indian restaurants in town. My favorites are Haveli and Swad. 

To give them a fair chance, my spouse and I have been to Minerva three times for the lunch buffet on the weekday and weekend at least an hour to an hour and a half before the buffet was to close. Each of those times, we did not feel particularly welcome or that our business was appreciated. Frankly, we felt like we were imposing.  I thought it was me and did not say anything until my wife made the comment after we had left the first time. Our next two visits were the same.

On all of our visits, our table was cleared reasonably promptly so there's no issue there. It has always been upon entering and exiting that we get these blank stares with barely an acknowledgment.  I have not heard this from other people so suspect it could just be us although I am not sure why since we are pretty affable and well mannered.  A simple hello, thank you and a smile or nod would suffice.  

Their buffet selection is on the small side and is just OK quality and taste wise.  The space is a little cramped.  If there were any more than a few other tables of people, a wheelchair bound guest could not be accommodated readily. All told, there are more comfortable and welcoming settings with better food.  

But for the lack of pleasantness and difficulty accommodating our more physically challenged brothers and sisters, I would give them 3 1/2 stars.
