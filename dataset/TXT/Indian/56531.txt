xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw This was a lovely dinner to end our time away in Cleveland.  Our AirBnB host listed this restaurant as one of the popular venues and that people drive hours to go there because it is that good.  It is a Punjabi family-owned establishment and they are putting their heart and soul into the food.  Is it an instagram curated venue?  No, however that shouldn't matter.  The food quality is fresh and that should speak volumes.  All of our dishes - vegetable pakora, chicken tikka masala, chicken biriyani and chicken korma exceeded our expectations, which are quite high since we eat Indian food regularly.  Prepare yourself for the wait by calling your order in beforehand, even if you are dining in.  I didn't feel like I was in a restaurant, I truly felt like I was in their home.  If I am back in Cleveland I will definitively go back to this restaurant and sample some of their other items.  Balle balle!
