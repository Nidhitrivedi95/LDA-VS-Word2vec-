iU7rCNlmoQvp-JZ5dOx96w There is only one way to describe Ancila and her food and it is OUTSTANDING. 

Ancila was my caterer for a dinner party of about 50 people. We first went to her restaurant to meet her, try the food, etc. before placing our big order. She was so warm and welcoming, and we were instantly blown away by the quality and freshness of her food (even my mom - the best cook in the world- was impressed... which says a lot!). She offered excellent advice on putting together a menu which would be perfect for the guests, and was so thoughtful about every detail. The price was also very reasonable for the quality and amount of food we ordered. Ancila remained in communication leading up to the event, and happily answered any questions that I had. 

On the day of event, the food was ready and hot right at the time we agreed to pick it up. My guests LOVED the food - they were raving about it - and several asked for Ancila's contact information for future catering events. Ancila even followed up with me afterwards to see how everything went. I cannot stress enough how amazingly positive this whole experience was... we look forward to going back for dinner soon to thank Ancila in person!
