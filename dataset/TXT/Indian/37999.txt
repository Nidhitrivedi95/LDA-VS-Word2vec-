ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw This is the first time I've ever had Indian food and I liked it a lot. My boyfriend had a restaurant.com certificate so came in on Saturday night to have dinner. There  were maybe 2-3 other tables the whole time, which is sad because it's really nice inside. 

We ordered the lamb skewers for an app, and then I ordered the HYDERABADI CHICKEN and my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Mukhani. Our server brought us an app but it wasn't the lamb and we didn't know until after we ate it. It was this spicy chicken and apparently the server accidentally sent it to the wrong table. They were super nice and told us to enjoy it and then they brought our lamp app out. The lamb was actually lamb patties, not skewers, and it was just ok. The chicken app we got on accident was delicious but very spicy.

Both of our entrees were simply chicken in a curry-type broth and then we got a side of rice. My entrée tasted exactly like this Thai curry that I make at home. LOL. I LOVED it! Honestly, my boyfriend's entrée tasted very similar as well, with less of a coconut taste. We were stuffed by this point since we had two appetizers, so we had a lot left over to take home. 

The service was good and we got our food fast. It's a fun little date spot.
