JYgoAQHdJWKPArQDvBEBng I had dined with my colleagues last week and it was the worst Indian food I had for years! Restaurant looks good but staff rude for no reason.  It appears the server (not sure his name but thin guy with square glasses on) had an issue with inside staff and showing that on the customer.  I thought of getting out after seeing his behavior.  But there is another server who took care of us at the main course.

I don't recommend this restaurant at all.
