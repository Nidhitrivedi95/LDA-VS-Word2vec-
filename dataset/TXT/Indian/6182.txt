3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA My boyfriend and I decided to try this place after finding out our first choice restaurant had a 60 to 90 min wait.  Little did we know that we would end up waiting for 10 minutes before we were even given water and a chance to order, and another 50 minutes before our food would arrive.  And the restaurant was only half full!  After we finished eating, we called for the check and again, we were made to wait as we watched the guy who promised to bring us the check run around, refilling the potpourri bowl and ringing other customers up..basically doing anything but bringing us the check.  

I guess the food was decent enough.  But I don't care how decent your food is, if you can't get your food out within a reasonable amount of time when your restaurant is only HALF full, then you've got an issue and you can forget about ever attracting your customers back.  As such, we could have stayed at our first choice restaurant and still ended up eating at around the same time.  We would also have saved on the gas money it took us to drive over to this place.
