VCYhWAkuxl2Irj_vgnraYw Confident after my Yelp outing at Taj Mahal a few weeks ago, I set out on my own to test the lunch buffet. The restaurant was great with a large group, but I wanted to go again to see if they were playing up to the known large crowd that night. Still my knowledge of Indian food is very limited, but I knew I had a variety of dishes at the Yelp event and they were all good - so even though I might not what it was, I was confident it would taste good. I was not disappointed! The lunch buffet is $7.99 and features many selections, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. I did not try the soups, salads, chutneys or desserts - I was too full to venture that far down the buffet line. I recognized the tandori chicken, tried an egg curry and a couple of other chicken dishes. In addition to the items on the buffet, I was served a large basket of garlic naan. Being a buffet, the food is catered toward a larger audience, so it was not very spicy. That is good for a newbie like me, but some of the more veteran Indian eaters may prefer to order off the menu. 

I recognized the guy working as one of the gentleman from the night of the Yelp event. He is very friendly, kept the drinks full and even took another customer over to the buffet to explain one of the dishes. 

I like the atmosphere of the restaurant as well. It feels comfortable with enough space for everyone, a nice big photo of the Taj Mahal and Bollywood movies or videos playing in the background. I enjoyed the buffet as much as the dinner a few weeks ago. Anytime in the future I plan to go for Indian food, this will be the place.
