-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg The quality of a South Indian restaurant and that too Udipi is based on the taste of Sambar! The sambar was 4 on 5 and hence the food too. Great food and the Dosas were crispy and tasty though a bit smaller than regular restaurants! They have 19 varieties of Dosas and the best one I liked was the Paneer Dosa.
