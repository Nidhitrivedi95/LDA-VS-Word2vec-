gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A First time here and won't be the last. My friend and I had vegetable samosas which were 2 big pieces that came with green and red sauce. Our server had given us papad chips to start out before ordering. I had the vegetable curry and my friend had the shrimp spicey rice dish. I noticed alot of pick up orders on a Friday night.
