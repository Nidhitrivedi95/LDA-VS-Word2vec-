-Kw6QNbBBgextJZlhtIq9w This resturaunt has gone through several name changes, and I've always noticed it on my way to work.  I love unusual or ethnic foods, so I'm actually pretty ashamed that it took me so long to finally have a meal here.  

To be quite honest, I was a little taken aback when I walked in - it was dinnertime on a Friday night, and the place was completely empty.  All the tables were set, the lights were low, it looked like it was closed.  But it was open, and my friend and I were crazy hungry so we sat down anyway.  I saw an application for a liquor license on the front door, so hopefully that'll help their business pick up. 

Service was prompt and friendly, and we were given thin crackers and a variety of dips/spreads/I don't know what they were, but they were delicious thingies to munch on while we made our selections (lamb saag, tandoori shrimp, garlic naan).  And then we settled in to wait. And wait. And wait. Honest to god, I don't know if I was just really, really hungry or if I really did wait as long as I felt like I did, but by the time the food showed up, it could have been utter crap and I still would have wolfed it down.

Luckily, it wasn't crap - it was AMAZING.  There were no survivors on this meal - we ate the entirety of everything we ordered.  The shrimp were enormous, the lamb was tender, and the flavors were intense and complex.  And the naan - ohhhh, the naan!  Frankly, the servings could have been a bit larger for what the prices were (our meal ran $20 each), but for the taste, it was well worth it. 

Rangoli Cafe would have gotten 5 out of 5 if the food had been a bit quicker to arrive, and if the liquor license was already approved.  I will absolutely be returning here, and soon.  I only wish the lunch buffet was open on weekends so I could actually attend!
