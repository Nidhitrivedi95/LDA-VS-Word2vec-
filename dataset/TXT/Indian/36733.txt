NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Very surprised by this place.  It really is a quick service (think chipotle) version of indian food.  The chicken is great - Tikka Masala sauce is good, but a little under spiced - probably because they are shooting to appeal to the masses.  The naan is reasonable, the piece I got a was a little cold - but it wasn't bad.  I bet a fresh piece is really really good.  The chickpeas were also very good.  I am impressed and will be back.  The location is reasonable, and the building is clean and modern.
