H4AvltDM9QY8Up8z-ybUyQ I'm giving this amazing authentic Indian restaurant 5 stars only, because Yelp doesn't allow 10 stars.

I've been frequenting the restaurant on a weekly basis since the start of the year (I think I'm getting addicted to their food), and the food and the service seems to get better and better every time I go there.

A customer looks for 2 things in a restaurant - a great tasting food and an excellent customer service. This restaurant provided both of this, hands down. 

The Manager, Sam's energy and the positiveness, is exemplary. He is a natural, talks to everyone at every table and gives his honest opinion about the food and the drinks.

The food selection is amazing. 

The bottom line, I won't (and I don't anymore) go to any other Indian restaurant!
