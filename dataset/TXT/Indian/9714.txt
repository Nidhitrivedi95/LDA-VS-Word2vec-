9-yRTZGbhNwvDhxRKqZmtQ We used Jalsa kitchen's services for a gathering at our place. The food was of excellent quality and the order was ready on time. Above all, the owner was an absolute gentleman. We placed an order for 50 guests and the owner cautioned us against ordering in excess and he was correct - the quantity was adequate for 70 + guests. We are happy to have used their services and would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone
