uGxZdLLgMQDvFSqiXyCg_w Sorry, I never give bad reviews but there was a fly in our food AND I saw a large and strikingly grotesque roach near the kitchen as I went to pay. Also it was clear they didn't want to make me fresh food, although they did. They were pushing me to use the buffet however I refused when I was told the buffet had been out since 11am (it was 5pm!). Also the atmosphere was terrible due to the owners (or managers?) airing out their personal issues in less than savory language during our meal (in another language, but one which I understand). 

Prior to this bad dine in experience I once ordered carry out and came to find them shoveling their buffet food into to-go boxes... and then charging me normal price.

The food itself wasn't bad, but it also wasn't great.

I definitely won't be eating there again.
