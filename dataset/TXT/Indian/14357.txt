c1_adyjYG6JEa1PZAXMOBg Great value and decent number of options for their lunch buffet. There are curries, chutneys, rice dishes, and breads for dipping. They even have a dessert section for their lunch buffet. I also appreciate how quickly the replenish their dishes, so you never have to wait long to try something. 

Warning: their dishes are spicy and if you can't handle spice, their dishes will set fire to your digestive system. 

I have been told that the dishes are quite traditional. However, it was odd seeing Szechuan chicken, but it tasted more Indian than Chinese to me. 

If you're coming for lunch on a weekday you can probably get away with not making a reservation. 

My one complaint is the inefficiency of their payment system. They don't split bills, and requested that we pay in cash if we wanted to pay separately.
