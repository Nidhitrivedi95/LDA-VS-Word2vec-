VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg Always had good service here. 

Like others, I prefer indian food a bit more spicey, so I always order (literally always) the butter chicken with more kick. And yes, its damn good butter chicken and goes especially well with a side of the garlic naan and saffron rice. But judging from others' reactions the menu is a bit geared towards the curries rather than well... the Tandoori food. A bit ironic, but theres good food so its not disappointing.

Yes, they are a bit pricey, so I try not to go often, and if I do its usually with a person who wouldn't think less of me if I said "you want to split the bill?"
