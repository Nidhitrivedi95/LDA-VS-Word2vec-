0BJK4_RQnNiiXJcYPEgG3w Good food and the best-looking waiters in Toronto. 

Gotta go there at least once a year.

The only Nepalese resto in town (used to be, haven't heard of any others opening) - so it's interesting to compare the flavours to some of the north Indian tastes in Little India.

Stay away from the stinky traditional Nepalese thing in the veggie combo - even some of the waiters say they can't stand the taste/smell - kinda like you imagine sweaty sneakers would taste. 

Overall, a really nice addition to the Annex when it opened.  Still a reliable place for a pleasant meal in a clean resto.

If you've never had Nepalese food, it is a bit of a must do.
