Ip5IQLwjFzmr_X03pNH7pg I went to Tamarind for lunch today. The food was terrific, Im so glad to this is located in Matthews. I ordered Paneer Makhani and soup for my side item. The dal was delicious and flavorful, and hit the spot on this muggy day. The paneer makhani was also tasty. It had a vibrant red color, the paneer was fresh, and dipping the naan into it made for a wonderful meal. 

I wish there is an option for half stars, because Id lke to give 3.5stars.  though the lunch menu is titled "Express Lunch" it was not served in a timely manner. But other than that the hostess was lovely and kind, as well as the server. All in all a great experience, Ill definitely visit on a regular basis.
