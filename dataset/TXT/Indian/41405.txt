Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w We missed the lunch buffet that we had heard so much about and went right to dinner.  We ordered six dishes for three adults and one kid.  The food was fantastic and flavorful, though the kid who was with us was VERY unimpressed with the exception of the Mango Lassi.  The big surprise came at the end when we got the bill and it was over 75 dollars!  Yowzers!  While the food was good, there wasn't a whole lot of it, so the bill was a bit shocking.  But don't let the cost of dinner detour you if you are looking for excellent Indian food, this place has got it, so go early and hit the lunch buffet instead.
