o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw If you love Indian cuisine you must stop in and meet the team at Saffron.  It was my wifes birthday and we wanted to try a new spot for our curry fix.  The restaurant was very clean with a very inviting decor.  It was quite tonight but it was also early on a Tuesday evening.  We ordered fried cheese appetizers and the lamb tika masala, curry coconut shrimp and vegetable briani rice.  The food was the best curry we have had in phoenix.  The chef and his wife were very nice and they were genuinely concerned that we were completely satisfied.  We will be back often as this is now our spot...  They also have the cutest little girl whom will welcome you to saffron many times...

Thank you for a great evening and dinner
