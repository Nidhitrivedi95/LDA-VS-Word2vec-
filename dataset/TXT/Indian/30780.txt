KfxPrJ5PzgFRm2XltnbBLQ This place is absolutely amazing! We ordered the Tandoori King Prawns, Chicken Vindaloo and the Goat Saag with some Naan for carryout. They did forget one part of my meal and I had to go back for but the customer service was excellent and made me a happy customer instantly. All of the dishes were hot, prepared well and tasted incredible, I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Interior was dark, intimate and very clean; it would be a great date place and I will be back soon!
