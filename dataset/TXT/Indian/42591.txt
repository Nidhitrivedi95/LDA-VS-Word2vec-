Ra6dcmjOIqDdBXremeGEuQ We ordered delivery on a Sunday night around 6:30pm. The food arrived at our door around 7:45pm and we noticed there was no rice in the bag (we ordered rice with our order). We called back to get our rice. The driver and the small amount of rice arrived at 8:45pm. 

Food was just okay. Staff was mostly unapologetic about not delivering our rice the first time and for being so late.
