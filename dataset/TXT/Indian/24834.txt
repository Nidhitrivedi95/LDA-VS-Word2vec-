h1MxTLZ1b2FkU6ituL1yHA When hubby and I first landed in Mesa, we were had a fierce craving for Indian food. We pulled up google and did a search which led us to Royal Taj.

We had literally been in Mesa for a few days and were used to Indian food in Britain. We found this place ok, but not as flavorful as we would have liked.

...Two Years Later...

After lacklustre Indian food and mindbendingly tasteless curries from different places, I decided to give this place one more try. It's also ten minutes away from my house.

I will have to change my mind about this place - the curry is wonderful and their tandoori chicken is just barely made on this side of heaven.

I will recommend Royal Taj to anyone who wants good Indian food.

This is my favorite Indian place - until I find a new one.  :D
