CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ I am definitely liking this place and will be back soon! It is a small and cozy establishment and decorated nicely. The service is impeccable and the staff are all smiles and super friendly. 
We came with a few friends on a Saturday evening. It was a last minute decision so we called in maybe 45 minutes beforehand to see if they could accommodate us. We originally wanted 7pm but 6pm was the only time they could fit us in. We only had an hour to eat but that was fine. We were seated and served water quickly. The place was packed and it looked like everyone was enjoying themselves. I was super excited as I have not had Indian food for quite a while. The buffet is probably not as big as other establishments but it is definitely more than enough and they have some really delicious items. The buffet stations are located at the back area near the cashier. One side is the cooked food and the other is the salad and dessert area.

I absolutely loved their fish curry, mushroom curry and lamb dish. The butter chicken and chicken tandoori is also very yummy. Now let's talk about naan, the owner (I believe) brings it out right to you and they are huge pieces. We were a group of 4 and we each got 4 long pieces of naan....seriously so good and satisfying and it is all you can eat. We noticed the other table had garlic naan so we asked for that and each garlic naan is $1 extra. Well why not? So we gave it a try. It was definitely a meal full of carbs but it was so delicious! 

My friend ordered the mango lassi and I took a sip. It was refreshing and very good. It  complimented the meal well. If you can handle dairy, give it a try!
This may be a small restaurant in a big plaza but it will not disappoint. Come hungry!
