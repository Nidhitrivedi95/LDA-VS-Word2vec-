PYUmLq7FkBbMyfYyHX1waQ I came here on a Friday afternoon for their AYCE lunch buffet with my co-workers. First time at Tandoori Flame and first time at an Indian restaurant buffet. 

The place was large and clean. A few different rooms and they could seat a fair amount of people. However, the food area wasn't that large. Service was consistent as they were quick to take the finished dishes and quick to fill our waters. 

I'm not an expert on Indian cuisine but I do enjoy their usual dishes like Butter Chicken, the Vindaloo and the Tandoori Chicken. I was expecting an Indian version of the Mandarin but I was wrong. The food that I'm familiar with, had nice blend of seasoning and spices and it didn't feel like it was toned down for western palates. I didn't see many vegetarian dishes though. 

Price was great as it was $16 for the lunch which was more than fair.  

Recommended and will be back again.
