tqJcWIO5uvv1MzwGd7gkUQ Lots of things to say. 
1 Delicious food and great portions for the price 
2 Staff are really friendly and welcoming 
3 Wish they were open late 
4 Shawarma doesn't come with pink pickled turnips and that's unfortunate. But it's still tastes really nice 
5 The big papa on fries and rice is pretty good too (better than Osmows in my opinion) BUT the hot sauce isn't as spicy and the garlic sauce isn't as satisfying. The meal can also get pretty dry eventually 
This is a great establishment and I hope they don't jack up the prices and cheap out on portions like most places do once they become popular.
