zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q I am giving it a 2 star only because a) the food is okay not so great b) service is average and c) very, very pricey for a kabob joint.  There's clearly a trick in the menus; there are no combos of two items. The closest thing is the mixed grill but that's way too much for one person and the proportion is for at least two people.  So, what do you do when, for example, you want to combine lamb and chicken (1 skewer each)? In my case, I added the chicken boti with my lamb but the extra charge was $7.99 so my single order, a custom combo, came out to be about $18.00!!! No rice! They give you an option between rice and bread with your Primary order (lamb kabob in my case) so I picked bread and paid an extra $7.99 for a single skewer of chicken. 

I don't think I will return here again, it's a complete rip off.
