UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Tried to go here on Christmas day but the line was insane. Wait until this week and it was definitely worth it. Went for the buffet so that I could try a few different things. Everything they had on it was excellent. If you don't like a lot of spice (like me), then I want to point out that the food on this buffet is spicier than most Indian buffets I've tried, but not too spicy. Definitely would eat here again.
