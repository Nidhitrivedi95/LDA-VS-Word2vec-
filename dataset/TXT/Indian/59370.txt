z71cDtFTgwvT7ihsxesTzA Today we ordered Chapati for a group of 6 people, each person ordering their own customized "bowl."  Initially we had difficulty even getting the employees to answer the phone and we actually talked to them over 9 times to coordinate getting the meal and faxed them an order sheet.  We were hoping that the trouble would be worth it and unfortunately it was not.  Not only were our meals incorrect and missing ingredients, but the portion sizes were extremely small.  Several of the bowels were less that 1/4th full and since they were missing so many ingredients we were left annoyed and hungry.  We certainly don't plan upon ordering again.
