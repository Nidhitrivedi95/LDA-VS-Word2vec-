DXsV1EmzKcsnz8bzCHyqnQ I've only had take out from here and while I live closer to Kwality and Tandoori Flame Sweet India is now our go to place for picking up snacks and meals, especially their samosa's which are less oily and tastier than some of the other Indian resto's around here (and certainly compared to most in the downtown area). 

Their curry too is very well done and I'm a fan of their biriyani and prices are hard to beat. Sweet India does not look like much inside or outside but things like that matter little since they are able to dish out some mean meals. While Kwality seems to have the better variety of Indian sweets, the one time I bought sweets from here, they were a big hit with my family and our guests. 

Not much else to say here, it wouldn't be a location I would come in for a sit down meal since seating is sparse and not very welcoming, but that's not a big deal for me since I don't live too far from here.
