-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA Just had their lunch buffet.  I took a bit of almost everything and thought the food was quite good.  They seemed to have quite a variety of meat and vegatable dishes  washed down with a nice Kingfisher beer.  I admit that I'm not an expert in Indian food, and only know what I like.  However, I have spent time in India and other parts of Asia where I have had quite a few Indian meals and this appears to be very similar and therefore I'm guessing fairly authentic.  The second clue is that there were a lot of Indian familes there.  It has a nice family feel about the place, draws larger groups of people, so all in all a pleasant experience.  The service was ok, not spectacular, but for a buffet you don't need much service.
