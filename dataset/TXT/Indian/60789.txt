zR12ySz1Ew1qAP-yPJDHAQ Amazing in every sense. Not being Indian cuisine experts, we let our waiter choose a smattering of menu items for our party of 6. He ended up bringing 3 appetizers and 7 entrees along with a few breads for the table to share. Everything was out-of-this-world. Flavors were intense and varied widely between dishes. The restaurant is beautiful and intimate, but not stuffy. Undoubtedly the best meal we've had in a very long time.
