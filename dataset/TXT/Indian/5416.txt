2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw i tried this place since it was so close from the bf's place and all the amazing reviews & cuz im looking for an amazing indian restaurant that i can call my favorite indian restaurant .

- their veggie samosas are soo good and i dont even like samosas . their wrap is a bit different, more pastrylike than others that ive tried .
- butter chicken was amazingg ! it tasted exactly like what it sounds like . buttery sauce with juicy chicken pieces . must try !
- mattar paneer . i only got this because of the review below mine . i never had anything like it before and it was different but in a good way . the little blocks of cheese seemed weird at first, but it goes so well together . must try if you want something different .

i LOVED their dessert section .
- milkbread was sooo sweet . maybe too sweet but thats what dessert are suppose to be ! the more you eat, the better it gets ! my fav out of all 3 !
- white pedas . this was different . i thought i didnt like it at first but the most i ate it, the more it tasted like condensed/evaporated milk . by the second piece, i really liked it .
- ras malaii . i also got this because of the review below mine . its not like anything ive ever tried before ! its a cheese ball in white liquid . its worth a try !


one of my most favorite thing in the world is trying out completely new/different food & flavors . samosa king provided me that by plenty ! i cant quite give a 5 star since i havent tried a lot of other south indian places, but this is my fav so far !
