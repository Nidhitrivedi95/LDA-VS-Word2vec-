PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g I'm quite an expert on Indian food having lived in India for most of my life and being a foodie since I turned 5 (rather that's my earliest memory of liking delicious things).

So I went enthusiastically to try this place. A bit snotty - quite empty but they made a show of giving us a table at 5 pm without reservations. The complimentary garlic naan is appreciated and is a nice touch as someone else mentioned.

The Delhi style chili chicken was tasty, but the lamb karhai style was just ok. They lacked spice punch entirely, despite 3 chilli signs next to these items. Not suited to an Indian palette at all, and not for you if you're looking for authenticity. But the chili chicken was creative for sure - something I look for in a contemporary high end restaurant. Indian mains served with naan have to have more curry/gravy - that's how we Indians like to dip our naans and rotis. But these were a lot more dry and not fun with naan or roti.

Expensive for what it was, but fine dining Indian style for sure. However, it lacked the little touches that Indian food presents culturally - fennel seeds in creative sugary casings to clear the palette.

I'm not coming back unless I just want ambience.
