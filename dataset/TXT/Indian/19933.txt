FMMNajth88mWX76QVp6N9Q There are a few Indian restaurants in Madison that offer a lunch buffet.  This one is definitely my favorite.  I find the location much brighter and cheerier than the other ones, and I really enjoy their selections in their lunch buffet.  They have the pretty traditional offerings and they always have samosas with a tamarind chutney and a green coriander chutney and some other ones.  I pretty much only pay attention to these two kinds of chutney.  They also usually have some kind of grilled dish simmering on the buffet line with onions and cabbage.  The few times I've been there, it's been chicken or fish.
