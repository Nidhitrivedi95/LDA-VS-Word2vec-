z7NIceJU_4vSk-EJ8H6hQA When my stomach says "Indian" food for a meal, this is probably one of the first places that pops into my head.  I live in Matthews, but I still make 
the trip to Pineville for this food.

The dining area is a bit dark for me, but gives the place a unique atmosphere for a dining experience.  The servers are in all black and are very quick and attentive to re-fills (especially critical when eating spicy food since you may need some emergency cooling chugs).  The servers do a good job of telling you what dish is what as well.  Hopefully one day I can be pretty good at ordering and being familiar with certain dishes.

There are a ton of vegetarian options on the menu.  I tend to lean toward the carnivore side of the menu, but I tried the Palak Paneer and it was excellent (if you enjoy spinach and cottage cheese).

I'm hoping as Charlotte grows to be more diverse, more places like this show up on the map.
