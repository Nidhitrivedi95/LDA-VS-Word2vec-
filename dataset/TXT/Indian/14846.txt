cFpbP3-trTR9q34lOqiIUA Came here with coworkers for dinner after work one day. We've heard some good things from another coworker and decided to give this place a try. The place was empty at 7:30pm on a Thursday night which made us very sceptical. It was pretty warm inside the restaurant, to the point when we started to sweat a bit as we waited for the food. They eventually urged on the AC when we started eating. 

food: food was pretty good. I ordered the lamb Korma (cashew sauce) which was very creamy with a little bit of spicy. Dipped some garlic naan which was amazingly delicious. 

Service wasn't poor since we were the only customers but it isn't anything to write home about.
