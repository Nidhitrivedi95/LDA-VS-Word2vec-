UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I'd like to share a theory with my fellow Yelpers: 

The dirtier the bathrooms in an Indian restaurant, the better the food. 

Banjara's bathrooms are gross. But boyyyy is the food good! If you're looking for a moderately priced place with decent service; i.e., you're just in it for the food - go here!

Order tons, eat lots, and enjoy the patio. :-)
