DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew We love Indian food so when a spot was opening up that was close and convenient, we were thrilled. Prices are decent, the food is tasty, the service has always been friendly and polite. I really love paneer and it's not always easy to find a variety of paneer dishes. I love that most of the entrees here come with a paneer option! It really makes it easier and more fun to mix up my order.
