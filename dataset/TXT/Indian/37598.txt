OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A Holy moly, what an amazing little place. Every dish is cooked to perfection with so much flavor! How do they do this???

Such a treat! Soup with lamb & spices was extraordinary. Shrimp tandoori like I have never had before. Balti chx melted in our mouths. Mattar paneer rich and creamy. Wanted to lick the bowls but I do have manners. Onion naan was thick and infused with yummy spices and soft sweet onions. 

Luckily we sat out back where it was cool. Atmosphere inside was exactly what we would want to have in someone's Indian home but way to warm for us when I melt at any thing over 85.  Live music

Staff was welcoming and attentive. Appears to be a family business.
