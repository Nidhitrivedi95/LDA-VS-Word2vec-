We decided to cross the street over to this place.

If you feel like blowing the calorie budget, go here!   Exceptional Indian sweets as well as vegetarian food (thali).  Try the barfis - pistachio ... coconut ... milk cake ... ladoos ... jalebis ... pakoras and samosas.  This is NOT a place to go if you're on a diet.  Regardless ... nice place, polite counter service.  Yum!
