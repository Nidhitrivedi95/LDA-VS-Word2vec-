RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w The food I tried was just okay.

Palak paneer was not very flavourful. The cheese cubes were cut too large as none of the flavour got into the middle of the cubes. 

Lamb curry was flavourful, but the pieces of lamb were on the tough side.

Garlic naan was great. The bread came out fresh, piping & delicious.

Rice was okay and plain, but served in a surprisingly small portion for the price.

Portions in general are not large. It seems a little overpriced here, especially for the rice.

Service is so-so. Service was slow & they made mistakes with our order. (It wasn't very busy when we were there.)
