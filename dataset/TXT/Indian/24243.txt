gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA Went here once last year under the old management and this past week with the new management.  I am vegetarian and my husband is not, but the food was so good he didn't mind that they removed all meat options :)  Less sweet coconut bases are being used now and it is way yummier in my opinion! As another reviewer stated, it is more a blend of North and South Indian now.  Dosais are very spicy and come with the buffet.  Yummy!  Great to see a local restaurant embrace vegetarian menus!  Plus, you can't beat the price!
