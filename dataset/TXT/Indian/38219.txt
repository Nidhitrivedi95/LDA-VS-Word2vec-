OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ This is a very promising restaurant that JUST opened a few weeks back. I came along unsuspectingly, unsure of what type of cuisine was being served exactly. Upon entering, I saw hot dishes on a buffet line, alongside freshly prepared naan and salads. The Indian owners that greeted me confirmed it - this was an Indian lunch buffet!

I was overcome with joy and anticipation. Here I am, in the middle of a decidedly healthy period of eating, standing at an Indian lunch buffet. Yes, the owners will claim that is actually indo-chinese, and the manager of the restaurant herself moved from Darjeeling, but the focus is most definitely on Indian dishes. Chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, daal, palak paneer, mixed vegetables... this place has it all, alongside some chicken pakoras with an indo-chinese flair. The naan is freshly prepared, and the chutneys (usually overlooked) were chunky and rich, as opposed to watery and bland. 

The manager was very accommodating, noting that although I came in only 5 minutes before closing time, they were happy for me  - even my friend who hadn't arrived yet - to partake in the lunch buffet. At $9.95, it was reasonably priced, and my three trips down its lines most definitely ensured that I received my money's worth. 

Try Tulips! It has one of the best lunch buffets in the north Charlotte area, and I will certainly be back soon.
