i6N0e1zVhkQvof_acn85Og Okay at best. Was visiting montreal and needed a late dinner. Called this place and hey said they had seating as well as take out.  There was a bar with stools. Not what I expected. The food was meh. Geared towards college kids who don't know any better. Our dinners were luke warm and dry. I expect that was because it was late. But that speaks to quality control. Anyway I'd go elsewhere.
