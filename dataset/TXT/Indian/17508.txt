I went there when my family from the States was visiting and my aunt said that she liked it a lot! The food is fast and properly made. The waiters are nice and always helpful, and if I say so myself, the after mint chocolate is delicious!  

The portions are huge so you are never starving by the end of the night, and there is a bar that has a full bar if you feel that urge and desire to have a drink in between or before your meal!
