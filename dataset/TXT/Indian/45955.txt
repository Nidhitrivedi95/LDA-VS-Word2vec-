slCEVhYos8olUoEOPyAEgw I wanted to try this place because I love rotii and curries.
This is not the place to go if you're looking for authentic Indian food. This restaurant appeals more to the masses.
With all that said, the service was fast and very friendly. The place was very clean and the food was fresh and tasty. I would go here again.
