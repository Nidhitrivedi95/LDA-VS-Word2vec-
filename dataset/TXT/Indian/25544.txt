Hq86WlkF7bdQlaGe_p5fHA This was the first time I had dinner here (I've only ever been here for brunch which I would highly recommend!). 

We started off with the cleverly named Porkoras, which are pakoras with smoked bacon. They were a really big portion but a little underwhelming - all you could taste was batter and chunks of bacon fat. After that I wasn't sure what to expect of our main. Our server recommended the Steak & Ale pie and I'm really glad she did because that dish is the only reason I'm giving this review a four star. I can see why that dish is a customer favourite. The pastry is light and delicate, the filling is hearty - they don't skimp on the steak, and the mashed potatoes (made with real potatoes) are soft and fluffy.  Writing this review makes me want to order one right now!

The service time was average and our server was attentive and friendly. I would definitely go back for that Steak & Ale pie again.
