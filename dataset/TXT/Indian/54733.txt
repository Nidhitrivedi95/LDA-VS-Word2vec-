wMN68wTTlu8hADAF3FkKTw Probably the best Indian food I have ever had !!! What impressed me was the quality of the food. There are No short cuts here! So you do pay a bit more, but the quality is evident. The sauces were excellent as were the taste of the chicken and the lamb !!! They ask you how spicy you would like and they were spot on !! They also had serrano pepper naan!! I have never seen this naan any where and probably one of the naan I have ever had !! Service was excellent too !!! When in town again I will always come back!!! Did take some left overs and heated them the next day, just as good !!! A true sign of the quality of the food !!!
