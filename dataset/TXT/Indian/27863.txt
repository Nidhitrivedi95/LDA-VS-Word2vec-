IuGzUnd3fy5F9Gz_SoNUdg I was craving mithai and didn't want to drive to the airport so I dropped in here. The sweet selection was limited and not cheap, at $5 for half a pound ($10 for 1 pound, I guess). Half a pound gave me 5 pieces. I chose 2 kinds of gulab jamun, khoya barfi, sugar-free barfi and milk cake for my DD. The gj were very heavy with syrup and a bit dense in the centre. The other items were sweet but had little/no aromatic spices.

Guess I'll have to head out to the airport and Sweet India for my sweet tooth.
