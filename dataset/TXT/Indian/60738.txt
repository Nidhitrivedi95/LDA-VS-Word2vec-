ZPhQyUO9MY5xNEcTqZOrTQ I'm a huge fan of this 'street' food. This is a small take out place with delicious, Vegetarian food. From snack food to curries and Indian sweets you get it all here. They also have 3 smaller tables for seating if you come here to eat.

I  absolutely love their chaat papri here. Their chaat, yogurt, sauces and toppings are simply delicious. Their curries and chapathi, parottas are pretty good too. I love their saag paneer (spinach and paneer curry).

Polite, fast service. There really isn't much place to sit, they do have maybe 2 tables. it's more of a take out place. Luckily all their food travels well. 

They have a good selection of Indian sweets as well. But yes, this is a 100% vegetarian restaurant - so be warned meat eaters.
