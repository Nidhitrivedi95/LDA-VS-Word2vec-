3OknFx5ox_1O9nmP5DSFBA Do not miss this place if you're visiting Toronto! We ordered the butter chicken and lamb twist masala! Both amazingly good!! Even ordered some rice to eat with the left over chicken later. Friendly, fast service! 15 mins drive from downtown.. not bad at all given the traffic in the city. Highly recommended!
