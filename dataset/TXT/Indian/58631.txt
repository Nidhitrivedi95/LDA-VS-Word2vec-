yLmZPpg57FRukoqlLZH_dQ Service has deteriorated lately, most of the items in the menu are not available. Looked like the waiter himself was the cook as he used to disappear inside after taking the order. Also the portions are small. Food looked like it was assembled from the many ready-to-eat Indian snacks.
I won't be surprised if this place closes down in the near future.
