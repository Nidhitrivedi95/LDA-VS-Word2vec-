IO0b0QQpI92At0g5BZUTlw I have been there for lunch and dinner both...But its the same menu for both times which i thought is odd coz i m paying more money for dinner for the exact same food...every week they offer one new item on their lunch buffet and a lot of times its things like pakora or vegetable pulao which in a traidtional indian restaurant should be on the menu at all times...naan always comes later than the curries...no point in that...

They have very limited options but the food is decent. and the venue is small but I like the coziness..and it looks like a legit nice restaurant..

Customer Service: I personally felt that I was not treated equally compared to some other customers that walked after me..i have gone there a few times and i have felt the same way everytime..I am not a big fan of the host that takes of care of the payments (older man with glasses) but I really like one of the waiters...very sweet and polite guy

I would recommend checking it out once because its a decent place with good food thats very affordable but I personally will not go back
