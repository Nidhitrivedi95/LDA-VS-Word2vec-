xhPdBbduivnHYTnoM0K1Bg I placed an online order of  Malai chicken and goat biriyani.   

They promptly called me after 30 minutes to inform me that the order is ready.  So I went and picked up the food which was packed and ready.  Service was okay.  

Malai Chicken was very delicious and had the right level of spice and tenderness.  Just perfect

Biriyani was very average.   I does not taste like DUM biriyani.  For me it tasted like pepper fried rice with a hint of pudina and rose essence.   

I'm planning to try other dishes before judging this place.
