tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My favorite Indian food restaurant without a doubt.  Their buffet is like no other.  They even serve Mango Lassi, complementary with your buffet.  Their staff is very courteous.  I would say that if you want to grab a fast lunch, you could do it there.  Their food is so delicious it is hard to pick just one item.  The Tandoori chicken is grilled to perfection.  Their naan bread is also great.  Sometimes, when I don't want to cook, I just pick up some Tandoori chicken, Naan bread, and Basmati rice and have that for dinner. I highly recommend this place.
