India and Pakistani relations in harmony at The Dhaba.  

First off we ordered refreshing Coconut juice with mint.  I love that there are bits and pieces of coconut flesh.  We got 2 huge samosas for our appetizer.  It's filled with curried potatoes and peas and came with a condiment of garbanzo beans.  "It's spicy!!!", darn, I didn't even think to ask  the level of heat in those suckers.  So, be warned if your kiddos are sensitive to chili heat.  He enjoyed the garlic naan bread he dipped in a sweet and tangy tamarind sauce.

My hubby luvvy the Chicken Tikka Massala served with saffron rice.  I chose the creamy Spinach Paneer.  So good!  They all came in a copper and stainless steel vessel.  The drinks are also served in the same ware.  If you want, you can buy these at the grocery store next door.  The owner saw that my son didn't eat his food offered him mango juice.  Just for that, this place is on top of my list.  The rest of the service was wonderful.

One of the best Indian resturants we've been to.  We can't wait to try their tandoori dishes on our next visit!
