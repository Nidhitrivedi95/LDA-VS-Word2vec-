VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ This place was suggested by an Indian co-worker.

Establishment -- pretty nice.  They have 2 tables for low-seating (Indian style).

Service -- servers were very nice.  Had great suggestions but were kinda pushy on making us try a bunch of entrees.

Food -- good food!  Everything we ordered was pretty good.  Although kinda pricey but servings were bigger than other Indian restaurants I've been to.  Garlic naan was good and HUGE!  We paid about $20 per person but we took home a lot of leftover.  We wanted to try alot of their stuff and didn't mind paying for good food :)
