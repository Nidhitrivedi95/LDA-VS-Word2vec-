FudpYlLuoqeetWX6UCt3PQ We've been ordering from here for years. It's been hit or miss all over the menu. After calling and talking to staff, we were told that they like to take standard Asian recipes and "do their own thing" and modify it. We've tried close to half the menu, and are not happy with their modifications.

The Pad Thai lacks a few of the fresh ingredients that make any pad Thai sophisticated and good. The crab Rangoon we got was completely dry, it's hard to think of a worse one! Several other curries hardly stand out, and seem to always have too many veggies and not enough sauce. The Chicken Manchurian looked and tasted nothing like any chicken Manchurian I've ever seen on a menu, and was bland to boot. When I spoke to the staff, they explained that this is "their version" of chicken Manchurian. Which apparently means the chicken isn't fried, there's no sauce, no scallion, no onion, and is mostly stir fried broccoli and carrots. 

If you are going to "modify" a standard Asian recipe by removing most of the ingredients and cooking it differently, don't call it by the same name!! We feel cheated, and we are getting rather tired of feeling cheated half the time we order food from here. The Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Curry, and simpler Thai curries (red, yellow) have kept us coming back. Not frequently, alas.
