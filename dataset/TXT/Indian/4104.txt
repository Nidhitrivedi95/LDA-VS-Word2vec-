171c2z28JaSYQtWimiZ62A Wish I had read the reviews before I bought the Groupon. Food was just okay. We ordered steak biriyani, butter chicken, and two garlic naan. The waiter made us order $40 before taxes and charged us 18% tip. He tried to overcharge us but changed it when I confronted him. Don't understand this kind of business attitude.
Save yourself your money and the trouble of coming here. Better off eating at McDonalds.
