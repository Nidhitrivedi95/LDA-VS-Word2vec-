rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA I had the Reshimi Chicken Tikka which came with rise and salad. This place is comparable to SAFA (another Pakistani cuisine place just north on Markham). This place had great tasting fresh tikka kebabs. We went for the lunch special which was $7.99. The meal also came with a drink. The plaza seemed new and the restaurant itself was massive even though it looked small from the outside. I highly recommend this restaurant.
