TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Awesome service from Gary, the food was so good, the place was very clean and the tables were good to the feel and were not sticky/oily. I had chicken tikka masala -great food and chicken bryani (fried rice) - this is by itself a delicious meal. We also had the garlic naan - superb appetizer. My wife and I had total of $46 but I had groupon with a promo value of $30. We paid about $16. This was a wonderful dinner for us.

I love to come back and go for the buffet.
