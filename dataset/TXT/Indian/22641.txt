As a rule, we run from Indian buffets as if they were the plague. So I was dreading lunch when my husband oddly declared he was craving indian and insisted on weekend buffet lunch. 
We'd never heard of Ruchi before but decided to try it as it was on our way home. We walked in to see a familiar face - turns out that it is the ex-owner of Udupi. They were friendly and attentive, the place was tastefully decorated (no placemat that looked like it had been through the wringer since 1649) and clean. We walked in at 11 and were surprised to see the buffet ready! (Granted, I haven't been to an Indian place in ages, so the habit of setting up the buffet 1/2 hour after open time and staring at you while you wait uncomfortably might have died along with the recession). Good sign. Also catered food was ready to go when those people turned up, which was also a good thing.

We were surprised to see the variety in the buffet. There was a generous mix of north and south Indian, and best of all, none of them tasted like they had made up volume with corn starch. My husband who had declared he could eat a whole bear for lunch was full before he could even sample all the items. Again, my attitude could be ancient, but we were impressed by quality and quantity.

Finally an Indian restaurant I like.
