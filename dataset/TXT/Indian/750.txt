-iauwrCGxk1cEJJnf4soTg Probably one of the best Indian restaurants in Mississauga in terms of food and atmosphere. Staff are very nice and polite, however can be a bit akward with serving. I would highly recommend the eggplant with goat cheese and tomato sauce, it's crunchy and savoury. On the weekends make reservations cause tables are limited. This is a great place for fine dining in Mississauga, but is also pricey.
