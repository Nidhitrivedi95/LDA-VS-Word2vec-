RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg Was very impressed with the food. We ordered Butter Chicken and Saag Paneer. The Saag was puréed which was new to me. The Butter Chicken was delightful. Very good, high quality meat too. The naan we ordered had onion and perhaps cilantro. 

Definitely give this place a shot! Best Indian I've had recently in Madison.
