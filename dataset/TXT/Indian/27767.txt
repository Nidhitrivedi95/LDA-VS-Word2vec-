iS44aNB5h7bkAV3dzm9Fgw WOW! I took my mom here for mother's day dinner this summer and it just knocked our socks off.

We ordered the Lamb chops - which was amazingly good. They gave us three pieces and it was 27 bucks, very pricey!

The ghosh bhiryani is amazing! they have cashews and dates. I absolutely loved it!! One of the best bhiryani's I've ever had. Again, very pricey! around 20 something. 

We loved our food and would definitely come here again when we have that amount of money to afford it. It's awesome, delicious food. Their quantities are extremely petit. That  bhiryani plate is not enough to fill even one person, why does it have to be so small, whyyyyyyyyyyy.

The lamb chops were awesome, but there were only 3 thin chops!! not enough for one person as well. Especially considering the price of 27 bucks. 

But I loved the food, it was amazingly delicious. One of the best Indian restaurants int he city.
