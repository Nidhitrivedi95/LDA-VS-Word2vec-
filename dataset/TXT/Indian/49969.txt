u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw Came in around 6:30pm on Saturday. The man at the counter (the owner?) was super friendly. I told him it was my first time here, and he explained all the difference sauces for me (coconut coriander didn't have a coconut taste, but was quite fresh. Tamarind was good - sweet and slightly tart. Hot sauce was very clean tasting and quite delightful. Not too hot. The coleslaw was slightly tangy, and doesn't have a mayo base. Carrots and cabbage). Had the short ribs and the chicken mishkaki. I can see why the short ribs are their bestseller. They're quite tender. The chicken wasn't as tender as it could have been, but it wasn't super dry either. Nothing particularly distinct about the seasoning. Tasted like standard charcoal BBQ. That being said, THE MOGO. Cassava fries. Fairly chunky fries. I was a tad concerned when I first saw them, but they're super crispy on the outside, and fluffier than fries on the inside. They also don't have a nasty aftertaste like you get sometimes when you eat fries. They're also fresh. They're seasoned with something slightly spicy and slightly addictive. Yeah. The mogo I'll be back for...now if only their their hours were slightly later at night...
