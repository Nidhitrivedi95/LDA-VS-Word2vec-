bswktkxTqTFdhg8uvcuWWw My cousins brought me to this restaurant when I was visiting Canada. They kept raving about how good the food was so they brought me to witness for myself. I must admit, I'm happy I tried it out. The food was very delicious. It was definitely authentic Indian Food.

We started off with Chana, which is a combination of chick peas,  sweet yet spicy chutney (sorry, I don't know the actual name of the chutney) and yogurt.  It was a ray of flavors in my mouth. I loved it! 

For my main course, I got the butter chicken with naan. The chicken was tender and succulent. The portion was huge. It was so good  that I finished all of it. The naan was very different than the typical naan you get at other Indian restaurants. You can tell it had just come out of the oven or as Indian's like to call it the ''tandoor". Usually naan is a little greasy, but this naan was not greasy at all. 

The restaurant kind of looked like a fast food restaurant. I liked the fact that it was very clean. The service was good and prompt. I'm bummed we don't have a restaurant like this in Los Angeles. =(
