ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw If you are looking for nice ambiance and plethora of waiters serving you, then this place is for you. But if you are looking for authentic Indian food stay away from Origin India. I ordered Makhni (Butter) Chicken (medium to spicy) which is a common dish at Indian restaurants but what I received was bland Cream of Tomato Soup with pieces of chicken. After sending it back for the chef to make it spicier I got my dish back with green chilies on it, again which isn't Makhni Chicken. The waiter took my food away without even asking why I hadn't eaten it or if I would like it to go and just handed me the bill. Overall just a bad restaurant and service.
