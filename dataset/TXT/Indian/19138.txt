f-WuJzLy2yi7D95lPyrNCg Best if you love Indian/Pakistani food 
Had been here with few friends...ordered all mutton dishes...and it was just mouth watering..
Not just the non veg..even veg food had unforgettable taste..
We finished with Mango lassi..which was again just yum..
Me n my friends are a fan of this restaurant now and would definitely hop in next time..
