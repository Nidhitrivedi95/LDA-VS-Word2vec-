9cGvOaA1BYw-ByOXjNbu9A The food here was good.  That's the sole reason for 3 of 5 stars.  Otherwise, not a great dining experience.  We got sat promptly and given menus, but it took a solid 20 minutes for anyone to come back to take our order even though they kept looking at us.  We also were given a pitcher of room temperature water. 

The cleanliness of the restaurant is also very questionable.  We received one napkin for two of us and the napkin was already dirty.  Our paper placemats were also dirty, they had clearly been used by someone else.  Half our silverware was also filthy.  I was afraid to order a pop as to I was unsure the cleanliness of soda lines.

In the end the food was good and the chef did come out to make sure our food was good.  But the service is lacking and the lack of cleanliness is disturbing.
