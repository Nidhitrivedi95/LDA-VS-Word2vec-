I went here for the buffet recently.  They hardly had any food and promised to refill.  This lie is what made us agree to pay for the buffet.

They bring out only a little bit of food at a time.  There is tons of food in the back, and the whole restaurant was complaining about the lack of food especially the meat.  Yet only little bits would trickle out from their pre-made pile in the back.

They let you fill up on rice and naan which is well stocked but have to compete with other patrons for the meat.  

You are better off going elsewhere.  We left hungry and frustrated.

It's a trap and a ripoff.
