eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Decided to try this place for the first time since I was in the area. I love ethnic food, especially indian, and I've tried a couple in the valley, however none have been as good as this one! The vibe is calming yet the music makes it a little upbeat. If you're going for something low-key, this is the place! 

The food was great, a little spicy, so if you're not into that I'd ask for Mild. But the service was great, I had the pleasure of being waited on by the owner's son, who is extremely cute. If only I was a few years younger :)
