jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw They now have a lunch buffet with naan!! All you can eat! I stopped by for my Sunday treat ( been here several times now) and got this additional treat!  Nice buffet in addition to their wonderful menu. So i did the buffet.  Nicely spiced, raita by my side to cool it down. Delicious. I'll be back.
