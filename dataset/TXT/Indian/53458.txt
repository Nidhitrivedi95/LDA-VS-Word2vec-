VdnqeZXVfTRYB_ASLp8umg The food at this place is disgusting.  I would have given it 0 stars if that were possible.  I'm not usually hostile in my reviews, even when I don't like a place.  But this place was SO bad it pissed me off.  And at the prices they charge, I consider it fraud.  If it were not a** cold out, I would have driven all the way back to demand a refund for my take-out order.

I ordered Indian basics.  Veggie pakora, meat samosas, chicken korma, and aloo palak.  Only the meat samosa was even edible, and that's just because fried dough around ground beef is hard to ruin.  But it had no flavor or taste whatsover.  And the peas were uncooked, hard and crunchy.  Everything else went straight in the trash.  The pakora was like sawdust and the ratio of bland breading to alleged veggie was about 100:1.  The chicken korma looked and tasted like glue.  And the aloo palak looked fine, but had no taste whatsoever.  To be fair, the sweet sauce for the samosas was nice, but only because it tasted like barbecue sauce.  I suppose the rice was technically edible, although cold.  But what is the point of plain rice without anything to put on it?

I gripe all the time about ethnic food in Cleveland, and Indian is the worst genre.  But this is far and away the worst food of any kind I have tasted in Cleveland.
