UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ Hands down, my favorite Indian in the area. I would highly recommend the lunch buffet. They change up most of the options in the buffet line daily. They have a homestyle Northern flavors. I wish some of the dishes were hotter, but you can specify the level of heat when you order from the menu. Parking is tricky, but you can sometimes luck out on side streets.
