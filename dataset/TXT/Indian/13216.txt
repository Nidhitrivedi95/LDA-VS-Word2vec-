b7Cez__--oO39tisyyNueA Sahib is a solid Indian restaurant, with reasonable prices and a really nice atmosphere to dine in all in the heart of the otherwise limited dining of the west island. 
The food is consistently good, with a wide range of choices. The buffet is more limited, but the sit down menu has never let me down.
The staff are friendly. And they have Cobra beer on tap. 
This is a frequent stop on trips to pte Claire.
