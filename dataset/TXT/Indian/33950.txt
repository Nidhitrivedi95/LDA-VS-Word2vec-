m2xeKBhS0szlm7xfU5b8ew Excellent food great service. Amazing value. Couldn't believe how cheap it was. Everything was amazing. Butter naan could have been better but no complaints at all. Even their salads were really good. I'm surprised this place isn't more busy. Must be the unfortunate location of being on the second level. Will be coming here again and again!
