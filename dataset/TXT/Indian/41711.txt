q7fAiwQVfCxLM3Uvk2oslg I actually stumbled upon Anantha Bhavan, I didn't plan to go there. The M&M meat shop happened to be right next to it, so I had to check this place out. The first I tried there were the rolls. They had the mutton roll, chicken roll and veggie roll. I fell in love with all of them. It tasted so good and at a reasonable price too. Since then I have been coming to this place whenever I wanted a snack. 

On my second visit, one of the cashiers recommended me to try mutton kotu and masala dosa. I've never tried mutton kotu before, so I thought of giving it a shot. It's a combination of roti and mutton scrambled together and my my my it was good. It was spicy but the flavour just explodes in your mouth.

The dosa, on the other hand, wasn't that great for the price I paid.
