RGLC87HVaASIYLxh2RL4hg This was one of my worst experiences at a restaurant ever.  The food was good but the service was abysmal.  

When we arrived, it was about 6pm on a Saturday night.  A few of the tables were reserved, but there were plenty of open tables, and we were seated right away.  About five minutes after we got there, someone dropped off glasses of water for us, but didn't say anything.  It took another five minutes for our waitress to get to our table.  We were hungry and had had 10 minutes to review the menu so we ordered.  That was the last time our waitress gave us a look until it was time for the check. There's just no excuse for that.  It took about a half hour for our appetizer to arrive.  Both the appetizer and dinner were delivered by a nice kid who seemed to work in the kitchen.  Because again, our waitress wouldn't even look at our table. 
 
A man who I presume was the owner was onsite, and floating around, but apparently not moved enough to actually help out his wait staff. If he doesn't want to lift a finger to actually work at his restaurant, then he needs to hire more efficient wait staff.  And train them well.  A good waiter or waitress does not avoid a customer's table for an hour, showing up only when it's time to pay.  

Like I said, it's good food.  But I won't even be back for carryout because I do not want to support a restaurant that so obviously doesn't care about its customers.
