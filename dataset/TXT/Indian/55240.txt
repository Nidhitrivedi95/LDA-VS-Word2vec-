My husband got the jerk chicken roti and couldn't stop raving about it.  I had the chicken and potato roti and it was perfect for me because I don't like food too spicy.  We also got a few drinks which were very reasonably priced.  Definitely lived up to our expectations. Seriously the portions are huge so keep that in mind.
