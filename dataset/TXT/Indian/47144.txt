Tal9LqH3fvSDiF_-YDnfEg Indian Delight is the newest entry in growing collection of Detroit Shoreway neighborhood. They are open 7 days a week, and I think they may have a lunchtime buffet (at least the buffet stand was set up with christmas tinsel no less). It has authentic plastic table cloths and the decoration is pretty spartan. We tried the vegetarian samosas which were pretty good. I had Chicken Makhani which was delicious and my friend had Chicken Saagwala. We were both wimps and ordered our food medium which turned out to be more like mild. The basmati rice was really good and plentiful and the naan was excellent. It's a great addition to the hood, and I see a lot of Indian carryout in my future
