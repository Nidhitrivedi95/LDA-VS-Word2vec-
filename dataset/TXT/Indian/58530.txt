YK6XFE1SbLZGGXIKZmrQ-Q Ordered from here online and waited for an hour and 15 minutes. Called them up to see what was taking so long and said it would be there shortly, after seeking clarification he said the order hadn't even gone out yet. I told him to cancel the order and he tried to tell me I was an unreasonable person who didn't understand how restaurants work. Apparently wait times aren't really a factor in the restaurant business like I had been previously led to believe.
