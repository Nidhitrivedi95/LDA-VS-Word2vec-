cvELVLQ4jbS5Qqbm79IxVA We were so exited to try a new Indian place with so many 5 star reviews.  Unfortunately, we went last week before the newer reviews were posted.  My sincere apologies to those who endured a meal there due to my delay in getting this review in.  There were several reviews saying this was the best Indian food they had ever eaten?  Really?  Have you ever had Indian food?

Based on early reviews we went in with high expectations.  They were so nice that we would really have liked them to succeed.  But that isn't going to happen.    

On the plus side, the owner could not have been nicer.  He came out several times to see if we were happy.  We had a bottle of wine - no corkage charge.  The entrees here are about $3-4 less than other Indian restaurants so it was an inexpensive meal.   Also, since the food isn't very good, there is always plenty of seating.

We had the Chicken 65 as an appetizer.  It tasted like yesterday's tandoori chicken with some veggies and unremarkable sauce.  Also tired the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala.  See the photos below.  Can you tell which is which?  The worst part is, it wasn't much easier to tell the difference when eating them.  Both where very heavy on the tomato sauce.  Perhaps this is an attempt to make Americanized Indian food devoid of spice?  If so, it doesn't work.

By far the worst was the Naan.  I know things change by region in India, but this Naan must have come from the region so far to the west that it was in the Arabian Peninsula.  It looked and tasted a lot more like pita than Naan.  See the photo.

If you are in the area and have a hankering for Indian food, just head to Mintt.  It's worth the extra couple of bucks.
