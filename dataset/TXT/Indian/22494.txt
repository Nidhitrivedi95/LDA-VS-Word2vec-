gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Awesome service and good! Ask for raffi! He comes to the table and explains all the food. Order the samosas and veggie cutlet for appetizer then the dessert with paste made of almond, saffron, and sugar served with ice cream on top. Too notch service and traditional food. We live nearby and can't wait to return!
