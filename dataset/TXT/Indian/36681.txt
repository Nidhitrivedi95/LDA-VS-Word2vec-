NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg We've eaten at Choolaah 3-4 times in the last few weeks and every time the food has exceeded our expectations! The salmon and chicken tikkas are fresh, succulent and grilled to perfection. We've tried almost everything on the menu and it's hard to pick a favorite...biryani, bbq plates and sandwiches are all mouth watering! Fiery hot sauce can be added for those who enjoy an extra kick. Kulfi, mango lassi and chai are definitely not to be missed. The  place has a cool vibe and the chic contemporary interiors are very representative of modern India. A restaurant like this was much needed in Cleveland. Choolaah will appeal to both novices and connoisseurs of Indian food. Highly recommend it!
