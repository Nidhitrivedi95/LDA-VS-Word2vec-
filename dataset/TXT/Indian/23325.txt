gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I took the family for the lunch buffet and it was the best Indian buffet in Las Vegas.   I had been to just about every Indian buffet in town before getting a recommendation from a friend.  The place was clean, the food was well stocked, and the fresh naan that's included with the $8.99 was excellent.   Particularly good was the chicken tikka masala.  Since my kids liked it, I will be going back there often.
