3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw I've been there many times.... I would have given this 4 stars previously.
After my last visit, I'm not so sure.
I can't put my finger on it, perhaps the buffet is worse or my tastes are changing, but the food was not doing anything for me, even though 90% of it was the same selection as all my previous visits.

One thing that is definitely a minus is the naan is not at the buffet anymore, they bring a basket to the table.... not a big deal but it's only the regular naan!!!! why???? we asked if there was some garlic naan, and they brought us regular naan which had been covered with (what I believe) was garlic butter spread - definitely not the garlic naan they used to have at the buffet.

** bring back the garlic naan, bring it back to me, sweet lovely garlic naan-y **
