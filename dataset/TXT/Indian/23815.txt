gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Awesome Indian noms!!  I was in town for business and we wanted Indian.  This place was worth the cab ride off the strip.  Great flavor, and they offer spicy.  I always order spicy, but it never comes spicy, and this place nailed it!  Great service too. Would definitely return next time I am in town!
