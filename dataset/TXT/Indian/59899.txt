ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg Slightly disappointed. Ordered delivery. The food arrived fairly quickly and still nice and hot. The vegetable samosa was delicious however the chicken tikka masala, although flavorful, the chicken I got was over-cooked and felt like rubber biting into it. A lot of the pieces were also inedible because it was mostly cartilage. Maybe just a bad batch?
