gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Phenomenal. The butter chicken, the garlic Naan, the chicken tikka masala, the tandoori chicken, the rice pudding, all incredible. I don't like to review until I've tried multiple dishes and I'm sure. This place has exquisite Indian food. The food is spicy where it should be, sweet where it's needed, and a great balance of flavors that aren't just overdone to compensate for poor food.

Truly authentic, from the moment you walk in, you smell the rich roasting spices, and are greeted by a warm and inviting staff.  The owner takes personal responsibility for your visit, always there to check in, refill your drink, or talk about Katmandu, Nepal, where he's from. The only Indian food in the desert I'd recommend. Period.
