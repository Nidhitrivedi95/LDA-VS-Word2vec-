I was craving some Indian food and decided to try a new place.  This review focuses on delivery as that's what we got.

Pros:
Fast delivery

Cons:
Not as "authentic" as it could be

We ordered the butter chicken (of course), lamb korma and the xacutti chicken.  Placed the order at about 7:00pm and there was a knock on the door at about 7:30pm.  I've had pizza take longer to get to my place from a shorter distance.  The delivery guy was friendly and left before I had a chance to tip him.  I'm glad I caught him in time.  

The butter chicken was different from what I'm used to.  It's less on the creamy side and more on the tomato-y side.  I'm more a fan of creamier butter chicken but this one was still pretty good.  The main thing was there use of fenugreek.  They had by far the most fenugreek I've seen in butter chicken.  It really added to the texture of the dish and made it more enjoyable.

The lamb korma was the weakest of the 3 in my opinion.  It was a little more on the oily side than most kormas I've had in the past.  The xacutti was my favourite only because of the uniqueness of the dish.  I've never seen this dish on other menus at Indian restaurants. It's described as a coconut cream sauce.  You can taste the coconut, but there's also a lot of other flavours going on.  If you come here, definitely give this one a try.

Earth Indian will be on my list of places to go eat in for the future.  I will update this review accordingly when I do.
