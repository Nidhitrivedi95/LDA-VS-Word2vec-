o_sq_rvTBo59hm6TkDi6tg The food and ambience was great but the servers need to be trained on proper serving etiquette. Cannot discount their politeness though. Price was on the reasonable side considering that it was a fine dining restaurant.

The food was very authentic. Not being an Indian or a Pakistani person, I was able tell the difference compared to the famous Canadian buffet Indian restaurant. Had the Chicken Tikka Masala which was really good. My wife liked the Chicken Biriyani. My cousin had the Chicken Kebab and he liked that too.

The restaurant and the ambience makes it feel homely.

The server Sheveta was very polite, always with a smile and engaging.

However, those who brought the food to the table on many occasions served my wife across me. They never bothered to go upto her except for once out of the four time (aprox) they came to the table. It was the same even for water. My uncle was a veteran Banquets Manager of the Oberoi Hotel chain and I remember him pulling up his staff when this etiquette was violated. Defeats the term "fine dining."
