2t-a8qkgoRiiohThDVjfNw You won't get such delicious and authentic Indian food anywhere else. Enough of the cheap buffets and all you can eats. Indian food is meant to be cooked slowly with all the right spices and shared family style.  These guys bring in some of the best chefs to make food which would be hard to find outside India and they do it phenomenally. Try their sizzling black bean tofu with gravy, tandoori paneer sizzler, afghani chicken sizzler, malai kofta (never had one so creamy and soft), goan fish curry and lamb rogan josh. Get a reservation on weekends because it will be packed! Don't expect to get a seat right away with just a walk in!
