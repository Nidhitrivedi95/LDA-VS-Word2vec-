CXG4kMMiq2JUDhUgl94QTQ Probably the best thing you can say about this place is it's better than the Indian Pakistani place that was here before them since they use less oil.  
I guess it's easy to take over another restaurant but it's hard to maintain consistency. I try  take out once with a couple different dishes and I really wonder if most of these Yelp reviews on here eat much Indian food .... I can name at least five Indian places nearby that are much better. 
The best thing I like about them is at least they have two sizes if you're not really hungry otherwise it's more like banquet hall quality style food.
