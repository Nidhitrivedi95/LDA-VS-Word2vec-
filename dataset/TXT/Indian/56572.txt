xu3JbicQsPv1lay0cT6tRw I'm so glad we drove past Cleveland Tiffin on our way to oil change one day and we decided to give it a shot. Cleveland Tiffin is where we go for authentic home-cooked Indian meal - just like how mom cooks - not too much oil/grease/masalas, unlike restaurants. 
The food is truly yummilicious, unlike most Indian restaurants in the area. We order and call ahead (they also have a daily menu) and have enjoyed everything we have ordered here.
Our favorite 5 are: saag, chicken tikka masala, Punjabi pakora kadhi, mattar paneer, and rajma chawal. We also love the samosas and pakoras here. And the chilly chicken, goat curry, besan gatte ki sabji, aloo baingan and baingan bharta. LOL yes we love everything we have ever tried here!
Cannot wait to try their aloo poori masala, chole poori/bhature, karela and zucchini! 
Give them a call :)
