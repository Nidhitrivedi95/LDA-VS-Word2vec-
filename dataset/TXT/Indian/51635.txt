My husband who goes to Las Vegas regularly on business trips, introduced me to the restaurant and I was hooked. This is his go to place he says, for a meal that is closest to a home cooked meal plus the variety they offer. He is on first name basis with the servers here and I found them very friendly and efficient. They also adjust the level of spice and you can opt for a healthier version of an item devoid of the butter. When I visit Las Vegas again, I will definitely go back to this wonderful restaurant for it is indeed a refreshing and a healthy change from all those heavy food indulgences that one can be subjected to on the Vegas strip!
