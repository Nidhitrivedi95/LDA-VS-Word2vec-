5KsvP10z9InBcI6hhqjjKg I've never tasted such tasteless menu. As being of East Indian descent, the food was bland, below Indian standards. There was no taste in the food, especially the vegetarian options. 

The variety of desserts especially the Indian desserts were displeasing to the eyes. 

The vegetable naan bread given the fact it has mashed vegetables inside it, was empty and had a yellow - ish color to it. 

I would definitely not visit this place again and I would recommend others to do their own research.
