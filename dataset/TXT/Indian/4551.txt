1WE-vUAugCNBg7-Vg4HKBg When I worked in the Yonge & Bloor area, this was a place I would frequent.

They had an exceptional lunch deal and I loved their naan bread.

I believe this place is very authentic and absolutely worth the price when you go there for a weekday lunch. It was also a favourite among my coworkers. Even times when one of us packed our own lunch, it would sit in the fridge for an extra day because it got bumped for a Biryani House lunch special.
