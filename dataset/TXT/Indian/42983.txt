rgG2k-8qHXuO4ZKhC1AmIA La Sani Grill...comes on my Visa statement at least once a month. 

Great place, located central-ish part of Scarborough, there's also a Pickering location. Both places have the same set up, nice clean open kitchen look. If you going with a large crowd for dine in, would recommend the Pickering location. Finding parking in the Markham Road location is just annoying at times. 

Food - For the price you really cannot complain. Some things that I tried are : 

- Butter Chicken - Nice creamy butter chicken. Not skimpy on the protein and definitely not some premix from a bottle.  

- Half Chicken Roast - Comes with half naan, salad, half chicken, rice, and the sauces. For $14 with tax you can't go wrong. Well flavored and infused chicken and rice. Would recommend getting extra hot sauce, they drizzle on top of the chicken..( fist pump emoji ) 

-Chicken Tika Wrap - Good for a quick snack. Chicken Tika, veggies, wrapped in a naan.

-Lamb Chops - Good seasoning, but was rough to chew. Smaller chops then regular. Unless you really really want lamb chops would recommend skipping this one.  

-Chicken Tika Boti / Tandoori - Comes in the same way as half chicken roast. Well seasoned meat. Don't forget the hot sauce ;-) 

Good place to try out and for take out, good portion sizes. Would recommend for all occasions.
