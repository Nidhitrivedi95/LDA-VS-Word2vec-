-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Disappointed by the service. We were hoping for a nice warm dinner before heading back home and stopped at Udipi Cafe on Old William Penn Highway. The food was decent, but the service was horrible. It took them forever to take our order. My daughter's food was not served until all of us had already eaten. We had to wait about 20 minutes for dessert, and it was not served till we had already gathered our things to leave.

We tried to point out the poor service to the manager and he responded very disdainfully that the restaurant was busy, and there was no apology for poor service.

We have been to plenty of restaurants that are busier and hold their staff accountable for providing quality.

Once again- disappointed.
