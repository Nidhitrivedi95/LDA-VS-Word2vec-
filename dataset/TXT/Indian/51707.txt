UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA I haven't been here since it was a Himalayan place. What took me so long to come here! I had stopped down the street at India Masala for Dosa Tuesday, only to find out their chef quit and they're no longer serving South Indian food. So I left and came here.

First thing that caught my eye was one their first page of the menu, inferno naan. YESSSS please. We were asked to sign a consent prior to ordering. What the? Made with ghost peppers and habanero chills, it came out looking so plain, but when you open up the naan, it was loaded with peppers.  I took one bite, it was horrid. I love spicy food, but I like a good taste with the spice. This was pure nastiness. I had to spit it out. My nose, lips and tongue immediately started burning, thankfully I had a full lassi in front of me that cooled down the heat. 

Onto the next one. I was excited to see that they served Northern and Southern Indian food. I ordered my favorite, Mysore Masala Dosa, red chili chutney and potatoes, and onions. This was by far the best dosa I have ever had. The chutney served with it was really good as well. 

We also ordered the lamb kabobs, these were nice and tender, great flavor too. Of course we had to order cheese naan, every americans favorite. I love naan. I could eat it for days.

The most exciting thing tho, they have a lassi bar! I tried the mango and rose lassi (two, don't judge). I love a good mango lassi. I've never seen a place have a lassi bar, there were so many different flavors to choose from. I will most likely be trying all of them. 

I like this place, a lot. Good Indian food. I like that they serve both cuisines. Kinda like when you go to a Thai place and you can get Northern and Southern style. I like options.
