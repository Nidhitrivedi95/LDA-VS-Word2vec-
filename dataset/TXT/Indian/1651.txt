-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA 5 star! I was driving to Phoenix from Tucson and wanted some good Indian food. I am so glad we decided to go to Chutneys. My fiance got the butter chicken and it was pretty close to the authentic Hyderabadi butter chicken I so missed. I got the mysore masala dosa which came with TWO chutneys and thick, flavorful sambhar that was almost as good as my Mom's sambhar. We shared a medu vada to start, and it was crisp and delicious as well. Since I was such a fan already, I decided to take some chicken manchuria and fried rice to go for the next day. I haven't eaten Indian chinese food since my trip to India the previous year, and I was so satisfied that I am willing to drive to Phoenix just for dinner sometime to appease my homesickness. The wait staff was friendly, and the decor very inviting. I will definitely return!
