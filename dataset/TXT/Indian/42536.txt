r7JM2s-kkcFf47H7yl0PUw Sometimes when you want Indian food, you don't know exactly what dish your tummy is asking for, so the answer of course is The Indian Lunch Buffet.  

My first visit to Ann Purna was a smashing success.  I was on my own, so had plenty of time for (too) many visits to the food table!

The pakora starters were fresh and crispy, with the vegetables as the star, not the batter.

They offer a small selection of main dishes, and to be honest, when I took my first look at them, I was prepared to be underwhelmed.  The sauces looked watery and they seemed to have some vegetable combos I didn't recognize (although as a Anglo my vegetarian Indian cuisine knowledge is somewhat limited).

However, the food was simply wonderful.  My favorite was what I think was a saucy variation of aloo gobi, it was deliciously sweet, creamy & spicy.  The lentil dal (which I usually don't care for) was a great excuse for more basmati & naan, which was fresh and puffy from the oven.

I was early for lunch (just before noon), and sat and read while the buffet was prepared.  I think it was ready to go between 12:15 & 12:30.  I ate so much I didn't want supper later that evening, so it was a good value for me :)

What a great location in St. Patrick's Square; easy to get to from the city centre and the university, and about a mile walk home for me.
