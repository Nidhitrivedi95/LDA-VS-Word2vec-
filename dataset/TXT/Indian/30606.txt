kEIe_lyBKdFB6Hv_wsUYaw I've ordered here a few times the last time I ordered the food took and hour and a half literally from the time of ordering with no discount or apology so i figured busy night give them another try well tonight was utterly disgusting i ordered a mango lassi well tonight I assuming they thought well let's pour some more salt I was left with a nice plump fly right on top of the drink I'm now questioning the entire meal and stopped eating halfway through will be demanding refund
