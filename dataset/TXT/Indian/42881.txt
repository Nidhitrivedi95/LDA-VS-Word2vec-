RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg I had my first experience with Indian Food yesterday, and I must say... I'm glad it was at Blue Taj. Not only is the decor warm and comfortable, but the wait staff was above and beyond helpful. As a vegetarian, it was easy for me to tell the server what I did and did not eat and he easily gave me a recommendation. And man was the food aawesome!

My good friend Mo was educating us on the ins and outs of Indian food, including the naan and spice levels. I would gladly go back to Blue Taj and leave my food decision in the hands of the staff. Well done!
