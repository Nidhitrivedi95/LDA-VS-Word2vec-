qjaMwPcTyq5_JLcZpmTqNw Let me be honest, this place has tasty food. This is what made me travel for more than an hour to this restaurant.

But beware when you take out food. For some reason, they happen to make a lot of "accidents" in the number of items ( just in placing them) while being super accurate in the bill.

The owner told me that it's always my responsibility to verify the quantity and number while doing take out from there ( which shows how unreliable they are).

Also their service is one of the worst. They mess up with the orders and delay food all the time.

Please be careful while doing take out and make sure you confirm it before you leave the place or be ready to face the worst customer service and worst attitude on the phone ( he blatantly said that his business is thriving and a few unhappy customers are not going to make any difference to him).

Hope that none of you reading this review have such a bad experience.
