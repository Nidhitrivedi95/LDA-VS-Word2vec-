9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g We have been regular customers of Amber since they opened, and prior to that at Minerva's. I gave a very good review here previously, but I have to amend my rating. Tonight was the second evening we've been in and had VERY POOR SERVICE, bordering on being totally ignored. Also the first time we've ever complained about any of the food.

After being seated, we waited 20 minutes to have our order taken.  We requested additional rice 3 times throughout the meal, and never got any until we were ready to leave. We had to wait for our check, we had to wait for the credit card to be returned. Several other tables of customers had been seated, served, and left before we got our check. The restaurant was nearly full while we were eating, and almost completely empty by the time we finally left - and not because we wanted to stay.

I often order the Egg Biryani, a dish I've enjoyed very much there in the past. The first time I had it there, it had 4 eggs in it, and was topped with whole cashews and raisins. Over time the number of eggs decreased, and tonight, the dish had less than one whole egg, no raisins and no cashews. Very disappointing. Basically rice with part of an egg.

In addition, 2 of us ordered the lentil soup, which we often have. And while it was tasty, it was about 1/2 a serving.

At several times throughout the meal one or more of us desperately needed water, but could not attract the attention of any waitstaff. 

When I expressed to the man I think must be the owner my dissatisfaction with my entree, he made quite a show of promising to make me another, with all of the missing ingredients, to go. However, in spite of our extensive wait (it was probably 30-45 minutes from the time he said he would bring the replacement dish out until we left), it never appeared. Nor did we ever see him again.

I will probably give the restaurant one more try, but I've lost a good deal of my previous enthusiasm for going there.
