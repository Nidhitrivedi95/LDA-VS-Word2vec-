ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw This was the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to. I have had indian food in various states from IL, MI, and now Vegas. They had the most beautiful decor,classy atmosphere,wonderful staff, and the most freshest and purest ingredients ever. Not one thing was drenced in oil. Nothing left me feeling heavy or guilty. I had the chicken makani,aloo gobi, (yes I was sharing with someone else lol) and this spinach and paner dish.....can't exactly remember but we ordered it as a side dish.  Oh and the mango lassi was to die for. Their rice is super fragrent and the whole cloves you could smell a mile away. Best indian restaurant ever. And being in love with Indian food and trying over 2 dozen trying to find the best one......is not at home in michigan its her in vegas. (Aunt lives her....so I will DEF be back) try it! You wont regret it

P.s. my waitress was from sri lanka, I forgot her name....but she was amazing!
