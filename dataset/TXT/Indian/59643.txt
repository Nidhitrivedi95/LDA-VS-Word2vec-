Zcd2yYA5ck-38duDOg6dww Wow - I had no idea that such an interesting Indian place opened up here so close by to Thornhill.

The food is 100% vegetarian. It is also served in a most interesting way - in the carrier tiffin boxes. Each main is served with 1 more veg dish, salad, chappati/Naan and rice. The three of us ordered Rajma, ghatte shatte de curry and lotus root kofta. All dishes were awesome and the side dish was a mixed squash curry - also excellent. Remember to ask for pickle and onion. 

For dessert we ordered kulfi and gulab jamun and our son ordered Masala tea.

Every item was excellent. Prices are reasonable - this is an informal place but quite "nice" in terms of decor and serving presentation. $ 7-10 appetizers and $12-14 mains is quite reasonable. Service was friendly and we will surely be back.
