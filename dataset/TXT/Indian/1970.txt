-z_DR7omzpcR__l7MbDu0A Ordered(Pick up) Egg biryani on 11/25.
While having my Egg Biryani found CHICKEN piece
Later I figured out that it was actually a chicken biryani where these guys removed the chicken and  just added some masala topping with 3 egg pieces and made it Egg biryani.

PS: I'm a Egg'eterian.Never had meat in my life.
