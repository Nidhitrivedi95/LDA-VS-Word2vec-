sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ I'm sad to say that I can't agree with all the other Yelp-ers and give this place a 5-star review :(

I ordered the Butter Chicken Roti and when I got my order, it was just....okay. Maybe it was because I ordered the "Mild" version, but I thought the sauce wasn't fragrant enough and the chicken was dry. The roti was hard to cut through (as if the dough was overworked) though it has a nice flavour. I didn't expect for it to be rolled so thinly though, I think I actually prefer a thicker roti shell. The amount of chicken you get in the filling is what you'd expect from a roti filling - although people have complained that there isn't enough, it's a $11.95 for cripes sake! What do you expect? The size of the actual roti itself is ginormous - enough for 2 meals.

The girl that was taking my order at the counter was really pleasant too. if anything, I would rate the service at a 5 - service with a smile :) I also really like the feeling that it's a little mom and pop joint.

EDIT: I finished the other half of my Butter Chicken 2 days after ordering it and it seemed a lot more fragrant (upped from 3 to 4 stars)! The roti itself softened up though. If I were to order it again (probably not in the near future though, just because I want to try other places) I would probably order it one spice level up.
