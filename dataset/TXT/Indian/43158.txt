RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA Initially slow service was far outweighed by the excellent food in large quantities at very reasonable prices. For a Saturday night the place was, given the level of quality, surprisingly empty. In recent years, since I started going for side-orders rather than making a pig of myself with starters, I can't recall eating so much in an Indian restaurant. Definitely one to go back to but they need to work on that initial 5 to 10 minute period when you first arrive. Knocking off two stars following my visit here with work a couple of Tuesdays ago. We were a party of 13 and there was another large table set out when we arrived plus a smattering of duos/couples yet there were only 2 waiting staff on. The quality of the food was undiminished yet that in no way makes up for it taking nearly 3 hours in all for us to be fully served. Add to that the fact they were lucky to get the booking at all seeing as they failed to respond to my initial email request for a table and I had to resort to phoning them up & the result is I won't be back until I see some improvement noted on this site. Such a shame considering how it was a couple of years ago.
