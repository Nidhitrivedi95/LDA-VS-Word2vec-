The food in and of itself is nothing to write home about. The guy taking the orders is friendly enough- we got our food to go so I cannot comment on the table side customer service. I must mention the portions are what a true Hakka place should be - enough to feed a family of 4 easily if you stick to the standard one meat and one rice dish. 

Our food was still hot when we got home so we were happy about that. So we ordered the Hakka staples - chicken lollipops, chicken corn soup, house special fried rice and chilli chicken. 

The chicken lollipops were delicious and juicy. The chilli chicken was made with an extreme amount of soy sauce so it was very salty and the gravy itself was quite dark. The chicken corn soup was tasteless with large chunks of chicken - add the chili vinegar which they thankfully provide and some soy sauce and it saved the soup to make it yummy! The fried rice was good - but it wasn't true Hakka style fried rice - it did not have that fire kissed char flavour you look for in great fried rice. 

Overall I will definitely come back because it's so close by and in a great location. They offer wonderful lunch specials which I would suggest making use of it so that you can try different things each time! 

A must try is the chicken lollipops - they aren't as good as Hakka Legend but they hit the spot!
