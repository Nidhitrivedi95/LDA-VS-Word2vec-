In addition to the more standard type Indian entrees you will find (korma, tandoori chicken), they had a few Southern Indian foods in the buffet.  Each dish was very flavorful, and I liked that they weren't afraid to kick up the spice level on the dishes.  The buffet for lunch is $8.99 and they do have a dinner buffet on the weekend for 12 or 13 dollars I believe.  The owner was very friendly and I will definitely like to come here again for more Indian food.
