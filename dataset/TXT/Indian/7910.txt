6P4ZzCdd_YQqncnQv1jplQ I want to give 5 stars because the food is great. All fresh and really good. Saag paneer medium wow! All The bread options, hell yeah! The waiters are nice but not the most outgoing so don't expect benihana. Also not the fastest thus the 4 star. Did I mention the food is sooo good and fresh! Come for the food, drink to forget any service issues. Definitely coming back.
