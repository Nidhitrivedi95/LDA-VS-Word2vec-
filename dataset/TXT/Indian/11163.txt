abWt3B-dvJ1oVj83ebYoyg How did I not know about this place? I joined a few friends who were well on their way through the second course by the time I got there. So I just tasted all their dishes and ordered drinks. The food was fabulous! The khao say and mutton curry were my faves. As were the cocktails. I loved the cardamom gin and saffron shots (with real saffron). I finished off with flaky pastry stuffed with sweetened condensed milk and some authentic chai. I'm already planning my next meal there.  

P.S. Don't forget to ask the story behind the wedding dress hanging at the entrance. You won't be disappointed.
