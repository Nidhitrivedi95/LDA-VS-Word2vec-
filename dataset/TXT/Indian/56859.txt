xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I love fry bread and this place is as authentic as a restaurant can be!!!! 

Indian tacos are my favorite and for dessert I love the honey and sugar fry bread. Usually I have to share dessert and don't eat for a few hours prior to my visit. 

The people are friendly- but it's a bit confusing as to if you leave your dishes or put them somewhere. Feels like a small mom and pop place... Not many signs and tables broken etc. they are moving soon (still) so that could be why. 

I love the food and the food is phenomenal!! I think with a little more attention on ambiance and service they would be jam packed all the time. 

Must try if you're in Phoenix !!!!!!
