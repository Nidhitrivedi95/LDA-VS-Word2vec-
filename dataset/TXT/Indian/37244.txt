o3dA9fcwg84luw9yamk7wQ My God. I ordered a medium hot butter chicken roti. Im from Kolhapur, a city in India that eats the spiciest food. But this medium hot had me crying. I wonder how their hot and extra hot might be. This isn't what I'd recommend. All I could taste was spice, and not the good kind. Bad memory.
