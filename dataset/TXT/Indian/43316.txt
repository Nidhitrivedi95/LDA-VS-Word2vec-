RkOguMKU13hPglELb6t2Vg Royal Indian Bistro is pretty nice; with a slight overkill of gold and a chandelier it feels like Trump's powder room, but with big comfortable booths. Best of all, it feels cushioned from the smoke and noise of the casino.  With the nice white linens, I felt bad being so nam-messy. 

The food was great, and someone watching me eat may have thought I was Ganesha with four arms. You expect the chicken tikka masala at an Indian buffet to be a bit runny and lacking in chicken, heavy on the masala.  Not here.  Maybe it was because there were only four other people here (Monday at 2pm, which is Tuesday 2am in India).  But all the hot dishes, well-presented in catering dishes with digital thermometer readings, lids, and utensil holders, were all great.  I skipped half of the dishes (lentils and chickpeas), but the aloo gobi has big chunks of potato, the basmati rice is fluffy (peas? ick), the chicken tikka masala was creamy with big tender chunks of chicken, the naan fluffy with crisp edges, the tandoori chicken with onion slices was nice and dry (my preference), and the lamb curry was not baaaad.

(One star off for expensive drink options)
