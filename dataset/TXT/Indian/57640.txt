yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Went for dinner with my husband on a weekend night, with a reservation. We were seated at a table near the front which wasn't the greatest - right next to the hostess stand and by the door to the connected shop next door. So guests and staff were going through the door right next to me throughout our meal. If you're seated there I would recommend asking for a different table!
Service was a little bit slow, took 10-15 minutes until our order was taken. Water glasses were refilled regularly. We enjoyed the vege appetizer platter, but unfortunately it really filled us up and we didn't have much appetite for the mains. The spice level in my main was disappointing. We were asked on ordering - I asked for a 7, assuming that a 10 would be very hot, and a 7 would be about a medium-hot. My '7' malai kofta was very mild, and my husband's aloo ghobi (also a '7') was really lacking in flavor and spice, extremely mild. The garlic naan was very good. We ended up boxing the rest of our mains to take home, it tasted better the next day. 
Overall experience okay, but just a little disappointing, perhaps since we'd seen the reviews on here were so good! Probably won't come back here again.
