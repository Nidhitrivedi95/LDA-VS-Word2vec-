BSchC5THOB0MFmzJTEqAnQ I used to be a regular customer at this location and used to be one of my favourite until about 3 months ago, I noticed a change in the taste and freshness. I decided to give it another chance today and was surprised there were no customers inside and for a moment I thought not to get in but I finally convinced my self to do it. unfortunately things were even more disappointing than last time and this explains why the restaurant has no customer tonight. food was not fresh and prepared with old frying oil. I feel sorry to lose one of my favourite restaurants because I'm not coming back here.
