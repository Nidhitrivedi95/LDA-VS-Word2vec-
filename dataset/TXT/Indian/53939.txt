VoHTd4QkPGWXl6IGI72isQ The food here is very good however the service is hit or miss.  We go here every couple of months and eat inside.  The decorum inside is great and the food is fantastic.  Unfortunately the service can occasionally be sub par.  Example: the other night we waited almost 20 minutes before we were even offered our drinks after we sat down.  Then waited another 10 minutes until we got them.  Then another 10 minutes before we were asked our dinner order.  They were busy but 40 minutes until we could order?  We've had other occasions where the service was perfect.  Like I said, hit or miss.
