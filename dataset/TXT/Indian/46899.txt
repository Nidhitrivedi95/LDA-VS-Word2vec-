t4bBKVXbr8bIN9nEJIobYg We just happened to call them for carry out because we wanted Indian food and they were the closest one to us. I didn't know it was there first re-opening night and oh what a treat! My husband had the lamb vindaloo and I had the lamb korma  with both garlic and plain naan bread. The entire meal was amazing!! They were busy but the bartender --Britney-- was super nice and talked to me while i waited. We will be going back again, but this time to sit and dine.
