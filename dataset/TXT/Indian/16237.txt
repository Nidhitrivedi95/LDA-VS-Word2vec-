DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA We bought groupons as we were sitting at the restaurant, excited for the deal. Then we loaded up on orders to our max.  Unfortunately there is only one groupon allowed per table says the owner with a stick up his butt.  This was our first time at this restaurant and the owner served us.  He stuck to his guns and would not budge on letting us use 2 groupons, even though he openly admitted to being able to make an exception.  We will not go again and definitely not recommending to anyone.  Food wasn't even very good.  No spices and pop that you grow accustomed to in a good Indian dish.  The owner looks like he's from ohio, not bombay.

I think it's completely unprofessional that the OWNER complains about not getting a tip when he was a dick to us.  How about learning some customer service before entering in the retail food industry.

Much better Indian restaurants in Vegas by far!!
Try these for tasty, authentic Indian food and unconditionally friendly service:

1. The Mint - Flamingo and Maryland
2. Mount Everest - Sahara and Arville
3. India Masala - Flamingo and Swenson
4. India Palace - Twain and Paradise

I will never go back to Samosa Factory and urge you not to patron this poor excuse for a restaurant.  Some people are not suited to be in front of customers.  Rick, the owner here, believes the customer is always WRONG.  Not the way to win repeat or new business.
