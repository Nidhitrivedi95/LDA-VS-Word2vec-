gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg This is, by far, my favorite restaurant in town! Everything is vegetarian-friendly, and there are a lot of vegan options clearly marked on the menu. The staff is very warm and welcoming, and the owner always makes an appearance to make sure everyone is well-fed and satisfied. I've honestly never felt more welcomed at any other establishment like I do here at Ruchi. 
The food is phenomenal. If you're looking to treat your taste buds, look no further. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. From their curries and dosai, to their delicious bread also known as paratha or naan, everything is packed with a lot of flavor and a lot of passion. For someone who does not normally willingly eat spicy food, I just can't help myself when I sit down to eat here. It's simply too good to pass up. (Let me add that this is coming from the same person who thinks mild is spicy.) I've recently moved away from Arizona and the saddest part about that is not being so close to my beloved Ruchi, but you better bet it's the first stop I make when I'm back in town! There's no place I'd rather sit and eat, even with a runny nose, than here. Thank you, Ruchi!
