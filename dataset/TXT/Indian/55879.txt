xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w Food was passable, the dishes were dirty, the glasses were dirty, and the food seemed like it came out of a plastic container in a fridge and just got microwaved, and the staff seemed so busy even though no one was in the restaurant, it seemed like they wanted to close early. Overall if you want Indian and have nowhere else to go, then go to this restaurant.
