pn0vdwO7vLa3Wgm1r5ZnhA On Monday we decided to go for an impromptu work lunch, just three of us.  I suggested dosa (my favourite South Indian food).  My co-worker suggested Anjappar and I'm so glad she did.

We were greeted warmly and shown to a table.  There were two options: Buffet or menu, we chose buffet.

The buffet was fresh and contained many items I was familiar with, as well as a few that were new to me.  We had a co-worker that doesn't eat meat, which was fine since the buffet was about 75% vegetarian.  The dosa with the potato masala was just awesome!  Spicy and crispy!  I also tried other items, like the Lentil Rasam and chili fish.  Everything was great.  Can't wait to come back, with my family this time.  Any chance you can open one of this in Newmarket or even Markham?  That would be even better!
