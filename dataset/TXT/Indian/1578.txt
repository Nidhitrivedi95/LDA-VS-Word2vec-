-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA My husband and I went there for the first time today. (9/20/12). Quite a drive from North Valley, but the food was totally worth it. Tasty, and well presented. I am a vegetarian, decided to eat the Idli-Vada combo. The sides-coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and Sambar- were beautifully presented in 3 small bowls, separately. Idlis usually dont make it on my "to-eat" dishes at any restaurant, because by evening they dry out. But these were soft and fully cooked. The Medhu Vada was done perfectly. Crispy, crunchy, and tasty. I also had samosas, and the accompanying chutneys( tamarind sweet chutney, and cilantro mint) were tasty too. My husband, found South Indian style Chicken Sukha( dry ), and enjoyed it immensely. The Egg biryani was also quite tasty. Rice was fully cooked, and they give quite a generous portion. Price wise, probably same or at par with most other Indian restaurants in the valley. Non veg dishes come at 10.95 to 11.95. and whatever I had was under 12 dollars. The staff told me that their buffet spread is extensive, and weekends they offer more variety. 

Definitely a Must try!!! We will go back again, if possible.
