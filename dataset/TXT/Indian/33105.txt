llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g i really wanted to like this place since it had such good reviews. however, we just got delivery from india palace, and both entrees (chicken tikka masala and chicken saag) arrived sans rice...seriously? garlic naan was good, but that was about it. salad arrived with *no* dressing, and with a hair on it...FML. so we paid $45 for delivery food that we had to supplement the entrees on rice, and salad we couldn't/ wouldn't eat. when we called the restaurant to ask if something had been mixed up, they confirmed that they do NOT give rice with entrees for delivery/ takeout orders--you have to order it separately from your entree...what a joke. would not try this place again.
