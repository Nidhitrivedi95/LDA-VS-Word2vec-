gotvSVEaPn_qHasAU33ejg Been here numerous times for the Indian food fix... and the owner, Raj, has always been responsive and helpful in making suggestions. We will bring our 18 month old and they are always very accommodating and helpful with the timing of his meal and surprisingly he loves it!

For Indian food in our area.. this place is it!
