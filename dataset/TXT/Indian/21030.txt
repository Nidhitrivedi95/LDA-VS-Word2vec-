GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA We made a special stop here before leaving Phoenix after seeing them on triple D.  
They had large portions at a good price. The food was delicious. 
The reason this is not a 5 is that my husband's goat karahi dish had many many bones in it. (We counted over a dozen). He actually cut the inside of his mouth on one and was bleeding. These were not large bones that would be easily eaten around. They were small, somewhat chopped pieces of bones that were dangerous to be served. They could have easily been swallowed. 
We would actually return, as we are hoping this was an anomaly.
