_nmOWqgx_KdLrj5pehDQmg Upon hearing how much our family enjoys curry dishes, my coworker urged me to try this restaurant.  I am so glad we did and we enjoyed every bite.  My son and I arrived around noon and walked through the market to the restaurant and found no one in the dining area.  I walked over to the meat counter to ask if the restaurant was open, the butcher then alerted the staff in the kitchen there were customers in the dining area.  We were quickly seated to a table of our choice.  So far so good.

The menu was worn and had several items crossed out with a marker indicating they no longer served those items.  That was okay.  There were still plenty for us to try. We ordered samosas for appetizer.  I ordered a eggplant dish (Bandanjan Eggplant) and boneless chicken handi which were both served with delicious naan.  My son ordered paneer masala which he really enjoyed.  The appetizer and main meal came out at the same time which again was ok because everything came pretty fast.  Realizing I had completely forgotten to ask the server to adjust the spice to mild, I knew I was going to be in trouble. After my first bite, I was pleasantly surprised to find the spice to be perfect - not terribly spicy and yet full of flavor. 

The only regret we have is that we weren't able to try everything on the menu!   I am definitely going to try beef nihari and mantu dumplings that everyone here has been raving about.  We will definitely be back.  We live 30 min. away but it's well worth a drive for this delicious find.
