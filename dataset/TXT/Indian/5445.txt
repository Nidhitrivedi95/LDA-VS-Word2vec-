2ZmZbmsTRHogSZR-nJY_Fw I consider myself a connoisseur of Indian food coming from two of the best places India for incredible cuisine (Goa and Kerala) this place does indeed rise to the occasion. The lounge can prove to be a visual great and may be awkwardly uncomfortable in the beginning. Take off your shoes and relax a bit and this place turns into quite the exotic resto!
