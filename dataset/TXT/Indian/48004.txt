TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Really good lunch buffet! They had all my favorites, and were careful about keeping the vegetarian stuff and meat stuff separate. The ambiance here is very nice. The only reason I am giving four and not five stars is the location. It seemed very scary, even in the middle of the afternoon. I would not come here at night, especially not by myself. It's a shame such a nice place is in such a shady neighborhood. 

I've tried a few Indian places during various trips to Vegas, and I must say this was the best food for sure. The people working here are also very nice. Overall this was a good experience and I suggest trying this restaurant.
