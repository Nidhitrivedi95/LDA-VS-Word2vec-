gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A The food was okay.   I had malai kofta and it was too sweet and kofta was hard.  The waiter asked how was the food and I told him exactly how it was.   Next time I may try different dish.  The place was busy, assuming the food must be good but that's not the case.  I guess it depends what you order.
