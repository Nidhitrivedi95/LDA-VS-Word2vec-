LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg **Update...we went back and the food was great and the floors were not sticky.  This will be our go to Indian food place!!  Also, the owner (I think) wrote me a nice email in response to my review.  He apologized for my experience and invited me to come back to the restaurant.  It is nice to have an owner who reads reviews, cares, and responds.   
This restaurant's lunch buffet certainly deserves a solid 4-star rating based on food alone.  Unfortunately, the floors were so sticky that I lost a shoe when I was waiting in line and went to take a step.  My shoe was solidly pasted to the floor.  It was embarrassing and appetite killing.  Also, the chairs at our table were so wobbly that I pinched a finger while trying to scoot in my chair...on second thought, maybe my chair was pasted to the floor too. 
I would like to visit this restaurant again since I enjoyed the food;hopefully I will be able to rate restaurant with a higher rating.
