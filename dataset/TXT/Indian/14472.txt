C3PVq7UpeHd6nz1_e-AtkA Came here for brunch with a group of people.

They accommodate groups well and the staff are attentive. The environment is nice.

The Napoleon is good. It's 2 pouched eggs on salmon, spinach, mushrooms and placed on croissant halves covered in a dill sauce. (3/5)

The French toast was plain and dry. (3/5)

The attention to detail is lacking. The pineapple garnish was a few days old. The coffee cup and saucer were chipped. The fruit juice tasted like frozen Mcain juice mix.
