We ordered veg biryani and shahi panner. Veg Biryani was more of fried rice with little Masala flavor.  Shahi panner was almost same with taste of panner butter Masala. This is not worth of $$ if you are looking for good Indian food. I am from Dallas, TX and I guess this comes as very avg restaurant in my tried n tasted restaurant list.

Apart from taste, everything was fantastic. Great interior, lighting and service. All perfection. If they change their chef, this could be good pick.

Sorry for avg review but my taste bud didn't allow to go any further.

There is addition to this. The service man(waiter) had argument over the feedback and tip. And as per him, if food is not good, that's not his problem. So then I should go to any restaurant n pay separately for food n service. With this logic, yelp should have two review section. Man....world is full of crazy people with crazy logic. :-) lol...
