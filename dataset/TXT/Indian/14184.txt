C_chktl5jFeRqu1C0rmScA My son and I dropped in for a late afternoon lunch buffet, toward the end of the lunch window-- between 2:00 and 3:00.  Despite the late start, the staff kept refreshing the buffet with more supplies and kept it tidy.  The food was really tasty -- and there was sufficient variety.  The butter chicken was the highlight -- it was suprisingly tender and NOT overcooked like we often encounter in buffets..  The staff made us feel comfortable and came by several times to check in on us and offer us dosas.  It is not a fancy place, but they make it for it with great tasting food and friendly family style service.  At times the music seemed a wee bit too loud, making it slightly hard to communicate with the waiter, but we were sitting right under one of the ceiling-hung speakers.  We will visit again when passing through this part of the city.
