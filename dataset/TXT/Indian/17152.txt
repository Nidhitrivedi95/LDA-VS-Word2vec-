The Mixed Grill was less than stellar. The reshmi chicken was dry and quite bland. The tandoori chicken was well cooked but the rub remained pasty and almost chalky. Like they cooked the chicken first then threw on the rub. The jumbo shrimp were delicious. The star of this entrée was the lamb kabob. SO GOOD! So moist and juicy. 

A craving for Rojan Josh was what made me want to try Curry Leaf. And the dish did not disappoint. The sauce was exactly like I remember having as a young kid. The lamb seemed a but overdone but the sauce made up for it. 

Tadka Dal and Aloo Gobi were both out of this freakin world. I ordered this dal thinking it would be mild so the kids could eat it. It was on the spicy side which is how I like it. The kids, not so much. But that's their loss. The cauliflower and potatoes soaked up the spices yet the cauliflower remained crunchy and the potatoes tender. This was probably my favorite dish.

Naans were both soggy which could have been because this was takeout and condensation settled in the foil which held the naan so it's not entirely fair to hold this one against them. The garlic naan was very garlicky and very yummy. BUT the plain naan, one corner was entirely raw. It made up about a quarter of the serving size so this was a real disappointment. 

Finally, the Gulab Jamun, I'd suggest making each ball larger so you get more of the soft, syrup soaked yummy center. And maybe up the honey/rose water in the syrup. It was so-so. Be warned though, with a takeout Gulab Jamun order, you don't get the ice-cream. Boo.

So there were some hits, some misses with Curry Leaf. Would I go back? Yes. But I'd steer clear of the Tandoori Mixed Grill and probably explore the vegetarian dishes more as that's where I got most flavor and authenticity.
