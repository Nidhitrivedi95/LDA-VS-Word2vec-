I'm obsessed with butter chicken, and have had it at at least 40 different locations across North America. I can say with certainty that this place has the best, and the helpings are massive. Their samosas and tandoori chicken are also quite good here. For the price, it really is hard to go wrong. 

The atmosphere is authentic as I have seen for Indian restaurants and the location is within walking distance of most major landmarks in the downtown. 

I have eaten here at least 10 times and will continue to go back every time I make it to Toronto.

During my visits I have encountered some forms of awkward service. This is the only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5. If you get the right servers, the experience here can be absolutely fantastic.
