ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw The best Indian in Vegas, and perhaps the best I've had in the US. Came here for countless work lunches (they have great specials, Dosas, etc) as well as dinners with my wife. 

Service was always exceedingly friendly - waitresses remembered us, talked us up, etc. 

It's a bit pricey, but worth it. Just really great cooking in a cool trendy ambiance that feels light years away from the tackiness and sleaze of the Vegas strip.
