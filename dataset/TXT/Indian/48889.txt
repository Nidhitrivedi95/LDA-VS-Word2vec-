tSsdTMmiwN0TjaoAYVQ1CA Was in a bind and needed to bring something quick to a potluck, so decided to give this place a try, again.  Ten veggie samosas and ten chicken samosas came up to fifteen bucks.  It wasn't bad actually, it maybe became better than the last time I was here? It's not too flour-y anymore, it's not oily, which is good, it was really stuffed, which is good, however, it doesn't have a complex spice flavour.  People seemed to like the sauces it came with.  I guess it's not too bad because it's not oily and does have a lot of filling.  However, I think it is quite expensive!
