-R2kwt0qMnzwEdAfXPvkXg Very good South Indian food. The dosa and idli sambhar are the best. Very delicious and authentic. 
3 stars and not 5 because other dishes on the menu except for South Indian not great. We ordered Chana bhatura which was average in taste and flavor. Ambience is not great as well. The interior was too hot and crowded. The tables are very close to each other. Service is average as well. In Spite of these the food makes up for it.
I recommend this place to all authentic SouthIndian food lovers.
