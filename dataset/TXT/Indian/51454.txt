UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA A wait list for an empty restaurant on a Friday night....hmm seems they wanted to keep tables free for parties larger than two. Their close proximity to the strip leaves them hopeful that others will come. But in the meantime, alienate the customers who are already here and ready to pay....very stupid practice! The place is all pretty on the inside. Cute decor and the sexiest buddha sitting in the midst. But the service was horrible. We decided to sit at the counter and watch the shenanigans. Parties of two constantly being wait listed or sent to the bar then looking around and leaving. Larger parties being sat (without a reservation mind you). Our food was brought out over spice, cold and tasteless. They made the list of worst Indian food I've ever had, and I eat plenty. All pomp and circumstance. Not the place to go if you really want to eat great Indian in Vegas. Tourist trap....
