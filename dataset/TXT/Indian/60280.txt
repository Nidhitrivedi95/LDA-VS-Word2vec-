ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA Went here for dinner with my wife while celebrating our anniversary. Couldn't have been better. The food was absolutely delicious and you get a lot of it. We ordered the dinner for 2 and still had plenty of leftovers. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants great food at a good price.
