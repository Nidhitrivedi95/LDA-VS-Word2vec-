9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g Have visited several times for lunch buffet only--rating would be higher, but for terrible service. I waited to write feedback until after several experiences, in case I just came on a bad day.  No such luck.  Although previous visits were earlier in the day with more patrons, service issues were identical. 

  Workers and owner(?) checked out--going through the motions.  Host on cell phone for about 45 minutes and wordlessly seated us on most recent visit. At 1:30, there was a tablespoon of basmati rice left, and most of the entrees were gone or picked over.  No naan ever brought to table or refreshed at buffet, no dishes cleared, no water refills.  I finally made a point of picking up a water pitcher at a waiter station and helping myself. My companion placed our dirty dishes on another table so perhaps they would be cleared eventually.  The message was neither received nor acted upon.  

We were not the last patrons to be seated, but the buffet food was never replenished,  including the sad, tiny soggy amount of mango ice cream left in the dessert tray.  Workers were having lively, at times loud and angry sounding, discussions. These discussions interfered with the competing decibel level of the Bollywood music videos on full blast on the huge flat screen TV--hard for diners to have table talk.  Pick one, please--Studio 54 or diner. 

Amber has a lot of competition in terms of like restaurants in the area--but the other Indian buffets have a more welcoming staff and give wonderful service (and food).  By the way, I forgot to ask what the discount should be for 1/3 stocked buffet items.
