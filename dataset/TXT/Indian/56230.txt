xqocOGl5Hvjc3hb1r_U4xA Roti is EXCELLENT here.  And the specials are fantastic.  Tuesday specials are $3 rotis - boneless chicken (dark meat), bone chicken (white meat), bone goat, etc. Wednesdays are $3 chicken munch - boneless chicken (dark meat) wrapped in a thin paratha.  I have been going here since it first opened.  At first, the roti was a little dry and they didn't put enough gravy in it.  I was ready to write it off, until friends told me how great it was, so I gave it another try.  So glad that I did.  Now, they have perfected their food.  The roti and paratha are consistently fabulous, never dry, nice amount of gravy and the curry chicken or goat is very tasty.  Now I come here every week for takeout special roti or chicken munch.  It is very consistent now.  

Go here for the great food and the value.  Don't go for the service or the atmosphere.  I'm glad that I don't have to drive all the way downtown for Island Foods (my other favourite) every time I have a roti craving.
