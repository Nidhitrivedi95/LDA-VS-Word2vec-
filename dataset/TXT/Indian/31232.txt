KPSaUzlYg4JLVbzrbA23uw This place has deliciously unique food! If you are a fan of fusion, you will love this place. I love their masala fries with Shahi paneer, samosa chaat, shahi paneer naan'wich was delicious as well. The dishes are enough to serve 1 person, although I end up sharing the appetizers anyways! Most of their menu is unhealthy/fast food, they do however have a Healthy-ish salad option. I love the fact that they have Gobi wings and their samosas are made fresh in house!
