ZMEax9auuGMUPqxl2D3kLA One of those roving-eye-hungry lunch stops (seriously, it could have been TGIFri or Hardees, we were so starved) that turned into super-happy-belly-land. 

Tiny, as has been said. Darkly lit, too. If you're a bit of a wide load, you're going to have trouble squeezing past chairs and tables. 

Buffet is cramped but packed - all the classics present and kept refreshed. Mostly veg, with some chicken and other meats at the left end. Malai kofta, paneer masala, daal, sambar, iddly, vada, hamburger buns (wtf), biryanis, chutneys and such, along with some sweets, on the cold bar. Veg lo mein . Free paper dosas brought to the table as you sit.

10 bucks is a little high, but worth the variety of flavor and freshness of grub. Had a sip of a mango lassi - and smiled - pureed cardamom pods made my tongue sit up in surprise. Sweeeeet.
