x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag Quite possibly the worst food I've ever eaten in my entire life. Literally. We ordered the chili beef, garlic chicken, and masala noodles. The chili beef was just spicy. It had absolutely no flavour. The garlic chicken was too sweet. And the masala noodles were the most horrific food I have probably ever eaten. They were extremely dry and there was so much "masala" powder on them that brining the fork two inches from my lips caused me to gag. If you're near Markham and Steeles and are craving Hakka food, make the drive up to 14th and eat at Fredericks!.
