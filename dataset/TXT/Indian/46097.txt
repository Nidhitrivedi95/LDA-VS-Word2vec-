SNqVyfgsfIXYvg_5VmLCqg Had a fantastic meal at The Spice Pavilion on 17 Aug 2012. Based in a New Town basement, it eschews the twee fixtures and fittings that normally scream 'Indian!' However, in the interest of balance, I should not that the waiters were dressed in slightly twee tartan waistcoats and the phraseology of the menu is a little eccentric. The only complaint I'd have of the stylish but cosy interior was that, on the muggy evening we arrived, it was uncomfortably warm. Fortunately we were seated by a window which we were able to open. The food was great, amazing flavours and all clearly freshly made. There were none of the oily bowls of indiscriminate gloop that all too many Indian restaurants churn out. A particular highlight was the 'Atishi lamb chops'; deliciously tender chucks of spiced meat that had me gnawing every last scrap off the bone. Three courses for two people, including a nice bottle of viognier for £17 (house wines start at £13), came to £63. I left trying to plan when we can go back.
