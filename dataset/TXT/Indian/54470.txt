W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg Disclaimer: I am vegetarian so i haven't tried chicken or lamb entrees. 

I have been to buffet more than 20 times, ordered for take out many times. 

I have been to all parts of india, been to some of the best restaurants in all major cities. Minerva's food taste is closest to authentic indian food compared to other restaurants in madison. 

Buffet is not that exceptional but if you order individual dishes the must try things are 
- Veg biryani
- kutthu paratha
- various south indian dishes

Food quality is incredible.


South indian entrees and few north indian entrees are very good. Not all north indian entrees are good. 

Taste of Indo chinese entrees and starters has deteriorated in last few months. 

Pros
- great food
- authentic taste, spicy
- unique menu : menu has various things that other indian restaurants do not have
- friendly staff

Cons
- limited space ( i have heard they are moving to bigger place )
- mediocre ambience
