-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA We tried Chutneys for the first time last night & I was very impressed. When we first walked in I noticed that it was very clean and the food smelled so good.  The service was very friendly and attentive. The food was presented beautifully & was delicious...so much so that my friend & I had to pause our conversation.  The rosemary naan and butter chicken were my favorites from the dishes we ordered. I will definitely be back.
