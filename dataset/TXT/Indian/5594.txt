3dG81ZT3TjPdRARfClWMkw Full disclaimer of a Groupon NOW: yep, we were lured in by a deal while pondering what to eat in the area.

To save time on conceiving of a narrative, I'll be lazy and use point form.  Yay!

Buffet quality:  3 / 5
 * Nothing special, with no true highlights and a single low-light in the form of the dry, sat-too-long tandoori chicken.  It's a buffet, however, so I'm rather forgiving.  If any of these items were served as an entree, I'd have been pretty disappointed.  Coming as it did from a warmer, "a-ok" is spot on.

Masala Coffee:  2 / 5
 * Good flavour, but the fact it wasn't properly filtered resulted in us chewing our coffee as much as sipping it.  Perhaps I'm wrong and the lack of filtration is intentional to the style... but I've never seen it done that way before or since.

Ambiance: 2 / 5
* Dining area is fine: clean, basic, comfortable, though the basement location results in a lack of natural light.  Unfortunately, the buffet itself is devoid of character and exits to the restrooms, resulting in it feeling both clinical and unsavoury at the same time.  Odd combo.

Service:  1 / 5
* Agh.  Just plain terrible.  Slow with everything, then very rude when we presented our Groupon.  Apparently, we should know to present a Groupon upon entry.  Sorry, but I use such deals to explore new places, and don't want any pre-judgement, positive or negative, to affect the experience.  Anyway, head server (manager?) left in a huff to print off our bill.  We then waited over half an hour for the bill and our masala coffees to arrive.  Spiteful much?  Don't run promotions if you don't enjoy welcoming those who make use of them.

As we were leaving, the head-server/manager/whatever engaged in a yelling match with the only other people in the restaurant: a large family out for some gathering or another.  The yelling was, unfortunately for my curiosity, not done in English.  I'll just assume they kicked the man's dog.  That'd make me angry enough to yell at a paying customer.

Overall:  8 / 20

I'll be kind and upgrade them to 10 / 20 for the generous 2 star rating.  The food wasn't bad, and the service very likely was not indicative of what one should expect at Kama.  Unfortunately, it scared us off and we won't be returning.
