xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I want to say up front that this rating is solely for the interior and exterior of the restaurant. I had lunch here today and the food was good and the staff were very nice. My problem with this place was the décor, (or lack thereof) along with the "old" and dirty smell/feel of the dining room. Furniture that needed to be replaced long ago with ripped seats that are cheaply taped over, broken tables with hand written notes on them telling the customer "DO NOT SIT HERE!", very poor lighting, and just an overall "dirty" feel.  I thought I was eating in some third world bomb shelter or something. Outside wasn't any better with overgrown weeds, dirty windows, etc. Now thinking about my experience today, I wonder how clean the kitchen is? Won't be back.
