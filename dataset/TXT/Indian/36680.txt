NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg I have been going here since it opened and it has consistently been amazing. I have never had a bad experience. The wait time is never too long and the food is always fresh. I like my food spicy and I love their hot sauce. My order varies from the BBQ chicken to the lamb meatballs. I also like their tikka masala if I want to switch things up. You receive a lot of food for your money. Great service too, everyone is always smiling and happy.
