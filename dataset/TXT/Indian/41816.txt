QbuWKli8fme4O84t99UfSg I came in for the lunch buffet and left slightly disappointed; the food wasn't cold but it wasn't hot either and they didn't have any soup out at all which would have been most welcome on a chilly, snowy afternoon. but the food that I did have was really good; spicy like others have mentioned, but i like a little heat in my food so it works out well for me. The samosas were too dense for my liking, but like I said everything else was good.

Only one other table had been occupied, leaving the atmosphere oddly quiet. Service was good until it came time for the bill. The host/waiter had cleared my table and noticed that I was putting on my coat and scarf but never brought the check over. I waited another minute or two then realized he was staring at me from behind the cash register. By this time I got the point that I was supposed to go up and get the bill so I went up and paid. No big deal, I just felt weird being stared at like that. 

In summary, the food was pleasantly spicy and tasty but luke warm. Service was attentive, but odd and the atmosphere was dark and quiet. If I'm in the mood for Indian, next time I'll give somewhere else a try.
