GdPWJo3z4ySEXpF7Wkn3FA The food is ok but they are not very skilled or particularly good waiters. Seems as tho all the workers do all the work. Nobody is designated to one spot. This made for a very messy service experience. I was approached twice by two difference people to take my order. One person asked if I wanted a water and forgot right as the other guy saw and said "ah water" then brought me the water. After putting in an order they didn't take my menu so the first guy who talked to me asked if I wanted to order again right after I did with the second guy. 

If you can stand the mediocre confusing service and the fact that you will have to tell multiple people that you want to order, already ordered, and repeat twice, then you will enjoy some decent food. It is not the best Indian food I have ate before tho, and better places exist with much better service. Also some portion sizes are quite small like the sampler plates and I left not completely full.
