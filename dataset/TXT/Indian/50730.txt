UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg I like my soccer, and as such, I like my beer as well.  And after a find day of both, I like to partake of yet another British tradition, the curry.  The usual suspects of the Indian Rice Factory (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/indian-rice-factory-toronto), Bombay Palace (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bombay-palace-toronto), and well, any place on Gerrard come to mind, but as always I'm looking for newer places to try.  Step forward my buddy who introduced me to Banjara.

The interior is brightly lit with ceiling-to-floor windows that give the place an air of a converted donut shop.  Do not be fooled.  You're ushered in promptly by staff that are as helpful as they are efficient, ensuring that any needs or concerns you have are met 

Then there's the food.  Ordering with a pack of people can be a chore, and you have to stand by your guns to ensure that you get the dishes that you want.  To be honest, I could care less what food hits the table so long as we've got Basmati rice and Naan bread dropped off at the table.  II was not disappointed.  As for the other entrees (curried chicken, Alu Gobi, etc etc and so on) every dish came out fast, fresh, hot, and tasty.  Get shot of the donut-shop exterior.  The true Indian flavour is found inside.
