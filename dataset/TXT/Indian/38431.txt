OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g We arrived to our room at SLS earlier and started yelping around for restaurants nearby and stumbled upon Urban Turban so we decided to go give it a shot as we are not the usual Indian food eaters and we wanted to try something different then our usual food choices. 

Walked in and they were very friendly from the start. Couple of the employees were new so didn't have all the answers but that's normal. We got few plates (chicken Tikka masala, world famous curry shrimp added, some other vegetable curry) and let me tell you, they were all great. 

My wife that mentioned she might not like Indian food, actually loved it. We will definitely go eat more Indian food because of this place. 

Btw, make sure you get their garlic butter naan.
