RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Long wait times as the place is so busy during the summer even with their outdoor setup (covered).

The lady apologized for the wait time as we were waiting for the food to arrive. Which I thought was very nice for a place that busy to make every customer feel at home.

Very large two storey Pakistani restaurant. Never tried their famous buffet though. Always ordered off the menu.

Food is so so fresh lots of flavor, the place smells really nice. Little too noisy but its part of the experience. The tuk tuk and the rickshaw parked out side on the busy street for snapping photos gives you that south Asian feel.

Will visit during next summer again!!!
