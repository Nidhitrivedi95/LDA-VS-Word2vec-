RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Holy cow! No pun intended, this place was absolutely amazing. I've tried quite a few Indian and Pakistani restaurants around the GTA and this place absolutely blows all of them out of the water. The vibe is pretty authentic and no frills, including plastic utensils and paper plates. But the food is so good I would be ok with eating it off the floor. We tried all the staples you'd expect at an Indian restaurant and everything was flavourful, fresh and fantastic. The chicken was moist and flavourful, the kebabs were well seasoned, the naan was fresh and fluffy., the chana and dhal both had wonderful depth of flavour.  I can't wait until my next visit.
