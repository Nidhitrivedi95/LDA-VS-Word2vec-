g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ What sets the Bloor location apart from their Mississauga location is the SERVICE!  Man who seated and served us was very kind and gentle.  Since this restaurant is newer, it's also a more dim, white table cloth, cavernous atmosphere with a lot of wood beams.

Food is more or less the same as the Burnhamthorpe location.  Except Bloor does not have a lunch buffet.  :(

I frequent the Burnhamthorpe location and 1 particular waiter there isn't the most friendliest - at least not to me.  I don't know why.  So when he serves me, I don't feel as welcomed as the other staff.

Another difference is that the Bloor location is slightly more expensive.  With certain dishes rice/naan is not included, so you end up paying a few dollars more.  However, sometimes it is worth it to enjoy your dining experience and be treated nicely, as opposed to complete indifference!
