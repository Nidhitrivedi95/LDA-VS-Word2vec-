cFzrkYqtFvae7vaZSYMdWg We had the groupon for the lunch buffet for $7 instead of $12 (the lunch buffet is 12.99 so we had to pay an extra dollar).
I see a lot of bad reviews about the service, but our waiter was great! He was very attentive although the place was full and he was the only waiter. We didn't have to ask for anything - he just kept the water and the naans coming :D
The buffet had various vegetarian options and a lot of salads so was more than enough for vegetarian and all were yummy. Also a nice selection for the deserts: rice pudding, Ras gula, and ice cream.
Food wasn't as spicy as I like, but I understand they make it to cater the north american pallet. 
I'm not a fan of buffet meals, but with the groupon, this was a great deal.
