ebhkQpSusPpPgZLU1a_HxQ We ordered 50 dosais for take out, was not cooked properly had to throw out all. Service was poor, Managers response was don't complain about the food to anyone but did not want to refund or give credit.
Terrible place, would not recommend going back!
If you do choose to go good luck with their poor service!
