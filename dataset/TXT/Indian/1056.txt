-K3kqmykKlhlB4arCsLHOw It's more like a 3.5.

Pros: good chicken tikka masala, pretty good naan, yummy samosas, spicy but not too spicy, very reasonably priced and good for takeout, friendly service

Cons: The dal curry had a strange consistency. Echoing some of the earlier comments the restaurant isn't that clean. Also not a germaphobe and have lower expectations for hole-in-the-wall/mom and pop shops, but still seemed like it wasn't clean enough.
