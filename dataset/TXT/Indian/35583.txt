MZgIUrRRF3AuTLzbSgGEIw I've been going to the North York location for years because I love the patties and they're fresher than when you buy them at the Asian supermarkets. 

I didn't realize there was a Brampton location until today, which is more convenient because I live here. However, the service here was very lacking. Mainly because of the lady at the register taking my order. She had a stuck up look when I approached to take my order. I didn't realize they don't accept debit, and that seemed to irritate her even more. I did notice an ATM machine inside the store, but nowhere did I see a sign that said debit wasn't accepted. Anyway, I just really didn't like the attitude of that employee. I almost didn't come back to place the order after heading to the car to grab my wallet and cash. There were other employees there that seemed to be more pleasant, so hopefully if I decide to come back I'll get to deal with them instead. 

Companies need to understand their employees can keep customers coming back or keep them away. In this case, I wouldn't mind getting my patties back in North York whenever I'm in that area.
