UuEfwtPMT9W9tgDmI4o7tQ Good food but a little on the pricey side. Especially for the $17 mixed grill which consists of mostly chicken. You do get a few shrimps and other meat but for the price, I expected more. The curries are fabulous. I have yet to try the mixed rice biriyani. Edit: I've tried them and it's mouth watering ! The lunch combo was a great value until they raised the prices. Glad to have this in Laveen. It's one of a kind in Laveen and I'll definitely be coming back for more.
