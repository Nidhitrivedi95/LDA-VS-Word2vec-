Ynv5JjrGbUvcVKsPd8hYZA I stopped here yesterday after reading about it in one of the local papers. I don't have the words to express how bad it was. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and Palak Paneer. All I got was a Styrofoam plate with 3 sections full of grease. There was no cheese in the paneer; it was just spinach. The chicken was shredded and there was so much oil in it that I could barely eat it. The rice was not basmati, or if it was it was the most flavorless basmati I've ever had. I had a stomach ache for the rest of the day because of the grease. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Oh, and the only person working was on his phone the whole time except when he slopped the food on my paper plate.

If I could give this place zero stars I would!
