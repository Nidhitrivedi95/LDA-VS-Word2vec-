9gJjV1uydmM6ncehYn159g I've lived a lot of places and I'm not sure I've ever had Indian food that was this good! Their lunch Buffett is massive, and also offered on the weekends. It doesn't get much better than that!
I think I've dreamt about their pander tikka masala. Really. And their garlic naan. 
Just go try it!
