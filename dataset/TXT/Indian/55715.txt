x3-d_7Bgj4sYVks1xiq8kQ If you have eaten Chinese food in India, then when you eat here you are going to have a quick flashback (guaranteed).
Though the taste is authentic I found the chicken dishes only so so .. the coating/sauce was nice but the chicken itself was not up to the mark. Anyway below is the gist..
Best dishes: veg Hakka noodles, veg Hakka rice, crispy chilli potatoes 
Authenticity: 9/10
Service: 8/10 (very helpful)
Hygiene: 8/10
Ambience:9/10
