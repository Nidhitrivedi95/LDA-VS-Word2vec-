yfHYCkQaupRzWU8FIgxUPg First visit and not impressed. The reviews seemed to suggest a different story, albeit, I only tried the buffet. The basmati rice was almost tasteless, the chicken tikka masala had very little flavor and the chicken was a tad overcooked. I tried the samosas, but again tasteless. The grilled chicken was dry too. Don't think I will be going here again.
