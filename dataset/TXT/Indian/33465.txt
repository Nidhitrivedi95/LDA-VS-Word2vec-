LpyndkMvevIQA-JHoReHNw You have GOT to be kidding me.  This place has been in a shopping strip for years.  It has no windows so I refused to try them until today in hopes of finding an Indian gem near my work...  WOW...  no.

Dark, hot, dirty and old...  and none of which in a "good" way - LOL  There are mirrors on all the walls that make it feel "trippy" inside... and again- not in a good way.

The sanitation grade was a 90, and the floor actually moves and creaks loudly as you walk on it.  There's what appears to be a storage area directly beside the entrance complete with items piled against each other.?.  If that's what they choose to showcase by the front door, then I'm afraid to ask what they might be showcasing in the kitchen where I can't see. 

The buffet was as far from the area we were seated as possible, which I thought as weird since the place wasn't full.  Again- what was the reason (that I don't know) for this?  The selection was miserable complete with mismatched hand written signs that didn't coordinate with what was in the dish.  The Riaita had some sort of round orange colored balls in it that gave it an oddly sweet taste = yuck!  We had to chase the only waiter down to get our drinks half way through our meal and then it was a canned coke?  Really?  When we walk to the register to pay, the same waiter asked how things were and then asked us to please return.  Clearly they're struggling a bit, because successful restaurants don't usually have to beg people to return... the food and ambiance should do that on it's own.

I realize there aren't a ton of Indian places to choose from, but there are certainly enough to bypass this one, which would be my recommendation to everyone.
