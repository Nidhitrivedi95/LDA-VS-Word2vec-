-YxR1MgbIe3k__YBdbLwXw The food flavors in this joint will not blow you away but for a 11$ (with taxes) non-veg Thali in downtown, it offers a pretty good deal. The butter chicken and lamb curry are good. So too are the matar paneer, chana and alu gobi. The naan literally drips oil or ghee and is a bit disgusting and the samosas or sweets are not very fresh.
