OsB_ZtFAaLDCPzvlAjHQ-w ATMOSPHERE: Dum Pukht has very nice decor in a dimly lighted setting. It has an overall classy look and a quiet atmosphere.

SERVICE: The service here isn't the fastest, but I was also with a party of eight, so I'm sure the large order contributed to this.

FOOD: I had lamb vindaloo which was surprisingly tough and dry. However, I tried another lamb dish at the table, and that meat was tender and cooked properly. The chat papri was a great appetizer, too. For dessert I had gulab jamun which was just as I'd hoped it would be based on previous experiences eating it in my home town.

VALUE: The portions are a tad small for the prices, but overall this place isn't a bad buy. A few tweaks here and there could improve this aspect.
