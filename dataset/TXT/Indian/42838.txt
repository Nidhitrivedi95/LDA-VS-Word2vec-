RcB7STNxoSDjtoK1pXgWBg The Blue Taj is not the worst Indian restaurant I've been to. The food is tasty, the ambiance is swanky. The prices are average for an Indian dinner.  The plates used are conducive to being handled by hands. The presentation is good. The portion looks small, but are larger sections. 

Cons: 
My biggest complaint to this place is the arrangement. The entrance to the place [where the hostess is] is closed off, and there is a sign for people to enter from the side door [covered by an unheated tent] This is very awkward, and can cause conflict for people leaving and entering. Another issue is due to this setup there is no buffer between people eating and the air coming in from the door. I saw a couple refuse to eat there because of this. The flavor of the chicken tika masala, wasn't very out standing. It was a sauce, but it wasn't very complex. I asked for a 4/5 spice level, so I expected there to be a kick to the dish. There was none.
