llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g Traveling through and found this lovely restaurant. The food was delicious, the portions are very generous, and the staff was gracious. 

Everything about the restaurant is exactly what I love in an Indian restaurant - amazing aromas the minute I walk in, mellow lighting, decorations with classy flair, and of course Bollywood music videos playing in the background.
