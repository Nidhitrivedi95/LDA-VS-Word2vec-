gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Incredibly delicious and well priced. It's definitely some of the best food in Vegas and certainly the best Indian cuisine. We had some new items we'd never eaten before, and we have eaten in many Indian restaurants before. Treat your taste buds to a wonderful Comfort Food experience. AMAZING!!!
