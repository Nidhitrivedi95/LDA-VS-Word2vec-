-iFvYhgysvjkxckCr42NRw I was so excited to get lunch/ snacks from their deli after reading good reviews but ...money wasted totally!  
I got lunch thali , masala dosa for meal and samosa chaat/ papri chaat & daal kachouri for snack. 
If ur eating there, it could work only if u add salt, achar / raita and chutney since the basic food was BLAND ... No flavor at all! In thali I was given Daal, chana masala & eggplant masala ... Since I had gotten the food to go, upon opening of the container( they gave all of the above curries with rice in one styrofoam container) it was all into each other... Imagine the rest. 
Masala dosa only came with coconut chutney which was DRY !!! Potato filling with absolutely no flavor ... Huge portion of dosa with only 1/4 filling of potato... Mostly wasted too...they didn't give me any pickles with this... 
Samosa chat would be the only thing I might recommend to any one ! Good portion and priced well for 3.99$. 
Papri chaat .... Horrible ... Why? Soggy like pudding ... They knew my order was to go yet they mixed everything together( rather than giving papri separately ) 
Daal kachouri was HARD to bite... Cold  and hard like a stone  .... 
I feel bad of bringing such horrible food for lunch for my husband ( leaving all the other amazing restaurants in Vegas ) anyways lesson learnt ... 
I will only recommend chaat if ur eating there ... You ll get to drink a dollar worth of chai for free!!!
