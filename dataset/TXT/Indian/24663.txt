h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Prince of India offered a pretty stellar Groupon deal. I took the plunge and am glad I did. The first time I went, I had the buffet. The only vegan options in the buffet were chana masala and dal. While not abysmal, the meal was decidedly forgettable, and I was frustrated to discover my discount was not applicable to the buffet as it meant a return trip would be necessitated.

As it turned out, the second time was definitely the charm. My girlfriend and I were thoroughly impressed by our (modified non-dairy version of) the mouth-watering veg thali with its aromatic fresh vegetables, savory legumes, flaky samosa, and crisp but tender roti. The meal left us with satisfied bellies, and when the chef emerged from the kitchen, we couldn't help but give him two big thumbs up. Wowza! This is one "prince" that ought to be king - of the Pittsburgh culinary scene, at least!
