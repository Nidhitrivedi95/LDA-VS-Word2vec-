49sbCG7F2jvqJsfG6-N8Rw Good basic Indian food. Went to the lunch buffet. No spice level at all so would be good to take first timers for a variety of Indian cuisine. Raita has too much raw onion for my taste. Biryani and chicken dishes were OK.  Next time we will order for dinner so we get a better spice range. Pakora and samosas were cold and lost their crispness on the buffet. For buffet, Taj Mahal has the better option. Will try for take out and review again
