5O7qB4gNmr3NgdYAuYbP4Q Disgusting food. No flavor. Served cold. Only thing hot was the naan. My wife and I couldn't continue eating the food. The lady the works there flat out said that's how we serve our food, would you like us to microwave it? The food taste like frozen Indian food and they serve you nasty tap water with things floating in it. Do not go here. Go to Lazeez.
