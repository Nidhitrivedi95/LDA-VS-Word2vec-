tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA My favorite!!!! I would go here for my birthday dinner. We take all our friends here. BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER! I love you chicken tiki masala. And your buffet style serving. Mango lassi, yes please. 

HUGE fan!

Great price. Fantastic service, even when super busy. Always keep my water filled. (Huge fan of that!) fresh nan bread. 

I love this place!
