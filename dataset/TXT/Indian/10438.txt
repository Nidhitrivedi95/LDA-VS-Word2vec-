9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g Absolutely amazing! I'm tempted to go so far as to call it the best Indian cuisine in GTA.

Customer service is exceptional. It does feel like a fine dining experience as advertised or rather expected.

Food is constantly delicious. We've been here over 6 times in past couple of months and never left with a bad after taste.

Appetizers: Aloo Nazakat is my 'must have'. Being avid potato lover, this sumptuous dish with spinach filling sets the course. Pudina seekh kebabs are a relish. Soft, tender and juicy to send shockwaves all over your palate.

Main course: Puran Singh da Murgh (chicken) & Gosht Marchwangan Korma (Mutton/Goat). Every.Single.Time. 

My friends & everyone I know love their Lalla Mussa Dal but for some reason I find it odd. But oh well!

Don't forget to pair above with the Pyaaz Mirch ki Roti (Bread made together with onions & green chillies).

And, the Paan Kulfi to finish the guilt trip!
