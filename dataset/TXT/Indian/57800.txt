yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw Been going here regularly for a while. Now sometimes we get it and it is watered down and isn't as spicy as it used to be; this has happened on two occasions thus far. The rice is strange sometimes too. I don't know if they changed cooks or not. The soft drinks are $3 each which is outrageous. We have also experienced the 18% tip issue mentioned on here before. $17 per person for lunch! It is a shame because it used to be so good. :-(
