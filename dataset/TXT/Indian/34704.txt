At first I was a little hesitant to try Indian food, but what better way to try it than with my Indian BF and his entourage of cousins, aunties, uncles and parents? We came here one Saturday evening for dinner and I fell in love with the setting. It's nothing like restaurants you see on the strip. It had a buffet, large lounge love seats with over stuffed pillows and an orange and gold scheme that made you feel like you were in India itself (or so I imagined).
Being with the crowd I was with, it was great because some of them were not too fond of extremely spicy food so we got a lot of mild dishes. You can just tell the staff to make it mild and they will do so. The vegetarian dishes were great. We started off with dishes like the Kurkari Bhindi- okra with brown onions and had chicken tikka for our entree.  The Naan had a great texture for scooping up all the sauce left over. I really enjoyed the dining experience and I think that I owe my love for Indian food to this restaurant.

This is a great for a first timer!!!
