Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg My cousin has nut and cashew's alergy and even after informing them about the same atleast 5 times, they still made a mistake and added cashew in it. Luckily nothing happened to him , but we literally had to run and gave him medicines before anyrging happen to him. Owner even though understood our language, never came to our table once. 25% discount doesn't solve the problem. 
(Ideally, they should have made whole order free, but   I am not going to argue for that). 

Also, they add lots of food color especially in paneer curry . Please be aware of that..!! My wife also had allergies due to that afterwards :( :(.

Giving 1 star because service wasn't too bad. Servers and Manager was not as good as thry should have been in mistake they made, but that s fine.

I dont know , if they take this seriously or not, but from now onwards, anytime I am in Vegas, this restaurant will be my last option..!!
