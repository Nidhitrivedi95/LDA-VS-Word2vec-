ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw We were in vegas for four days and ordered food to go from them twice and unfortunaltely both the times our experience was really bad. Firstly we ordered three orders of chicken makhni - the chicken was really hard and not cooked properly, the flavor was so missing, it was just like having a cream sauce in tomato puree with some chicken pieces in it.

Next night we ordered saag paneer and chicken karahi and some naans. While the saag was just about ok the chicken dish was totally pathetic. The meat was not blended at all with the rest of the stuff - i wonder how can an indian restaurant make karahi chicken without any flavor. 

The decor there is really good but you have to have the food quality to go with it and Indian food with no flavor - its a sin. I hope the owners will pay some attention to the food as well along with the decor.
