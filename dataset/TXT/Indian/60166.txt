zlF2RzJYTgZRbzFbhe3zTA The food is always good here. Who ever the chef is.. he sure knows how to cook Indian food with Lots of flavor. Usually I don't like chain restaurants, but they aren't bad at all. Try the vegetable pakora and cucumber salad as an app. Tikka chicken Masala and the lamb briyani. Yum! Oh and of course butter chicken. Customer service is good too!
