g29Wq8-qWAQok49AQO2WqQ I think Bukhara was pretty good. We ordered:

chicken tikka masala 
Plain naan 
Saffron rice

Everything tastes good and the naan was fresh! Love.

I found the service a bit dull, the server didn't check in with us often and when we paid the bill and said thank you, he just said ok and left. So awkward.
