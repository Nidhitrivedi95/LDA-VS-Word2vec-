If you're looking for good value, check out their daily specials (small-sized entree, side salad, naan, and rice).  For those with a sweet tooth (like me!), try their HUGE pieces of gulab jamun... mmmm!

One huge caveat that begs the question of the authenticity of the meals served at this restaurant-- the appearance of beef in the menu.  Holy cow!  This is the main reason I haven't gone back.  Therefore, when I'm dining in Scottsdale, I am either at Jewel of the Crown or Indian Delhi Palace on McDowell.
