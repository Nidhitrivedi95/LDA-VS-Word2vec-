TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw I've been here before and had tried to find it again to no avail. A friend and I happened to both want Indian at the same time, but having no idea where to go turned to my trusty Yelp app and it found this awesome place for me again! 

It's tucked off in a little shopping area, but well lit and easy to find. It's got a great, cozy interior with roomy booths and Indian movies playing constantly. It has a full bar also!

Checked in using my Yelp app and received a free drink called a mango lassi. I would never have known to ask for this had I not gotten this check-in offer, but I'm so glad I did. It was seriously delicious. It's mango and yogurt and it was part of the reason I couldn't eat all of my food. Highly recommend you get this fabulous drink!

For an appetizer we had vegetable samosas. They were dense and a little dry, but with the spicy cilantro sauce to put on it it tasted just fine. You get two and they're a nice size. 

For dinner my friend had chicken tikka masala, which, while not outside the box is definitely a solid choice. He liked it and proceeded to eat all of it. I had the mata paneer and it was just the right spicy (medium) with a rich tomato-y taste mixed with peas and the paneer cheese. Had it over a bed of jasmine rice and it was super filling. One of my favorite dishes.

Also ordered a side of garlic naan which was okay. It wasn't the best I've ever had, way too much garlic, but it was find and went okay with the meal. 

The service here can be spotty, I wasn't impressed with that at all, but it's not the worst I've had, so...

Anyway, great food, nice atmosphere and at a reasonable price. Definitely recommend.
