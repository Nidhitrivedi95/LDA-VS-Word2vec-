fagmJeecurJfXGAxbgMv8Q Recently I attended an Elite event at this place and I loved it. Seems I enjoyed the food and wine so much that the waiter still remembered me :-)

Ah, well, I thought to try out this place on it's own and see how it stands out without the party buzz. It did not disappoint!

We ordered the traditional South Indian dish called "DOSA" as a starter. It was a plain Dosa, served with 3 different chutney's: mint, coconut and some sort of spicy tomato sauce. 
So engulfed in conversation I misunderstood the part of the refill and ordered another Dosa by accident - still, very nice, but filling :-)

The main was a Chicken Korma with a mild creamy sauce. The chicken was tender and the sauce delicious.
The staff was very attentive and patient, especially as I do not know much about Indian food, so he had to explain a few things to me.

There is not much space in there, such it can feel very crowded or loud on occasion, if there is a big party present. However, they offer take away service and you might try their delicious food ad hoc, at home, infront of the TV or serve a wonderful meal to your friends or partners.

Normally I would give 5*, but there is no other Indian restaurant I can compare this one to at current stage, but as soon as I have visited some, I might change......

I will certainly be back!
