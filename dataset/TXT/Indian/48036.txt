TfabYPasZ1oOMN6JLa-yvw Good Indian buffet that isn't too far off the strip. 

The good:
-I had lunch and the buffet was $14, I think. 
-Buffet came with fresh naan brought to your table (as opposed to other buffets where the naan has been sitting in a pan on the steam table forever)
-Baliwood movies playing on TVs - very fun atmosphere (but not too chaotic)
-Very clean, newer looking, cool (temperature-wise), easy parking
-Several different meat options, including lamb, tandoori chicken, and a couple of other chicken in sauce options, as well as saag paneer (I have been to several buffets where there is a single meat option so this made me happy)
-Their rice pudding has almonds and some other stuff that I had not had before - very much enjoyed that!
-Good table service and attention as far as removing plates and keeping my water glass full 

The bad:
-not really anything about the food or service - but even though it is close to the strip, it isn't really walking distance (and I don't even know if I would call that a bad thing....)
