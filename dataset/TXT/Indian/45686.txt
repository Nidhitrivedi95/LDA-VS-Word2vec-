scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg We have eaten in a few Indian restaurants around the area and this particular one is the best we've had so far.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Menu is extensive but we tried the lunch buffet for $8.95 and it was a steal!  Husband said mango ice cream was excellent.  I didn't have room to try any of the desserts.  .
