Zcd2yYA5ck-38duDOg6dww I'm no expert on Indian cuisine but I had a great experience here.

Their menu includes Northern and Southern Indian cuisine, and also Indian street foods.

We had the bhel puri which was on their high tea menu. Great texture and flavourful. A little bit too spicy for me but it added a great kick of flavours.

Lotpot ki chaat - chilled yogurt snack with chickpeas, potatoes and crispy poori. We really liked this! Sweet chutney with savoury components with the spices. Lovely app covered in yogurt

We got the tiffin shiffin gattey shattey with a side of naan. This whole dish had great depth of flavours. Many spices were present, good spice level. Overall yummy dish!

The decor gives this place a hipster vibe which I really enjoyed. Reasonable price food as my friend and I were stuffed in the end and excellent service!
