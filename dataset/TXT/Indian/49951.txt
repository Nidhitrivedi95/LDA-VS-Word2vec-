u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw Oh Scarborough I love it when you remind me why I think you're the best foodie scene in the GTA! 

Dear Pili Pili,

Your cassava chips was wonderfully light and flaky to munch on. When it was drizzled with the tamarind chutney and then dipped into with the hot sauce eating it became an experience! 

Your poutine has left a lasting impression in my taste buds. The tang in the gravy and chopped beef mishkaki was a great surprise. I love how I didn't have to chew the beef several times because it was deliciously tender. The medium spice gave a kick that didn't overwhelm the taste of the gravy and the meat.

Usually i love my samosas all pastry and the stuffing is usually just meh!  But your chicken samosa....what a yummy jam packed meaty goodness. I really tasted the seasoning of the ground chicken and onions. The chicken was the star here. I really enjoyed dipping/drizzling/pouring the coconut chutney all over it since it really brought out all the flavours in the samosa!

Thanks for a great time! I will definitely call you and plan on seeing you again!
