ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw Sat at bar and had a few cocktails which were fabulous. I even tested the owner's skills by ordering an off menu cocktail which is not all that common...he knew it, made it, and it was perfect. I'm not going to say what the cocktail is called b/c it's a chore to make:) Atmosphere is pretty cool with a bar that twinkles at night (no...it wasn't too many drinks...). The business looks west so we watched a nice sunset before ordering the Gobi (cauliflower) appetizer. It was excellent. I was super hungry so I was a little disappointed in the amount. Not that I look for Pittsburgh portions, but it really was not enough for my wife + I. I wanted to order the fish + chips, but alas they were out. Disappointing big time, but it gives me an excuse to go back. Which I will. Great addition to the Mt. Lebanon/Dormont borderlands.
