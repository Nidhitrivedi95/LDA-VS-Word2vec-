llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg Introducing a six-year-old to Indian food can be challenging. We went with some pretty basic items; naan, chicken tiki masala, chicken biryani, and Lamb seekh kebab..... All done in the mildest spices we could order. It was all we could do to keep our son from eating the food hand over fist. It was a great success, and he has now listed Swad as his new favorite restaurant in the Monona area. The grownups enjoyed dinner as well, although we would have liked to have a little more spice. Didn't want to blow the little ones pants off the first time he had the food. Thank you SWAD excellent as always.
