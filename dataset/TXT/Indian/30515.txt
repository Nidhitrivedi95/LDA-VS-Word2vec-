KcxNZlw2arK3jCX3-YV9TQ I had high hopes for this place after reading reviews here and elsewhere about it, so I took my friend for her birthday. The decor is nothing fancy but it looked clean and was decent enough. We ordered chicken tikka masala and palak paneer spice level hot. The food was very good and the spice level was perfect. The rice they served did not have the aromatic smell that basmati usually has and the portion was small. The naan was good, typical stuff. They had absolutely no air circulating in the place and it was hot inside. I know I had swamp ass about 10 minutes in. No fans, not ceiling fans, nothing. A little air would've gone a long way towards our comfort, but it didn't ruin our experience. 

Here's where things got weird... On our way out, we saw a man and a little boy get out of a minivan and open up the trunk. On the floor of the car was a large aluminum foil pan, with foil over the top. He went into the restaurant with it and appeared to be heading for the kitchen, though I can't say for sure. I'm sure there is a health department violation somewhere in this story. 

For my money, I will stick to Saffron Patch in the Valley or Bombay Sitar in Canton if I want really good stuff.
