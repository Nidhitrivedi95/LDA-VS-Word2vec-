SNqVyfgsfIXYvg_5VmLCqg The place is headed very near George street in New Town.

We shared a couple of dishes and everything was great, all the stuff was also attentive.

The women who was in charge of the place(probably the owner) did a great job also, she really made us feel welcome.

My only concern is the decor, like some other places in Edinburgh its very simple decorated, clean with white walls, i think though this place could add a little more cozy touch, darker walls and soft lightning.
