vSVDFUm5D-Xab3bAfeN2Xw I went to Amaya with a Groupon to try out the place. Let me start with the atmosphere. The owner must have hired a good interior designer who helped decorate the place in a manner that's both authentic, modern and welcoming. Most Indian restaurants in Toronto look cheap and bland, but not Amaya. Bonus points for mellow Indian tunes a-la Buddha Bar.

Service was great 10/10. Our waitress was very attentive and polite.

Food was tasty, with great plate decorations, something you rarely see at Indian restaurants in Toronto. Yes, most items on the menu are priced higher than average and I'm not sure I would go back without a Groupon. However, to be fair, everything was well prepared. Palak Paneer, however, wasn't how I like it. The spinach was like fine paste, which IMHO takes away from the true taste. If you're wondering where one can try a better version of Saag, it would have to be Trimurti - my all-time favourite spot for good Saag/Palak Paneer. Garlic naan was good, but not as good as Trimurti's garlic naan, which is unbeatable.

All in all, Amaya the Indian Room is a great spot for a dinner, but I wouldn't call it the best bang for the buck. Then again, with not much competition in the area and the upscale nature of the venue with a brand name to be upheld, I can see why their items are on average $2-$4 more than at any other Indian restaurant in the city. In the end, I would recommend to go to Amaya yourself and form your own opinion about the place.
