Y6Tu9r3AaEaX41BRATQLaQ A nice restaurant but not everything is good

Me and my wife ordered chicken biriyani and vegetable biriyani. The veg biriyani is just like sweet rice. They don't know how to make biriyani. So don't order biriyani. Besides that the restaurant is clean, well maintained and cozy.
