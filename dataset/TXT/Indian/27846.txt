Ancila's is a different experience altogether. There are no dine in menus, chef comes out and talks to you about your likes and then serves food the way you like it.

All our encounters with the wonderful food being served, be it dine-in, takeout or catering have been truly satisfying.

We love her Saag Paneer, Dal Makhani, Goat Biryani and Chicken Karahi. Naan's are made to order just like everything else.

And, call ahead since it make take her a while since she seems to be running this magnificent operation all by herself!
