My boyfriend had been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally tried it last night. We ordered a few things and half the stuff we got was great and the other half was just soso (bland or strange unidentifiable flavours). That's the overall feel I get from their menu also. One thing I do like is that everything came out piping hot! 

Food does take a loooooong time, as other yelpers mentioned, and it comes one dish at a time so this is not a place for when you're in a rush. We were the only people in the restaurant most of the time but I think they prioritize take out/foodora orders. 

Near the end of our meal, a man and woman came in (total of 4 people inside the restaurant, important for later) and we think they were friends of the owner since the woman was going into the kitchen and chatting and the owner came out to chat with them as well. 

I noticed they got the same momo we ordered but we hadn't gotten ours yet and we definitely ordered before them. My boyfriend went to ask and lo and behold, the server said she had given it to the other table. 

She apologized profusely and wasn't rude at all but said she "got distracted by the crowd" and "it's a good thing you came to ask about it." I mean.... okay? I guess four is a crowd? If we didn't ask about it would we just have just sat there forever? 

When we finally got our jhol momo, it was lukewarm and felt like a sloppy microwave job :( maybe they rushed it since they mixed up the order but it was such a disappointing end to what would've been a fairly decent meal. 

Will I come back? Maybe, but probably only for take out.
