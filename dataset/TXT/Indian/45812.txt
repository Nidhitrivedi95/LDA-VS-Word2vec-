SGapZBbSgSYY3fziaskULQ Stopped in right after they opened.  Some of the booths are oddly *tiny*.  Find another one if it doesn't work out, don't sit where you're uncomfortable.  They might have fixed this, dunno.

I feel bad that they moved next door to another indian place... because India Palace is the better of the two for lunch.  The buffet is still about $10, but the buffet here seems to have about twice the variety, and it's all pretty good.  

For Indian for lunch Downtown, I'm still a fan of Sree's, but for all-you-can-eat, this is the place.
