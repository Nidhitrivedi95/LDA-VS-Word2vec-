My wife and I have eaten here three times and it has been excellent all three times.  Twice, we have eaten in and once we have taken the food to go.  I have had the tarka daal, the chicken biryani and the beef balti.  All three were full of flavor and prepared beautifully.  We particularly like the tarka daal (which is a vegetarian lentl dish, not sure if it is vegan).

I really like the rice they use in their dishes, probably too much as I usually stuff myself.  The portions are generous.  Honestly, you can pretty much guarantee that you will have enough for dinner plus lunch the next day.  Given that, the prices are more than fair.

The service is as you'd expect in a small place: friendly, professional but not over-the-top. You can tell there is a lot of pride from the family in what they do.  

I'm no expert on Pakistani cuisine, but this place is totally yummy.  If you like Indian food, this is very similar.  You will even find some of the classic dishes like biryani and tikka masala.  I'm so excited we have this place in our neighborhood.
