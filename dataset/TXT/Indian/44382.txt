I had the kale salad, eggplant tartar and the vegetable curry main. All just ok. The kale salad at $14 was underwhelming. The eggplant tartar was nice, but a one note dish, lacking in complexity and depth of flavour that I have come to love and appreciate with good Indian food. The vegetarian curry was also ok but by no means the best veg curry I've had in the city. It was however the most expensive I've ever had.

The meat eaters at the table raved about the chicken 65 appetizer and the lamb and chicken mains. They were all very impressed.

I would still try this place again as I like the vibe and feel of it and I want to love the food. However as a vegetarian, I feel underrepresented on the menu.
