BmFStvt6hs77XmYR7zmHtQ Skip the Kathi roll! I've had their thali items and they're all good, but I wanted to try something handheld. I noticed they've added a shwarma thing too. The Kathi roll was made with shwarma chicken, lettuce and wrapped in roti. But the chicken was very salty, there was way too much sauce, the roti fell apart and it was just a mess. I couldn't get through a quarter of it before I took that picture and tossed it. It was $8, I could have paid a dollar more and stuck with the reliable meat thali. With an experience like that,  I'd stay away from the shwarma as well. 

If they're listening, make it with tandoori chicken, add potato, and use some raita or chutney instead of all that mayo.
