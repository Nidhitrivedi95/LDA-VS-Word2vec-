iSRVQRoDNgf3IFuMn9r0_g Went there for the first time.
Placed the order and the food came out 50 minutes late and that too after asking for it 3 times. Throughout they kept saying it is almost ready.
The chicken Karahi was good
The nihari was not good. 

For the ambiance, level of service and quality of food, I think it was over priced

Will I go there again? Most likely NOT
