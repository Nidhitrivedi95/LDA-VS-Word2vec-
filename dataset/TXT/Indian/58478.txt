Luckily Edinburgh has curry houses a-plenty to help me get my fix, so many in fact that it's easy to get overwhelmed and just order from your closest restaurant time and time again. Well, if your closest restaurant is not Bombay Bicycle Club and you haven't yet given it a go, you must promise me you will. I spent a month this Summer in India giving in to all my curry cravings, and when my friends wanted to go for an Indian 2 days after I was back in Edinburgh, I was really nervous about whether I'd enjoy it, or whether comparisons with the Mother Land would leave me in tears. The BBC was incredible - authentic, full of traditional spices and serious about its menu.

I ordered the Marco Polo chicken from the chef's recommendations section of the menu (not a traditional curry name I know, but wait til you eat - you just won't care). It was rich, well-spiced, tangy and saucy, with beautifully marinated chicken strips which were huge. All of my friends were similarly impressed with what they ordered - so much so no-one offered anyone else a taste, being so happy and protective of their own! The restaurant itself is bright and light, and the service was fine; nothing to rave about, but the food most certainly is. It's not the cheapest curry on the block, with traditional curries being at least £9 for chicken and the chef's specials £10, but the taste and ingredients are definitely worth splashing out for.
