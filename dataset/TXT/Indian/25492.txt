hq10TdILrwtTcAESKY251Q I went here for a going away party for a coworker.

Dealing with this place is like going through a contract a lot of ammendments.

* no bill splitting
* gratuity is included with the price (so they can get away with bad service)
* only one round for appetizer and dessert
* different prices for vegetarian and non-vegetarian.
* we bring the food to you rather than you picking it yourself in the portion we choose
* we will bring the food whenever we feel like and make arbitrary choices like waiting for the full party to arrive without checking on whether the main bulk of the party is already ready anyway.

After what felt like forever which is about 30 minutes after arrival is when they started asking what we want to get.

I chose the non-vegetarian option, though they only had two dishes that are non-vegetarian and they're both chicken.  The appetizer which only had one round had some chicken dish which wasn't too bad.  The mains only had butter chicken (which is close but relatively of lower par than that of India Sweets).

In typical Indian style, most of their food had a bit of heat, but they were pretty tolerable even for myself so I did enjoy eating a few of their food.  Some of the veggie dishes were pretty good.

However, I don't normally get myself full, unless the food is bad or disagrees with me.  The food probably disagreed with me and a few of my colleagues.  It had the same feeling as a cheap Mandarin buffet which puts ingredients to make you feel full and leave ASAP.  I had to waste eating the left over dessert and I hate wasting food.

Near the end of the terrible service ordeal, the waitress says to the person who was coordinating the payments that we do not split the bills and we already tack on the gratuity as it to add insult to injury.

I only gave this a two star because some of the food made up for the minus 4 star service.  And I won't recommend this place to anyone.  How it even got those awards I can just speculate that they must've paid someone off or they knew the reviewer was arriving.
