GiDPLKtTfNHTb0koEWIz2g So after reading the reviews.,i wanted to check this place out today. Ordered pav bhaji dosa. It was good.spicy but good. Parota kurma , it was oki. Next was the twist , i tried vegetable briyanj. Sad thing rice was undercooked.  So have to send bk. Next tried poori masala. Masala was bit old i guess.it tasted funny. 
Mango lassi was good. Overall try dosa maybe . Would give it try another time.
