w1cL1J0PML_1R8U_cEK5aw This is one of my favourite Indian Restaurants in Inverness. The food is fantastic! My favourite is Chicken Tikka Masala. They do a great range of curries from mild Kormas to spicy Vindaloos. You can choose from plain rice to mushroom rice which is lovely. They do great garlic naan bread and poppadums. There is plenty of seating space and they do an all-you-can-eat buffet on a Sunday I believe. Prices are good and the staff are friendly and efficient.
