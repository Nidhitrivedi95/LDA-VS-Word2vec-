YZHOLWQ36dbDwI78pRmaTw Not the cleanest place but am here to taste the food. Ordered halwa poori and will review it later. The place was very busy and seemed a little unorganized.
They asked us to have a seat and wait for 20 minutes.
I ordered 4 halwa puris and 2 niharis.
Each halwa  poori was supposed to come with 2 poori, halwa, chana and achar. When the order arrived, the portion looked too small for the price. They had packed all the 4 halwa orders in one and the chana in another. I asked they person why the portion seemed to small, his answer "we stopped buffet". Not the answer to my question but whatever.
I asked for the achar which they were supposed to give and they handed me 1 piece of achaar. I was like what! Where are the rest of the 3? They had to consult with the owner to give me the rest of the 3 achaar pieces and the owner acted as if he was doing me a favor by giving me those 3 achaar pieces that was supposed to give me anyways as I had paid for for 4 halwa pooris and each order comes with 2 poori, halway, chaana and achaar.
Anyways, The food was just OK, nothing special and I do not think I will be returning here or recommending it to anyone.
