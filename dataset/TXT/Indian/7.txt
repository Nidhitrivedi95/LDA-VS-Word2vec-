-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Good foods, full of flavor, fair prices 3,75 stars

So prices are fair expect $10-$15 a person for plenty of food to fill a full sized man! 

Good spices are used to give you good flavors.

I ordered the Tandoori Chicken and also the garlic rice and garlic bread with a side order of gulag. Everything was really good. 

The service started off super attentive. My glass would reach half full and it would be filled again before I noticed. By the time we were winding down the service disappeared unless we waved, called and made efforts to squire attention.  

All in all good food means come here...
