HFvcnBSVPk66HUAaVKaK8A The food was five-stars, but the atmosphere was three.

We started with the samosas, which were stuffed with delicious potatoes and other veggies, and served with two delectable dipping sauces. A great appetizer before a meatier entree.

I had the lamb korma and my dining partner had the chicken tikka masala. The korma sauce was great and the lamb, while tasty for the most part, did have some unwanted gristle attached. I usually prefer chicken korma, but since it wasn't on the menu I chose the next best thing. 

The tikka masala was great as well, and I'm happy to report it was very flavorful without being sweet. I've had over-sweet tikka masala sauce before, and it's disgusting.

The basmati rice and naan were welcome additions to the overall dining experience, and we closed with a pistachio ice cream. It was nice to eat something cold and creamy after the spice and heat from the dinner, but it wasn't the best dessert I've ever eaten.

This was my first time at Saffron Patch, and I'm already excited to return.
