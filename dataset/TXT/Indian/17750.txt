E6QAh8UPRo6Tlg6hkcWCHw I have no pretensions to being an expert on Indian fare, but Bombay does what it's supposed to do: fill your belly in a reasonable fashion while remaining tasty. The naan is fluffy and delicious, and any of the chicken dishes (I've tried several), are excellent.  However, the lunch rush is pretty intense, and the staff make no bones about letting you know that they are not there to indulge in your lunch hour relaxation.  Expect to see your plates taken away and your table cleaned as a *hint* to mosey on along, partner.  Seriously, a bit awkward to have my table wiped down in mid-sentence.  Still, decent food for what it is, a tiny lunch factory in Campus Town.
