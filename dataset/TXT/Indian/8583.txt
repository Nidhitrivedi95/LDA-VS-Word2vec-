7U5-h997PyWX4B8uMk4Tcw Was having an impromptu BBQ so thought we'd check it out to get marinated meat. The selection was great. Tons of varieties for both spice and non-spice lovers. We decided to try out a couple things, including Jalapeno, Afghani, and Tandoori Chicken, along with unmarinated lamb chops and Chicken Kebabs. The kebabs were definitely my favourite! They were already half way cooked so took no time at all on the BBQ. 

The store itself was full of surprises. Other than just the butcher side, they also had ready made food and a variety of snacks, drinks, and other food items. 

The staff was helpful with making recommendations and service was really quick. 

Overall, would definitely go again for the kebabs!
