VJJ6t8DAAmq277RS5gbCdA I tried the large chicken biryani and found it very spicy. It was too spicy to eat. The flavour of the rice and chicken drumsticks were good but just way too spicy! I like spicy but not to that extreme. I wish I was told about the heat or given an option to choose mild, but my guess is that it was already pre-made that way. I wish I got the burger and fries instead for the same price. Oh well.
