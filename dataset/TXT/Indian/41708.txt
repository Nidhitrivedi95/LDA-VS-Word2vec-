q7fAiwQVfCxLM3Uvk2oslg I come here often for the iddiyupum (weekly) but that's because it's so close to where I live. They are a bit stingy when they give the coconut sambal (definitely not enough for 25 pieces of iddiyupum, but again I live close. I love vegetarian food and would definitely recommend the 5 veg curry, such great flavours when mixed and eaten altogether.
