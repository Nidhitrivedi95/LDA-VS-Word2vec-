Firstly, its owned by an Indian and they just want quantity and no quality at all. He did not allow me to order from the kids menu, as I was not under 10 yrs. Yes, he was that desperate and disgusting. Even when I told him that the big dosa is too heavy for me, he didnt budge.
Now for the food. Being from Bangalore and Udupi muself, I really know this kind of food. Its like eating a hot-dog when you go into an Italian restaurant. Chutneys cannot be stored for a buffet. Its impossible with the rate at which coconut degrades. Except the tomato one. So your not eating chutney, but just some stale mustard sauce.
The food is so lame, I dont know what to say. But the perfect recipe to fool Americans and desperate Indians. Its also too spicy for American standards and thats too bad.
Oh and avoid their frozen lassi, its nothing like a mango. India is famous for alphonso mangoes, but this is soooo horrible. Better off at buying mangoes from Costco and eating it raw.
