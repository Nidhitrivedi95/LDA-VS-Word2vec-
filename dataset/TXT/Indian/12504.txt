THE Butter Chicken Kathi Roll ($11.29) is wrapped in a paratha and thin layer of egg. the sauce is thick like tomato sauce. The spices are just right, pleasant -- sweet and tangy just the way I like it. 8 minute wait. Recommended on a cold, windy day b/c it hit the spot. Staff explain what it's in it when you order,  is great and bollywood music is at a great volume. A1 THOUSAND PERCENT!
