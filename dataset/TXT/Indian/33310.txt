llQfDCKPXBW1-hSb_qUC-g I was looking for Indian food in Phoenix for the first time (my favorite place is out of state) and was craving chicken tiki masala. The place is pretty and service was fast for naan and drinks. The buffet was small and very limited, some of the food was out which was a bummer. It also tasted like it had been sitting out for hours, but I should have expected for such a small buffet. The chicken tiki masala did not meet my expectations, I wish the chicken tasted fresher and had more flavor. The garlic naan was good.
