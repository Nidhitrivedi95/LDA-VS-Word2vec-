tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Me, my former roommates, my wife and some other friends all love this place. You can eat great flavor like a horse. The only downside is that it is closed part of the day to regroup in between lunch and dinner so if you are craving it in between those times then you have to wait till they re open. Usually like an hour or so. The people are awesome though and it is well worth the wait.
