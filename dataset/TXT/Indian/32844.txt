llKBbswD5XIb-kXFSCP9Tg My family loves Indian food. We have experience from Chicago to London and consider SWAD to be the best in the area. It compares well with the better places in Chicago. Try the lamb madras with a side of poori (puff fried bread)  and Raita (cucumber yogurt sauce). Lamb, chicken or beef shahi Korma is excellent. For vegetarians the eggplant dish Bhagwan bartha.
