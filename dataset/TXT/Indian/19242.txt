F2Sz8PJ5j1JSwFNsB4bb3w Vegetable jalfrezi was very good.  The vegetables seemed fresh.  I asked for medium spice, and it was just right.  Not too much to become overwhelming.   The only reason they're not getting 5 stars is because the garlic on the garlic naan tasted like it came out of a jar.  Otherwise, a tasty and affordable dinner.
