1iKMxBsTsPSoEzYUf1AijA I went here with a friend on her recommendation and I was blown away. The owner was very friendly and treated us like family. I had the veg thali and the portions were huge (even by Indian restaurant standards). The dishes tasted fresh and flavourful, I rated it 5 stars because we have a lot of Indian restaurants in Montreal but I feel like this one is better than others I have tried in the area and even Parc Ex. They also have some Southern Indian options like dosas which are pretty hard to find in Montreal, I will definitely be back to try them!
