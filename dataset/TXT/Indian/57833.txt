yet0Pww_ouW49T7V41ecSw The Dhaba is my go-to Indian good place, I love it!!! It is the best Indian food I've had in the valley. It's very small and I recommend making a reservation in advance to be safe. On occasion they do put out a groupon that is insane! 

Foods I recommend:
Chai tea (free refills!)
Chicken tikka masala
Paneer tikka masala
Lamb vindaloo
Garlic naan
Raita
