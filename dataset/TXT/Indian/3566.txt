0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Went here on a rainy day and didn't feel like driving super far to eat Hakka food.  So busted out my trusty Yelp app and searched for the nearest, but also delicious, Hakka food.  

And BAM this place popped up and was super happy I tried this place out.  It received great reviews and the food was delicious!  Also, was super glad we came at the right time as it started getting busy once we got our table, so I was glad I didn't have to wait.

Will definitely be coming back and hopefully this time try their chicken pakoras!
