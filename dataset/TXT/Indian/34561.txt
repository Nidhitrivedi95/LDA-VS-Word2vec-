Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg We took out Classic Goat curry last night and it was very good so we decided to have lunch buffet the following day. It was a really bad experience. There was no paneer dish, they had tofu instead of that. Other choices were baigan (eggplant), tasteless kali dal without salt, and stale idlies stinking the whole food area, somebody told about it to the owner. In non-veg only 2 main course options, very bad deserts mango custard (served as a yellow color with water and sugar) Being a buffet priced for $16, with limited choices (2 appettizer, 3 veg main course dishes, 2 non veg dishes and 2 deserts). Not at all worth it. Not coming back at all. You have to pay first before starting the food you like it or not
