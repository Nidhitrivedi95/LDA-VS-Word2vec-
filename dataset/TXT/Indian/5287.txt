2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw This my go-to place for samosas and spring rolls. They are always freshly made, hot, crispy, flaky, and delicious! At 5 for $1.00, you can't beat that deal!!! Apparently, everybody knows that because they're always busy and you could be waiting in line up to 30 minutes during peak periods. It's worth the wait!

I've also tried their pakoras, tandoori chicken, butter chicken and some of their vegetarian dishes. All are good, although I've had tastier versions of the latter two, but nowhere near the prices they offer here.

I once ordered 400 spring rolls and 150 samosas and they were able to have it ready for pickup with only a couple of hours notice. Try them!
