GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Came here on advice from an out of town friend. The restaurant is tucked in a small back strip corner-ish type area on the strip. Up until I went I thought that whole area was closed down abandoned businesses. I was pleasantly surprised. There were 7 people total inside the restaurant, my friend and I included. No buffet that night. 
We ordered I had shrimp tandoori and it was just... so so, nothing great nothing bad... just average. The spices were spicy but did have a whole lot of flavor. The garlic naan even lacked enough garlic ( I'm a garlic freak ) IDK the food wasn't bad, it was just... average  to me I guess. 
Would I go again... yes, if someone asked to specifically go there but I personally wouldnt go out of my way to go again.
