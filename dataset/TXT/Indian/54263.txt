vwVoksbTKehDP8ZGUQaVfQ Everyone raves about the butter chicken ... I honestly didn't like it. Was way to sweet and I asked them to make it spicy. I ordered take out without realizing it's a lunch room style Indian food place


Butter chicken was mediocre to say the least wasn't the worst I've had but wasn't even close to being good.

Mutter paner - this was good but is more peas then paner 

Garlic naan was good

My bill was 40$ and honestly wasn't worth it,

The price went up it's not the same prices as online menu which is what I ordered from my bill should have been 27.94$ but was 10$ more when I got to the restaurant I said fine cuz the reviews where good

For 40$ the food wasn't the greatest I won't be back. This was food for 1 

Tandoori kazana is way better cheaper and the food is always good.
