auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ After recently relocating to Las Vegas, I decided it was time to scout out a place to turn to when I'm experiencing a craving for Indian food.  I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I spend most of my dining-out experiences in Indian restaurants and this time, I wasn't too impressed.

***DISCLAIMER: I have left behind the perfect Indian restaurant where I recently moved from and I know nothing will ever compare***

We ordered Paneer Pakoras, Chicken Tikka Masala (spice level 7), and Chicken Curry (spice level 5).  The Paneer Pakoras were fresh and fluffy, but lacked flavor or spice.  The sauce for the Tikka Masala was okay, but no amount of creamyness or richness would save the dry chunks of chicken.  The spice level was pretty good, but if you like spicy Indian food, you better order something higher than a 5 because a 5 is the equivalent of mild (in my opinion).  The Curry was tender, but just okay.  Nothing much to report on that.

My biggest problem with this place is the price.  The Naan and Rice are an additional $8.50, not to mention the fact that each entree item is about $15 a piece.  Yes, you get a lot of food, but that's standard at any Indian restaurant.  The Naan is nothing exceptional, either.  Our total bill came out to $45, which is crazy!  

With as many places Las Vegas has to offer me, I won't be returning.  The staff IS nice, though!
