ECtQU_nN7OX1xnz1gujGcQ My boyfriend and I went for dinner last night. I had been to the lunch buffet and it has always been alright. However, the dinner experience was wonderful.

We both got combo meals, he the chicken curry and I the fish curry. The fish in the curry was salmon, which was a little unusual and not quite as good as other fish you could curry, but I was also made aware of that when I ordered. For the price we both left very full. The waitstaff was very helpful. When I ordered a "10" on the spicy scale, he asked if I wanted "American 10" or "Indian 10". After finding out that "American 10" = "Indian 5", I was steered toward the "Indian 7" which really was perfect for me. (In previous trips, we had both thought the food a touch mild, but knowing there was an Indian heat scale fixed that problem right off).

It was a wonderful dinner, and I can't wait for our next trip!
