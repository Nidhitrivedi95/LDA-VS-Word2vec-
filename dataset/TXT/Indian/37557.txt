OatOHmJMq8b44cdz6L2N9A The service and food are pretty good, although certain things on the menu are better than others. We really loved the samosas the most. But the most important thing that needs to be changed is the cleanliness of the tables that you are seated at. Our table cover was stained from food from previous customers, which was a big turn off right when you sit down. If the tables look like that I can only imagine the kitchen's cleanliness. I would come back if it was cleaner.
