KXl2k4LkrmnHRTTAY-TVDQ Was in a hurry and decided to go it one more try as we were there a long time ago. 

Ordered a Hot and Sour soup - the soup does not fit the Hakka criteria for us. A bit too sour for our taste and did not do anything for us. 
A Paneer Chilly was not spicy at all and had some gravy but hardly any chillies and had red dried rather than the fresh green. 
A fried rice which was ok
A Hakka Noodle, had equal amount of cabbage and noodles and were hard to distinguish between noodles and cabbage. This was the best dish amongst all
A spicy mixed vegetables was again vegetables in a gravy. 

The quantity was way less than compared to other restaurants and priced in the high end. The service was a 5/5, but the food was 2/5

Would really have to convince me to come back
