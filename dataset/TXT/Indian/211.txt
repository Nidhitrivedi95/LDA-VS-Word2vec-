-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Delicious lunch buffet with lots of vegetarian  items as well as chicken dishes.  Buffet includes chai tea and mango lassi and several dessert options.  The garlic naan was brought to our table straight out of the oven.  The server was attentive.  We definitely got our money's worth.
