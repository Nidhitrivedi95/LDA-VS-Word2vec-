OISg1vUo1jVhUWZB3gv8oQ Ordered the Chicken Korma & Tikki Masala along with an order of peshwari / garlic naan for take out. Delish!!!!! The korma was the most flavorful and aromatic I've ever had. The only reason I'm giving 4 out of 5 stars is because the rice to entree ratio was way off. We will definitely be back and look forward to trying other dishes.
