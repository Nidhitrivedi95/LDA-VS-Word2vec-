DeI4KqEeWy0cTdh7Wy5_RA Sooooo yummy! They have a great vegan menu and the people who own it are so nice. We ate dinner there and asked the guy if we could order some to go since we were moving and had no food in the house. He made us a bag full of stuff with about triple the amount of rice and lots of extra sauces (at no extra charge) along with paper plates and plastic forks which was a godsend since all our dishes were packed up. It's a small thing but I thought it was very thoughtful of them and it was a big deal to us.
