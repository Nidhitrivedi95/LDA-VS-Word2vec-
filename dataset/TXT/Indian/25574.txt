htK8VGscVVAiOGnsaZFNsQ I will say 4.5, but move it on up to 5. My buddy and I were exhausted, and just got settled next door late at night. We were also starving, so this review may be biased.

We got the banquet platter, which came with great appetizers, a sorbet palate cleanser, and a mix of chicken, lamb, and prawns. Different flavors, definitely unique than from what we we're used to in the states.

Definitely recommend this platter if you go with some friends, so that you can have a plethora of different tastes of Indian cuisine
