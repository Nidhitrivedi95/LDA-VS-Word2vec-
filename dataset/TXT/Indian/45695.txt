scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg I don't know how this place has got such a high rating.. I have tried almost every indian place in madison and this one surely is in the bottom.. Tried buffet and it was just pathetic, minimum options and so so food.. Never went back again.. There are better places like amber and swagat.. This is Over rated!!
