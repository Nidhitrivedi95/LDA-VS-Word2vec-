ERX_Dz1prKPk_qXtFhUsAA We order a home delivery. The person on phone was rude & so was the delivery man. The wasn't cooked well, except the biryani. The tandoori chicken was ok, but the butter chicken and the nan was horrible. They are located at a good location, but taste and cost is negative. Overall just 2/5.
