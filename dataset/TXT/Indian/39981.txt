pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I am writing this after receiving a response from Taj Mahal's owner regarding a previous review I posted. The review was not glowing, as I did not have a very good experience, but the owner's reply was so gracious that it became clear how much she cares about both her business and customers. I look forward to returning, and exploring more of Taj Mahal's expansive menu.
