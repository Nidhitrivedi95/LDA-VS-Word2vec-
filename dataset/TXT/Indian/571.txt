-coR5Ch6_HsUAfBWcuetKQ This sweet spot is in Riverside not Riverdale! Made my fourth visit here tonight for take out and I can conclude this joint has it going on. The portion size and quality are totally decent. For $10 I get two meats and two veggies, rice, and lovely naan. The dishes are tasty and fresh and the meat is good quality. I am so glad Siddartha moved into my hood!
