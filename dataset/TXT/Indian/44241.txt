RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Long wait times. Very poor coordination between the waiters and the receptionist. Waiting for 45 mins for 3 people and yet no signs of table. That's okay if the tables are really occupied, but it's not. We could see multiple tables empty inside, outside and the tents too. Will never go there.
