RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I am from Lahore and anybody who has been to or is from Pakistan knows that Lahori's are very passionate about their food. Hell, food is all they think/talk about. The name of this restaurant is very misleading. One thinks that he is visiting am authentic lahori restaurant but in reality is actually visiting the worst Pakistani restaurant in Toronto. For people who are looking to try the authentic Lahori food. Please do not eat here.
