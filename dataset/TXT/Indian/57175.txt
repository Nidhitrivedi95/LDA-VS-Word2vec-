The food is DELICIOUS, and the service is great.  I had the chicken vindaloo roti, which I'd recommend t anyone who can handle a bit of heat (the medium was more than spicy enough for me, and did wonders for my sinuses).

A few slight beefs though (maybe 'beefs' isn't the right word; I don't think I saw that on the menu).  Water was served in stainless steel cups, which is fine if you're serving good water.  In this case, I think it might have accentuated the minerals in the tap water.  I'd have gone for a beer instead of water (a nice pale ale is almost a necessity), but ditn't see any on the menu.  Finally, presentation was bland.  almost all of us got rotis, and they just kind of came out, sitting on lplates.  That was it.

All said, the place is great.
