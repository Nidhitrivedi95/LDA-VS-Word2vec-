3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I was lured in by the good yelp reviews, found myself in Vegas wanting some really good chicken tikka masala,  it wasn't terrible but I wasn't impressed. I like my food spicy so I ordered 7 out of 10 for the spice level.  When my food came out I was very surprised with the portion size I received a bowl of sauce and 8 of the smallest chunks of chicken, some which were dry while other pieces were mushy. The level of spiciness was perfect but the flavor of the food just wasn't there for me.  Service was great but the place was empty.  I wouldn't come back again.
