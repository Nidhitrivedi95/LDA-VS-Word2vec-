Gtw-SpnhyNa0TwNETlysyw Being an Indian . I always keep looking out for good authentic indian restaurants in the valley. It was just by chance that I stumbled upon Southern Spice and Have been in love with the food served here ever-since. If you are looking for AUTHENTIC south INDIAN food . This is the place to be. The kerala style biryani served here is just awesome. I also tried the chicken tikka  which was really good . It was very juicy and perfectly cooked in the tandoor. The garlic naan was also really good. 

The only drawback about this place is :

Service is very slow.
