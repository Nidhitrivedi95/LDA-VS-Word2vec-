1v9TVINzMod7JfSQI7Aayw I hail from Bombay and this is my go-to-place whenever I am craving some spicy chaat and other delicacies (which is quite often). I have savoured the papdi chaat and khasta kachori in the chaat section. These had the right mix of the unique ingredients and the spice level. My suggestion would to be to go for the highest spice level possible (if your palates can handle it ie!). 

The dosas are hard to miss and I have simply enjoyed having an onion rava sada dosa and still craving for more of it along with the coconut chutney which they offer. Most recently I had the vegetable biryani (highest spice again!) and it was sumptuous and completely filling.

I have also tried the Gobi Manchurian in the Indo-Chinese section which may need a little bit more spices depending on who you ask. Overall, a restaurant you must visit, especially if you wish to try different cuisines from India all under one roof.

Finally, a shoutout to the friendly staff there who always accommodate my requests for something off the menu even during busy buffet hours.
