P6JCepLy6zlq-jEsrAqkKA Went to my usual Indian restaurant, Queen and Duncan.  It was hot outside and the A/C was not working.  Too hot to stay and enjoy.  So looked for another one.  Found India Palace.  First A/C working, clean and really nice food.  Best part was rice pudding.  Best I have ever had.  Not too sweet, really rich. Servers were really nice, brought me plenty of water without having to ask  I will be going there from now on.
