LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I've been going to guru lukshmi since they had their stall in the Newin centre way back when (I wasn't even in High School yet!). 

The food has always been consistently fantastic. Their sambhar is always rich and flavourful, the chutnies perfect and the dosas just divine. 

The restaurant can get packed so make sure you make a reservation or avoid going at peak hours. 

My recommendation: Start with baby idlis in sambhar or rasam vada, then go for the mysore masala or coriander dosa (the latter if you can't tolerate spiciness) and then end off the meal with a traditional south indian filter coffee.
