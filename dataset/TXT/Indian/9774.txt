They have a self serve wine/beer machine which the owner or manager named Chris was kind enough to show us and let us test out. We ordered rebel curry with chicken and Rogan Josh with lamb. Both were so tasteful and very well made. Probably the best curry I've ever had. The organic samosa was a little burnt on the inside but still flavorful. For desert I recommend the Gulab jamun it reminded me eating pancakes with sweet syrup. I will definitely be back with my family and friends!
