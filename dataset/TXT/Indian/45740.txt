scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg I've had two dining experiences here.  My curry dish at both times have been very good.  Please note I don't eat very spicy so the flavors have been great for those of us  who like mild spice levels.  My dinner guest at my last visit got medium spice level and was satisfied with her choice too.

Service is very attentive.  Quick on refills and generous pours on wine.  Our server was happy to give suggestions and to explain menu items.  There is a small discount on cash payments so try to remember to hit an ATM before arriving.  

I've not made a buffet here but I hope to cue k it out in the near future.
