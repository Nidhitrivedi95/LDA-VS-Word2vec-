XGMI18dOgrOo_r7Wz54Xnw My wife and I ate here twice in the 5 days we spent visiting Edinburgh on our honeymoon, and that in itself should tell you it's damn good. This place won't knock your socks off, but the prices are reasonable, the service is professional, and the food is solid. Oh, and there's one other thing...

The NAAN.

If you're at all a fan of this Indian bread, then you need to go to Himalaya. The price is pretty much the same as any other Indian restaurant, but the size is anything but. The naan portion you'll get with a single order is absolutely enormous. Easily enough for four people, or two really stupid Americans who may be gluttons for punishment.

Even if you're not a big naan eater, you'll still enjoy it here. The portions are good-sized, too, and the food comes out rather quickly. Give it a shot.
