DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg This was my third visit and it wasn't as impressive as the first time. Tonight (Saturday), there was only one server attending to a restaurant filled with customers. The term Udupi symbolizes authentic South Indian food. I ordered Masala Dosa and it was far from from its origin, and the iddli  was hard! Lassi on the other hand was the only thing I liked. The poor server was so busy running around that she even forgot our bill, and then when we waited for her at the counter, she calculated our total incorrectly! This dramatic change in their service is explained by change in management. No wonder! Anyways, I'm not sure if I'll be coming back.
