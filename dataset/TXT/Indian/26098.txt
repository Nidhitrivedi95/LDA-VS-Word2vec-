Iadni8K9IgCJe2yB3fpgTw I love their location on Bloor and assumed this place would be no different. We rolled up on Sunday for lunch not realizing this place does buffet on weekends. We were a little hesitant about having the buffet as we all seemed to want something specific but ended up going for it as we were all going to die if we didn't eat soon.

The selection was the usual Indian buffet spread but way less hearty. The meat dishes were so sparse and seemed to have only a few chunks of the good stuff (meat) swimming about, and the flavours were so mild, as though things had been watered down. At least now we know for next time.

The place was practically empty but service was really attentive. Other than that, not much else to report.
