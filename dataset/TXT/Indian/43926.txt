RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w I have been going here for a few years and am always satisfied. Their naan is always fresh, and the butter chicken is to die for. The only thing that has changed recently is they no longer make their mango lassi to order. They make it in massive batches and put ice to keep it cool but this waters it down and it isn't so good anymore. The service is usually good depends on who you get for a waiter. They are attentive and polite. The bathrooms were surprisingly well maintained (womens bathroom) which was kind of a shock seeing as how many people were in the restaurant. 
Its a very casual place they serve the food on paper plates and use plastic utensils but the food is better than any food I have had in a fine dining restaurant thats for sure
