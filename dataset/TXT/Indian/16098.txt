DBxS04vNEd42NquQcAIMXA I would like to say it's one of the worst restaurant I have eaten or been in, should close, the service is just flat out bad, the atmosphere is joke, pool tables, stage in the dinning room showing really bad music videos, the India food at Target is better out of a box,the people that posted 5 stars either work there or are friends with the staff, I'm pretty sure you can not make someone leave a tip or the restaurant will charge you 15%, that shows you how bad service is..... Stay away
