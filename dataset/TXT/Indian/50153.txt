uaFhlzoJbiqlnkUgfSjpdA Today's vegetarian buffet was very bad. Mirchi bhaji, veg noodles and Naan were good. The paneer butter Masala had very hard paneer. There were two desserts special Bengali sweet and sheera which were soo bland. The one star I am giving for this restaurant is for the service offered by the waiter.
I have been to this same restaurant few months back. The food was good few months back.
