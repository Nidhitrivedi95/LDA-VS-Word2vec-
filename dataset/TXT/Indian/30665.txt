KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA I've been coming here for the dosas for a few years - tastes great. Came in today and saw the menu changed. Also saw new staff members - the girl working was extremely slow, had to wave them down to get my order taken, after that we felt like she was very fake and insincere in the way she talked. Was annoying. Also seemed like they were training a new guy so more emphasis was on training him than getting her job done. Anyways we Ordered the Punjabi Chaheel drink which tasted just like a glass of milk with rose syrup so it was way overpriced for what you get. Dosa was good though as usual. 
Also every time I come here they have horribly LOUD music with the bass up very high. It is extremely frustrating having to talk loudly to hear the guests your eating with and the bass just gives us a headache. It's happened Every single time I've eaten here and once it was so bad that I literally had to ask to turn it down. 
Lastly, their decor is very dark and strange. 

Anyways, I mainly come for the dosas which I recommend but the standard of this restaurant is sadly dwindling.
