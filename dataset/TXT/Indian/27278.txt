Ijh1AcbH-F3CyhYT_5qL8Q Went here for lunch here on a weekday, ordered Saag Paneer & Eggplant Bharta both are really good. 7.95$ each was lunch special deal. Portion serves 1 person. Quite filling though. Garlic Naan was good too. Curries are rich and flavourful. Friendly service and clean restaurant. Would definitely recommend this restaurant.
