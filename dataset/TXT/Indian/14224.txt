c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A Makkah is still the one with the best tandoori chicken in my book.

As soon as you stop in front of the restaurant, you can see hard working men grilling their mouth-watering tandoori chicken and baking the naan.

Be prepare to get in line to order your food.  This place can be quite busy with take-out goers.  It is a cafeteria style.  Order what you want at the counter, find your seating at the back, carefully listen for your order and check at the counter often.  Then pay before you leave.  

The service is great, friendly and helpful.

I go there for a good home-style and authentic cooking meal.  Everything is consistently delicious.  Superbly seasoned.  Generous size.

Of course, my absolute favorite is the char grilled tandoori chicken.  Each dark-meat piece is always juicy, flavorful and tender.  The tamarind-like dipping sauce was tangy with slight tartness, which gave it a wonderful contrast to the perfectly grilled chicken.

Rock on, Makkah, rock on!
