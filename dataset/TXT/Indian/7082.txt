4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q Great indian food with a large selection. Everything is tasty. My favourite is the butter chicken and the lamb  curry, amazing taste. My hat off to the chef. Desserts are equally good which includes sweets, fruits, ice cream, cakes etc. This is the best dine in buffet indian restaurant in Mississauga.
