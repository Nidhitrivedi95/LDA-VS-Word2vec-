jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw I was so excited to find a Indian restaurant in the neighborhood. Went in and was greeted by a sweet girl. I wanted to try the Tandoori chicken so I opted to get it ala cart instead of the meal. (5.00) and ordered a side of Baba Ganoush. She said that it would take about 10 to 15 minutes. After 15 minutes the order was still not ready. I was one of two people in the restaurant. The other person that was their asked about his order as well and she said that we ordered the same thing and it takes a little longer as it is made to order - so I decided to order a chi tea and wait it out. 40 minutes and finally got my order. What a waste of money. The baba ganoush was extremely bitter and chunky. No spice to it at all. The piece had maybe a 2 bites that were edible.
