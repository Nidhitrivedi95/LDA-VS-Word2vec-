Gj3EI0cqh1ZpC86sDHtf7w Literally the worst restaurant experience of my entire life. The food was really quite fantastic and I won't disregard that at all. But quite honestly, the whole experience started out awfully as my party of seven would end up having four different servers. The first server offered us an appetizer that we didn't see on the menu that we would actually be charged for without being told. Then the next server would literally throw our food on the table as he barely told us what each meal was. 

Due to the fact of the second server's unwillingness to serve us, we had to reach out to another waiter to help us out who would end up helping us fix everyone's wrong orders. Throughout all of this, we found out that the fourth person was overcharging us. Throughout all of this, the four servers were not communicating with one another. We would end up having to reach a compromise between ourselves and the manager. The customer service was awful and once they saw us trying to sort through the bill that was not properly broken down, the manager came over and laughed at us. 

We found him trying to charge us for food we did not order at all. I would suggest not ever going to this restaurant due to the aforementioned problems. I want to suggest that you not even begin to think to eat there. 

It took us thirty minutes to reach a compromise after we were laughed at by the manager for noticing that he's overcharging us.
