gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I know my Indian food. I grew up eating it and this is a pretty good place when you can't have home cooking. The staff was really friendly. I had the Biriyani, with chicken. It was so good. One of my friends, who had never had Indian food, tried the vindaloo and loved it. The location is a little sketch but a lot of Vegas can be like that lol. Prices about expected for Indian food. Also, they don't play when it comes to spicy... You've been warned! If you're craving Indian I say check it out.
