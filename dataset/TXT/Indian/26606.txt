We ate at Cooper on Memorial Day so it wasn't very busy.  We received excellent service and left very satisfied.  The spinach soup was too watery for my taste, but my son ate two bowls!  Wow!  Anyway, the chicken in both our entrees was a little dry (I noticed others have mentioned this also), but the flavors were spot on and made up for the issue with the chicken.  I have been craving Indian food ever since!
