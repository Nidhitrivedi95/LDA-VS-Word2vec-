iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA BEST INDIAN FOOD IN PHOENIX!

The food deserves five stars as does the service!
They have a great selection of gluten free and vegetarian options.

My personal favorite is the chicken tandoori with a side of yogurt sauce. If you're looking for the perfect way to end your meal; the mango Lassi is a delicious dessert to indulge in!

Why only 4 stars?
You get what you pay for rings true. This place is very pricy, but
If I could eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life, this would be it. 

Sadly, spending $30 for just one persons meal is a jaw dropper. Thus, I have given this place 4 starts for being overpriced and having rice be an additional side order. 

HOWEVER, they have reasonably priced and a creative lunch menu that makes up for the very expensive dinner menu..
If only they could add the chicken tandoori to the lunch menu, I would be there everyday.
