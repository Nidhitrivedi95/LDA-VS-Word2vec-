CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA We have always ordered takeout so can't speak about service. Food is consistently good. Chicken tikka masala is spicy and flavorful with nice white chicken breast chunks. Samosas are delicious as is everything else we've ordered but can't remember names. Sorry. Very good place for reliable tasty Indian food. Some day we'll dine in.
