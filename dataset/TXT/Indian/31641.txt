Place: Small and busy.
Service: Good
Food-Karahi (Chicken. Goat needs 24 hour notice):  3.0/5.0
Food-Seekh Kabab: 4.5/5.0
Naan:5.0/5.0
Chiken Tikka Pieces: 4.0/5.0
Raita: 1.0/5.0 (Silver Spoon has better raita)
Salad: 2.0/5.0 (very small quantity considering we ordered 5 dishes + Nans)

Overall, good to have one more choice.
