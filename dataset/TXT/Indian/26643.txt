iDCAMAg7XPBx2g-82AIsgg The food here is amazing. I will start off by saying that. :)

The service is OK but Mr. Butt can be forgetful at times lol. On several occasions I have ordered sides or dishes and he forgot to put them in my take-out bag. I actually called on one occasion to remind him that he had forgotten my naan and samosas. I walked back for it and when I got home I realized that he'd only given me my naan and he forgot my samosas again lol. A lost cause at that point... but the dishes I did have were amazing and I'm never disappointed when I try something new.

I wish they would cook with less fat though.. there tends to be a half inch of oil floating on top of the food before he scoops it out. I guess that goes with the nature of take-out but his food is so tasty it doesn't need all that fat. 

His desserts are pretty good too :) he's very patient and nice.. but forgetful lol just make sure all your items are in your bag before you leave ahah..

Definitely recommend for something a little different.
