1Vbt1GsmtQm2dkC4A2L_-g I just had my first Subba experience today as takeout, and I have to say, I'm impressed! Cheap and delicious. I got the Nepali chicken and veggie momo. The nepali dishes come with a gravy-style main (think indian curries), some amazing dal, and some veggies in a dry sauce. All of it was delicious! The guy asked me if I wanted it spicy or medium and I said somewhere in between. Be warned, they are generous on the heat. Maybe not for you if that's not your thing. But I happen to love it, so I was very pleased! The sauce for the momo set my mouth on fire, but it was delicious. The momo had a thick, chewy consistency to the dough, which is something I really love in a dumpling. The filling was moist and beautifully spiced. And I could eat a gallon bucket of that dal. The chicken appeared to be boneless thigh pieces, and the flavor was excellent. It was quite a bit of food and definitely made a pretty big lunch and dinner for me. At $15 for two full meals, I'm very pleased.
All in all, this place is great. I can see how the service might be slower sometimes due to a very small staff, but it appears to be a small, family-owned place and everything else about it makes any potential wait worth it. I'd rather have a bit of a wait than see the prices go up if they hired more staff, but I'd love to see an awesome place like this grow and be successful in the area!
