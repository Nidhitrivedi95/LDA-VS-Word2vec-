LhfKAGpQ12pgvQRqg-2wmw I was recently turned on to Salem's as I work on the other end of the Strip District and I really dig it - great fresh food (reasonable $$) and the staff is awesome. Their butcher shop is superb too - you can get really nice beef, goat and lamb there. They have the more interesting cuts - hangar, skirt, shank, and super fresh liver, kidney and heart (my fave!).  Great burger, kofta, shawarma and a killer goat curry.  Easy parking too - they are far enough off the main part of the strip away from the hoi polloi.
