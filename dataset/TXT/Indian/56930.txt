xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw OMG!!!  Okay, so the woman who took our order was far from friendly, but that really didn't matter because the food was outstanding!  My son got the Beef Vegetable Stew, and it was amazing.  I got the green chili fry bread which was perfectly flavorful, and delicious.  We can't wait to go there again!  Yeah, not the cleanest, but you can get your food to go, and it wasn't the dirtiest, either, but we made it a point not to look around.
