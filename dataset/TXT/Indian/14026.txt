BXeXS9EaNN03AptFwElvjA I go to the Delhi Cafe about once a week - I can't resist! I love everything about it (apart from the toilet facilities). 

The food is cheap and delicious. The curry is very flavourful, the naan bread just the right amount of garlicky, the rice is lovely and a refreshing little side of fresh salad and couscous comes on your plate. Portions are the perfect size, enough to not make you feel like you'd want more, but not so much that it's a struggle.  Yummy, comforting food that doesn't leave you feeling over-stuffed.

The staff are lovely as well, very efficient and up for a wee chat. 

What more could you want? Love it! (I'd give it 5 stars if they gave the toilet a bit of a re-furb.)
