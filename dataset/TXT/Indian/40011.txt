pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw Went for dinner for the second time tonight. The first time was because Tamarind is not open on Mondays. Anyway, I had the Goat Vindaloo and Mango Lassi. I ordered the Goat Vindaloo -medium spicy and it was perfect for me meaning, there's a nice kick but my taste buds are still in tack when I leave the place. The Mango Lassi which is a yogurt/milk mixture flavored with mango... I really enjoyed it because it wasn't thick like a milk shake. This time, I decided to get the buffet instead of ordering from the menu... look at me, venturing out... hahah. The buffet was availale the first time as well but I hesitated because of a lunch experience I had at Tamarind. There lunch buffet wasn't very good and I was afraid that was the case here as well. I looked around and it looked like a lot of people were actually going to the buffet so I decided to go for it. The buffet was $12.99 - not bad at all considering, most dinner entrees are at least that much. You get naan, samosas, a number of vegetarian dishes and about 8 meat dishes from fish to chicken to goat. It was pretty good. We got there around 530 both times on a Monday and didn't have to wait but it started getting pretty crowded after 630. The servers were nice and polite, filled our water and cleared our plates promptly. I'm a fan and would definitely come back.
