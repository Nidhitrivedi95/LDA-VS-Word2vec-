GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw I've been frequenting this establishment over the past 2 years, and they seem to have changed ownership. What once was a legit spot to get some Indian food, has definitely gone to diarrhea status. 

Walk in, no one greets us. Ok, I'll let it slide (even though the place is almost empty.) Go to use the restroom, and I see one of the cooks finishing his business and proceeds to walk out of the bathroom without washing his hands. Maybe he washed up in the kitchen I hope? I chose to be optimistic, but definitely not a great impression. Bring on the E. coli and Hep, baby. And slather it up with some naan and Tika Masala. 

Fast forward to the lunch buffet, which is decent, but nothing special. Server never comes by, so I walk over and ask him for a drink. Again, the place is dead. 

The one nice thing about this place was that it was quiet, despite being in the vicinity of a convention. But I don't think I will be coming back anymore.
