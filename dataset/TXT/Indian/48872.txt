tRSUE3l8T2ptsj4LMk8Ysw I visited this place on a Sunday evening for a private event with selected buffet dishes. The staff was very courteous and the place was quite clean, although I didn't visit the washroom. The atmosphere doesn't involve a crazy theme but it looked descent and not overwhelming. It can accommodate a good number of people as long as most of them are sitting down. I'm quite picky and not very adventurous so I stuck with certain dishes. I have a certain tolerance for spice, but the food was within acceptable range. I think it's all a matter of taste for each individual but I found it to be pretty good. The naan was  fresh. I also tried the tandoori chicken and butter chicken with a cold Coke to wash it down. I think that the chicken biryani varies from other places but I liked it. I was full after two plates and most importantly I didn't experience any repercussions. The coffee we had later ordered at my table took a long time to arrive but it tasted good. The bench type seats near the windows with a straight back gave me a bit of a back pain, but I was there for about 3 hours for an event and so I doubt anyone would normally stay there for that long. It was a hot day in July and I also began to feel the heat in the last hour that I was there. All in all I think it's worth a try since I enjoyed it.
