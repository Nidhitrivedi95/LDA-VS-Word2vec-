h1fOnj8ofEmKM7U9JdCcGw Is it the best Indian food I've ever had? No. Does it get the job done? Absolutely!

My BF and I go here regularly.  I always get chicken makhni with garlic naan and he will get vindaloo, mango curry or tikka masala.  Most of the time it's really good and fulfills the craving.  Service is also good.
