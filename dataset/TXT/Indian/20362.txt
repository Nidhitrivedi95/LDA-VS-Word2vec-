FrMqrN-jIvc1abEBqn4HaA My family and I found this place yesterday while going to the bank. So we decided to check them out. It was our first time trying Indian food. We tried a little bit of everything that was recommended. The food was amazing. Service was fast and friendly. We will definitely come back and try some more items off the menu.
