2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Embassy Restaurant is the reason why I am spoiled for Samosa's. Years of living in Scarborough and buying 5 Samosa's makes me go "WTF!!?!" when I go into other places and see Samosa's for a dollar per and over. Even more so than the fact that they are so cheap, the samosa's are really really good.  They have a nice size, they are usually really fresh. They are the right texture on the outside, slightly flaky, not too oily. They stuffing isn't over spiced, or bland.

They sweets they have are decent too. They have all of my favorites, Ras Malai, Gulab Jamun, Basan ki Baarfi (sp?). I don't eat their food very often. Usually it's just samosa's to go. People come in here and order like 200 of them. I know, I've seen it.
