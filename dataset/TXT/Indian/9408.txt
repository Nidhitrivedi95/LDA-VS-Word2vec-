8mKV3KThn3wXGL3OVxrCNg Really good Indian, especially enjoyed the chicken tiki marsala and the naan. The yellow dal was a little runny for my personal taste, but still very flavorful. Generally good service (I have a toddler, and they were VERY supportive and attentive to what we needed), although a couple missteps. All in all, we're headed back again!
