UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA when in Vegas if u want Indian food only place to eat is this ..,...Best Indian food in town.....tried their lunch buffet surprisingly it's very good.....just that the chicken curry(Andhra curry) as stated in buffet tasted more of Goan style otherwise impressive menu. Great service and clean place.....
