LZWXP-D4YPlzsFjVx6b9XA First visit on a Wednesday evening and should have known the results when we were the only ones in the restaurant.  Weren't welcomed before being seated which I can overlook.  Overall felt uncomfortable being there and then service was lackluster.  Food was decent.  Willing to give it another try for the weekend buffet.
