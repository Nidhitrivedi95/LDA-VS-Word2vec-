Good Indian food - the gravy/curry dishes and breads are good. The thali has large portions for a single person, but quality suffers. I would avoid the thali. 

Service is terrible, but that's the case with most Indian restaurants I find. There's this one short waiter who is polite and cheerful, you're lucky if he's serving you.

The ambiance is good, the far end has a statue of an Indian deity with waterfall effects which is artistically done and is the focal point of the room, and the music is soothing Indian instrumental.
