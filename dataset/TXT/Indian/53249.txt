VdlPZg2NAu8t8GkdbPLecg First time going to Tandoori Times! I had a great time catching up with friends but the service was pretty slow, not a lot of staff and the food was spicy. I asked my waiter how spicy the dish I was going to get was and he said mild but when I tried it, it did not taste like mild. Luckily he gave me another dish that wasn't too spicy and didn't charge me for two dishes. However, my friends and I were tricked into buying naan bread! The waiter asked if we wanted some and he didn't mention that we had to pay for it, we assumed it was a free dish that you get before your meal! Overall it was not bad, they had belly dancing when we were there and it was very cool!
