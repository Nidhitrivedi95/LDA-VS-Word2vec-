You have to pay extra for sides like french fries though as the included choices are chips, croutons or celery.  I am a big fan of the beef tartar with the spicy sauce which has a nice kick to it.   I like to pay extra and get french fries  as they are really good here and come with a tasty mayo for dipping.
