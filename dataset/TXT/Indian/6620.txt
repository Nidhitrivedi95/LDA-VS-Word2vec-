483pQIBo1rxjZqms1s6V2Q Me and my friends are traveling in Edinburgh and wanted some good Indian food, and this was very close to us. I ordered the #33. Chicken Tiki Masala and it really hit the spot. Great portion size and delicious! The employees were all very kind and helpful as well. In terms of ambiance and environment, we were the only ones in the restaurant and it was quite, but it was a late Sunday night when we ate, so I can't fault them for that. All in all, if you are looking to eat some great food, I would recommend!
