xA6L2w_TlbxHubb1xeBE8w I love the intricate spices and heat of the food. Most restaurants here dumb down for the Pittsburgh palate..

The women's bathroom doesn't lock, out of towels and the restaurant floor looks to be never cleaned. Buffet was sloppy looking and dark entry and dark interior only looks like they are hiding dirt..


I have enjoyed the food.

There are too many family types with children eating here. Children here tend to be fussy and annoying . Parents do not monitor their spawn.,they are unruly and noisy
