De8Z9rLZOmf-icp3gDxCZA I went here with family to celebrate my mother's birthday.  As the only non-vegetarian in the group, I think I was the only one truly satisfied with my meal.  I had their signature mutton dish, which was incredibly tender and flavorful and almost worth the trip for it alone.  However the vegetarians in my midst were grumbling about their bland sambols, and borderline spoiled daal.  They were asking why we didn't go to Karaikudi instead.  Nonetheless, the overall experience was satisfactory and I would go there just for the mutton dish.  It was sublime.
