YoEISHuKbCiq4HgykG9fIA Came here with coworkers for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. They feature a special lunch menu that is not featured in detail on their website (Photos of menu provided), which has a wide array of entrees that come with a soup, vegetable pakora, puvlav rice, naan bread, and a dessert of the day. This combo is $8.99 +tax, a great price for what you get. 

The Channa Masala entree was very flavourful. From first glance the portion looks small, but I assure you that your hunger will be satisfied. I asked for the medium spice level and it gave a good kicker, so choose your spice level wisely. The chickpeas were not too firm and not too mushy, the way channa masala is meant to be. I mentioned to the waiter that I was vegan, and when the chef (yes, chef, not the waiter) came to deliver the entrees, he put an individual bowl of rice on my plate because the puvlav rice contained butter. Even though I didn't ask about the rice, they took the initiative to make this change which I very much appreciate. 

The water is served out of a copper ewer and copper cups. It may look like drinking out of the cup will give you tetanus, but rest assured you're A-Okay. Drinking out of copper vessels have been proven to have many health benefits (go look it up!), so don't be alarmed. 

The only thing I'd say can be improved is the service. They should definitely hire more staff during the lunch rush hour. It was hard for us to get hold of our waiter when we wanted to pay our bill, so we ended up walking to the counter to pay. 

Overall, a satisfying experience with tasty food at a great price despite the lack of staff available. Would recommend if you're looking for some authentic Indian cuisine.
