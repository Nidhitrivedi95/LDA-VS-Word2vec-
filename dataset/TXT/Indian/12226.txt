auTNigMttjBBTj1MNxOeFQ My husband and I stopped here for lunch and it was fantastic. We are normally a little skeptical of buffets but the food was all very fresh and hot. Plus there was a lot of selection. The place has a nice decor and a nice smell aside from the food. There was an underlying spicy incense smell. The price was just a little higher than the standard lunch buffet but it was definitely worth it due to higher quality. The service was good, our water glasses were never empty and the server checked on us repeatedly to make sure everything was to our liking. I would definitely recommend.
