LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg Great lunch buffet. Easy and casual restaurant to try indian food. I'm not a big fan of indian food and always feel its a bit heavy to get a full sit down meal. For those who want to try a bit of different things - this place is a great spot! Food is surprisingly good and tasty with a wide selection for u to enjoy. Comfortable seating area with polite staff. Highly recommend!
