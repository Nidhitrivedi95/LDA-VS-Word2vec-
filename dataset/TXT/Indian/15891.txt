daI7_EpE3ZrkEZEt2qdTBQ If you are looking for a hidden gem, this is it! Good food and good prices. I had the Veg Thani Special (for dinner) and it was great! Perfectly spicy, and tons of food. For those "spicy challenged" people, you may want to check how spicy your dish is before you order. 

Location is tucked back next to the Pieology, which is a blessing and a shame. The staff seem really nice too!

Critiques: Inside is dim and could use some up-keep.
