Torrance and I had the lunch buffet. $10 for this??? And you get fresh, hot garlic naan? It seemed too good to be true. Why did we wait so long before coming here? The staff was friendly and attentive, more than any other buffet that I have been to. I advised one of the staff of my husband's tree nut allergy and he walked us to the buffet and pointed out every item that he should stay away from. Tikka Masala has cashews! 
Every item that I had was delicious. I want to go back again... very soon!
