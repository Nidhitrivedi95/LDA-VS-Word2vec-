7IF5cjvH1d97pzvYPnf9Mg Savera was a delightful discovery on St. Clair: great food, fantastic Indian taste and friendly service.

We ordered a variety of dishes (rice along with 2 types of curry dishes) along with the meat-stuffed naan bread which was fantastic. The flavor of the dishes was perfect which I should have known from the delicious aroma when we walked in.

Will definitely return. Go St. Clair!!!
