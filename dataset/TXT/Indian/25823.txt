hzumXofKoqICLsHETI1LAA This is by far my favorite restaurant to visit for Indian cuisine. The atmosphere is relaxing, the ambient music is lovely and the lighting is perfect. The first time we came here, my girlfriend and I were greeted personally by the owner who did an excellent job selling us on what was at the time a brand new establishment. We've since been back a handful of times and most recently were treated to a complimentary dessert by our waiter Madhu. The entire staff is very friendly and attentive. This is where I refer whenever my friends ask for authentic Indian cuisine.
