Pzs43Fkub-6A9hA1zqpF_w Madison Wisconsin is not a place one would figure for great Indian food, but there are some serious gems here! I love this place, after a day of shopping or a cheap movie, we often found ourselves here for dinner. The service is great, they put our napkins on our laps and brought us the warm towel after dinner, our water was never left unfilled, and they even chased me down with my coat once. I love the food, its so good it's hard to stop eating it. My boyfriend loves meat and I am a vegetarian, we both were pleased here and that can be hard to accomplish. We were always welcomed and fed well at a reasonable price. if you are near Odana and hungry, try it out.
