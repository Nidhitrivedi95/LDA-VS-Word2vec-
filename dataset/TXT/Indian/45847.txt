SGHTKGDcNXwdtw-ZMNbrcg All in all a very pleasant experience yet restrictive for the price.  I really liked  the Indian cinema theme throughout the restaurant and menu. Bollywood serves up smaller portions than most Indian restaurants.  But bigger doesn't always necessitate better when it comes to portion size. Our spread of cheese and chicken pakoras with mint sauce, chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani,mattar paneer,  with garlic, onion and rogini naan.  I must say that it did not disappoint.
The staff bent over backwards for us, especially to help with our wine selection, a Chilean red.  I will be back someday for their lunch buffet.
