CNx_ie_OvjJHZLZ6yEO8UA Ate here today for lunch. The food was very good but I am only giving it 4 stars because of a couple of things. The thing that bothered me about this place was they had table cloths with glass over it. The table had 2 menus under the glass facing opposite directions and centered in the middle of the table so you had to lean over to read it. The part of the table cloth that was not covered by the glass was filthy. Drips of food as well as food sort of jammed under the edge of the glass. The restroom was not clean either. 
The food was very good, good size portions and very good garlic naan. 
Server was polite and attentive. 
They need to get rid the table cloth action. It was gross and really sad that the majority of my review was about that rather than how tastey the food was.
