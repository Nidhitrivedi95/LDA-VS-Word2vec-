OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g This place was such a treat! We were dubious upon entering the place due to a complete lack of trust with desi restaurant's ability to deliver service and quality. 

We were seated and served fast. We ordered chicken tikka masala, Malaysian chicken, vegetable frankie, chicken tikka,  and naans. Food arrived fast and it looked & tasted delicious! Everything was fresh and so so good! Chicken tikka masala was perfectly creamy and spicy, with enough pieces of chicken in it. Malaysian chicken was spicy with a unique flavor and a kick to it. Chicken tikka was freshly made, was spicy, and it was lovely! And the vegetable frankie was pretty damn nice as well! 

The ambiance was cool, chic, and extremely clean and it was much much appreciated! The chef and the sous chef came to check up on us which was a nice gesture. We all were extremely happy with the food and the restaurant and regretted not finding this place earlier since it was our last day in Vegas. Highly recommended for Indian food, it was one of the best Indian food I've had in a while!
