UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg The dinner platter here is great! You get a variety of curries, pakora, rice and dessert. The rice pudding was one of the best I've had at an Indian restuarant. The service is decent. However, the interior decor are a bit worn out. However, if you can overlook that, definitely come for the amazing Indian food!
