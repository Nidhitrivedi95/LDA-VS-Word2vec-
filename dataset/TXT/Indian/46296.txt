sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ This is the best roti in Toronto and thank goodness it's a 15 minute walk from work, otherwise I would be in big trouble and eating here at least 3x week.

Very, very small interior seating only about 16 or so and if you don't call in your order ahead, you will be waiting at least 20-30 minutes. 
Especially during the Monday-Friday lunchtime period. 
Other times it may be less busy, but my experience is seeing the weekday lunchtime crowd.

My usual: Chicken roti, medium.
