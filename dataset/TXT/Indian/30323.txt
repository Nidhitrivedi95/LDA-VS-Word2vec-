K4isdrdwV3GbI52Bv2Wq6g I love this place, and I am not vegetarian.  The first thing I tried was the paneer butter masala.  Amazing!  the dosai crepes are also SUPER amazing.  the place is clean, and modern and the staff is very friendly!   the naan is sooooooo good!  I really recommend this place to Indian food lovers!
