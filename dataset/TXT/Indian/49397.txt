tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA The food was delicious and the naan was especially good. It was our first time going and I did feel a bit awkward. It seemed like the servers expected us to know that to do. Don't get me wrong, everyone was very nice and courteous, I just felt a little uncertain of how to proceed after I walked in the door. The restaurant is also really small and dark. These are nitpicky things. The food was amazing and the place seemed clean. Those are the things that count.
