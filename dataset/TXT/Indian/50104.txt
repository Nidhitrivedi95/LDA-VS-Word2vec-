U9IPxzMp4LbdoiBtTzBWLw Best indian food EVER!!!  I've been coming here for years as well as everyone else in my family and we don't even live in the West Island anymore.  I love indian food and I've tried just about every place in Park Ex and nothing compares. Being a south indian restaurant means that they serve goat yummm and have some other interesting things on the menu that arent served everywhere.  They're all worth trying! The only issue I have ever had with this place is that sometimes there can be a line up and there have been times where they have been closed without notice.  Its not fun when you're coming from far, just to specially eat there but I've learned my lesson and now I always call first.
