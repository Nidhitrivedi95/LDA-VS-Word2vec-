gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A I've had a lot of Indian food in my life, and this is definitely my favorite place to go for it. I probably eat here 1-2 times per month, and I have yet to be disappointed. My go-to is the Saag, but I usually eat off of my friends' plates as well and it's all been delicious. The customer service here is unparalleled, and I always feel like my business is appreciated. Often it is the owner serving us. The only downside I'd have to say is that the food is so yummy I usually accidentally over-eat to an uncomfortable level... But I guess that's my own fault!
