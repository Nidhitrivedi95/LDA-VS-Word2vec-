u0YqV9eoMDVdYxMegrSxqw I've been here a few times. The food is absolutely amazing. Turkey samosas when available are one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. The ribs are just incredible. I live in the west end and am more than willing to make the drive for these ribs. Highly recommended to anyone who likes to bbq ribs.  Get the basting sauce and powder. Takes the ribs to another level. I could keep going but I'm still eating. Took a break to write this review. Great place and great food!
