9coZa838egYONxSdTe-wUg I've waited far too long to try this place. I was actually hoping I'd hate it because I'm moving out of town in a week and won't be able to get back for more. I was disappointed. It. Was. Amazing. 

I ordered for pickup and it was done exactly when they said. 35 minutes. 

Everything I got was great. Fried chicken mo mos. That dipping sauce was out of control. 

Goat curry. So good. So. Good. Spicy, rich, all the things. 

My wife got the tikka. She enjoyed it. 

Support this business, friends!
