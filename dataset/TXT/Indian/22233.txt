GMBvBDKgOT51xDTpGVphBw Where do I start? Bombay Indian Cuisine was definitely Bomb. The atmosphere was comfortable and quiet. My waitress was a sweetheart and because I've only eaten Indian Cuisine once before I wasn't sure what to order, but she was patient and helped me through the menu. I ordered the Shrimp Curry which was amazing! I like spicy, so I ordered it at level 5 which was perfect. I ordered the rice which was so much better than Asian rice and went perfect with the shrimp curry. I also got the garlic butter naan and dipped it in the Curry sauce and if all blended so well. Highly recommend this place, I will be visiting again before I head back to Alaska!
