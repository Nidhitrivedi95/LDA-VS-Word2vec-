JIeEWpuNrvXsboLLtl1WGw This review is for weekend lunch buffet only : veg dishes are excellent. Biriyani is consistently bad. Chicken tandoori and fish fry are bad too. Mutton dishes are too good. Gulab jamun is from the fridge and is too sweet. Vada, samosa chaat are good. Seating area is very big with separate space for catering and parties. The place is clean. The staff is ok.
