Lp9p3CanKJdqRekIwRNJ7Q I stopped in here for happy another one of those common themed days when I'm too hungry to cook after work. It is fairly new so the place was pretty empty but it was GORGEOUS!!! It's so nicely decorated and modern and inviting! I loved just looking around. 
I sat at the bar and ordered the salmon croquettes and chicken soup. So, to be fair, I went safe with the menu. I also ordered their signature cocktail mule, it was very good. 
My meal had a tremendous amount of flavor. They made chicken noodle soup so extraordinary it was delicious I could eat that everyday for lunch. The portion was just right to accompany either an entree or hearty app. I chose the hearty app with the salmon croquette. It was so tasty and even though I was full, I ate each and every one :-). Yum!!! The sauce that went w the salmon was also very flavorful. 
I should mention that while full of flavor, it was not confused. It was a very deliberate mix of spices and ingredients. It was very "vanilla" for Indian food, so if you want a small step into this cuisine then definitely check out Indo Fusion.
