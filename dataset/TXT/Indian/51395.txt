UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Possibly the best Indian food I have had in Vegas so far. I had the Rebel Curry, which while not being spicy at all was very tasty. My friend had the Chana Masala. We also split a couple different kinds of Naan. I thought the dining area was nice, the lights were dim and the tables were spread out enough that it was pretty quiet in there. We also tried a few different deserts and they were very good. The menu was huge so I will definitely be coming to try some more dishes.
