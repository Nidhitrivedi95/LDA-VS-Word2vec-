UDk7qUVIetK3Y3NuARguqg This is a really good Indian spot in Toronto. The food was absolutely delicious. We ate bhindi and mutton rogan josh, and the food was very delicious and prepared well. 

Our server was exceptional. I like the fact that they're high tech, and take your order on iPods. The atmosphere is great, very clean, I love the solarium. And the prices are well worth the value received.
