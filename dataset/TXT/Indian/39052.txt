Oq4frcNpND8e_SGdidzzbQ Just eaten here as it was local to my b&b. Based on the reviews I figured I couldn't go wrong. The staff were very attentive without being in your face. The Boti kebab starter was 5 stars, so I eagerly anticipated my main course of chilli garlic chicken. I eat in a lot of indian restaurants and sadly this dish didn't deliver. It had flavour but a bland appearance. Don't get me wrong, it was by no means awful but didn't live up to the standards of the starter. Food and it's taste are very subjective, judging by how busy the place got I guess I just chose wrong on the night. In summary, enjoyable but not memorable. I'll give it 3.5 stars but that shows as 4!
