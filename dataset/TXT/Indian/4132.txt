1A47OcRyjJa56OwrTZpfmA Paneer Tikka!!!! One of the best I've ever had. I've said this before that this is one thing that tells if there is a Chef or cook in the kitchen. Service was great. We were looking for good food and good time. We got to experience both. Also, do try their falooda kulfi. It is really good. We will be back!!!
