bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Federick's restaurant is a Hakka joint I've been going to since as far back as I can remember. I remember how shocked I was many years ago to see one of their Chinese chefs speaking fluent Punjabi! 
These chaps are known for their solid cuisine, and most importantly their chili chicken. Below is my ideal order. 

Crab Corn Soup 
Chili Chicken 
Chicken Pakora 
Manchurian Fried Rice 
Manchurian Noodles 
Kingfisher Beer (India) 

A very close match to Federick's is Lin Garden, I will have a review for Lin Garden up soon as many people feel it is superior to Federick's. In my opinion, it's a two way tie.
 
*Please note this resto does not serve authentic Hakka dishes, but the Indian Chinese style Hakka cuisine.
