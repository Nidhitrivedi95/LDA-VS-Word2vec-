wPl5OzBIXBCAfhGnymhjXw This is another gem of a restaurant by Hemant Bhagwani. We are a big fan of his Indian Street Food co.(fine dine) and Amaya chain.
We stopped by at Baklava King and Sindhi was a couple of doors down. We were craving for chaat(Indian evening snacks) so we thought of giving it a try.
As soon as we walked in, we kinda knew it's one of Hemant Bhagwani's as the decor was very familiar and the menu was innovative.

We just had chaat there and that's why I'm rating it as 4-star. Will visit them soon again for lunch/dinner and update my review.

Mississauga folks, this is one restaurant to watch out for in your neighborhood. Do expect great things from them, and they shall deliver.
