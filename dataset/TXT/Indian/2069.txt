_DiGwfdiH913E4LURwb2qg I really enjoy this place. With a new addition to my family, my wife and I are looking for less formal and less expensive places to eat. We started eating here because the Phoenix Community Acupuncture was across the parking lot. We really feel as if we've found a gem in our part of town. 

Informal, connected to a store and there are places where Baliwood videos could be turned down...but well worth it. 

We have gone for the buffet each time we have gone. The price is very reasonable and they don't mind that our one year old picks off of our plates. Everything is good, but the Tika Masala was very tender and delicious.
