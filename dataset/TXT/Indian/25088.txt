h8bJb1dIwPmUGiqstCy7lw I ordered delivery- it did take a full hour but was worth the wait.

The chicken Tikka Masala was outstanding. Although I was hoping it would be dairy free I think there was a touch of cream or butter in there, it was too good not to have it. It was rich but not over the top. It had green peppers which I usually am not a fan of but didn't mind them in this curry.

Chana Masala had a lot of flavour and was really great- but I liked the Chicken more...
Naan bread tasted fresh and homemade, and the basmati rice was great (fluffy, with cumin seeds).

Is love to try this place again and in person to check out the ambiance. I will definitely order from here again.

Also- the leftovers were even better the next day.
