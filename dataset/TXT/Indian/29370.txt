JQ4E1Im1dHMpDa1s4vJMoQ It's awesome to be able to walk into a place and know you can eat anything from the menu! This vegetarian Indian restaurant is a jewel of Charlotte. I get something different every time I go. I'm going to work my way through the expanse of a menu in time. The aloo gobi is definitely be at the top of my favorites list so far. The restaurant also caters to large family style gaterings. I'll continue to come back until I've tried everything they have to offer!
