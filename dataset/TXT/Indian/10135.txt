9K2FHkajUaTU4P2cfFJmGQ Change of ownership was great. Probably one of the best Indian restaurants in charlotte. I visit this place 3 to 5 times per month. I had a few bad consecutive experiences there (nothing to do with the quality of food, food is always been exceptional on evey visit). Peacock is a great resutant for lunch, I'm happy to be supporting it again
