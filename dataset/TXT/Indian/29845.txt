jXyy2Vc-Dgp7QguQJSfnXw They really need to ditch the buffet. Simply put, it is a horrible deal. For almost the same price as Mint (a few blocks down the road), they have about 1/3 of the items; the time I went, the veggie items were the cheapest ones on any menu (lentil soup and pakoras), and the meat dishes were pretty basic (chili chicken, chicken korma, tandoori chicken). They've eliminated the lunch specials, which were a considerably better deal than this, for this option, and I hope that changes and soon, because there is no way I would pay $14-15 for this buffet when it is worth half that, to be charitable.
