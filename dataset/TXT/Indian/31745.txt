kYDkMGQEuQIeSOGZHHjIxA When traveling, travelers want to eat something familiar, and they usually turn to their native cuisine... or fast food. While in Edinburgh, I opted for the former. Being of Indian origin, I was looking for an Indian restaurant, hearing rave reviews about Kalpna from the hotel reception staff, I decided, it was worth a try. The restaurant is nice, with a casual ambience that very much reminds diners of the cuisine thats cooked within with thoughtful Indian decoration. The waitstaff were polite and helpful but not overbearing. The star of the show however was the food, the first day, we tried the Archana Thali and Thali Raj Bhog, which didn't disappoint. Being delighted with the experience, we visited once again, this time however we sampled the Tandoori Mix starter, which consisted of several vegetables and Panner being roasted in the Tandoor. We then ate, Dal Tadka, Bhindi Bhaji and Dum Aloo, along with Tandoori Roti, Garlic Naan and Chapati. All dishes were very tasty and enjoyable. However, the Dum Aloo, while tasty was unlike the Dum Aloo I have ever eaten before. My only gripe with the place are the restrooms, while sufficiently neat, they are located underground, beneath the dining room and are not lit very well, this has sort of an eerie effect and makes it seem a shady place, quite unlike the rest of the restaurant. To conclude, if you want a good, authentic Indian experience, go to Kalpna, you can't go wrong.
