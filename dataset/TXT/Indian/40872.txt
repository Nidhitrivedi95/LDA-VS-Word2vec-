PxH02Eu2Z4MUycBLU80D8g Went there for lunch, only four tables were seated but the server on duty was totally overwhelmed. We were hoping to be in and out in under an hour. But we were there for almost 2 hours because the service was so slow. I had the butter chicken lunch special. It was delicious. Really fresh naan. It was worth the wait.
