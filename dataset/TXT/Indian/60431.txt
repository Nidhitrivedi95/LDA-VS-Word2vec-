ZNdV9ytExuxPTXSN8i2xhw Such a wonderful addition to Dormont!! We had the Beef Wellington Bites and several beers and cocktails. Excellent prices for appropriate portions. Food and drink were SO delicious. Sofia provided exceptional service. Can't wait to see her again and have another Bee's Knees. Even the manager, Derek, was incredibly hospitable. Thanks again so, so much for the stellar first experience!!!!
