NW3KM7K7ywzEfqk3OR4tAQ Did not expect such great Indian food in Edinburgh! We'd noticed that curry was popular here, and wanted to see it was authentic.
Saw some overpriced restaurants on yelp with bad reviews and chose this place because it seemed to be the most reasonable of the nearby Indian places. Very pleasantly surprised with the food, and would definitely recommend it. The Paneer Karahi is particularly good. Totally hit the spot!
