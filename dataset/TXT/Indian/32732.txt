LI9sVHgnX-DzFyvWmPDRgA I wanted to like this place so much. After reading reviews I was so excited 

Ugh so not a fan.... 

I ordered the spinach dosa, and for an appetizer we got soup and pakoras 

I order pakoras all the time but since when is a deep fried chilli pepper a pakora ???? 

The soup was not for me at all, I hated it. I had two bites and could not eat anymore 

The dosa was good but nothing amazing and not hot all all, I wanted to ask for it warmed up but my server never came back 

Which is my next issue. Service was ssoooooo bad, food came quick but they never came to check up on us I had to call over a serve to ask for a take out container and then call a server to ask for the bill and then call a server to get my change. 

They weren't even busy.... the servers just didn't pay attention at all :/ 

idk guys, I think this place is super over rated. I didn't like my food and my server(s) sucked... 

42$ for 2 dosas , pakoras & a soup .....
