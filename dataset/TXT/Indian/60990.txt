zxSfGIhK3hH3vVz_pS5eaA I recently returned in a simular situation as my last visit. The wait staff were, again, attentive, and three dishes were placed on each table. However, I was not as impressed by their food this time.

We started off with the pappadom as an appetizer. Although it had a heavy herb taste, it was also very salty. The chutneys alleviated this somewhat, but I still wasn't a fan. Then, we had chicken tandoori, chicken tikka masala, tarka daal, and chana masala served with naan and rice. 

My first impression of the chicken tandoori was, again, salty. The chicken itself was well-cooked, and it would've been great with a bit less salt. I found the other three dishes okay, but the chana masala was the only one with any distinctive taste, and even that was mostly spiciness. (Thankfully, it was at a level well within my tolerance.) I didn't find any of them to be great, though. The naan was delicious, as was the rice, which seemed to have another light flavor from herbs or something. 

For dessert, we finished off with kheer, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Overall, it's a nice, cozy restaurant, but I think there are better Indian restaurants in the area.
