zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q Idk how the hell this place has 4 starts. 
**RANT**
So, I am from the south. Atlanta, Georgia to be exact. My family is also African and I'm used to food that has seasoning, flavor, taste etc. I have traveled all over the world and tasted a variety of different foods from different countries that were quite exquisite and flavorful. So I decided to try this place on a trip to Arizona and I was extremely disappointed. The bread was dry as hell and tasted a bit sour it was also hard and thick (no resemblance to naan) , the rice had absolutely no flavor, the paneer tikka masala was also bland no seasoning just red sauce and cheese. I don't know if it is because people in Arizona are trapped in a desert and have never tasted real food, but there was nothing delightful or tasty about this restaurant and I do not know who gave these good ratings. Not to come at you Arizona people, but really? This is what y'all think is good food???? Also, The mango lassi tasted like water. 
DISGUSTING. 
 service was questionable as well. Please try to tantalize your taste buds at least once in your life if you actually eat this food and think it's good. 
Peace & blessings y'all.
