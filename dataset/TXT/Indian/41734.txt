Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw I am writing this review based on the one and only dish that I have tried at this restaurant.  The samosa's.  

I had the good fortune to try them because I was visiting our corporate head office for an audit and this place is located almost right beside it.  I typically do not eat lunch during the day, but the auditor was in the office for a few days and I ordered food for him every day.  On the very last day he was there, he said he felt for Indian food, so I looked up their take-out menu since it was right next door.  I had decided to order a samosa for myself, since I have yet to find the tastiest samosa.  I wish he had asked for Indian on the first day, because I would have gone back every day I was at the office.

To my surprise, when I returned to the office after picking up our order, the "samosa" I had ordered actually came with 2 on a bed of chick peas in some type of sauce, and had what looked and tasted like a dollop of sour cream or yogurt on top.  Way more food than I really wanted since I never eat during the day.

I figured I would eat one, and take the second one (along with the chick peas) home for another meal.  OMG.  I ate the first one and there was no way I could stop...I finished the whole dish of food.  I cannot wait to go back to try their luncheon buffet.  I think I have finally found the tastiest samosa.
