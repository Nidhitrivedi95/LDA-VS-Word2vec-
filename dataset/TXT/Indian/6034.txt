3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA I am a self confessed foodie! I am in particular an Indian food snob! 
I have the opportunity to travel with my job and I try ask sorts of locally owned places. Because this place received a good review I thought I'd give it a go... Oh man! Wonderful! The Saag paneer was fantastic. As was everything I tried. Everything was fresh and flavorful. I easy Indian all over the state's and this it's by far the best I've had! I'm almost sorry I only make it to Vegas twice a year!
