uvWcsnk8cnSzQg9_SQaFsA Obviously you can't be expecting anything crazy authentic from this fast food/catering south Asian food joint. As such, you don't come here for a luxurious Indian cuisine; you come here because it's fast, available, and satisfying. Thus, Babu deserves 4/5 stars if that's what you're looking for. 

Babu does its job; everything is cheap, big potions, and delicious (though again, I can't say it's authentic). I like to get their all-day lunch specials which comes with a choice of meat and choice of 3 veggies. For the veggies, their pickled eggplant is a MUST! It's sweet and sour and really adds to whatever you're eating. I also get their veggie special which comes with 5 veggie sides (7 sides on fridays) and rice or roti; also very filling. I like their veggie sides more than their meat sides anyway; the butter chicken is not as good as it used to be but again....good enough for what you give. Their masala dosa is great too, samosas are satisfying, and their desserts are quite delicious, though more expensive than I'd like (desserts are paid by weight).

I frequent this place because it satisfies my Indian food/south Asian food cravings, it's super affordable, and it satisfies.
