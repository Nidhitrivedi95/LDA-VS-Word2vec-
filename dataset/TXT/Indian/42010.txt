qcqDjeirxvdgW5kQVkEwSA You get what you pay for in life, and that statement is ever-so-true for The Red Room. Don't expect much when you're eating large sandwiches with soup for only $5. 

Decent, extremely cheap food makes this place a win for those on a budget. Lots of computer plugs, free WIFI and bottomless coffee makes it hard to resist for working away from home. I find afternoons to be relatively slow and quiet. 

Ultra-cheap booze and proximity to U of T makes it a popular student hangout. Inane  conversations abound, so if you're solo bring some headphones.
