75HVFV2yYaaz0qH_KCgyFQ So gross.  I don't often have negative things to say about restaurants in Toronto but this place is so "watered down" to north american taste it is gross.  The aloo gobi was drowning in butter with hardly any flavour, as was the lamb curry.  Even the mixed grilled tikka plate was average.  There was no spice to it, the onions were burnt to the bottom instead of caramelized and it was small.  I would not recommend this place or return. Lastly the chutney was sugary and the consistency dense jello.
