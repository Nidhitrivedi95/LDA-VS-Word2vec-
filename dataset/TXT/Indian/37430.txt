o8nauTizH7H_GEAeV6HfMg My husband and I have eaten here probably a dozen times, and we keep coming back for more! Our favorite is the lunch buffet - the offerings change from day to day, and they are always yummy. It can get busy at lunchtime, but they swiftly clear plates and refill drinks. The buffet price might be slightly higher than other places, but the consistent variety and quality make it worth it!

We have been here once outside of the buffet hours for dinner. It was less trafficked at this time, and you can get your dishes spicier than at the buffet - which was great for me, but my spice averse husband had to find some yogurt relief for himself during dinner. :-)
