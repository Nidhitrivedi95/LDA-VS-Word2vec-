Mn6PbumS7GL2v3jPilTaeg Food is ok.. limited variety... insanely expensive... i arrived at Vegas and was searching for good restaurants...my friend who resides there did mention that this is an overly hyped place because of its prime location. 
i ignored that and did go there ...

There was some good side dish like raita, aloo gobi.. but i did not know with which main course should i have it along with... 

Do they expect me to have rice and sambar with aloo gobi as palya!!!!! and all this after paying 20 bucks!!!! .. 

Thanks giving dinner, and no fried rice or biryani in the buffet spread... naan was ok... 

For the price i paid i could have gone else where.. and be satisfied..

Closing Comments : go here if you earned too much from gambling and do not know what to do with all that money ...
