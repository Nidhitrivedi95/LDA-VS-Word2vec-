DokbdCS20re-Jo-OqKRilQ I've eaten plenty of Indian cuisine, but I prefer this place over all others (I even like it more than the Indian food I ate in India)! Their lunch buffet is perfect - always offering pakora, spring rolls, vegetable korma, a potato dish, and other vegetarian-friendly foods. They have great service, decent decor, and plenty of seating since the opening of their extra room.
