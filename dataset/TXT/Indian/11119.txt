A9W5rhp49EX-BYpALGLJdg Upon walking in we were greeted pleasantly and the staff was attentive.  The aromas weren't necessarily as inviting as they could have been however we wanted to try this place out due to such great reviews.  Started by ordering the tandoori platter and chicken samosas.  Found the samosas to not really be authentic -  they almost had a beef patty type crust and were fairly hard.  While we were waiting for platter- table next to us ordered some type of sizzler that had a really odd smell.  I mean even at the most basic places when you smell sizzle going by it usually makes you crave it.  Not in this case- smelled like burnt ghee.  

By this point we were like let's see how the tandoori platter is and go from there.  It was a very generous portion ($28) but it just missed the mark all around.  We have eaten in the best Indian places in many cities and again are shocked by how off ppl are with the reviews.  It just wasn't flavourful.  I mean there is only so much bland meat you can eat. 

So we ended up calling it a night after that.  Didn't order any mains as we didn't want to be further disappointed. This is a classic case of trying a place due to great reviews and it not living up.  Would have rather it been given a 3/5 and then we wouldn't have expected much.
