qiZ7t01x0xqqB0RIvO3yuQ Agree with the previous reviewer. This is a hidden gem. The decor is mixed but the food is excellent. I have the lunch buffet, which has butter chicken, tandori chicken, goat curry, lentil, cheese and peas, gulab jamum (my fav. indian dessert). They even have hakka chow-mein.

I will definitely come back to try their regular dishes, like fish masala, butter shrimp. I cannot think of another place where they serve Indian buffet in Markham Unionville area.
