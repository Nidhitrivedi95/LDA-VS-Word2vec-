eJab5373h0eZiOYnMPG4dg Ordered take out so I cannot say anything about the service. I got chicken tikka masala, vegetable pakora, garlic naan, and side of raita. 

Chicken tikka masala was delicious---especially for here in Phoenix. It's hard to find good Indian food around here. This is the best in the surrounding area. 

Vegetable pakora was pretty good. 

Garlic naan was a bit soggy. Could be better if you ordered it in house.  

Raita was flavorless---I'm from Chicago so I've had some really good ones. Wasn't bad. Just not worth the money. Maybe ok if you need to cool down the spice in your meal but not if you're adding flavor. 

Overall would have given 5/5 if just judging on the chicken tikka masala, went down to 4 because of raita and naan.
