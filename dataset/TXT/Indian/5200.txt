2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Stands out amongst a gentrified strip on chain restaurants and fast-food places, but isn't all that impressive in the grand scheme of things. The food is tasty and plentiful, but you can tell they're business plan is based on volume and turnover, not authenticity and quality. Everything comes with a sauce that's a little too soupy, the food is over-salted and the meat is dry. Not my favorite Indian place, but when I'm at work and need a quick fix it'll do.
