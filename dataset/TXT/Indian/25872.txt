i-zvRNJ-KSG-sfdAzwImQQ Went for lunch here and sorry to say but the food was a let down.
We ordered Mysore Masala Dosa and a Thali. The dosa was below expectation in taste and chutnies were not fresh. Thali lacked variety and taste.
There are many places in GTA which offer better South Indian food than Godavari.
