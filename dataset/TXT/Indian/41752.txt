Q7YfGjBcFFpy3FUMOw7GLw Want the verdict? Cookie cutter Indian.  

I recently ordered from Chef of India. Didn't feel like cooking. Really felt like some naan. What am I saying, I never need much of an excuse to order Indian food. 

I had the tandoori chicken appetizer, the butter chicken and two pieces of garlic naan. 

I found the tandoori chicken to be really tasty and a huge portion (half a chicken) so that was a pleasant surprise. Lovely.

The butter chicken was not my favourite (not enough of that yoghurt taste, more red than I prefer) and the seasoning wasn't really balanced  (all I could taste and smell was saffron).

The naan was alright, a big piece so wish I'd just ordered one. Not very buttery but they are generous with the garlic coating.

Overall it was an a-okay dining experience and I was able to eat my order in two separate settings. But their prices are outrageous and they are a bit misleading about portion sizes (I was encouraged to get two naans when that was absolutely unnecessary). 

Frankly, for Indian it was pretty bland. An emergency measure really.

I RECOMMEND: Shopping around for better priced/made options. 
(If this place was more budget friendly, I'd probably give it a another try but there are too many Indian joints at a better value in the area. La lutta aka the search continua. This is a good problem to have lol)

EXTRA TIP: Pretty huge menu so while I stick to my faves, you might find more to your liking.
