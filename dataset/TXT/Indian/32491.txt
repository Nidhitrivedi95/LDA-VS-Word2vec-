li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ Was so excited to have an Indian restaurant in downtown Phoenix that I can go to for lunch. Was instantly disappointed that they offer a limited selection of menu items (their menu changes daily and they offer a handful of items each day). Plus, they only use dark chicken meat (hello, white is so much healthier for you!). The food wasn't very flavorful. Portions were decent but would have much rather had a buffet.
