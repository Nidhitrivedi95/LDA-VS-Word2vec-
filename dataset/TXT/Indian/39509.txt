p_1TYCJ8oVgrnuhWC9e6cQ For my visit i was in the restaurant and it was great.  The food was lovely, served in trays with tea lights, nice decor and lighting.  Main thing that let it down was the waiter as he seemed dis interested and mainly going through the motions.

But for the main part, which was the food, i couldnt fault it, the curries were great, the starters tasty and well sized and the garlic nan bread was perfect.
