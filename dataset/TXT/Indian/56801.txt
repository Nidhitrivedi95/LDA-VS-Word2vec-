xZtKQ6AFLh9P7rfmjvVjhw I honestly don't know why I'm not giving it 5-stars. I love this place! The red chili with fry bread is incredible. For about 4 or 5 visits, I wouldn't order anything else (didn't want to take the chance of something/anything not being as tasty) but the server recommended the red chili taco and damn was it good too! 

We usually hit this place for lunch 2-3 times a month, if not more.
