UQMQDq8yuxnyQyBIoKhzoQ This is a nice place by Case Western campus. It was really empty on this Monday dinner time. However, I'm not sure classes have started yet.

The food was decent. I had palak paneer (paneer cubes in blended spinach and garlic) and Alu Gobi. I was expecting a vegetable mixture of green peppers, broccoli, etc. It was literally potatoes and cauliflower. Apparently, I was completely wrong. Who knew.

The samosas were wonderful. Fried crisp pockets of blended potatoes and peas.

The naan was liberally coated with oil - the perfect accompaniment to our sauces. Yum 

The other patrons were South Indian and Middle Eastern. Not sure what that means.
