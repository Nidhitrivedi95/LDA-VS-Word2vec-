S1Gpj_cqlEzitBCGAXj5aA I have to say that the good was decent. Now I am an Indian and I eat at Indian restaurants in NJ and India all the time. Service really need to be worked on or they will have a hard time. 

For an Indian restaurant in the US I was quite impressed that their plates and cups were clean. Restrooms, like all indian restaurants were dirty and overfilled with fabreez. 


While we were there paying the check they had a call from a customer complaining about an delivery and it was not handled professionally while there were many others listening to her on the phone. 

Small changes and they could be the best place to eat indian food in Vegas.
