gw0ZS5b5RP3Lzr1BoCbALg I tried charkha based on yelp reviews. I used to fo to saffron patch. But I tried charkha last saturday. Food was so good so delicious. I never had indian food like this before. I orders samosa and paneer burji it was wonderful I can still taste in my mouth Service was quick. All the servers were very friendly. And I really like that they were wearing indian suits. So everything was so food. So I am definitely going back very soon
