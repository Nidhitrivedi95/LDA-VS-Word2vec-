LFfYe-hh1NKFtUKV3LUgfg This Indian food is just delicious! I like that they had several vegetarian options for dinners. I do wish the entrees came with more rice Tho as I had more than half my entree left when the rice was gone! Like most Indian restaurants, the ventilation is not good enough to rinse the air of the spices. This restaurant is no different so come prepared to smell like what you ate and allow for adequate time to go home and shower off the smell and do a load of laundry as to not offend anyone who isn't open to ethnic food! The smell is quite strong and tends to linger long after the meal, especially from this restaurant. Luckily Tho, this restaurant has a small outdoor patio so you can eat without smelling like Indian food afterwards! So that earns another star!! The waiter even came and threw a nice tablecloth over the table for me. It does get dark on the patio at night tho. But they were great and did not forget about me out there! I would return again if in the area again!
