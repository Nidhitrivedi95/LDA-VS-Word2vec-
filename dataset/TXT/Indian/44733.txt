I am all about Indian Buffets. The price here is good too. 

Went here for lunch with co-workers and had a great time. Plenty to choose from. The potatoes that have spinach in it is amazing. The naan is nothing to write home about, and some other just okay dishes . For sure try the butter chicken. 

Best of all it's not too heavy!
