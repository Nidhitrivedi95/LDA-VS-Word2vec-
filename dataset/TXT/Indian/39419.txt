OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA Lin Garden is supposed to be famous for their hakka food, specifically the chili chicken. I therefore decided to give this place a try. I ordered the chili chicken (dry style), steamed rice, and some egg rolls. First impressions of the chicken dish was it looked pretty standard as far as other versions I've tried. Perhaps lacking on the onion and green chili pepper. Taste-wise, it was very bland with almost so spice or even salt. I did order it without MSG however that shouldn't make a dish totally devoid of savoury flavour. Overall, I wasn't impressed with the dish at all and won't be ordering it from here again. The egg rolls were average and although possibly made in-house they were nothing out.of the ordinary.
