v3BLVPLRo2Egeak29B9lug Had no problem getting a table for 4 here early on a Saturday night.  We ordered 2 Karahi Aloo Gobis, a Matar Paneer, and a Palak Paneer.  

I asked for my Aloo Gobi with all cauliflower and no potatoes, and they were very willing to accommodate me.  The mix of spices coupled with the bits of very aromatic tomato and onion was very delicious.  However, I had specified I wanted it very spicy (hot), and it came out relatively mild to my taste.  

The Matar Paneer came out perfectly spiced to our palettes however, and the Palak Paneer was truly one of the best I've ever had.  It had a peculiar (and wonderful) aroma to me as if it had been cooked with schmaltz (chicken fat), although I doubt very much that an Indian restaurant would employ this fat in its cooking.  Regardless, the dish was beautifully umami.

The prices here are bit cheaper than other Pittsburgh Indian joints, though the portion sizes seem scaled down to match.  I almost always bring home leftovers from restaurant (and enjoy doing so), but did not from Coriander.  If we return, perhaps I'll order an extra dish for the table with these small portion sizes in mind.
