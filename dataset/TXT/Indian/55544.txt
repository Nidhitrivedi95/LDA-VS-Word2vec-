x2kGa_XkRy00cYotdlfmag I don't have hakka food very often but when I do, I expect it to be spicy. I came with three of my friends who have been here before and told me they died of spice so naturally, I was very intrigued.

Our server suggested we get the fish pakoras with sweet/sour sauce to start off and they were very tasty! There was plenty of fish to feed four people as an appetizer so we were happy with portions, however it was a bit pricy. We also ordered 4 meat dishes (crispy beef, garlic chicken, manchurian tofu and chef special spicy wings) and a Szechuan fried rice. 

The crispy beef wasn't very crispy and it was quite overcooked. The garlic chicken was alright, the sauce was too tomato-y though and not enough garlic. We expected it to be dry but it was super saucy. The tofu was pretty good when it was hot because it was very crisp but over time (of course) it got mushy so eat it all soon! The chef special spicy wings weren't really very spicy and the sauce was quite salty. We did order extra spicy for the manchurian tofu but for me who likes spice didn't find it spicy. 

Overall a little bit disappointed but maybe i didn't order the right dishes. I would come again to give other dishes a try!
