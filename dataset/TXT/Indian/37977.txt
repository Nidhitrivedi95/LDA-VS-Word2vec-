ohz8ljVxcZMo2bMGrBZfgw Tried this place on a Saturday night in Vegas recently. Surprisingly the whole place was empty at peak time. There were lot of customers in other restaurants in the same strip mall, so its not as if this place was unique. 
We entered and we were immediately impressed by the decor and ambiance. They also had some nice music playing and flattering lighting. 
The restaurant may be struggling as they had a Groupon deal running when we went there and also have a Yelp $15 for 20 running right now.  The issue could be with their pricing. The entrees were about $15+ for vegetarian and $20+ for Non-vegetarian. Typically, either bread or rice is included with entrees, but here it was separate. So its like they have 'on the strip' prices for an off the strip restaurant with less value. Nevertheless, we liked the food, service and ambiance. The server/host was welcoming, he made it clear from the beginning that he can only accept one Groupon per table (we had 2) which is a fair policy. Despite applying the deal, there was no difference in service. We ordered the tadka daal, aloo paratha and some chilli paneer. Out of which, I would rate chilli paneer the lowest - as it tasted more indo chinese and was super sweet. The daal was really nice and aloo paratha was fresh and not frozen crap. Our friends tried the chicken and lamb and also liked it. Our Indian food standards are pretty low coming from Austin, TX - but we had just returned from India so the taste of amazing Indian food was fresh in our minds. In the end, the servers even offered to pack our left overs for us, which was a nice gesture. No hassles with billing or the check. All in all, if you crave Indian - go for it.
