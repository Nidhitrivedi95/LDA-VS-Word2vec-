7LNuQqjcjAn0bBlGHIiQzQ I came here with my family a couple of weeks ago to enjoy a dinner out together.
We usually go to little India in Toronto for Indian food, but decided to stay in the 
area instead.

The atmosphere is nice, the tables are very nicely set up but it was freezing and the back of the restaurant was lit with very harsh LED lighting that was hard on the eyes.

We were very happy with the service, the young servers were very polite and professional.
The lamb biryani that I ordered was very delicious, but the salad was very peppery and looked wilted.

Overall with a few tweaks, I would have given the restaurant a higher rating. It was missing a warm and welcoming feeling, which would have been nice.
