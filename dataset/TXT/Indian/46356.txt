sRirP65Q7BSg3Lj9FdkKWQ NEGATIVE STARS. abolutely disgusting place. Who keeps a pigeon in the kitchen??? Food is tasteless. For an indian, the food is absolutely not tempting. Only tomato ketchup in chicken tikka . Very unappetizing.
Also the experience couldnt be any worse. While me and my husband were having dinner , a crazy huge homeless man came in. He kept staring at us and blabbering in front of us / himself. And all the staff could do was talk within themselves.  Later when we confronted the owner about doing something about it, he said his boundary is till the counter and anything after that is public space and he dsnt have control over what happens in there. He told us not to use our brains but use technology to send the crazy homeless guy's picture to police. Apparently this guy has been coming in there regularly.

Well what can I say, atleast they have one regular customer!!!
