Ih5Q1cNDLchhi1FqqTwrag Came during lunch on a weekday. It was pretty empty but, we didn't let that scare us away. 
We sat in the bar area where there are huge windows and a view of Fremont Street. 

We ordered Aloo Tiki Chat, Gobi Manchurian, Chicken Tikka Masala & Garlic Naan. Forgive any misspellings of these dishes. They were all excellent. So much so, my mouth is watering just typing this review. Will definitely be back!
