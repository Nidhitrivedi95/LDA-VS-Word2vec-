9QtfgneK8SIIm4c0SlrF0g Sanjeev Kapoor is a legend in India and it's the name that will draw foodies to this place. It's a franchise  and is the first in North America. The first question you ask is "Is the food really different from all other restaurants here in Toronto?" And the answer is a resounding YES. The food here is pretty awesome - I tried out both veggie and non veg stuff.  mushroom, Baigan or even the Biryani. I love the style with which they serve food here. The food leaves you wanting for more. The ambience is super - you will love it. The staff makes you feel comfortable and take care of all the small details. It's one of the most stylish Indian restaurants out here. Try it out for business lunch/dinner or special occasions. It's a pricey restaurant and I'd reserve this one for special occasions.
