Wrd9LAbc8IOoAS5H6uw9sw I have been here twice so far, both ventures for the afternoon buffet. The second trip came recently to confirm the quality as I remember being blown away the first time, and had another great experience. I am excited to start eating here more often as it is on the way to school. 

Until like 2:30 pm, they have an all you can eat buffet for around $9, and a guy like me is fully capable of devouring 3-4 entrees in order to get full. So this is the basis for my review as I may or may not make it in for dinner any time soon due to my schedule. 

I started the game picking out a little sample of everything offered, and then was planning to take it from there eliminating what I didn't like as I went up for seconds.
I absolutely loved it all, but only went back up for a few items due to being (surprisingly) full. Although I enjoyed the grilled veggies, I would have to put them on the side next time as they didn't mix well with the chicken curry and masala items. That was my bad though, as I had chosen... poorly with my plate composition.

I will gradually update this review as I learn more info about the dishes, I plan to start going here a lot for lunch and will be more vigilant about what is what.
