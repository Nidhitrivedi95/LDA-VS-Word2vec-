NyLYY8q1-H3hfsTwuwLPCg Indian approved! As a person who lives and breathes Indian food I'm very picky when eating out. My cousin had mentioned this place and said it was really good. Subsequently her and her husband brought me some paneer tikka and naan. I enjoyed the huge pieces of paneer. I went again with a friend and below I provide descriptions. 

Samosa chaat: classic Indian appetizer and I loved how it tasted here. Definitely need to try. 

Paneer tikka: the paneer pieces are big and yums! Best combination ever it comes with your choice of naan and rice (white or brown) 

Lamb meat ball: personally would not get this as I don't like lamb in this form. My friend enjoyed it. I would get the tikka masala. 

I wasn't able to get the other masalas but definitely will try them if I am ever in the area. However, you can never go wrong with tikka masala!
