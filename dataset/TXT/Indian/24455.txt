h-psPOmlY0mCOflb3S3rdQ A decent place to eat good Indian food. They are consistent with their menu and taste and I found at least 60% of the menu appeasing at any given day and I was never disappointed. Noise levels can get high during weekends and it can be hard to hear your friend sitting 2 feet away from you lol. Not a great fan of their dessert menu. Don't even think of trying their kulfi!!! Just don't mess with it!
