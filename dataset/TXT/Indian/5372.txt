2YsKefH250qxg28QCyEWZw Good stuff, but they really need to work out a better way to get people in and out of there. Came Sunday afternoon, and the lineup reached from one end of the store to the other end. Seeing as this place is at least two stores long, and their restaurant stretches out vertically, this says a lot. They have two lines: one for sweets and fried goods, and one for their hot table. Usually, when I go, I can line up in the hot food line and get both hot food and samosas. The hot food line is almost always shorter than the other line, so this usually saves me a lot of time. When I went this time, I was told that this wasn't an option. Perhaps he didn't understand my English? I'm not sure. Whatever it was, I waited in the long line (and I didn't bother getting my hot food). The lineup took me about 15-20 minutes? When I was paying, I looked back and the lineup was still at the other end of the restaurant. Yeah. There's a lot of people who like this place. There's a reason for it. Super cheap food.

All of these are $1 for 5: veggie samosas, aloo tikki, spring rolls (which taste just like every other vegetarian spring roll I've ever eaten), two types of vadai, potato balls (these are like spicy mashed potato balls that have been deep fried).

Veggie pakora (the only kind they had that day) are $4.99/lb. Theirs tastes primarily of onion, thus resulting in something I can only describe as the Indian version of onion ring shreds? Something like that. Delicious though. My little cousin doesn't do spicy, and she ate quite a few of these.

All in all, good food, but needs better, more efficient service. They also need to update their hot food menu.
