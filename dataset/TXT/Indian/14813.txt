cF0PKI4NzTpojcQvQRNRLw Went here with my Dad because we heard they had decent Biryani. Coming from a mughal background, we enjoy good biryani. This place delivered and the portion was more than satisfactory. We also tried the seekh kabobs, and those were very tender and flavourful. The service was also great, with the waiters constantly checking in on us.
