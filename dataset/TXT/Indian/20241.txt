|| My Experience:  

One of the few buffets I actually like and return to, India's Taste has an expansive clientele, from families to officer works, and people of all different ethnic backgrounds. 

The dishes are all self-serve, but are quickly replenished and don't sit around too long. The best value is lunch time, as the dinner service is more expensive but doesn't really add any new dishes to the table. 

The real standout here is the Naan bread, which is made fresh and brought to your table. Servers are attentive enough to ensure Naan is replenished, as well as any drinks that need refilled and plates that need taken away. 

Overall, a great place when you're feeling for some Indian food, but come with an appetite to feast!
