ICUCAzUZFiWkYs7iCtNCQg I visited this place on a friends recommendation. We arrived on time, they have bookings available through open table. They seated us. The decor inside is nice. our table was not best as it was slanting in one direction. They have wine and cocktails, but I was told by server they donot have regular single malts and other drinks etc. Food was good I will give it probably 4 star. Service was slightly slow. Overall a decent experience. I would def recommend trying Kheema Bhatura in the appetizers section.
