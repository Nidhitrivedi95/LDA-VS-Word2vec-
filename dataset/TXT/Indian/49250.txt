tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA Wow!  I stumbled into this place on the way to give blood for those injured in the Vegas shooting knowing that I needed to have food in my system prior to my donation. Am I EVER glad I found this. 
Buffet pretty standard as far as items but THE FLAVORS! Awesome. 

Will become a regular for me for sure. Want to come back for dinner to see what's what with that.
