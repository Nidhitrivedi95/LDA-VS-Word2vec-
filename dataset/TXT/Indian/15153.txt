CkncJJ9tKgsGULXTTKmfdw My boyfriend and I were thrilled with our entire experience at 309 Dhaba. From the gentleman who took us upstairs from the lower level entryway to every member of the waitstaff, everyone was kind, helpful, and polite. We ordered the Dhaba Platter and an order of Butter chicken with rice and two garlic naan - all to share between two people. Each bite was fabulous. We enjoyed the variety of items in the dhaba platter and with the entree and bread/rice there was enough to be full with extras packed up for leftovers. We came on a Saturday night and enjoyed the live music. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. Everything was clean and the restaurant was well-decorated. I would absolutely visit this restaurant again as well as definitely recommend to others.
