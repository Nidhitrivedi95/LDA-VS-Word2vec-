QzM-p93UPqQ3JN-iqgUNPQ I have been here for lunch a couple of times and keep telling my wife how good the food is and how cheap it is.  She finally got me to take her and the food did not disappoint.

We shared an order of Potato Balls, a ball of mashed potatoes mixed with a tasty curry and spices and then fried so the outside skin is as crispy as the inside is soft.  The taste is awesome and does not have the overpowering curry that other places put in their food so that it can be truly enjoyed without being overwhelming.

My wife enjoyed her Chicken Roti and I had the Goat Roti.  Huge portions for under $10 each with tender meat. Once again they use the curry so that it makes you appreciate how the flavour works with the meat and Roti and not just feel that it is the only thing in the dish. We enjoyed them both with a couple of beers, Bob Marley playing in the background and a cast of  characters at a few of the tables around us who had originally come from a few different islands in the Caribbean. These guys were mostly there for a cold beer after work (just $3.50 which is very cheap for any place in Toronto) and just added to the colour of the place.

Ordering was quick and easy since the place is so small and the owner you see in the pictures on Yelp was the guy who took our order and went back to help cook the food.

Dinner was under $30 plus tip.  Holy Crap, what a deal.  And on a hot August day in Toronto the food and ambiance had me feeling that I was no longer in Canada.  Hidden Gem indeed!
