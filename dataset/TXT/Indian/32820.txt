LK3HJH9LMAHTlO6U9rae4Q Don't judge me ladies and gentlemen, but I apart from my complimentary meal on Air India last summer, I have never had Indian food until today!

I am not a huge fan of spice and generally get suspicious of any food that has the distinct look of baby vomit! 

ANYWAYS, I was super hungry after work and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Chicken Tikka with Naan and a pop; the whole thing came to $11 which I found a bit pricey but not too bad. Everything was delicious!
