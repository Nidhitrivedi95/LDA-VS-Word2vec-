-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g Good food,  casual.  The naan bread was a must get.  Tried the lamb curry and chicken vindaloo.  The lamb curry gets five stars,  the chicken not so much due to the fat not trimmed off.  I don't claim to be an expert on Indian food so take this with a grain of salt.  However,  the staff was very friendly and it's evident they're doing their best to bring authentic Indian food to tempe.
