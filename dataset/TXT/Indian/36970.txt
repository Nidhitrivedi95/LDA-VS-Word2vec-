o2Qh4SiGYJ7BK4hP7dfkrw My husband and I had dinner at Saffron expecting it to be pretty good based on the reviews we read. We were not disappointed! It was outstanding! The black pepper shrimp with yellow curry, made extra spicy per my request, tasted even better than I imagined it would. We love this place and cannot wait to go back!
