DrdhxvpwlZGhwF5vTR_QnA I ordered delivery from this place with my mom a few nights ago. Two entrees, one appetizer, rice and naan came to over $60, which seemed quite high for a meal without drinks. The food was alright, but not spectacular, especially given the price paid; $20 for a shrimp entree, really? The lamb zhalfrezi was passable but the portion was on the small side, not nearly filling the takeout dish, or leaving any leftovers for the next day as is typical of Indian takeout in my experience. I'll definitely be exploring other options in the area before ordering from here again.
