uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Best Indian food in Toronto. Definitely my favorite restaurant overall. You have the option to do half orders so you can try a little bit of everything. They have great vegetation options. But I'm a carnivore. On the list of of delicious things I can highly recommend are the samosas, mulligatawny soup, garlic naan, bryani rice, shrimp curry, and their spicy Caesar cocktail. The spicy beef vindaloo is my absolute favorite. The pieces of meat are large and and fall apart with a fork. Lamb saag is fresh and full of spinach and curry flavor. Their butter chicken is the best I've ever had. The chicken is well marinated, the sauce is creamy, a little bit sweet and spicy. You just have to try this place you won't be disappointed.
