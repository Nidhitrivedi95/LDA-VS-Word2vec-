GJTQ0dgQ2BTkbRw2jLE0Fw Our first visit to Tandoori Times 2 will not be our last. The chicken tikka wrap features high end flavor and great naan. 
Tandoori lamb chops are savory, well seasoned, and tender. 
Today's delight was dessert. Ras malai. Part of the fun of exploration is looking up what you had for lunch to reinforce the flavor experience. 
We look forward to visiting again.
