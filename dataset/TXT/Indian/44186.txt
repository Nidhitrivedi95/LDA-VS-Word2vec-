RUd_M7DPJq1I3DPq0oF--w Me and my family were in Canada just for vacation in Niagara Falls, so we decided to drive to toronto from there. As we drove we came across this place which just stood out because of the rickshaws that stood outside and the architecture of this restaurant which just screamed Pakistani. To order we had to write down what we wanted to order on a whiteboard with a marker which was cool and I really loved that idea. The food was amazing and it reminded me of the old traditions of Pakistan. We ordered Kashmiri chai too, which was too salty but overall the food was really good. I just didn't like the environment\neighborhood where this restaurant is located because of the cracked and broken streets/houses. The whole street in that area is dedicated to Pakistan/Indian culture but it does need some renovation. Since being a New Yorker, it all just looked weird to me.
