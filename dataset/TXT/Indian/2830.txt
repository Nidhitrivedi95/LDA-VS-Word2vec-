0cf-w9PK5gLkBkitL3bdqw I admit I was a little scared to try this place. This was the 3rd Indian Restaurant we've tried since moving from Seattle and they all disappointed until this one!

It was Christmas day and the second we walked in the smells from the kitchen started to make my mouth water! We decided to go with things we knew the first visit and they did not disappoint! We had:

Chicken Makhni: Perfectly Creamy and delicious with the the right amount of spices. The chicken was juicy and cooked to perfection.

Basamati Rice: Not my favorite of the Indian Rice I've had, but cooked perfectly.. I would have just preferred it to be more fragrant.

Tandoori Mixed Grill: We went with the mix so we could try everything. It came with chicken breast/chicken thigh and leg/lamb/shrimp/sausage. The chicken breast was to die for, it was even juicier then the thigh/leg that came with it! Lamb was good, although it was a little to "strong" tasting for my husband who doesn't really enjoy lamb in the first place, the only one I wasn't crazy about was the shrimp but I've never had shrimp tandoori that I really enjoyed so it may just not be my thing.

Cheese Naan: This was my only real complaint (if you could call it that) We asked the waitress if the Naan bread was made with paneer (which we love) and she said yes, but when it came it looked more and tasted like they just sprinkled it with shredded mozzarella cheese. The Naan bread was good.. but I would have preferred it with paneer, or the garlic naan.

Overall, It was delicious and way better then any other Indian Restaurants in the valley, we can't wait to go back for their lunch buffet so we can try a different selection of food.
