2xw-Ksu9b2jDYlZaApXcBA Food was really good - not great but good  -
was staying at the Radisson so it made it easy to get.
Had Chicken Tikka Marsala , really good but for me to much gravy and not enough chicken. Little sloppy to eat.
Samosa was very different from what I am use to but they had alot of flavor and again very good.

Try it as it my be the the best of the choices of food in the area
