MVLQkoWx-uHFVyOBBFfvyQ Checked this place out for dinner and was not disappointed! 
We ordered the Dahl puri amazing flavour $4.99 for 6 pcs, 1/2 tandoori chicken delicious $8.99 - it can out on a sizzling hot plate on top of a bed of veggies nice presentation. 

For our main we had Butter Chicken, Lamb Korma, Jeera Rice and Garlic Naan (so flakey warm and delicious and made in house!) 

The staff were very welcoming, warm and attentive. The place was very tidy and clean. 

We will definitely go back for lunch when they have an all you can eat $11.99 Buffett and $7.99 Thali.
