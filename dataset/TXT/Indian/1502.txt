-s_U95xEEmJu5GK-srqpUA My wife and I took my mother-in-law out to dinner here and we all loved it!  We walked in and the restaurant was nice and clean,  the service was fantastic, and the food was authentic and delicious.  Everyone involved genuinely cared that we had an amazing experience and it showed all the way around.  We will definitely be back for more.
