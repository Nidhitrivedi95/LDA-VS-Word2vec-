c_hzWIFgbmirxHnzBtkH0A I would never ever going in Makkah Restaurant by myself if my fellow yelper did not take me here!!

Makkah Restaurant is full of men... all the men that works in the kitchen...all the men that was ordering the food or eating the food in here..  I really stood out like a sore thumb... 

The self served eat in area is clean and spacious... after you placed your order, you picked up your food and then you eat and after that you pay... All based on honour system since you even help yourself with the drinks from the fridge!!

Chicken Tikka Kebab was so tender, juicy and delicious! And love that charred smokey flavoured!! 

Naan bread that is freshly made by those friendly kitchen staffs that even posed for my photo shots with a big smile on their faces!!

Just love Makkah Restaurant for their food, their down to earth vibe and friendly service!

Now maybe I am ready to come back on my own now???
