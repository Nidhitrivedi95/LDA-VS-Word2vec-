OJLR2T3CgXQkUgFmqrkTwQ Found this gem by accident. Was there for Fartumo Kusow's book launch, Tale of a Boon's Wife. While the event was catered, I noticed they didn't have bisbas (Somali hot sauce). I can't eat Somali food without bisbas. So I went next door, to the actual restaurant, with the intentions of asking for bisbas. I noticed there wasn't any options on their menu. Out of curiosity, I asked the gentleman, he wasn't Somali - he looked Middle Eastern to me, if there was a vegetarian option. He said no but he could make me a salad. Sadden, I reluctantly agreed. Then he said, are you feeling brave? I'll make you something different. I was beyond excited at this point. He then took sabaayad (Somali flatbread) and added hummus then a variety of cold vegetables and topped it off with mixture carrots and potatoes drizzled with ranch. After rolling this burrito lookalike, he replaced the tinfoil on the (shawarma) as he remembered I mentioned I didn't eat meat. He even used s clean knife to cut my burrito in two! It's very rare to see restaurants use different cutlery and utensils while dealing with meat and non meat meals. As a vegetarian, I was super impressed and appreciative. 

Also, it's 24 hours so now I'm definitely coming back. 

Thanks for the amazing experience!!
