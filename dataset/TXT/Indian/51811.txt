UV2Jt8slktGu14gLZeNCjA Feel: you enter this place and want to feel good about this place, good lighting comfortable seatings et all. Good music.

Menu card: i love elaborate menus, ones which tell you details and makes you imagine and times salivate :). This one takes it a step ahead it even details items like gluten free, jain , halal etc.

10 on 10 for menu.

Service initial:
1. The manager asks for scale of spiciness.
2. The waiter clearly asks for water with ice or without it. How many Indian place do so?


And the good part ends there, rather miserably.

My friends, veg asked for a thali for 2. Question: how can a thali for 2 have only 1 nan?
Lamb lollypops, not well marinated and rubbery.
We were asked to rate the level of spice in food, we asked for 8 and got a -8

0/5 for food. There is an apt hindi saying: unchi dukaan feeka pakwan (only pomp and show but no content).

A good reataurant has to be flexible, we asked for a thali which had kheer for dessert but we requested to substitute with gajar halwa ( available on a different thali ). The request was rudely turned down not by the steward but by the kitchen, we never got what we asked for.

The waiter goofed up plain rice and jeera rice and tells us not to worry he will have the ticket updated. I love food and feel bad when my love for food is weighed in currency. 
Service 0/5
