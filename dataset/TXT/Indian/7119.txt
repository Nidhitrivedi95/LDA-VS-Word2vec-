4xtU8eji_G0Yepj3D-8I6Q 5 stars for variety, even a mediocre fan of Indian food would appreciate the selection. From authentic Indian food to pizza  , onion rings and fries . Indian friend said it was legit so enuf said.

3.5 stars for food quality. It's a buffet under $30 stop complaining

2.5 stars for service. Was going to order more drinks, head waitress said to wait (holding a finger up) while multiple checks were being paid. After asked for check is when she told the waiter to take our orders... yet she didn't take it herself (10 mins láter)

3 stars for price $15 duller lunch buffet is above avg. but wasn't fully unreasonable.  

4.5 stars for decor. Felt nice in this establishment being a buffet.

3.7 stars average so according to math 4 s

If you haven't been before to this venue and are hungry by all means feast otherwise Popeyes is across the street
