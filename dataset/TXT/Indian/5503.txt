3BJhHBe9xEKe8jaIDd8SWg I was clueless as to what Tibet's food was like until I accidentally ended up at this place.

The ambiance of this place could use some improvement, there is a little patio in the front although the people sitting there seemed sketchy to us so we decided to go inside and we sat in the front of the restaurant.

They have a bar and on the other side of the bar there is more seating. There is a second patio in the back, there appeared to be no one using it when we arrived.

The food here seemed really fresh and those vegetarian Momo's were really amazing, I have never had momo's before so I don't know what else to compare it to but I have had dumplings at Chinese restaurants and this was fairly similar, but it tasted amazing.

Service was fairly friendly, it seemed like it was a family run business. There are many options for vegetarians and vegans, i would go back here again.
