gWeNzHtxFh_Bv_am6WXIyA Unfortunately, Udipi Cafe has been one of those places for me that gives you one great meal on your first day, and then never another good one after. You just keep going back with that initial thought of that first meal, but are met with disappointment thereafter, till you just get fed up. And that is what I am fellow yelpers.

This place is a primarily south Indian restaurant serving a variety of South Indian cuisine. However, as it stands, the food is just not worth it to make the trip out to this place! The idlis are consistently dry and rubbery, the Dosas greasy, and the vadas dry and unappetizing. 

Couple that to the apathetic and lackadaisical service, and I don't know why you would come to this place. If you are hankering for South Indian food, try Priya's.

The only thing keeping this place at 2 Stars is that it has a decent sambhar and chutneys.
