DJuQgsoj-qmU0i5iTAa4aA While this is my first check in and review this was supposed to be our forth or fifth time here. You used to be able to order from with here or Bamboo Gardens next door which was how we used to do since I am not a fan of Indian cuisine. Apparently that is no longer allowed so we will not be returning. They have lost our business. Very sad.
