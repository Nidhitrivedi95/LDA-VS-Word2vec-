gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A Love the food here and especially being that we are very familiar with Indian food, need it to be authentic which this restaurant is. Service is awesome and staff is very welcoming. It truly is one of the better Indian restaurants in the valley and don't let the location fool you. If you come here once, you're bound to want to return!! Love love it!!
