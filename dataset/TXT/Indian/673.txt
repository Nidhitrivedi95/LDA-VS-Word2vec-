-Gh82g_IrQxW59zjNaCldQ This restaurant was close to my hotel in Mississauga and I went their for lunch. I ordered their combo #5 and my friend ordered combo # 3 and we both loved it. I am originally from India and I have had Pakistani food before in California and these guys make legit awesome food. Quality, quantity and price are highly decent.
