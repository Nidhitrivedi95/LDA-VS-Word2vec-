C9QVknXuoDBdR9CBa_Flyw I had their Mulligatawny soup (curried soup with chicken, red lentils, celery, carrots, potatoes & basmati rice), which came with a veggie samosa, and it was delicious! Perfect level of spice and the ingredients to soup ratio was just right. It was filling and came to just under $8. Ordered it via Ritual and was intoxicated by the smells when I went to pick it up. Can't wait to go back and make my way through the menu!
