OFAiA6En2HD0CqLkFDCNpg When we lived in Yorkville, The Host was our go-to place for comfort good. All we ever ordered was Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhni) and nan but we just couldn't bring ourselves to be adventurous because it was tough to imagine that anything else on the menu could taste better than their Butter Chicken. It had just the perfect portion that leaves you satisfied but not stuffed. The combination of creamy tomato sauce and nan always managed to make my day. The only minus is the long wait time. It probably doesn't help that we always come when we're already starving. 

The environment is very modern yet exotic. I love the little touches of nature that are added to freshen up the place, it really brings upon a feeling of tranquility. The wait staff are professional and courteous. I only have good memories from The Host.
