nAnpTnodDchSl9H0f6R2pw Average at best food at ridiculous prices. I ordered the chef special butter chicken with white rice, the portions are small - a bowl of sauce with a few pieces of chicken. The flavours were very average, nothing to rave about. The most frustrating thing is that a $16 main dish does not even come with rice, and I only found out when I got the bill, they charged me $5 for rice. For a meal that costed $30 after tax and tips, I essentially had a bowl of sauce on white rice. Simply despicable. Never again.
