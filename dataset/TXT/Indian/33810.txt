LyGab6ITDEMDI5E0YcC0Ng The Himalayan Chimney has great interior design with good sitting arrangement. Servers are really nice and friendly, but I wish the food quantity are enough for one person. 16 friends went together and everyone agreed that 
~food quality - good
~quantity - Not enough for one person. You need to order two lunch/dinner for one person. Compare to the quantity, it's really expensive. 

I hope they improve their quantity of food.
