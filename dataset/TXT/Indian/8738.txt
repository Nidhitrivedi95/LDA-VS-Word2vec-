7xA6iSP0Ndn08tpBFQtUKA I was actually pleasantly surprised by this place! I went with my boyfriend on a Friday night for dinner and they seated us promptly. The service was friendly and nicely paced, the decor was nice,  the dishes were excellent (especially the paneer masala....mmmm), and the price wasn't bad (a little higher than my usual indian place, but not too pricy). Yes it could have been spicier, yes it could have had a few more beef options... 

...But it had KULFI and it was AMAZING! I first had kulfi (Indian ice cream) when I went to Dubai and fell in love with it, and was promptly disappointed by the lack of Indian restaurants in TO that offered it. My regular indian restaurant began serving it recently and I got all excited and I took one look at it and went "huh?", as it looked really weird and tasted weirder. That made me quite sad. But this place totally rekindled my love for it. If you like hard ice cream and pistachios - try it, I don't think you'll be disappointed. :)
