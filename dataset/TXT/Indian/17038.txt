DNSDAtD6uxQkoZkQe2v4ew Came here based on the Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! The center where the restaurant is a little bit run down so I was hesitant to walk in but we did. The restaurant was spacious, very nice decor and most importantly, clean! The staff was very welcoming and friendly, and the chicken vindaloo was delicious!
