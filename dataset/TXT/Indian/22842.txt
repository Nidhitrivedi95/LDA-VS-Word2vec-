grzKamxEuXTZrTkiztLQGg I'm afraid that while I am a fan of Babu, I'm not going to be quite as glowing as the others, only because I have been to Babu many times over the years, and I feel like it is not quite living up to its former reputation.
It's nice to see another renovation to enlarge the place, and a nice job they've done with it, too, plus they've also added a new Chef which they are proudly showing off in their front signage (see below), but sadly someone has to pay for these Renovations and their new chef, so prices have bumped up fairly dramatically over time.
The samosas and patties are still very good and very inexpensive, and all of the food is really quite delicious, but the prices now are creeping further and further northward, see the tooth very small containers, one of Chilli Chicken, and one of a chicken tikka, that were $5 bucks each for a very, VERY small portion.
Maybe I've become spoiled by all of the amazing Asian restaurants in Scarborough, Markham, and Richmond Hill, who seem to serve up HUGE containers of food for around $5 or $6 bucks, but it now feels like like I am not getting very much mileage for my money, when compared to not very long ago.
This was once a place with amazing food and amazing value, now food is still great value has just slipped from what it once was.
Babu is still a great place to get real Sri Lankan Tamil food, including amazing samosas  both meat and vegetarian, very cheap as well as some of the most flame-throwingly Hot dishes you can imagine, and the service is quick and very friendly, even if you are a rookie and don't know what you're doing.
Still love the place, but would like to see the portions get a little bigger, especially on the meat dishes.
