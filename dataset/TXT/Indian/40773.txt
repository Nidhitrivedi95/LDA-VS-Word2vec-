pX7ftE5CySOa-5cpuJl_ZA I called in and placed my order to go. I asked the nice man on the phone if the chicken biriyani was fresh. He said yes so I placed my order for carry out. The rice was not fresh. It was a few days old and chicken was not fresh at all. It was dried out and was cooked days ago. This was my first time trying Pastries "N" Chaat and the last time ever. I really like Indian food but I'll never eat again at Pastries "N" Chaat. I like my food fresh and  . I ordered from the North Scottsdale Pastries "N" Chaat location today and I'll never go back. It only takes one time for me. You lost me for life Pastries "N" Chaat. It's a small world and the food business is a serious business. Focus on providing chicken that is made to order and making sure the rice is fresh as well. I don't mind waiting 30 minutes for fresh food. Pastries "N" Chaat you really need to focus on the quality of your food and not trying to open franchise after franchise. Focus on making fresh food. Thank God for Yelp. People need to know my experience I just had. The worst Indian food ever.
