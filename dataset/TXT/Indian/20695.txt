g14SuHGkIL-2pSWhRkSSlQ Popped in on a quiet evening. We were the only customers in the whole place for the time we were there, which was just before closing on a Tuesday night.

We ordered Pani Puri, White Butter Chicken and the Meat Thali. Although we were the only people in the restaurant, the staff forgot to bring out parts of our order (such as the tea my partner ordered). Still they were friendly. I found their twist on the pani puris to be a little odd. The appetizer comes with three shots of different types of juice ("pani') that you pour into the puris. The serve yourself wasn't odd as much as the flavouring of the juice.

The mains are significant in portion. I've never had white butter chicken before, but I found it to be underwhelming in taste. A super filling, but mediocre dish. My partner had the Meat Thali. He seemed to enjoy most of the dishes on his thali. Overall, this place felt more gimmicky than authentic. The decor was fun, the service was friendly if not spot on, but the food was just okay in my books.
