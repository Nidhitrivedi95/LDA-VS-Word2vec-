pHSHm72bwR09Mt022CVvrw I've eaten at Taj Mahal several times and I've rarely been disappointed. That being said, today I was a tad disappointed. My wife had the buffet and I had had the puréed eggplant curry (Baingan Bharatha). I'd asked for a spice level of I/10. But what I got was felt a 5/10 to my palate. Another quibble--my wife found the Tandoori chicken from the buffet overcooked & dry. That apart, the rest of the cuisine was excellent as usual. Which is why they get 4/5 stars in my book.
