gTlDDzDEHyDQ6iwjNhpI6A No doubt about it, the best Indian food in Vegas. I've been coming here for years, from 1 to 5 times a week in my prime. My fav dishes are Lamb Jalfrezi, Lamb Tikka Massala and Lamb Rogan Josh, but over the years I've tried almost the entire menu. You can't go wrong. 

Wash this glorious food down with an ice cold Taj Mahal and you're golden.

Conveniently located just a few mins from the strip.

A 'must do' when you visit Vegas.

Enjoy!!!
