MjfgD6Okt4_PaOeYNZ-prQ This food here is very good , I live here but I've eaten Indian food in its adopted exported home ( London ) for 40 years and probably in 10 other countries too , I have always enjoyed the meals here but usually get takeout as I find the restaurant just to quiet ( you could hear a pin drop ) unless I'm bringing at least 4 people , the only other comment I have beyond enjoying the food is that it's over priced for the tiny portions but I assume their paying a lot for rent here , although the sq ft price of their rent shouldn't equate to the small portion size compared to other curry houses in Phoenix and scottsdale if they truly want to satisfy the clientelle .,  My second comment is general and not specific to this restaurant , and it's that only Indian restaurants in this country America ask you ( how many stars hot ) which I have to say I find bizzare and still laughable , they don't ask you this in a Mexican Reataurant ? vindaloo as we know is hot and Phall hotter and tikka masala is mild and you should never be asked how hot you want your curry dish as each recipe stands alone , Beyond those two comments I always enjoy the food here , pricey or not .
