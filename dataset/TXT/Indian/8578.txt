I have travelled to an extend of 100 kms to get the best taste of a Biryani, but somtimes you come off disappointed I discovered that Warrich Foods Markham has the best Biryani not just  in town, city or Provinçe.The Lamb or chicken biryani just melts  in your mouth..       best Biryani   .      , owner   !!
He is a very good guy. Best Biryani I have enjoyed since 1996.
