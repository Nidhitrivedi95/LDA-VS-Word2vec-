OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA If i was writing this review 10 years ago I would I give them 10 STARS, Lin Garden was our cheap comfort food place , hang out, and what not, but now, first of all we are all older and matured ( at least we think we are :)  ), this place does not appeal to me as much or at all anymore, and on top of everything the food quality has gone down drastically.

My wife just brought some takeout from Lin garden yesterday, because she went there with her friend from Ottawa who was in town, and she is in love with this place, as they don't have anything like Lin Garden in Ottawa, that being said if you are new to the Hakka scene, you should definitely try  Lin Garden, they still do better Hakka than most Hakka places in the GTA, but it is not like how it used be.

Our usual order

Chicken corn soup, ( ask to be be steaming hot)
Chili Chicken ( a must try )
Manchurian Fried Rice
House garlic Shrimp( used to be out of this world good ) 
House fried rice ( i think it is chicken and shrimp) 
Sweet and sour chicken
Manchurian chow mein  
Cheap beer :) 

They are also LLBO, and get really busy on some nights, especially on the weekends

so if you are in the Borough, it would be worth it to stop by

Thanks for reading 

PS. if yous are one of those, who treats their "body like a temple" then stay away, it is unhealthy on so many different levels,  just like any other Hakka food but once in a while it is yummy good :)
