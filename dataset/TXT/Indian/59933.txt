ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg I have been waiting so long for an Indian restaurant on this side of town, and let me tell you, it is delicious. They have a fantastic lunch buffet that has tons of variety, and only $10 per person. They even let you take it to go, which is great if you need a quick lunch on the run. Their lunch buffet has all the usual favorites and some of the selections change based on the day, which is nice. The most important part, the food is fantastic, with several vegan and vegetarian options which was great since we had a vegan person eating with us. The owners are very helpful and pointed out which items she would be able to eat, and even got her special bread, as the naan is not vegan. I did enjoy the garlic naan a lot, of course, and is made fresh to order even if you are getting the lunch buffet. If you are a fan of indian food, especially the spicy dishes, give this place a shot, I can see us becoming regulars here!
