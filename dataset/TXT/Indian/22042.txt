My buddy ordered their chicken sekh kabobs which were literally tasteless, I mean seriously no TASTE, seemed like chef completely forgot to add any spices to the meat before cooking it. 

I have been to this restaurant many many times but today's visit was very disappointing and total waste. I am definitely think twice before going back.
