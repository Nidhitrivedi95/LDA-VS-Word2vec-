scM6rLQqoz5dEIgwz_JFsg Wow! I ate here while on a business trip. I love Indian food, and this place is superior to my favorite places at home. The food is fresh and so flavorful, and the staff is beyond great.

I had the tandoori fish tikka, medium 3, and coconut naan. I can't wait until I'm hungry again so I can eat my leftovers! This food will haunt my dreams!
