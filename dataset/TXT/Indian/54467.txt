W_9ophRRWO924hn1S-y2Hg Ate there tonight and found it to be the best Indian food in the Madison area. The website stated it is under new ownership, so I was a little apprehensive but all of the food was outstanding. I went with an Indian friend and she agreed with the quality of the food. Highly recommended and I would definitely go back. We ordered off the menu,  so I can't speak to the quality of the buffet.
