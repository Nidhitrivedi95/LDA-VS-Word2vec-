RiPhiTDvmhqlF9BYWv8mtA I have walked past this place more times than I care to remember and been in for their £6 lunch buffets a few times. Every time I'm left a little less satisfied than when I went in........hungry, no... but still wanting more.
The food is what you would expect from a place like this, curries of all shapes and spices and a lot of vegeterian dishes. I struggled to explore anything past a Tikka - i'm a spice pussy.
the value is very good but there's just not that spark!
