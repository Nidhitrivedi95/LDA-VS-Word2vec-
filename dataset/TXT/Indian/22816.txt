Thank the gods my friend had been there before numerous times and could successfully decode the menu because it confused the hell out of me!  And keep in mind I am used to King's Palace.

This place is insanely cheap.  We walked away with enough take out to feed a small army for $33!!!

The food was tasty but did mad weird things to my stomach that night after eating it and even more so the next day.  It wasn't just that it was hot; spice is fine by me.  It wasn't that it was overly greasy either because it wasn't unreasonably so.  Still, something rocked my gut.  Upon investigation and discussion with fellow foodie friends, I hear I am not alone in my tummy troubles after Babu.

I may give it a second try, but I wouldn't stray too far from a loo if I did!
