MJlq5AuCkRjz31sKspxp1g They have Gujarati dish in the menu and trust me the taste is not even close to any Gujarati dish. 
Namaste veg is 100 times better when it comes to veg food. 
The quantity at OM is pretty less compared to the amount paid. 
Since it's close to my place, I tried close to 20 items   So far from their menu thinking one of their dish will taste better. The only dish I liked is spicy dosa. Sambhar is disappointing.
