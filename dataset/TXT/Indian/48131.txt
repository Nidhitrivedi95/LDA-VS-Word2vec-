The Parotta was good but not excellent: a bit small and not quite the right flavour compared to other Parotta I have had. The Rasmalai dessert is fantastic - although the presentation is nothing like the menu picture (no saffron strands) and suffers as a result.  I will definitely come again if I am in the area. For those new to South Indian food, it would be a great introduction, but those who are picky may not like it as much.
