dAQySRBaGOo8GNYsGaQy8Q Had a lot of trouble deciding whether to give this place a 3 or 4 stars, but I'll give it 4, but felt the food was more of a 3. The service was great.

Food, I'm a very meaty picker, so I wasn't very interested in the chickpea's nor was I interested in the vegetable/eggplant dishes. The buffet selection itself was small. They had butter chicken, lamb, and tandoori chicken. The food at the buffet was more warm than hot.

Their rice was...alright. It tasted just like regular rice, nothing special. I disliked the tandoori chicken because it wasn't really soft and settled on eating just the butter chicken. As for the lamb, it was good, just would prefer it to not have so much bones and to have the pieces cut a bit smaller. Their butter chicken was the best dish and the one I had the most of. Reason being, that the chicken was very soft, the cuts were bite sized. Their Naan was fresh (it goes out fairly quickly), but whoever made it, burnt the Naan on one side.  I didn't notice it was burnt until I flipped it around...-._-|| 

The sauce was flavorful, but it didn't feel like the spices were there compared to other indian places I've been to. 

For an AYCE buffet for 12.95 at lunch. I would say that considering the quantity of food, service from the waitresses (attentive and friendly), and location, I would return here again, but only if I am feeling super hungry.
