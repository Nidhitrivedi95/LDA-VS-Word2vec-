vZu3xxlMQSqFngDgdFLfXg I have been to other indian food outlets in Toronto and would rate Tamarind as the best. The food is very delicious and the staff is welcoming and friendly. I eat here quite often and the best thing I like about them is their willingness to get customer feedback and continiouly adding new varieties of Indian food to their menu..I would highly recommend it to people who have better sense of real Indian food..
