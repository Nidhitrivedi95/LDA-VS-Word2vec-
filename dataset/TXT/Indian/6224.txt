3LWsVfsSmb_Nzbi2YQ-NIA This is my new favorite Indian Buffet!!  Lots of choices! All fresh, hot and great spice.  People were nice and attentive.  If I had one thing negative to say it would be that it is hot and humid in the dining room. However, it's so good I don't mind sweating. 

This is my second time now and it is better than I remember.   The food is wonderful and it is not hot or humid.  Just perfect.

Once again (third time) I stopped while in Vegas.  The food is amazing.  I never saw the bottom of my water glass.  They were on top of everything.   I don't want to stop eating.  I think the people who write bad reviews are the owners of the other Indian food restaurants and are jealous.
