-8QlV3b_9H4BAh6LgMIr1g We've driven by there many times and saw that the restaurant had changed it's name. Since we saw a Groupon for them, decided to give it a try. We looove Indian food and always order the same dishes to "test the water". We ordered Chicken Saag and a smoked eggplant curry dish which I never know how to spell. We ordered medium hot and to us they were more hot than we are used to. Next time we will order mild. Service was prompt and friendly. Priced right and portions were good. It's a neighborhood gem.
