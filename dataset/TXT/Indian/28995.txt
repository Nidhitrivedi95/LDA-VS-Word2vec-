jCNBZnkIFv_0omLVTgNR6Q Amazing food! The view is awesome! Mani, our waiter, was great and Nikita too! Thank you guys for a great experience:). My friend Jill and I had a great dinner! And they had live music. On our way out we checked out the Hookah Lounge there. Beautifully decorated, gave me a great feeling just standing in the room. I plan on going there and night. I definitely plan on eating at the restaurant again! Thanks again.
