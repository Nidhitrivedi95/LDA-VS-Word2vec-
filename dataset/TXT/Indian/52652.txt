uXzHDmzG5mTcjP7IctinKQ Delicious lighter home-style food which is really refreshing in what is normally an overly greasy, heavy Indian food landscape. 

The chicken tikka was really tasty. Only complaint is some of the chicken pieces were a bit mushy (over-marinating?).

Bharta was nice and smoky and tasty. 

Saag paneer was particularly yummy with a mix of spinach and other more bitter greens to give it a bit more flavour. And thankfully it was light and fresh tasting. 

Daal was wonderful too, though was a yellow daal substitute for the black daal on the menu. No complaints though: it was delicious. 

Breads were nicely done too.

Pakoras very good to start and nice homemade tasting tamarind sauce. 

Rice pudding was so wonderfully lightly sweetened and relatively thin. No cloyingly sweet glop here!

Overall, I was really happy with the meal and good value compared to others!
