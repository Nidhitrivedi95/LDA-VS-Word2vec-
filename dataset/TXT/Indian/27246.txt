The grill's portions are very generous for a reasonable cost, $8.95-$12.95 for entrées. If you want it hot and spicy, they are happy to oblige. Great breads and sauces and not too long prep times. Yes, they are new and working out some kinks in the service, but I definitely see a lot of potential here.
