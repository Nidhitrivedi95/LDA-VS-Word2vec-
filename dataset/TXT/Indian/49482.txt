tV5PcOIFlB12dpcbCy78VA I went here the other day with a friend after reading all of the glowing reviews, but it was just ok! Sad day. The people who work here are very nice and friendly and the price really can't be beat, but the food was not the best I have had around the valley. We both got the buffet (of course) and it had high points and low points. I thought the lamb (or goat?) was a little tough (usually it's so tender from being cooked in the sauce all day....not really the case) and the same with the chicken. The chicken tikka masala sauce was really tasty though....gotta love that. I also liked that the buffet comes with mango lassi and chai tea...definite plus. I did not, however, like that they brought out the tandoori chicken to every table because I don't like tandori chicken and I felt really bad just leaving it there.... maybe they should ask first so they don't waste their food.... Anyway, the buffet is large and has a lot of variety, but the flavor just isn't as good as some other buffets....maybe I'll give them another shot sometime in the future, it could have just been the night...
