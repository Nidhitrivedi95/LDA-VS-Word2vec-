DKusRJUxgsye1cdrlGgQOg Excellent Indian food restaurant with a mostly vegan menu and a few vegetarian options. 

The cauliflower is not to be missed and is a reason to dine here in itself. 

The decor and location could be better, but the high-quality lunch buffet makes this a perfect anytime choice for a  local Indian or vegetarian meal.
