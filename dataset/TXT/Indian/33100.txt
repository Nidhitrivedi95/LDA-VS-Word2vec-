This and Tandoori Times 2 are super good Indian cuisine in this area.
I was a little skeptical when my boyfriend and I were seated. Right away they bought 2 dips (I think one was cilantro chutney) and poori (thin crispy bread - almost like chips) and poured 2 glasses of water. Super tastey! But it took a good 10 minutes for our server to come up to us. I finally asked someone if we could order and he thought we were already taken care of. Despite that the food was really good. We ordered Raita $1.95 and 2 orders of Vegetable Samosas $2.95 each. Very yummy! I ordered the Vegetable Korma $9.95 so good and my bf ordered the Lamb Curry $9.95. I think the prices are really good for the food. We also ordered 2 orders of naan which were $1.50 each. Overall great Indian food for a good price - will def return!
