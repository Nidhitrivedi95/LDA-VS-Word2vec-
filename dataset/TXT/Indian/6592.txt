Went here for lunch, party of 4. The restaurant was packed and there was one server. 

So we ordered 4 apps and 4 dosas. The food as always is exceptional. Love their dosas and chilly pakoras. They aren't badly priced to, at $10.00 for a dosa. If the review was for food only I would give them 5 stars. However, it isn't, it's for the experience.

One server, serving an entire restaurant and it wasn't pretty. Drinks confused or forgotten, 15 minutes for dessert and one forgotten, cutlery thrown at you, dirty spoons, filthy floors, the list goes on and on. We understand this is not the Ritz but for chrisssakes get another server. The poor guy was run off his feet. We left him a sizable amount for his trouble, after all it wasn't his fault, he was moving as fast as he possibly could.

Go here if you have an hour and a half to spare for what essentially should be fast food and be cautious of the spices, food can get really hot here (in a good way)
