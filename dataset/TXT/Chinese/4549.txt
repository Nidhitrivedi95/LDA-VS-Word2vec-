_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w The lobster or crab are brought to the table, for your approval prior to cooking it.  

Eight of us ordered:

The 6 to 8 person, 25 pound lobster mountain set which includes a decent bottle of white wine, snow pea shoots with goji berries, a corn, egg drop soup and a black sesame soup for dessert.

We also ordered 3 Heineken's and a lobster roe, fried rice. Total cost of the meal including tip, $509.00. 

The meal begins with the corn, egg drop soup. Followed by a piquant, succulent, chilli and crispy fried onions, garlic lobster mountain, set in a bed of lettuce. 

Some of the meat had a custardy texture, illustrating it's freshness. The under seasoned snow pea shoots and fried rice expertly compliment the flavour bomb that is the lobster tower. 

The restaurant offers a lively vibe. The service was friendly and most of the staff spoke English. 

Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is another example of overpriced, Toronto restaurants.
