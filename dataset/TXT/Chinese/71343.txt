fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A My friends and I usually come to KJ for dimsum just because it is less oily than other places. Their service is actually better than other Chinese restaurants, but their variety of dumplings are too small compared to their competitors. I wish they had a wider choice and a little more improved customer service.
