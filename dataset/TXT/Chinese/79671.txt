GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg I went here with Elise R. and it was nice to know that this place is a vegetarian restaurant, so we could eat anything from the menu.

It is nice to not have to ask for substitutions or worry about that when you are placing your order.

This place was relatively hard for us to find we had to call them to figure it out, although the address is marked as Steele's Ave, it is actually facing Kennedy, it is behind Pacific Mall, behind Market Village.

There was lots of room to be sit and you get a menu that is in English you write down how many of what you want and they bring it to you as the dishes start to get ready.

Food was flavourful, although their Spring Rolls could be better, I'm picky when it comes to spring rolls mostly because I've been spoilt by my parents who can make some pretty mean spring rolls.

Tea was included with our order which was nice (Jasmine Tea)

I will most likely go back if I am in the area,  it is a little out of my way but all vegetarian Dim Sums? why not? Lets go!
