imBVeP4aA-aLTdPD-t8_WQ Standard Americanized Chinese food, nearly the same menu as most other places. Convenient location between a few busy streets when you've just got a craving. Historically the hot and sour soup, as well as the egg drop soups are hot, soothing, and loaded with ingredients. Recently, the hot and sour soup was so gelatinous that parts of the what-would-be-liquid stood up on its own. So disturbing to imagine what it does to the body. Egg rolls and noodle dishes are more consistent.

Though there are a couple of small tables inside the door, this is definitely a carry out joint for me. I call ahead to avoid standing in the very small entryway against the people in the tables. Really, a place like this doesn't need much more so it's fine. They offer periodic coupons in mailings and menu after the bill hits a certain amount, if you remember to bring them with you!
