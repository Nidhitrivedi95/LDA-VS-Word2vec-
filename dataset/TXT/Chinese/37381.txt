anGYRueZJKYCJefKFccfjA If I'm not having hot pot at home or at a friend's house, this is the place to go. Very reasonable price, and true unlimited all you can eat experience. They have a constant supply of beef and lamb, and specialty hot pot items like fried gluten, pig intestines, and pork blood jelly. If you're into that, this is definitely worth a try. 
One only thing is you might need to make an little effort to get the server's attention if it gets busy. But they are polite, well mannered and provide good service whenever they can.
