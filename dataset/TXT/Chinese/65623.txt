eCJDiRPoSuA0bsb7F1gNUA Went in today ordered a beef and broccoli dinner combo and a small side of mo pao tofu , let me tell you the lo mein was so dry and burned, the beef was slimy and had a coat of flour I want to say which made it taste very weird. The mo pao tofu was OK. Big portion for a small. The egg roll and crab puffs were tasty but then you can never go wrong with that. I picked up so as soon as I got their it was ready. But over all the food is not the best and I played 15.30 which was a waste because I did not even eat half of it..
