SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ My coworker and I ordered a take-out @ 12noon, was told it'd be ready by 12:20pm, got there at 12:08, paid the bill and the food was ready!  Impressive, right?  Got back to the office, opened the Lettuce wraps that we ordered and disappointment rushes in.  We had two orders but we have ordered the same Lettuce wraps in the past and the container was fuller and the lettuce larger.  The container was less than half full, with a tablespoon of noodles!  What the heck?????  It was as good and tasty as it was in the past but the portion was very disappointing...
