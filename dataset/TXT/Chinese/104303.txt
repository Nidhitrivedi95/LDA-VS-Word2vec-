Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I was pretty put off by PF Chang's on my last visit. I am very sensative to spicy dishes and seeing that so many of the options were spicy was disappointing to me personally. I will admit some fault, I asked if the lemon chicken could be prepare not spicy, the waitress said "Yes" however when my meal came, it was spicy. I commented about it to the waitress and her comment was "no it's not" and did not even offer to get me an alternative dish. I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service. 

I have been to PF Chang's before and while the food was good, I don't think it's better than most chinese food.
