5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the local area.  Service is pretty good, staff is friendly and welcoming.  I usually order the eggplant mint dish with sliced beef at a spice level 8/10 and it always hits the spot.   Reasonably priced and filling portions.  
I have ordered delivery before and their service is on par too.
