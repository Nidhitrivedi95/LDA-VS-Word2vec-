_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w We got there at 3.30pm 6/23/17, we didn't make reservation but lucky, when we walked in, the manager served us right away.  And still lunch hour, so we got the better deal. This is our last day in Toronto, we hear about lobster tower a lot, here we are for a taste before head home tomorrow.
We got a lunch combo, lobster tower HK style 4.20 lbs, veggies with berry & lobster fried rice, plus a black bean desert.= total $88.00 Canadian currency including tips.   We have had a lot of lobsters cook in different style, and this one completely different.  SO GOOD...I don't know if I ever have a chance to come back, but it's worth for the trip after all the hustle freeway, traffic from Toronto downtown..For the price, I think it's pretty good deal.  Hope some info. will help your adventure with Lobster Tower.
