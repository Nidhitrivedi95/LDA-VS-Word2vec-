taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg I'm leaving here stuffed and happy, but not blown away. I had the lamb and corn dumplings(very good) and the pork &shrimp which were recommended as their most popular (honestly, pretty mediocre). I would recommend coming here with a few friends, there are several kinds of dumplings to try, so it's more fun when you can order more! Get here early though, it's very small and gets full during dinner time.
