pofDmHoIsdvPcSKzb2iMag Service is terrible. I asked for hot sauce four times to four different waitresses and it never came. Took 15 mins before anyone came by to give us our tea initially, and then another 15 mins for anyone to notice our teapot lid was open signalling we need a tea refill. Dim sum is not great and everything looks dirty (my spoon wasnt clean) and the serving trays and carts dont look clean. I dont know why it's always busy for dim sum and I dont why I keep coming back (i suppose for convenience when im already in chinatown and want dim sum) We were seated near the entrance and barely any carts came by - waited for chicken feet and shrimp rice rolls that never came.
