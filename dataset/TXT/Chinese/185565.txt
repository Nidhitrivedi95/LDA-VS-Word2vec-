y166Ve7c7y2EnnePytr71Q Tried this handmade pulled raman, liked the noodle texture and the tasty soup base, the beef brisket topping is delicious. Service is fair, wait time and noodle prices are reasonable. The appetizers (cold dishes) are pricey, taste so so and the portion is small, not worth to try.
