fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw I've lived in Vegas for 11 years, and of course have tried out numerous Chinese restaurants in town. 
This one is an absolute favorite of my partner and I. 
Not only are they very friendly and hospitable, but they are super quick! Especially with delivery. When we order delivery, it gets here so fast it's uncanny. Their portion sizes are very reasonable and the food is always fresh, hot, and tasty. 
I highly recommend this location for anyone looking for "real" Chinese food on the go. 
They also have some amazing lunch specials and and family deals. So even the price has a fair value to getting such great food.
