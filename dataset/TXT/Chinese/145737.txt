S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ We wanted something Asian, inexpensive, and quick.

I ordered the Hu Tieu noodle soup with assorted meat. My BF ordered the rice noodle plate with pork, fried yam, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and fish sauce. Overall, taste and quality were okay. The portions were huge though! Definitely worth your buck if you want quantity over quality. The spring rolls tasted okay as well. 

I've had better.
