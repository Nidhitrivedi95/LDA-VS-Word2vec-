PeLzCf2_GZlNZns2PLBueA I love this place!  I'm from Massachusetts and am used to hole in the wall spots that have great food. I am so happy I have finally found a place like that in Vegas! Great service, excellent food,  good prices, and good portions.  The boba and teas are awesome too I highly recommend this place. We ate there the first time and picked up a few orders. Hidden gem
