F7EuGx19ChOlv__ov2G9bw The service really turned me off from this place, the host is always the same guy and he doesn't show a lick of human emotion in his face.  I thought he could have at least appeared to enjoy his job.  The restaurant itself is pretty clean and peaceful.  The wait staff is very attentive, but not really personable.  The food itself was actually really good though, I had the veggie lo-mein and my friend tried the peppersteak.  I thought it was pretty great they mixed plenty of different kinds of peppers together and everything was fresh.  The quantity of the food was really lacking though, I left hungry.  That is ridiculous for a Chinese place, I usually have to leave with a box.
