jOMtqF2XnRgOZ2eOVLoxGA I was looking for a place to have some catfish fry. I came across this little hole in the wall on yelp and decided try it out. The Asian and Southern fusion style was what caught my attention. I couldn't decide what I wanted so I ended up getting the Bruce LeRoy (veggie fried rice with 3 fried whole wing) and a catfish sandwich.  I took it togo with the intension of eating it at my office but the food smelled so good I ate it in my car in the parking lot. The veggie fried rice was the best I have had and I ended up walking back into the business and ordered a large box. The whole wings and the catfish was fried perfect with just the right amount seasoning. This place will be on my list of regular places to eat.
