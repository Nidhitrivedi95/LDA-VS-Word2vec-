D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Just spent 4 days at Bally's and ate here twice.  Great food, the spicy dumplings on the menu are amazing.  Great noodles.  Service was fast and efficient. Was open late, which made it a great place to get a late night bite after losing at cards.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas.
