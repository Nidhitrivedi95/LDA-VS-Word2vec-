IImZFNzX4cP84rFsyb-9mQ Yikes...their standards have dropped yet again from 2 years ago.  I don't care about the price - it's going to be expensive - as another reviewer has mentioned, you're in Vegas.  Seriously.  

However, I ordered a BBQ pork w/ rice dish and the rice was over dry and the BBQ porked lacked any sort of sauce.  I was also given 2 dingy pieces of Chinese broccoli that was way overcooked.  

Overall, it was a very mediocre dinner.  I don't think I'd ever go again.
