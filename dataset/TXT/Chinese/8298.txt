1czIVv2iyOHc3WMgtUWXCQ I've dined in or order from Persuasian a few times. I really like it. I've had take out a couple times. Both occasions I went with an assortment of appetizers. I enjoyed the wontons, the pork dumplings, the chicken wings and the hot and sour soup. One cold afternoon, I stopped in and took a seat at the bar, which was crowded. Ordered their Pho. It hit the spot and filled me up. Decent selection of beers. Convenient and friendly.
