CSe9FpalbwGzQcp_h5BVxg Needed to have a quick dinner and the beautiful wife wanted to try a new Chinese place. Let's just say it was not all that good. 

Phoenix and dragon... Combo general tso's and spicy shrimp... Fried chicken parts with broccoli in watery sweet hot sauce with no flavor. Shrimp with ketchup sugar and red pepper flakes. Not good. 

Chicken with brown sauce... Fish fried chicken in sweet dark sauce with vegetables and peanuts. No flavor. Nothing redeeming. 

Beef with pea pods. Over salted and meat barely edible. Pea pods were ok.

Hot and sour soup was actually egg flour soup with vinegar and chili flakes added. The cornstarch was a noticeable ingredient. Not good. 

Ordered brown rice. Was not fully cooked dry and not edible. 

The front counter person was attentive and nice. So it was not a total loss, except for a waste of money.
