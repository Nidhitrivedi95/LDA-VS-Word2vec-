3PsmvwxetLz1Tzb-6mNhgA I love this place. Everything from the decor to the service to the food. Their lettuce wraps are absolutely amazing. I wish they served it as an entree.

I highly recommend (aside from the lettuce wraps) their chicken dishes, lo mein, Dan Dan noodles, or pad Thai. You truly can't go wrong, unless you get one of their more "Americanized" dishes. But that may be just me. Their portion sizes are huge which is a plus.
