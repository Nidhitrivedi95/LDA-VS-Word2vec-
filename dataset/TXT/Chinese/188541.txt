yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Been here a few times and it seems to me that their food begins to suck more and more each time. Their egg rolls are small and not fresh at all, the lettuce that goes with it were soggy and old lettuce. My combination pho had absolutely no tripe in it and the broth was just bleh, dont ever think ill be returning back. but for once the server checked up on us more then usual, that was the only plus.
