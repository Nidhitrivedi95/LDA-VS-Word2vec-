PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ If you are ever wondering off the strip and have a craving for shabu hot pot then look no further. At first, I was skeptical since it was just me and Dad at the restaurant at first but more people trickled through out the meal. The server came by frequently to refill our waters and add broth.  The dishes of meat are perfectly portioned and  the quality is top tier. The meats are thinly sliced and well marinated. It does help that there is a wide variety of sauces to choose from and different foods too. I was fond of the sauce station where you could control the amounts and types of ingredients to select from.  I was very impressed and the price you simply cannot beat for all you can eat at mid-day. 
You can let the server know if you want hot, spicy or a not spicy chicken broth or 2 of the 3 split in a pot. I highly recommend the squid, tripe, fish fillets, shrimp, thinly sliced beef, fish cakes, soft tofu, Asian vegetables, and the pork belly. I hardly touched my water cup until the end. If you are not stuffed quite yet then you can either get a bowl or a few spoonfuls of the broth. Its quite tasty especially since the marinated meats were cooked in it during the course of the meal.
