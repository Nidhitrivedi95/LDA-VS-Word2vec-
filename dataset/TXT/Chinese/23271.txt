6SfNZP1oqiQV1AYLK9A8WA Only been to this location twice. First time I came, they closed 45 minuets before the listed time. I was successful to get wings my 2nd visit. I ordered mild but was sweating while I consumed them. I think they just made one sauce for mild through their hottest. I'm still a fan of Long Wongs but not this location.... Sticking with Thomas and Scottsdale
