OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Chang's isn't amazing, but it satisfies your dim sum cravings. I believe they serve dim sum from opening til 3pm. I went today and it was fine for the most part. However, when I received my honey walnut shrimp.. it was not even warm. So they lost a star for that. Also, service isn't the best. But you can't really expect much from them. I feel like having to wave down your server is pretty standard at a Chinese restaurant. Other than that, I got my siomai, shrimp noodle, and shrimp ball fix.
