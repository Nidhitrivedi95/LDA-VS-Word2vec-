GeeR1ScER2WpFoJs1sTjsA This place is criminally underrated. It's Chinese fast food, set your expectations correctly. However, they have some fantastic dishes. They are priced very fair, and great for on the go with their drive thru. Staff is very friendly and happy to let you sample as many different dishes as you like. The food is rotated regularly and never left to sit out all day. This is one of my regular stops every Sunday after attending Journey Church down the street. I wouldn't come here looking for PF Changs, but they definitely beat your average Chinese delivery place.

I have no clue what they ever did to deserve such a low rating. I have been coming here for months on a regular basis, and have never been disappointed.
