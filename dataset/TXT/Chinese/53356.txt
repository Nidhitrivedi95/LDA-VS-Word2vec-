CO8MpD1bSkBPArXKBKkIfA Went here for the first time with a friend this past weekend.  Really enjoyed my dish however, they seemed to have some sort of mix up because after waiting 10 minutes on it I had to go back and check it and they remade it for me. Not sure how they ended up giving it to another customer or if it was taken by one while I was waiting but I'll still gladly visit them again. The portions are just right and when it comes down to water matters most, taste and quality of food, I had no issues.
