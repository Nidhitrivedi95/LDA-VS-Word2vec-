PzdI7yM9GrufH6oavO6odg Dine in order: chicken lo mein was favorite, Mongolian beef a really good also. Sesame chicken had good flavor but breading a bit thick. Shrimp with lobster sauce was barely ok. All a lunch special with egg drop soup, cream puff and egg roll. Those 3 items made the meal better than average.  Didn't have any boba milk tea...
