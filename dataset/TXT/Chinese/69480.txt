eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg I can't speak for the actual restaurant since we are always picking up the food to go but we love it and it's prepared so quickly! They're always nice over the phone and give good suggestions but our favorites are the lunch specials, which come with 2 cream cheese wontons and an egg roll. We usually get chicken fried rice, chicken lo mein and orange chicken. All great and our go tos!
