jDZJsIyc3jXjcTtJk_p8ZA "Express" is a good way to describe this. The speed of service here is sometimes a bit faster than McDonald's, Chipotle etc. 

If you are in the mood for something light - I would highly recommend the Curry Scallion Pancake. 

I thought they were really good value for money until recently when they increased their prices. 

They have a lunch menu where they give you an entree, an appetizer (Vegetarian Spring Roll or Chicken Teriyaki) and rice for $7.99. :)

Although the quality of food is not that great, I would go back there - especially when I have a test the next day and need to spend every minute cramming.
