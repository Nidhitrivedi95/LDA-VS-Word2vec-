-_DxZ8gKU50sfuZEu4ypKg The manager here is a cool guy.  I like when he is the person sitting guests and bringing the check, etc.  The rest of the staff was just ok- we sat for a while waiting for water refill and dishes to be taken.  The food is better than average, and it has all the right Vietnamese essentials.  I highly recommend the combination Bun, it's really good: pork spring roll, roasted pork, shrimp, rice noodles, sweet chili vinegar sauce, lots of vegetable garnishes and peanuts.  The pho is good too.  Outside seating is a nice plus.  The only drawbacks for me were the price (although higher prices should be expected in that area) and the atmosphere is a little blah.  But a nice place for someone craving Vietnamese in downtown CLE
