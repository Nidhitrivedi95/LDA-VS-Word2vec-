WqXrmUVy5Ay3Scn4GPM9Ug Not enough food!
We went today to this place since it had 4 stars, it is an amazing place, staff was really nice, the lunch menu did not have that many options, so we were already not impressed. When the food came in ohhh dear we just look at each other like "where is the rest?", one of my friend said that it was an Inappropriate serving size lol.
The food was bland, nothing amazing or worth the price! 
I don't know why this place has 4 stars. We were left hungry, we had to go somewhere else to eat. 
Never going to this place again!
