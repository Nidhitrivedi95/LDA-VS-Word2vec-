zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Fantasitc food and service! I ordered the ginger scallion noodles and they were perfect, buttery and full of flavor!

My only qualms with recommending this place are that it's not very clear what items are vegetarian/vegan. We had three different employees tell us three different things about which items were acceptable for a vegetarian/vegan to eat and it seemed like there was a lot of confusion as to what contained fish sauce and what didn't.
