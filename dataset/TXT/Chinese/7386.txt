0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Some of the food here is FANTASTIC, and some seems to be a hit or miss, like the crispy beef. I will however say that the crispy eggplant was the BEST eggplant dish that I've ever had in my life or even dreamed possible!!! 
Also their fried rice and soups are great and portions very generous.
