qSzICKCd041EdjjGNgMYrQ Crown Jewel Fine Dining is a new Chinese Cantonese restaurant that replaces Sam Woo Seafood Restaurant at Bamburgh Circle.

A much needed renovation resulted in a more open and brighter dining environment. 

Price point for dim sum is at the higher side: S ($2.80) M ($3.80) L ($4.80) XL ($6) SP ($8) J ($9.80) but it is a baragin during Early Bird Special: $2.80 S/M/L before 11 am everyday!

We ordered a few items to try, most of them were well made with high quality ingredients and nicely plated.

Har Gar (L) - excellent, jumbo shrimps with excellent bite
Sui Mai (L) - excellent, caviar didn't add much taste but looks good for photos
San Tau Dumpling (M) - The wrapping is a little doughy 
Beef Balls w/veg (S) - I prefer the bigger balls and water chestnut version for more bite
Chicken Feet (M) - The sauce is well flavoured and the braised feet is soft and nice
Deep Fried Pork Dumpling (M) - Looks pretty but just too doughy with hardly any fillings
BBQ Pork Rice Roll (M) - The pork was just too lean/dry and healthy , meh


Sadly, I didn't take advantage of the Early Bird Special and ended up paying full place but still worth it.

Service is attentive and friendly. 

I will be back to try out other interesting items on the dim sum menu during Early Bird Special!!
