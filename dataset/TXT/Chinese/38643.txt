AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Been here twice now, once dine in and once take out.  First time we dined in we ordered veggie dumplings, veggie spicy crispy beef, scallop pan fried noodle and Thai Tom Yum soup.  Everything was awesome!  I liked my pan fried noodles more than his crispy beef but it was still so good.  We also ordered Vegan ice cream desserts which ended our meals with full bellies and not as much guilt.  Our servers were great also, she was recommending things and talking to us about being vegan.  She was telling us how she was Vegan 80% but has a small piece if fish every once in a while.  I'm currently in the same boat where I'm slowly going vegan but have meat/dairy once in a while.  They made us feel very comfortable and constantly checked up on us/ cleared out empty plates throughout our meal.  When we returned and ordered take out, at least 3 servers came up to us to ask us if anyone has already helped us, even Chef came out to take a look outside and mentioned to us how great the weather was today.  Food was prepared and brought out to us quick and thanked us for coming by.  Our take out lunch specials were General Tzo chicken and the curry/potato chicken.  Again, I liked my general chicken better than his curry but again, both were good.  *they have a Groupons available every once in a while so be on the lookout for those.
