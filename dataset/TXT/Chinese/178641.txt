X4CRPHvv-33kjxVJISZpUg This place is near Pitts and CMU, so the location is very convenient for students. I had been here for a dinner, and I ordered black pepper beef. I think the price of dinner dishes is pretty high, compared to the lunch specials. And the flavor is just on average level, since the black peper seasoning is uninteresting. The service is slow after I made my order, it took me 15 minutes to wait for my dish. Also, I spent another 10 minutes to wait for my payment. In light of the poor service quality and the expensive price tag, I will probably not return here again.
