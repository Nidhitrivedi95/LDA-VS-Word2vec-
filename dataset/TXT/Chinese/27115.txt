7zQejWAhY4v4LXHR6bY7dg The poorest dining experience I've ever had for years, and this was the first time ever I had never left any tips, firstly we've been waiting in line for 20 mins, which we don't mind and giving this is a fairly new res, but no one was greeting us or give us any number and then they ends up confusing them-self of which one comes first, then we waited 45 mins for our XIAO long bao to come....taste is not bad but not impressed as well, <U+814C><U+7B03><U+9C9C> is definitely a No no, looks like homemade....and it also taste like too much cooking wine was put in the soup as well, then our <U+516B><U+73CD><U+8C46><U+8150><U+7172>is stir fried....not even in the hot bowl which supposed to be and the dish is cold!!! Or I should say not warm at all!!!!.... And the most funnest thing is I ask the waiter for the vinegar for the xiaolongbao, and the response is"steal from the table beside u" Lmao, so to sum up, worst Chinese res ever, definitely not recommended!!!!!
