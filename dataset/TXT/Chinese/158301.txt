TYEQ38ONpmYMYv378IByhw I've been here a couple of times and service has always been pretty much on par with most Asian places: fast and no nonsense.  

We waited a little longer tonight.  They had to fulfill all those Christmas dinner orders.  People lined up carrying large boxes of bags and bags of take out.  

Our go-to dishes:  beef fried rice noodles with bean sprouts and Cantonese fried noodles.  No complaints.  Good portions and well-made.  

We had a slight issue with payment.  I do think it was our own fault with a certain level of miscommunication. 

We were offered dessert!  Whaaaaat???  Two people and we get dessert?  Nice.  I politely declined though.  It was some sort of peanut and squash business.
