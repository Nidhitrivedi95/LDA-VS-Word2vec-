C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ I don't think I have ever gone to a Chinese restaurant and liked everything I ordered besides Szechuan Gourmet... 
This place is equal, if not better then Szechuan Gourmet !
MOST: you have to order the crispy Ginger beef! It's soo addictive, I could eat the whole dish myself! Every piece of beef was excellent and lots of flavour. Almost like candy I loved it so much!
The vegetable spring rolls were a fare size, bigger then average Chinese joints and the plum sauce is your average tasting sauce, which I like. Some homemade sauces taste very strange if you're not used to them. 
The sweet and sour chicken balls were ever so soft and the sauce didn't taste like pour ketchup either. That bugs me so much, I could just take a bottle of ketchup and pour it on myself! Spadina Garden has a nice tasting sauce.
Vegetable fried noodles has no surprising veggies, but were a bit bland.. Could use a little more kick.
The only thing I didn't like that I ordered was the general Tao's  chicken, only because the chicken was all dark meat. If you want white meat you have to ask for it, which I will do for next time.
I will be coming back to Spandina Garden!
PS DON'T FORGET TO ORDER THE CRISPY GINGER BEEF! (:
