xVHzCbDWCwmyavF5PgJRmg Great place to eat! Super cheap and wonderful place to lookout. Right on the intersection and top floor you can see a lot of things. Food was great. One of the best Chow Mein in the city. Upstairs is really quiet so it's great to go for a quick quiet lunch or dinner. Rarely gets busy.
