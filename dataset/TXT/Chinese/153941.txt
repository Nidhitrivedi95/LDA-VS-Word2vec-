TcKQgA509ffYhQnmaOrwjQ Really disappointing food and dreadful atmosphere. Ordered the soup with Peking duck and noodles. The broth was bland and the duck meat over-powering. Enjoyed the birds nest with seafood, minus the undercooked onion pieces. The chicken with cashews was not very appetizing. The chicken pieces were very tiny and greatly outnumbered by the other ingredients.
