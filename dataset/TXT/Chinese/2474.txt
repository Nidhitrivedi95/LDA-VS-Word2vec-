_c6CpqB2d1L7kbSVbE9HAw This place is a joke. I write this review as a warning to all. My family ordered the combo for 3 which included beef and chicken. We did delivery. After we opened it they gave us two containers of celery with 3 pieces of tiny meat in it each. I called them to see if they would give me what i ordered. They said essentially too bad all of our meat dishes are 80% vegetable. She went on to tell me that i was the one who said i didnt want any onions. As if giving me 2 bowls of celery AND ONIONS would of made up for the fact that there was no chicken in my cashew chicken or beef in my szechuan beef. What a joke. She said every single chef can verify that they counted my pieces of meat. Riiiiiiiight. What a joke. I was totally pissed. 40 bucks and every one in my family went to bed hungry.
