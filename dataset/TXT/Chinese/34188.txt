ABRgXNwdOX_JyqChNr8IYw I have my favourite Chinese restaurant on Spadina, and so do a couple of my friends. So it's inevitable that I would have eaten here a couple times. What I don't understand is how this is their favourite.

In my experience, the food here always tastes too sweet. Especially bad was the Hot and Sour soup, and General Tso's Chicken. The soup is probably the worst I've had in Toronto, and had a ketchup flavour to it. The chicken was bland. 

To be fair, I did like the Fukien fried rice I had here.

People seem to love this place, but to me there are better options on the same street.
