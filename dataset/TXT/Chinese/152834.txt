T5iVkzBXvG5cG6de_TMquw Love love love the house special beef.  I try to frequent this restuarant weekly.  It is my preferred Chinese place to eat.  The waitress is so darn sweet.  The food comes really fast.  I can never seem to get enough of the House Special Beef.  It rocks!  It is on the pricer side of the menu however after the first taste, I was hooked. And there always seems to be plenty of leftovers for the next day as the portion sizes are great.  The only bad thing is the initial serving of rice is small.  But they do bring more upon request.  The potsticker are on the small side but the sauce that comes with it...delish!
