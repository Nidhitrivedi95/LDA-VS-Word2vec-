aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg I walked in at Asian BBQ & Noodles and I saw pork and duck hanging - a positive sign of good authentic Chinese food.  Everybody who was eating here were Chinese and some Vietnamese.  The servers were speaking to me and my sister in Chinese and it felt like Beijing all over again.  It's a tiny place that seats 50 people.

We ordered roast pork, yang chow fried rice and Chinese broccoli since we weren't too hungry.  The traditional Chinese restaurant would serve you dishes one at a time and it's usually the quickest one to prepare is the one that gets served first.  So, we got the broccoli then the roast pork.  We were dying to eat the pork already since the skin looked so crispy and delicious...but we had to control ourselves and wait for the rice.  It didn't take long.  The broccoli was fresh.   The pork was super crispy and succulent - honestly, the best pork from a Chinese restaurant in Vegas!  I was very pleased and all I could say to myself was "HAOCHI! HAOCHI!" (delicious).  The fried rice had a lot of stuff in it: chopped green veggies, eggs, BBQ pork and shrimps.  

We took a BBQ pork rice bowl to-go.  I tried a piece and it was delish!  Their food is inexpensive too!  It's like $6-7 for a rice bowl and you get a lot of food.

If I was blown away by one dish, I can't wait to try the other items on their menu!  I'll definitely try their roast duck and something else next time.  Other Chinese restaurants in Vegas marginal roast pork. There's a particular place with a type of flower in their name that microwaves their roast pork making the skin gross and chewy.  I'm also not concerned with the use of MSG...in China, they give you a small saucer of MSG!  I never get headaches from it so I don't care!
