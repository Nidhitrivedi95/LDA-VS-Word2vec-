zI-CqEm-qmkTY3WdhPlXgQ Do you love pho? Do you live in the Northwest Valley? Yes? Then why are you wasting your time and gas driving to Chinatown?! You can get your fix here. The pho here is amazing. I usually use a generous helping of chili and hoisin sauce wherever I pho, but let me tell you I loved the taste of the broth so much here there was no need. Throw in an order of those deliciously porky ground pork rolls wrapped up with the vegetables and fish sauce to dip in and you are good to go! The restaurant is very clean and the service is very friendly, not like a lot of the establishments you will find on Spring Mountain, which is a definite plus!
