-BSf1LtnOrtCWAzmumxUpw Chatime regular here.  Drinks are as good as the other branches.  Only problem I have with this one is one of their new employees.  Everything was fine until he got hired.  Always gets my order wrong and I have to repeat myself atleast 3 times, and when I want to collect my points for a drink,  he still charges me full price.  Another time a coworker and I wanted to get a drink we got charged the same price when hers was a small and I got a large?  Other than that guy being incompetent, good place overall.
