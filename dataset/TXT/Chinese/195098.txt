zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ I don't understand what all the hype is about ! I read about Momofuku on Yelp and I also saw a feature on it on 60 Minutes. That being said, I have yet to eat at a fusion joint that I like so maybe this was a sign. I met up with a pal here on a rainy Saturday for lunch. It was pretty crowded considering the terrible weather. We sat on the high chairs facing the line cooks. 

As a starter, we ordered the jar of kimuchi. I have had better kimuchi for half the price. For my main, I ordered the chicken ramen. Once again, for half the price, I've had better ramen. This place tries way too hard to be 'cutting edge' and 'unique' that the food was a solid two star for a Yelp'er like myself. 

I like the location and decor of this place, but that's about it.

Good for: checking d/t restaurants ...
