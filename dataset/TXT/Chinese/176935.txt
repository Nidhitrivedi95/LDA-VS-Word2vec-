WTuBrN0z2h7xvTaP7eN_XA Yes I am coming to Royal Teahouse for dinner instead of dim sum.

They do have set menu where you can pick 2/3/4/5 courses from a specific menu and the more you order the cheaper the cost per dish. There are over 40 dishes you can select from so there must be something for everyone.

I found the dishes here are sizable so we were full even ordering the 2 dish set meals. 

The staffs here are one of the friendest one I meet in term of Chinese restaurants.

They accepts Visa and Mastercard.
