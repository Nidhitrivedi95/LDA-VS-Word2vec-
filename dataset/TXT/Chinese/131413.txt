Pj9DDbTmjBEKXezLb0qmTw First time- walked in and was instantly greeted. Server offered up suggestions and gave descriptions for the beverages. I got the Tea Tarik and my friend got the pineapple water. Tea Tarik was a nice milky tea without the sweetness. The pineapple water was sweet and very refreshing. Upon ordering the server offered up some suggestions for the Nasi Lemak to switch out the fried chicken for the honey chicken. Great dishes and will be coming back to especially try their other unique drinks.
