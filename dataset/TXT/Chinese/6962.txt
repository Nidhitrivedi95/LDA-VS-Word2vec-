0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw The gf and I continue to search for our "go to " places in the neighborhood.  In that this is basically the only Chinese place less than a mile from the homestead and they deliver, we walk in with fingers crossed.

ordered

Hot/Sour soup (bowl- $5)
BBQ Pork ( $7)
honey walnut shrimp ( $12)

gf orders her "good girl" chicken and steamed veggies ( I believe cost for both under $12)

The soup was decent and a decent serving.  The pork was also a generous serving and we believe it was the pork loin so a good cut of meat.  I enjoyed the shrimp more than she did - we agreed it was above average.

gf was very happy that the chicken/veggies were properly prepared.  unfortunately, she tasted the honey shrimp and pork and that opened the flood gates !  The chicken and veggies were quickly placed in a to-go container and the girlfriend orders the citrus beef ( I think that's what it's called - cost less than $10) and it's over - she wolved most of that down ( btw - we agreed that was our fav dish of the night ) 

I'm stuffed but again, the gf just warming up - she decides we need  dessert ( the only item I finally got around to taking a picture of ) Banana/nutella egg roll with ice cream (we picked red bean ) - very good !  

Service was timely and attentive, then again, a little worried that we were the only people there at 7:30 pm on a Friday ( they did have several to-go orders while there ) 

Overall, we were very please and will consider this our local Chinese spot.
