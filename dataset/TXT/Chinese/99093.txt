Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ This place is great. Seriously, every time my boyfriend and I are hungry on Sahara, Orchid Gardens is our go to place. I don't know why more people give this place five stars. We always end up eating more than our fill on delicious dim sum and our bill has never been more than $29. Good food, good variety, and good prices.
