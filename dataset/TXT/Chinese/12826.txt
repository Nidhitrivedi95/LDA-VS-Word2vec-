Cheap + Fast + Authentic = Perfect quick meal.

Don't expect amazing service. All they want is to feed you and turn turn tables. I don't mind because I'm only there for the food anyways. If you want a quiet atmosphere, bring earplugs.

If you are in a rush, order the noodles/congee.... Less than $5 for a meal and it'll come out within minutes.
