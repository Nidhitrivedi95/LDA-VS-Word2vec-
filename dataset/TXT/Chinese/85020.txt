HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant. The food is consistently amazing. The staff is very friendly as well. We called in an order for The General's Chicken, house noodles and rice. They had it ready to go within 10 mins of us waiting. Oh,  and it's very reasonably priced too.
