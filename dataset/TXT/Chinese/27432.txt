8C65DwwnazwYB2z9naHyaw I really want to give Golden Mountain a 3 star review but have really struggled with the food here.  The service is good, restaurant is clean, open, and inviting but the food really does struggle.  My 3-5 staples that I base Chinese restaurant reviews on, as you would see with Hunan East, are 1) Egg Drop, 2) Hot and Sour, 3) Lo Mein, 4) Crab Rangoons, 5) Egg Rolls or a standard dish such as Beef w/ Broccoli.  I have never gotten consistency here. 

You might be asking why do I base my review on those items, well its simple.  Think of the percentage of all customers going into a Chinese restaurant that are going to order one or more of the items above......pretty high huh.  Now if those items do not come out of the kitchen hot, consistently delicious, and spot on to expectations, what would that say about their other food, specifically their dinner plates?  Ex.  I have a place in Grand Rapids Michigan that I would drive an hour just for their egg rolls, they are that good.  Those alone made me go back again and again.  Am I being too anal??  Food review is below.

Their egg drop CAN be good; once it was like jello, once was cold with no salt added, and the other it was perfect.  Their lo mein has really skinny noodles, almost like rice noodles that just stick together and have no flavor (comparing to the standard lo mein noodle).  Where are the ingredients?  Crab rangoons have little stuffing, can be really oily, and just can't compare to Hunan East.  As for the other items listed, its just no up to snuff in my eyes.  But they do have a following and it seems to busy on most days, but I think that's only because the patrons there haven't tried my favorite on Richmond Rd.
