lXZvgVmIz-ko1OiCG-VDTw If you love soup dishes and want a great deal on ramen, this is the place for you. Food is always good, the staff is always friendly, and plenty of choices. Plus they are right across from the building they are moving coffee, tea, and snow into, which is a great place to grab a cool treat. So all in all 1 star for location, 2 stars for food, 1 star for service, and a final star for choices and price.
