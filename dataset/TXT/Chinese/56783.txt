d_oEgPEL7jaMVDBsRf2t-A DURIAN PANCAKES rock!  Durian is a fruit, Pancake is a dessert therefore a FRUITY DESSERT.  This is the only place I know that has a Durian dessert in the GTA.

WHY do I come for Durian dessert?  Do you really want to bring Durian home and STINK up the joint?

The Pancake is a thin cold wrap that holds WHIP CREAM inside.  In the middle of the cream is Durian meat and all it takes is that small amount as it is so CREAMY its like Ripen Banana but less SLIMEY.

This place opens in the EVENING and thats the perfect time because after having Durian Pancake, you probably want to avoid any place public because the SMELL of it will be KO lights out for others.

Some people are known to be addicted to Durian and there are many varieties and people get picky over the kinds they will eat even at more cost.

This place is actually an Open Patio-like setting that opens up to the inside of the Mall so every passer-by can be TEASED by your odour.  The secret is that the person eating it won't smell it, so make sure you're the one of the group having it or else SUFFER like the others.
