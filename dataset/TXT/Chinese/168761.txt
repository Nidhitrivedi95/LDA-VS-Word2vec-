Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA This place is such a find! Have been here many times and literally everything is amazing!!! The pad Thai is the best I've ever had and the beef pho with garlic is killer. Also love to order the panang chicken for lunch, super tasty! Make sure you don't order it too spicy because they don't mess around when it comes to spice. I love spicy food but find myself at about a level 3 for spice when I'm here. Definitely a gem!! It's kinda of out of the way for us but soooo worth the drive!!!
