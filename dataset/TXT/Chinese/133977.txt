q-3Q3t3RS4qiW51fDIEvyQ Wow! This place was pretty disappointing! At 7pm the food all seemed dried out and like it had been sitting there for hours! When they did bring out fresh it was only maybe two spoonfuls of the item. So my fried and I could never both try the fresh serving unless we rushed when we saw the lady carrying out the tray which didn't work well with other customers wanting to try the fresh serving as well!
