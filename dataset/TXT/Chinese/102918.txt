Kig-T7wfebjGIpgSKcdlKA I'd have to agree with the other reviewers about this Pho joint, they have all the elements of a classic Vietnamese restaurant, but flavour intensity is lacking the punch that you'd expect from this unique asian cuisine. I came in on my own on my lunch hour and was greeted by a guy wearing a baseball cap who appeared to be the owner. He winced when he realized I was on my own, and after the place filled up and a lineup formed I knew why he preferred full tables, this place is popular!
I would consider this more like Vietnamese fast food. I ordered the beef Pho along with some greasy spring rolls. I didn't ask for hot chill oil, but they did have a squirt bottle of Sriracha sauce on the table, good enough I suppose.
The beef Pho was ok, but after eating at Pho Hung on Spadina I realize that making this type of food delicious must be more difficult than it appears.

I'm still on a search for a Vietnamese restaurant that offers a couple of unique items that I've only had out West, lemon pepper shrimp and wings, and bread rolls, along with cheap pre made ice coffees that you can drown yourself in. I'll keep searching!
