xyyLHodMgcAwon4EeRT_jg Great authentic Chinese food! The menu is HUGE and a bit overwhelming , they have divided it into regions from where dishes are from. 
We were tired and overwhelmed with the menu so ended up getting the set menu with a few substitutions  ... And while it was delicious I think we got the "white Scottish " Chinese food options haha because everything was fried! Like I said all  delicious but I don't think very authentic... Haha I walked passed a bunch of other tables with lovely looking fresh dishes that I think I will try next time! 
Despite our food all being fried we really enjoyed it all and are planing on going back , just ordering more of the fresh non-fried options! ;) 
Very formal seating , good prices and very friendly !
