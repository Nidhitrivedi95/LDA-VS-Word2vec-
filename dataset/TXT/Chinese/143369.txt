rntKF4Dm9JIJoSNi5XqRsQ Went there at 3pm. The restaurant wasn't busy. The food came very quickly.  We order pork, beef, lamb dumplings, onion fried pancakes... All was very delicious, very juicy and fresh. Big portions and very cheap.
Stuff was ok. Not too friendly. And restaurant was dirty. Floors and tables need a wash.
