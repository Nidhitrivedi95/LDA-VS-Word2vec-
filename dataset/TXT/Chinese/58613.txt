DDAGwRR0SypD47XD7-ytjA -Friendly service, very attentive, slow to bring bill.

-Food was average, a bit on the extreme salty side.

-Prices were a bit high, but they offer evening dinner specials for $6.99.

-Server talked us into ordering the Wonton soup-Large was $7.95 with skimpy portions (a few wontons, sliced chicken, tough beef, 2-3 shrimp, half cup of cabbage) and lots of bland broth. Not worth the price.

-Restroom clean, but no soap in Women's restroom.

-Decor was very nice.

-Parking is very convenient.

-Next door to a Barber shop.
