PM0A7ZgbxvtbRCj931PbyQ For $30.00 per person and the drinks is not included, no ice-cream and the dessert is a joke! You should go and eat somewhere else. They said lobster is included but it's always empty. I didn't even see any lobster at all. Before this restaurant used to be cheaper and more selection but since they raised the price the quality of the food is horrible. I will not be coming back.
