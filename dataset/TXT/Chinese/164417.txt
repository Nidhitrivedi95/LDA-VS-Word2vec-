UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ I've eaten here 3 times and it never disappoints. The dishes are served family style with a large pot of white rice on the side. My go-to is the spicy eggplant (I don't eat meat) and it's seriously SO good. I can't attest personally for the meat dishes, but my mom is currently RAVING about the sizzling peppered beef dish. She says it's the most tender beef dish she's ever had at an Asian restaurant. Overall, the waiters are attentive and helpful, the food came out FAST and hot, and the experience overall was nothing but positive.
