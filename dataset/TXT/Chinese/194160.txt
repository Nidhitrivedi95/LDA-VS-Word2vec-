Overall the food was decently good, better than Pei-Wei, Panda Express, and those chain restaurants.  Quick service, friendly. 

Hot and Sour soup was too watery and too sweet and not enough sour. 
Steam rice was cook correctly, not dry from sitting around too long.
Mongolian beef was good. Meat was tender and not overcooked.
Cashew chicken was excellent, vegetables not overooked and limp but firm and crispy.
Teriyaki chicken was also good, lots of meat, chicken tender, not too much sugary flavor. 

Plenty of food for the price.

My biggest complaint would be not enough spices, chili pepper, or heat in general. Need to kick it up a notch.

Would eat here again but ask for more chili.
