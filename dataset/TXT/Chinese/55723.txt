cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ I LOVE this place since it opened, the quality is pretty consistent. This is the only chinese restuarant i would go in cleveland. The restuarant was renovated recently. The menu was updated adding lots of new dishes! you definity should go check it out! i would recommend lamb spine, crisp duck and crisp shrimp!
