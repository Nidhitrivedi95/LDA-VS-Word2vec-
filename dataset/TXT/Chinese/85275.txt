HJ928N6c5Hh2KD3lYCuabA I'm not a big fan of Thai food,but I liked this place. We tried tempura shrimps, tom yum and black pearl rolls. The soup was a bit spicy, but everything else was good. I honestly didn't like the service, but we came on Saturday night and they were quite busy.
I might give the place another shot some time.
