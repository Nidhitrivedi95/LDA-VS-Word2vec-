qGLEE1yA1bK0YdlGI-S39A Could be a bit more cheerful, but definitely a cheap and classic Canto comfort food!  

There are 3 parts of the menu:  Apps/Dumplings in Soup, Noodles in Soup, & Lo Mein.  If you're a beginner, you just hafta concern yourself with the Noodles in Soup portion.  And for the noodles, you have your choice of 3 different types of noodles, egg (standard wonton noodles), rice (prob thinner haw fun), & vermicelli.

I ordered the 2 varieties, wontons + dumplings, with wonton noodles for $5.50.  Noodles themselves were thinner than the ones you buy at the Chinese grocery store and cooked al dente!  Wonton/dumplings were plump and juicy.  Dumpling ingredients were mushrooms, pork, & shrimp.

At ~$5 a bowl for your standard wonton noodle soup, it's great for a light meal, in-between meal, &/or snack.  Unlike dim sum, it won't make you fall asleep afterwards due to the MSG-overload...Zzzz...

Note:  CASH ONLY!
