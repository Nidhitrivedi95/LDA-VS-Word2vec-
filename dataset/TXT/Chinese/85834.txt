hoGyiTjrri-Sq3-EaO7Kpw I have tried this place twice. The first time we dined in  the food was okay, not very flavorful. It lacked any spices even though the dishes were labeled as extra spicy. The second time I got the pad see ew to go... So disappointed. It was just noodles and vegetables thrown together. No sauce, no flavor. Just bland. The tofu was brutally overcooked. Would not recommend this place.
