b3vRI8yXNK34hgC0Wd4Iag I had the lo mein and it was pretty darn good, but then again I was super hungry. We also go the plum sake and it was really good. We had a great server that was very attentive, because we were all chugging water. It was nice because they had a few gluten-free items (not many, maybe 5); we had 2 in our party that are gluten intolerant so it was nice to see. I was overall satisfied when we left. The atmosphere was nice and not too crazy but relaxing.
