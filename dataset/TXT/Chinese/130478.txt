pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA My Fiancee had been to both the NYC and Miami Sushisambas, so she wanted to try the Las Vegas one. I had been to neither, but was happy to tag along. 

I'm glad I did! It was great. I was wasn't sure what to expect, but everything from the edamame to the gyoza was great. The whitetail taquitos were really good, and different from anything I had tried before. The best dish was the chicken terriaki skewers. Probably the best chicken skewers I've ever had. 

I will gladly go back.
