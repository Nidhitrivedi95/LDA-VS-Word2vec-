gBEWJ4b2OvUmN4Oh7ju3hw This place is okay. I've never eaten in the restaurant, only take out. Their sushi is okay. If you've never had sushi that wasn't store bought before, this place is really good. It probably ranks at the bottom for me as far as sushi places are concerned. 

They have this one delivery guy that is incredibly rude. He only gives you like 2.5 seconds to answer the door before knocking again. He is Very impatient and just shoves the food in your face. Watches you write your tip and if you don't tip him good enough he doesn't even say bye.
