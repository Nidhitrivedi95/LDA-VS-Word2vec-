j1QfFrTE22PAak7rzD8OoQ Sweet Culture is another one of the Chinese Dessert place.. opens late in the afternoon till 1 to 2 AM.

It is excellent choice to drop by for an afternoon snacks or a midnight snacks! There are also quite a good choice of fresh fruits desserts on the menu. Healthy and Tasty, what a good combination!

Dropped by here on a Sunday afternoon. A lot of the table ordering their special afternoon noodle set that let you pick your own ingredients and comes with a drink.

Me.. I opt for the Herbal Turtle Jelly with Fresh Fruits ($7.50) Thanks God.. though there are only 3 kinds of fruits watermelon, cantaolpe and honeydew diced up in small cubes but at least they are all fresh! What a good snack!

I would for sure to be back to try Durian Sago Mixed ($4.50) next time!

The seats and the tables are wooden without cushions so not really comfy however the services are nice and friendly!

They accepts Cash only!
