773ovbZW7HvfaNy5laUznQ We found out new favorite somewhat local Asian restaurant.  It's a smaller place with average atmosphere but the food was great.  We have been twice in the past couple of weeks, once for pad Thai and the second for sushi. Both were much better than anything not near uptown Charlotte.
