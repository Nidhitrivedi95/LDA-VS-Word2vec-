cxVp-a28Cp7lavjaPMvK5w This restaurant has all the potential to be great.  A good location and interesting menu.  However, the decor is tacky, it would be better to add some neon lights and go for a John Carpenter Big Trouble in Little China theme.  The ramen was so salty it could barely be eaten.  The dessert was good and the quail eggs were very good.  I wouldn't return to this place unless they scale the down the sodium.
