OllK5_S-7svgSwbUfx1xYA This is my go-to place for weekend morning breakfast/brunch so I can only speak for this place before 11am on a weekend morning. 

Whenever I'm in the mood for a Chinese breakfast, I come to King's Noodle sit between 10-11am and the restaurant is about 1/3 full. My order usually consists of a Seafood Congee (since I don't eat pork or beef - this is one of the only options), a breadstick rice roll or sweet doughnut roll. 

The Seafood Congee (around 6$ for a medium/large bowl) consists of some shrimp, scallops, and fish. Their congee is very creamy and is usually on point every time I go. The breadstick rice roll (around 4$) can be quite salty at times so it's a hit or miss. The sweet doughnut roll is crispy with a good amount of bread in between so it makes for a filling combination with the congee. I always leave with a full belly. 

The service is laid back as is the case with many Chinese restaurants. They don't come to you unless you call them and they can be hard to flag down if they're not looking at you. You just have to be tenacious and patient. Usually, I ask for everything when I put down an order to avoid flagging someone down. Also, since this place is very popular for take out, orders may take a while but that all depends on how busy they are. (Reason for docked star)

Overall, like I said, this is my go to place because I do really like their congee and my belly always leaves content. If you don't need good service, this is a good place to go!
