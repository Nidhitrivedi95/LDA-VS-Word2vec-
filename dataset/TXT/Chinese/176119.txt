WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg My family has been eating here for about 20 years and I absolutely love the place. The place has renovated twice since I was a ye ol' lad and went from a grimy dive to a family restaurant. The service is excellent because the servers do respond to your order as soon as they can. 
I suggest getting the dinner menu if you're in a group as it gives you a big serving that can serve to about 3 to 4 people each dish (which is roughly around $10 a dish).  Even if it is "dinner time" you can still get a lunch menu for the best deal if you're dining solo. 
If you like chicken you should try their Manchurian Chicken/Ginger Spice Chicken or Chicken Pakora. Those are their specialty and you won't find a restaurant anywhere in Toronto that can make it better.
