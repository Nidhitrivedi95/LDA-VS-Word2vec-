68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw Been here about 7-8 times and honestly it's one of my favs! Everything I've had has been wonderful and the service has been great.  I live out of town but every time I make it to Vegas (every other week) I make it a point to come here.  The sauces are great, the chicken is divine and it looks like they have several things i still need to try like the fried rice and the Katsu! Looking forward to it. I wish they had a place like This in Phoenix
