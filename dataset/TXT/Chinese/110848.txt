Ly48L1qSRdLpCSWcs_DWIw Phoenix is a great place for solid, HK cafe style food. There are days when the dishes are really good, and others when it's just okay. Known for their Hainanese Chicken, they do one of the better renditions of it in the city - but it is subject to the up and downs of quality that all of Phoenix's food suffers. And the rice isn't yellow enough!

Their HK tea is good, as is their coffee/green-tea shake that reminds me of a kit kat in liquid form. Desserts here are also fun - they have a puff pastry with black sesame ice cream which is rather decent. And the super-tall brick toast is classic.

While you won't be crossing the city to try this place, this Asian diner is my go-to for an HK food fix.
