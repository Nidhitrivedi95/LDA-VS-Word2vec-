Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA Buy 1, Get 1 sushi rolls are not only an awesome deal, but the sushi is great! Spicy edamame and shumai are our go to apps! It's a weekly tradition for my coworkers and I to meet up for great food and drinks.  I've always had a good experience with waitstaff. I do not recommend sitting at the bar, as the girl normally behind it has an attitude. I learned my first time sitting over there! Stick to the table side and the waiters/waitresses do a great job!!
