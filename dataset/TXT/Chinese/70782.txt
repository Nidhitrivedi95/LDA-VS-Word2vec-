She loves their teryaki chicken and rice and how they treat her like a princess. Most sushi places that we've frequented in the past are not really savvy with kids - this place loves them!

In terms of grown up food, their sushi is incredible! The flavor and freshness appeal to all tastes and the variety is the best I've seen! I am addicted to the Califonia Crunch Roll and Green Valley Rolls! The presentation is so fabulous that everytime they bring the rolls to our table, everyone around us asks what we've ordered. 

We've taken some friends there and everyone is eager to return. We go at least once a week.
