W9y-Bl9030-rmfxSTmUD_g Tried this place last night with a friend. I got the orange chicken with white rice. Very good. I got it extra spicy, but it still was not very spicy. They brought over chili oil to help out and that did the trick. I tried the iced green tea. It was good, but a little too sweet for me. The crab puffs were very nice. Also, on your first check in, you get free spring rolls. 

Staff was very friendly and the customer service was awesome. Drinks always full and service was very fast. I will be back for sure!
