Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w We visit tintin every Monday lunch.  It's a good place to have all combined asian food buffet restaurant.  They have alcohol, such as wine and beers.  They also have Japanese sushi rolls and nigiri.  Their regular food includes Chinese lo mei, stir vegetables and white rice and noodles; dim sum and red beam bum.  They don't have a lot chicken, but sea food and pork are all there.  I love their fried jumbo shrimp, curry noodles and spicy sour soup.
