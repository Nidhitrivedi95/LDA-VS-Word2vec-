xP2zIIqXxW8QNiJqJyE92A I returned to China Passion yesterday because the owner Wei invited me back and I am glad he did. I ordered Kung Pao Beef and Chicken Chop Suey and both were really delicious !! The veggies in each dish were prepared perfectly with still a bit of crunch to them; the noodles are done just enough with the right amount of sauce and the fried rice was fluffy and had no grease whatsoever. Everything was so well prepared you'd almost think you were eating at a health food restaurant but with all of those great Chinese flavors. And yes the portions are big but I like that for leftovers the next day.So with a concerned owner and great food it's a place to try and I will recommend it to family, friends and neighbors !!
