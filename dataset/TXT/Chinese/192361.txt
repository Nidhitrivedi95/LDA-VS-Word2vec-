Z2xuK4BbrD0Qr9dAs7oTVw The food is average Chinese food...neither here nor there. What threw this to a below average rating was the following...I asked if I could substitute my egg roll for 1 crab Rangoon.  She said no. I asked if there was a reason. She said, "Because they don't want to." I was like a deer in headlights wondering if I'd just heard that correctly. It was confusing because she says it in the nicest tone with a big smile. Almost made it worse? There is enough competitors in the area willing to accommodate a simple request. I will take my business elsewhere.
