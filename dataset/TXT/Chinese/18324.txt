5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A When you walk in it feels weird. Like someone is using the place as a front for a different kind of organization. But that's cool, it adds to the ambience if you look at it the right way. You can pretend you're a secret agent in a movie and the servers are extra attentive because they're afraid for their lives. Yeah, the service is really good even though everything feels dodgy. I am really stuck on the Tom Yum Soup hot pot right now and their Thai Tea is really big and super sweet. (It scares me how sweet it is, so much sugar!) This is a pretty low-key simple place and it took a bad experience at another Thai place for me to realize how much I like this place and just how many times I've eaten here and brought guests with nary a bad experience. 
They give you generous amounts of food (something I personally get very picky about) and are very convenient in that you can order out. :) They have a nice variety on their menu as well. Gosh, I even turn to their menu right when I get the flu.
