z01_gDUfmedOuX2UZYF33w Most of the food I tried here was inedible. I spit the lo mein and potstickers out into my napkin, that's how bad they were. The kung pao chicken was so bland that even dousing it in soy sauce didn't make it edible. Avoid this place at all costs!

Update: I am now paying for my bad decision to let someone else pick the restaurant  in a very unpleasant way.
