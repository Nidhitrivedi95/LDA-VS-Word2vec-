zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ 3-stars "just ok" basically sums up the experience here. Hip, modern, Asian fusion-style noodles  that will satisfy someone who is willing to accept non-authentic experience.

If you are looking for a classic ramen, this is not the place for you. Although something resembling a classic ramen is offered on the menu, you are much better off going to an actual Japanese-run ramen place (Kinton, Hokkaido Santouka, Isshin, etc.). What's worth trying here though are the other non-typical flavours. I had the white pumpkin ramen and it was uniquely tasty. Noodles were cooked to the right level of doneness in order to maintain the texture of the noodles. I may come back to try some of the other flavours or the tsukemen.

My other gripe with this place--although it should not come as a surprise--is that the servings are rather small. Compounding with the fact that the prices here are generally higher than any other noodle place, the value of a meal here is really questionable. So beware, you are definitely paying a premium for "coolness" here.

Service is pleasant, friendly and courteous. During peak periods they do tend to get very busy, so be prepared to wait. Also, be ready to share a table with strangers because that's how it works.
