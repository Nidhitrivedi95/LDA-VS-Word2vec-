AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I've been to Veggie House multiple times and each time I cannot believe how delicious the food is. Everything I've had was exceptionally delicious. I've tried the tofu and eggplant, Japanese Raman, orange chicken, along with many appetizers and I have yet to be disappointed. I don't know how they make such delicious vegetarian food. I will definitely suggest this restaurant to all of my friends and family.
