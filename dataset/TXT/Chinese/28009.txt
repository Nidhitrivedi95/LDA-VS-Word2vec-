8IblwilNlenDVwBbEzQEVg Well my family loves eating here, they give amazing portion sizes and the rice and chicken are the best! They're kinda quite lol but I think they're still very sweet people. I'm giving it 3 stars because the veggie soup has no flavor at all, it's like eating veggies with water. & today I tried the beef noodle soup, it tasted like noodles fatty chewy beef and water. No flavor at all once again. They should consider changing that because it's so blan I don't think anyone would enjoy spending $10 on that. But besides that all the fried rice, lemon chicken, orange chicken, sweet n sour pork, was the best I ever had.
