U1S6NFCtMzq-qX7PnU2i_Q Food is overpriced and distasteful compared to other similar restaurants in the area. I can bare both of those but the worst part is their attitude and service. That one tall guy who works there behaves like the whole world shat on his chest and made him hand scoop the shit into his mouth and eat it. 

We ordered C9 on the menu which clearly says cucumber but it comes as a dish with 99% onion. When I asked the guy about it, all he did was take the menu, point to C9 and shove it in my face. I don't think he knows what cucumbers are.

Ugh.
