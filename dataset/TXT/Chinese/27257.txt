88ntJxZNxRIY8W_hji9pzg I hate you, Yelp algorithm. I know that I've written a review for this place before. I know that I have. But Yelp randomly deletes reviews, or something like that. Anyways...

This place is amazing. Authentic Sichuanese cuisine that will rock your socks and change your mind about what you consider to be 'Chinese Food'. China is a really big place, and unsurprisingly has many different sorts of cuisine. Sichuan province is located in the south, and tends towards spiciness. Several ingredients are used in it's preparation that you're not going to find at most other places- notable the Sichuan 'peppercorn'. It's a tongue-numbing delight that you'll definitely get to experience here with some of the dishes.

I can't even begin to recommend what you should start with. The water-boiled dishes are amazing and VERY representative of Sichuanese cuisine. Some of my other favorite are the bacon with leeks, chonqi spicy chicken wings, tea-smoked duck, and of course the dan dan noodles. Just come here with an open mind, and feel free to ask them to tone down the spiciness if you prefer. Just don't be surprised if, as a Caucasian male, you get weird looks ordering from their authentic menu. They're still not used to use guialo having a taste for the good stuff.

But they'll learn... oh, they'll learn.
