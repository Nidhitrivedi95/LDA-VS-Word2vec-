1CqDdPrrb0xvQpgu7fhI5w Went here for dinner. It has a nice decor with painted glass panels on the back wall which are actually  the wall between the dining and restroom. We  tried a variety  of things. The black tea tasted odd, I am not sure why, but I  didn't  care for it. The peach bellini was tasty.  The wonton soup.was good, with chunks of chicken, spinach, shrimp and water chestnuts besides the wontons. We ordered the traditional style egg rolls,  not having had them in a long time, it comes with a sauce which is basically  sweet and sour mixed with Chinese mustard.  If you do not like mustard  they will bring you sweet and sour alone. We ordered  fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and Mongolian beef. The portions are smaller and more expensive  than a good family owned Chinese. Restaurant. For $17.95 I  was a bit surprised to see about 4-6 oz of bite size pieces of beef and it was not tender, it was somewhat  chewy. We didn't  finish all our food but the waiter pushed the dessert  menu not once but twice! I feel it is badgering  if I  have already  said I don't  want dessert to keep pushing me! I will stick to my couple favorite family owned  Chinese restaurants!
