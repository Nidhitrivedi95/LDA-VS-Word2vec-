LjxuUvIQ-tWNHyGNfJ6UzA Ping. That's the sound the button on my shorts made when they busted open because I ate about 14 plates of food during my glutton-fest.
 
Flush, flush, flush.  I have a feeling that's the sound I'll be making in about 30 minutes from now.

It's a Chinese buffet that caters almost exclusively to a Hispanic crowd, hot sauce on every table and 50% Latin music playing in the background.

I guess this place was fine.  Some of the items were hot and fresh, a few were old and dried out. They did have about 30+ items to choose from. Even some sushi, but I didn't wanna risk it all and try the tuna. I'm not a gambling man like that.
