5It12biyGxe2Dz6kkf7wGQ Absolutely the best Chinese in the area. It's not your average Chinese carry-out. You can tell they use better ingredients and recipes. The staff is extremely nice. Affordable and delicious. I use this place as a comparison for any other Chinese food I eat around the Pittsburgh. I eat lunch here about once a week for lunch. The lunch specials run about $8-9 and I'm stuffed. I would definitely recommend this joint to anyone in the Wexford area. Enjoy!
