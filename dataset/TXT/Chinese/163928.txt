USRXU4ASBAFSKhlk-KVrCw Lots of veg options and the wait staff was friendly but that's about all I can recommend. The food was extremely oily for my taste, and also pretty flavorless. The rice tasted like it had been sitting around for a while. The veg egg rolls were conpletely stuffed wirh the blandest cabbage possible.  The tofu and vegetables was swimming in brown sauce. The moo shu vegetables were tasteless.

Not the worst Chinese but also not worth a return visit.

PS -- The parking lot in the front is very small and hard to navigate.
