sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg Best salted pepper chicken hands down! It's hard to find a place that has salted pepper chicken on the menu in AZ. This is it! I love love love the cripsy chicken and it goes perfect with fried rice or chow mein. Swtich it up once in a while and get Orange chicken, but salted pepper is my favorite here! DELISH!
