puPY7gVy7RCz8bK1zkzdoQ This is the best Chinese food place I have eaten at. Most places really aren't that great or are really bland but not this place. Tom is always so friendly and smiling when you come in the door, the other lady is nice as well but I don't see her too much. I very much recommend this place!
