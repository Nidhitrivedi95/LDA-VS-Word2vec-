yaVbWmuBGJuXWVtPFnGHdA I am really surprised to read the other two reviews! I have found Dr. Grout and the staff  there to be professional, caring, and very nice. I visit this office at least once a week and, again, I am shocked. "Doctor is God??" That's ridiculous. Dr. Grout is a caring doctor and a sweetheart who cares about her patients. The staff could not be friendlier or more helpful. It's a wonderful doctor's office with an uplifting atmosphere.
