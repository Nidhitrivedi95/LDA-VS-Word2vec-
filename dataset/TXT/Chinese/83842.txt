He_4k_w_8bjWnoepahS2zw Saw BlogTo and many Instagram food blogger posted this ice cream toast! So I went with a bunch of friends and tried it! As it turned out, not soggy at all!!!! And neither was it too hard. Just the right amount of sauce with the toast. So yummy!!! Will come back for lunch or dinner to try out their teppanyaki rice and ramen. I read pretty good comments on Instagram
