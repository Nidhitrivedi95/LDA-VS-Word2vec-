I don't expect much from fast food, but decided to share my negative experience with this specific location to save others from frustration.

Zero customers in line, I waited 5-8 minutes to be helped. Half of the selection items out; understandable if busy, but had literally 5 customers eating. No manners from staff. 

Again, I don't expect much from fast food, but still frustrating. There are plenty of other options in the area. Look elsewhere.
