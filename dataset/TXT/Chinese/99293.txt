Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ I've been coming here for years and no place can beat their dim sums! The idea or push carts filled with a variety of dim sums, desserts, and other Chinese dishes is great! You can order the food at your own pace and try many different kinds of dishes. Just be careful! You might not even realize how much you eat haha! It was quite packed after 12pm but the employees quickly seated everyone. Here's a short summary of what we ate:

chicken feet was good.
har gow was very good. 
sticky rice filled with (i think was) pork was amazing.
xiao long bao was not the best I've tried because there was hardly any soup. 
Pork buns were ok but messy
Deep fried fish was great and ended up ordering two
