4ps8XJFZWi9nNwiWUcycVA I'm from the East Coast and i love chinese food!! i looked at the reviews and i figured i try this out since there were a lot of positive feed back!! i wish i never came here the food was horrible had no taste. I'm sorry for people that are born and raised in Arizona they don't know what good Chinese food is. I ordered egg drop soup and it had corn in it i never in my life seen corn in egg drop soup it just went down hill from there needs more flavor.I won't be going back sorry
