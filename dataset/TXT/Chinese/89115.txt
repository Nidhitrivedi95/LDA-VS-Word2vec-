I5cGJJw5-VXJtxO58WfuLA This is a little Chinese take-out (primarily) place in the Food Lion shopping center at the corner of Graham St. and W. Sugar Creek.

The menu is pretty standard fare... just what one would expect for a Chinese take-out place.  The food was quickly and well prepared.  I made a couple special requests for my entree and fried rice, and my wishes were accurately executed.

If I were to find myself in this area again, I wouldn't hesitate to go back.... which is a good thing, since there are few dining alternatives in the area, except for the Subway next door.
