Akl6WDSUwYQ3zanxczLNSg Should've read some of the reviews. 

Our server was almost nonexistent since we didn't happen to order a lot of high priced items. It was two of us and we just wanted a bit of sushi, not a party platter of dinner. I tip exceptionally well regardless of cost of food, so if I get great service just ordering a water for my drink, I'll tip 60% for them. This did not happen this time. He was really attentive to the table next to us that got a single bottle of wine. I could tell he had no desire to return to our table unless of was really necessary for him to. 

For the food, I've eaten sushi at numerous places, and this one did not meet any expectations. I usually order eel and it's always delicious, but this place had my eel practically burned. It was charred and crispy and totally ruined the taste. The rainbow roll wasn't bad, but I did expect it to be above average for the price and the rice tasted...off. I can't quite describe it, but it didn't taste as I thought it should. 

I gave it 2 *s for the atmosphere and the fact that it wasn't a total waste. 

I don't think I'd recommend this place as a sushi dinner for anyone looking for a good place to go. If you're in the hotel and don't want to wander too far, this place should be fine as a quick stop.
