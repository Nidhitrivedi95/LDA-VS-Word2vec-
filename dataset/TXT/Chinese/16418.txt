44YFU284Z3KDEy25QyVoUw I actually think this place is pretty decent - at least when I've eaten here. It's realllllllllly clean, and the hot pots are goooooood. 

My mom and I dined here for lunch once, and it's a pretty good deal for the lunch plates - the spicy eggplant is really good.

Ate a family meal here too... it was a standard Chinese family meal - soup, veggies, a few meat dishes. It wasn't terrible or gross, nor was it HALLELUJAH! worthy. It was just good.

What was annoying was how this one family decided to let their little brats run amok and ignore their screaming and running into people/chairs/tables.
