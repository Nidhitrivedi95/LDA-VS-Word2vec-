RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg Third time coming here with my friend and honestly I don't know why we decided to go the cheaper route and not pay for all you can eat at another sushi place. It's 40% off regular rolls now, not 50%, because somehow they think their sushi is that high quality that it deserves 10% more. We didn't finish even half of our sushi (we ordered 6 rolls). They think that throwing mayonnaise on top of every roll makes it taste better and the spicy tuna roll they cooked? Not to mention both our stomachs hurt after so.... we asked for the check ASAP and walked out. Customer service is rude too... if we're being honest Smith's grocery store sushi is 10x better and I'd pay double the price I did here. Keep in mind this is coming from an avid all you can eat sushi goer. I know what sushi should and shouldn't taste like. Oh & our booth was taped with duct tape because there was rips. I wish Gordon Ramsey would visit this restaurant just to verify I'm not kidding. I'm surprised this got more than 1 star review.
