After waiting 15 minutes the server came back and told my friend to change to a different type of noodle because they would take a long time to make handmade noodles. He agreed because he didn't want to wait that long. Another 20 minutes passed and his food had still not come out - we asked the server how much longer it would take. 2 minutes was the answer we got... but we probably ended up waiting another 20 minutes for it. It was clear that they forgot about his food after they made him change his order to avoid a long wait. The place wasn't even busy enough to justify this type of screw up.
