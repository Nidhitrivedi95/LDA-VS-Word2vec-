dKOrxsz6ygqa-AatwzpKyQ Wow, this was interesting.  Quite honestly the food here is not bad, big place and okay service.  However, we came here on Chinese New Year and they had some guy dressed as the god of fortune coming around to collect red pockets from us.  Their god of fortune actually came up to our table and put us on the spot.  I guess they figured that we won't decline giving red pockets because we want to look generous in front of our friends and relatives.  What a douche move...lol... It was funny because we knew what they were doing but we didn't give in.

So I give you 2 stars in a red pocket for trying to pull that on us... Hope it gives you good fortune :)
