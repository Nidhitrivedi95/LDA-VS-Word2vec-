This place is always busy - especially on a weekend!  It's a nice enough place to dine in and the food is pretty decent.  Nothing I ate here made me want to scream Hallelujah   but nothing made me not want to return.  It's a happy medium! 

There are 2 other locations - Markham and I believe Mississauga.  It's cheap, cheerful and quick.  They have take out and delivery and lunch specials so for a quick pick me up on a night you don't want to cook, it's perfect!
