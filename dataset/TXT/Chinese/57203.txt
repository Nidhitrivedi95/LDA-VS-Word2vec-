D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Splurged for another delivery order from Satay for dinner last night and while everything was tasty, especially the coconut rice, there was a mixup with our order.  I ordered their traditional won ton soup, but received their wor won ton soup (which includes lots of veggies, chicken, pork and shrimp in addition to the won ton). Broth was weak and flavorless, but the fresh veggies, shrimp, and won ton were very fresh tasting. Wish the carrots had been cooked just a bit more though. I am not a big fan of crunchy veggies in my soup. The won tons were wrapped separately, so I initially thought they forgot them entirely.  My mellow was harshed temporarily until my meal mate uncovered the m.i.a. wontons in a separate container, and my world was filled with sunshine once again.  Satay's wontons are wonderful!

The other entree we selected was the combination chow mein with fried noodles. Now these fried noodles are not your standard Chinese fast-food hard and pasty flavorless sticks ... These fried noodles are light as a feather, flavorful all by themselves, and added a wonderful texture dimension to the generous amounts of chicken, pork, shrimp and veggies.  A little on the dry side, as a noodle entree goes, but a dollop of my soup broth incorporated the ingredients well and resulted in a happy diner.

My favorite thing on their menu, thus far, is still their coconut rice. Delicately infused with coconut essence ... this rice makes an excellent side, and would go well with everything else on your plate. TRY THE COCONUT RICE!

Still pricey at $40 for a large soup, combination chow mein, coconut rice, delivery fee and tip.  And not even a fortune cookie at the bottom of the bag. :(
