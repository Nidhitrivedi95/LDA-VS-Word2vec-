jDehhKtVZa62k32WHbnc2A I just ordered the green vegetable entree and it was very bland. The broccoli seemed less than fresh and the asparagus was woody. This used to be my go to place for Chinese but I haven't ordered in a while and I won't be ordering again. The delivery driver also refused to leave me a receipt.
