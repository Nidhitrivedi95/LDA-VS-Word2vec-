Price are consider cheap for the foods,which is good.The service here is really bad, the waiter will not answer any questions. I was asking what sauce is serving with the pork Chop(because I know some restaurant will serve mushroom sauce or pepper sauce), and the waiter look at me and smile like I am making fool of him, and then the chicken wings are not fully cooked you can see blood in the meat , when we told him, he didn't apologized and just take those chicken wings back to fried again and return to us.
