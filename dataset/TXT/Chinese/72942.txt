Fhjzzo7ranqqgEdbiPD50Q We used Yelp 24Eat for the first time tonight. We ordered from Bo Bo China, also the first time, and I can only say that both 24Eat and Bo Bo China were impressive. 
First. Eat24. Used my Yelp app and found a restaurant in my area that offered the service. Using the app we placed our order and were impressed with the ability to customize our order. We placed the order on our credit card. Very easy and painless. Eat24 called to update us on a possible change we could make in our order, very thoughtful. Then sent us an itemized statement with our order, prices, charges ($5 delivery charge) and approximate time of delivery (they were early 20min!).  The delivery person was prompt and polite. You may leave a gratuity for your delivery driver when you pay for your order if you like. 
Now to Bo Bo China. I ordered the Shrimp in Lobsters Sauce.   Rice and condiments came on the side along with almond cookies. The shrimp were very tasty. Cooked to perfection. Peas and carrots accompanied the shrimp and a healthy portion it was. My only complaint was the Lobsters sauce broke down too quickly. 
All said, we loved the experience of Bo Bo China and Yelp 24Eat. Kudos.
