Lv9wzkvPrVG-VdPGcw53_A Went for a special birthday for a group. Wanting seafood and a great meal. The original choice was the other fisherman lobster villa, but they were booked up so we thought this one would do. We ordered the one with the lobster and the king crab dinner set meal which serves 8-10 people. 

The king crab (which was what I was looking forward to  most) was as good as I had hoped for.  The meat was sticking to the shell in steamed and hk style. The version that was cooked with egg wasn't good.  The lobster was made hk style and the little fishies (sorry don't know the name) that were served with the lobster were very big and not good.  The lobster itself was fresh and pretty good. 

All of the other dishes in the meal were smaller than what I would expect given the price of the meal. There were a few people in the group (10) that were still hungry after the dinner.  I wouldn't really recommend this place unless you want to save a few bucks on seafood.
