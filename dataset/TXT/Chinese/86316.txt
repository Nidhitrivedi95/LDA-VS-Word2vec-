HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Tasty Asian fusion treats priced cheap but quality food.  I enjoy the shortrib fried rice with veggies.  Not a big menu but packed with flavors and imagination.  They also have burgers and cool toppings.  Easy access to this hotel restaurant off Sahara.  I used to represent the former owners and their menu was boring compared to this one.  Friendly service and spacious with counter seating.
