R-EGIdIgtoFzl--OudANtA First impression on Yummy Cantonese Restaurant. Crowded, unorganised, dirty and incompetent service at the front and in the restaurant itself. 

I gave it 1 star. Purely based on the food taste, mediocrity. Other wise this place don't deserve anything better. With the choices available in markham / scarborough, I will never visit yummy again.
