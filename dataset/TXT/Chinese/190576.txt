yKuAM6kL5sSKtfoe9a3GpQ I must be the only person to complete the Made-in-China tour as I've been to the Scarborough hot-spot as well. The design colors and patterns of the space is similar but I feel much more open as there are less barriers and overhead vents in the way. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/made-in-china-hot-pot-toronto 

We were asked if we came for Hot Pot, Hell ya! 3 guys walking in looking to scarf down a Cow, which was our intent. This means my ranking is for Hot Pot and not their a la cart Menu. 

A la cart seems to be unpopular and solely meant for people that want Chinese but do not understand or otherwise dislike soupy communal Hot Pot. I notice most a la cart patrons are coming in alone so Hot Pot might be less suitable for individuals. 

Weeknight Adult($17.95) is same price structure and the selection list is the exact same. The service does make attempts to satisfy and A-OK in general. General MAO Zedong looks over us, classic patriotic I didn't find in the Scarborough branch. 

On a Weeknight there was maybe 20% full at any one time and mostly Chinese patrons. This is the season for Hot Pot and the suburb spots of same nature are usually guaranteed to be filled much more than this.
