zrJDRWzP0P4wTFq8-N_mzA Despite all the terrible reviews, I still wanted to try this place out. My brother goes here all the time with his buddies and is kind of a food snob, so I figured we'd be safe.

They have a few really great items, and a few meh items.

The seafood thing really is a rip off. $5 extra per person for a plate of (1 per person) mussels, scallops, surf clam, salmon, white fish, oysters and a few shrimp. The surf clam was tough as rubber, and nothing really blew us away. The scallops were good, and I enjoyed the oysters, but that's about it.

The hot and spicy soup was indeed hot and spicy, and the cilantro and preserved egg soup was nice and flavourful. I particularly enjoyed the beef brisket, spare ribs, lamb, and beef. Everything else was just fine, but not remarkable. Take a pass on the beef balls. They also had frozen soup dumplings, which are normally steamed. I've never boiled them before, and they really aren't the same when cooked this way. 

Service was very good, the food came quickly and empty plates were whisked away in seconds. The servers were very friendly and every single one wore a smile. The soup kept going down in temperature every time we put something in it, which was a bit of a drag. I'm sure they would have moved us to another table had we asked, but that was just too much effort for me.

We ate until we were bursting, and then some. 

It was pretty good, but doesn't really hold a candle to the nearby Kim Tao Hot Pot in terms of selection of quality.
