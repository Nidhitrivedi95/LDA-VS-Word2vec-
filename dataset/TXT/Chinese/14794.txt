3ijLguDlxXRDSPHSVrikPQ Ordered take out from here,  the BBQ pork is great! Sauce is delicious and the flavour of the pork is just right. 

The roasted pork on the other hand was overcooked. Not to my liking. Skin was hard and tough when we got it so it's not fresh either. 

I guess it is hit or miss. 

You're looking at $10/pound for each dish. 

It wasn't that busy when I went and no line at all, could be just that day or time but at least the place is clean compared to other Chinese bbq places.
