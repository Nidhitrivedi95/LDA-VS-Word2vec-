VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng The service was excellent during my visit and not to mention the decent pricing. I don't know what the other reviews are talking about about the poor service, unless I was very lucky with the waitresses during my visit. I even received Thai tea on the house at the end. The two were very friendly and efficient. With my experiences with other Asian buffets, the food here is probably the best I've eaten. True, it doesn't compare to some buffets on the strip, but I felt like I received better service here than anywhere on the strip (other than the Paris buffet).
