My hubby had the spicy basil beef with wide pan fried noodles, which was good, but not as flavorful as mine. We split an order of chicken satay, which we both thought was over-seasoned and the peanut sauce lacking in flavor. I think we'll try again as the curry was so delicious. We asked for it spicy... a 7 of  10 for me i thought it was more of a 5... so kind of americanized. We thought it really worked if you were in the mood for thai, in a hurry and cheap eats.
