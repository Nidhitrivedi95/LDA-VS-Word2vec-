kWkW6vVePpBox_fKfGgPjQ We came here on a Saturday night because they had a 30% off thing going on, which is always nice.  The sushi selection is pretty limited, so if you're looking for sushi alone you might want to find someplace with a larger menu.  The sushi that we did get was pretty good though, well made and flavorful.  The entrees are also pretty standard Chinese fare, but were also pretty good.

We were pretty underwhelmed by the service though.  Our waitress seemed inattentive and missed out on a lot of the little things like making sure to put the plates on the table where you can reach them rather than having to lean all the way across.  It is possible she was merely new and didn't know what she was doing, but overall I got a somewhat unprofessional vibe from the rest of the staff as they just kind of stood around shooting the breeze.

I was also surprised that they charged for an extra serving of rice with the entree; every other place I have been too does not charge.  

Overall, pretty good food, less than stellar service.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back, although the prices were pretty good and that might help to make up for it :)
