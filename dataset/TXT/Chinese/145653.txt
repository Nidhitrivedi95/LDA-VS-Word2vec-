S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ This place is kinda hard to find.  It is like on the second floor of a development/plaza.

I consider this a bit of a hidden gem.  Overall, they serve very good and authentic vietnamese food.  The various bun cuon and bun are great and the prices are right on the mark.  We like the coconut drinks and Thai Tea.  Don't order the Bolboa tea here... I was a bit disappointed.  By the way, the best Bolboa tea in Vegas is down the street in the main chinese complex -- it is call Volcano tea (see my review).  

Going back to Hue Thai, my wife and I like to buy our bread here.  They make it from scratch and it is always warm and soft.  Recommendation, when you buy bread, request that they give you the ones that are cooking or that just got takened out of the oven ~ there is an oven out in open view that you can choose the bread... Well worth it!

Service -- surprisingly very good.  They do a good job of filling your glass and following up with your order.  Staff is extremely friendly. 

Atmosphere - well, it is dark.  I don't care too much for the aquariums and blue tint...  They could organize the dining area better.  It does seem like a cafeteria...

Overall, we highly recommend this place.  This is one of our favorite vietnamese places in Las Vegas - China Town....
