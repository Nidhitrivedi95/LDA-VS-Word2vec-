U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q Needed a bite to eat before the night of drinking officially began lol. We were seated pretty quickly and immediately helped. They gave us these yummy yet salty little bowl of peanuts. I ordered chicken chow mein and my friend ordered kung pao chicken. She liked hers. I liked mine without the chicken. It just tasted off. Everything they had there looks so good though so I can't wait to go back and try more! They are a bit pricey if you order an entree on it's own but they have a special for $30 that has soup, an entree, dessert, and an appetizer. I'd recommend that because it just seems like more bang for your buck. The atmosphere was very modern. Everything was white.
