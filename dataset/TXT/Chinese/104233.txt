Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg For those who demand their Chinese authentic get some mao tai and a book of Li Po's poetry and drink with the moon and your shadow. For those who don't, have a nice Japanese Sapporo with your mixed Asian grille style. No complaints by me, this is pretty good fare for the weak of auricle and ventricle when it comes to Chinese. If I needed an MSG hit and couldn't find a good Cantonese place, this would do. Its like when you hit a city you don't know after riding cross country next to sweaty pock faced woman in gray sweats that say (ARMY) on them and suffer under her wheezing, sighing, and sneezing, not to mention guffawing at a People magazine. You need a safe home to eat dinner, some safe, relatively hygenic food. So you hit the Irish pub and rinse old scabface out of your mind with a few pints of Guinness and a shepherd's pie. PF Chang is sort of upscale comfort food.
