mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w This is my favorite go-to Asian Fusion restaurant in Tempe. The food is great and affordable! They deliver and the staff are always friendly and accommodating. It is a quiet undiscovered gem for some but all should go! If not you are truly missing out. The Pho is AMAZING. Asian Spicy wings are addictive and delicious with the right amount of spicy bite.  The Vietnamese BBQ Pork and Rice Noodle is one of my favorites!!! The Asian Shrimp is absolutely delectable. It's a great place to dine in, especially right before or after going to the movies down the block. It's also a great place to get delivery. The food is always delivered quickly. Hot and on time. Definitely give yourself a treat and visit this great place. You'll return again and again. My wife and I did. So glad that we discovered it.
