The dishes are very flavorful, especially the spicy grilled fish bathed in hot red sauce, so be prepared to down a couple bowls of rice with this meal. 

My favorite dish is the spicy pig intestine, literally the most amazing accompaniment for rice. The fish is not bad either though it really is very oily, but like soak it up with rice or something because it really is worth it! 

One things that's good and bad about this place is the use of those fire glass crystals that need to be replaced pretty often for the food to keep simmering. I mean it's cool and safe but when they get busy they either forget to replenish or they run out. Our waitress was near tears when we asked her to replace it for the third time. I'm sorry, we are not trying to bully you but our fish had been stewing for a good half hour and it's still not cooked? The fish meat ended up being very tough because the temperature wasn't right. 

But anyways, still a very interesting place. Grab friends and go! It's filled with mostly large groups of young people so the atmosphere is loud and rowdy if you are into that kinda thing. Must be the spices getting everyone fired up. ;)
