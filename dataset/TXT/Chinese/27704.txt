8f9Tl2gq78wqjtrToOTo7A Just chose a dish at random. Originally I was thinking of pad Thai but I didn't feel like having something spicy. I am presuming that the chilli icon means spicy. Though it was green so I wasn't entirely sure either.

Anyway I ended up ordering G18 which is shrimp on rice noodle with egg sauce. When I think about it at $9.50 this dish is kind of expensive especially since it is not part of the combo.
Flushing with water could not keep up with the added MSG content of the dish.

Considering that this dish likely had MSG based on the tingling sensation of my mouth. It wasn't really doing anything. It's like eating some Pringles in egg sauce form. They probably would've gotten a better dish of they didn't add MSG to the dish.

Service was a bit slow considering they had at least four staff and the restaurant wasn't even full.

The place has no free wifi advertised and Wind Mobile signal is bad considering their booth was just outside.  There's also a $2 service charge for debit under $10.

Anyway have to go home and flush the MSG out.
