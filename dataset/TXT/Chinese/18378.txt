5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A Go to Thai restaurant when I don't feel like driving to Chinatown. Prices are a bit higher, but the service is great (although I can't say if that's just because they know we are frequent customers). 
Like how the large soups are served in the hot pot with sterno so it doesn't get lukewarm. Lots of veggies & flavor. 
Can't comment on their meat dishes but they can make some great vegan Thai food - pad Thai, Pad Kee Mow, & the curries (red, green & panang) are my faves. 
I also appreciate that takeout doesn't come in styrofoam cups - I hate those.
There is a stage, but I've never seen any entertainment. It is large enough to accommodate a large group, unlike some of my fave hole-in-the wall places.
