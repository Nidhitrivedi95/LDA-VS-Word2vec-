awZx3Y1PAwhCUpt3WGZhKg This resto has good clay pot rice.  We were invited by close friends to join them for lunch.  Just happened to stumble across the clay pot rice options in their menu under the category labelled "Rice in Hot Pot".  Been looking for a place to satisfy our clay pot rice cravings in Scarborough/Markham area.  

This resto has a large extensive menu to choose from, serving Cantonese & HK style fare.

Service is kinda hit and miss at times, this is our 2nd visit as of this writing.  Slight language barrier with the staff (English not comprehended easily).

You are offered complimentary hot tea upon seating.  Decent condiment offerings at each table.

Portion sizes seem small for the a-la-cart prices for the dishes.  The dishes that are served in bamboo steamers only appear to look "big" but the steamers are shallow.  We enjoyed the steamed seafood and meat sticky rice ($13.99) which is served in a large bamboo steamer.

Definitely will be making repeat visits.
