xVHzCbDWCwmyavF5PgJRmg I like this place because it has what any good restaurant should... Good Food! 

It's Dumpy and Dicey but the food is excellent, good Vegetarian and Vegan Fare, The People are warm. The Food is Hot.  The Food Comes Quickly. Not fantastic Service, but you get what you ordered. 

Decor is beat up, but something kind of cool... Is the place itself... Good Amount of AC going... If I was blazing hot walking or cycling in the Yonge and Wellesley Area, I would go here purely based on getting what you order and how freezing (amazing) the AC IS... 

THE PRICE IS LOW... QUALITY IS GOOD & You meet some Authentic Asian Angries Here... I like that. 5/5 on food 1/5 on Ambiance & Cleanliness (even for low end) so 3/5 it is. 

My Husband brings my Dad here every single time he is in town, my Dad who is a purely about the food guy, raves about Not Just Noodles and how it is his favourite place in Toronto.
