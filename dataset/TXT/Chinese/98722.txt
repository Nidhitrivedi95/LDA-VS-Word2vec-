JTNdV6u3DK-wcqX7ZXl5hw It had been a while since I visited. I see some interesting changes. It would appear that Pei Wei is trying to drastically reduce costs. Gone are the plates, napkins, and sauces at the tables. The nice napkins have been replaced with those horrible industrial paper towels like you find in warehouse kitchens. No lunch specials are offered. The old entree size is now called "large" and is more expensive. The food tasted the same though.
