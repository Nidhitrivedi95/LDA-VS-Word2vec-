This location shares space with Chipotle and a no-name pizza shop, so it's usually bursting with tourists -- some who smell better than others.  Seating can be scant, but I lucked out on my last visit and somehow wrangled a single chair and small table.

The food was definitely Panda quality and I recommend their famous Orange Chicken and their newer Beijing Beef, which came along during the Summer 2008 Olympics.

Odd moment, though: at the end of my meal, a homeless man approached me and asked if I'd buy him dinner.  After I politely refused, he asked if he could finish mine (there was very little left).  I agreed, he took ownership of my fork, and quickly polished off the remnants of my meal.  I rushed out the door, didn't look back, and hopped over to Casino Royale to double fist $1 frozen margaritas for the monorail ride back to my hotel.

Oops, so much for what happens in Vegas. . .
