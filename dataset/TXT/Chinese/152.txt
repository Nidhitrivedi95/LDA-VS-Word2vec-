I'd picked out the vegetarian soup and she recommended that I get the Hot & Sour version, which I did. I was glad too, because it was delicious, brimming with fresh veggies and delicious flavors.

We went for dinner and it wasn't too crowded, and the service was prompt, in addition to being helpful!
