_8c3Ky90nE50rN4Mb_Sxtw Tried this place twice now, First time 3 weeks ago, and again last night.
We ordered Sesame Chicken ($8.99), Orange Chicken ($8.99), and Cream Cheese Wantons ($3.99). 2 Egg Rolls ($2.50)
The portions are really small. Extremely small for the price. 
The meals come with a large clump of overcooked plain white rice, vegetables in a sweet sauce (literally 5 paper thin carrot slices, 7 1/2" asparagus butt pieces, and 3 tiny broccoli heads), and a clump of small chicken pieces, 9 to be exact.
All 3 items took up about 1/3 of a normal plate at best. Each dish seemed to be cooked sometime in the morning, and left to die in a warmer tray all day. Everything was overcooked by far. Chicken was hard and dried out. Rice was clumpy and old.
The wantons were burnt. Egg Rolls were clearly from frozen and heated hours ago.
The only good thing is they are within walking distance of ASU downtown campus, otherwise I assume they would be long closed by now.
Also, their prices are much more than the yelp menu states, at least 20% more.
Don't even bother trying to use the plastic forks. Bring your own. They are the thinnest and cheapest I have ever seen.
Pass on this one.
