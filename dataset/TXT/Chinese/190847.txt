YpnvKqeVD7dqZ9Mr0SGw6A We love the food here but tonight the service was not the best. There were 3 of us, we each ordered a meal plus one togo meal. 2 out of the 3 meals came right away, after 5 or so minutes I asked for the last meal & was told it would be right out. Another 10 minutes passed & 2 of us are done & went to the manager & explained the situation. Nevertheless we ended with an extra meals.
