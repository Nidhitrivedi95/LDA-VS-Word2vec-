RnxOmwWVsJC87ztJPrHsig Decided to give this place a try. There was a lady in front of us who was really annoying. She was very indecisive, kept walking around us, pointing at different items to ask about, and just holding up the line. She really tested my patience. Got the 2 entree plate with half fried rice, half noodles, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken. It was a ton of food! They really pile it on there. The fried rice was different from Panda's... smaller grains, no egg, and has onion in it. It was okay. I liked the noodles. I didn't care for the orange chicken. The flavor of the sauce was very understated and I didn't really like it. The teriyaki chicken was pretty good though. I had a lot of food left over, but I didn't think it was worth taking a to-go box so it went in the trash. While it wasn't horrible, I don't really see a need to return.
