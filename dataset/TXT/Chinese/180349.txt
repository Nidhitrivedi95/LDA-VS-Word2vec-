If you read through all the Yelp reviews, they all do a good job of summing up the whole experience. I had NO expectations after reading all the reviews. 

Here's a quick recap (pretty much what everyone else said)
CONS: 
-Disorganized lines with tons of ppl cutting. Thanks to the reviews saying that security would lead you to the wrong line, I asked and yep, I got led to the general admission line when I was really looking for the pre-sale ticket line. 
-Shitload of stairs --although they do let you wait for the elevator now even if you don't have a table. But still, line was so long that I just went up the endless amounts of stairs
-The layout is like a main hub with a random side hub that looks more like the restaurant. The main hub area looks like the inside of a spider's nest haha.
-Dance floor is total shit. No regulation whatsoever on people accessing it (at least Marquee restricts you from going to the dance floor when it gets too packed). It was so hot and packed that I literally almost passed out. 
-Nowhere to sit and they keep making you move. 
-$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Geez, even XS doesn't charge this much and they're the best clubs in Vegas hands down. 

PROS (if you call it that): 
-The random side area looks more like the restaurant area and the ventilation was FANTASTIC. I will say that much. The wall with the waterfall had some really good ventilation. I'm being totally serious. It was like a mini AC area. I hung out here a lot. 
-Good DJ line-up. This is basically their only saving grace. 
-The staff was actually very courteous and friendly. Despite all the other missteps of this place, the staff was surprisingly one of the nicest staff I've met. Everyone was polite and not the usual scream-at-your-face type of security. So, big kudos on that one. Yes, I know the guy checking IDs is super hardcore and anal but man, if it keeps out the little kiddies, then I'm all for them being uptight about your IDs. Even if they didn't believe that I was me. 


The most telling sign this place was a letdown? There were TONS of people leaving at only 2AM (us included). On the way down in the elevator, the security guy asked "Did everyone have a good time?" All 15 people in the elevator said "NO!" at the same time. So sad.
