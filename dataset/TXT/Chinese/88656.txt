i_t_UJTSScw4srpb8aHUiw My new go-to place when I am craving for some HK style cafe food. This is  definitely a no frills, tasty joint where you will get the most bang for your buck.

Forget about the service (which is actually above par) or the tiny parking lot. Forget about the occasionally dirty tables and lineups during lunch and after noon tea time. This place hits the spot when you are hungry and craving for some fast, cheap, deliciousness.

Not everything is good of course but I would say 80% of the menu is great. The highlights include the baked rice/spaghetti and various rice dishes. Their soup noodle dishes are sub-par I would say so avoid if you can.

A few notes to pass along. They get real busy during lunch time and afternoon tea time (expect to wait a few minutes). They stop serving their HK style cafe menu after 5PM. In the evenings they only serve family style chinese dishes. You will find the same great deliciousness and value in their dinner menu as well.
