aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg I love this place. It's kind of a little hole in the wall as it's tucked in the corner of the plaza. It's my go-to place for BBQ duck and pork. I order the #7 combo with the BBQ duck and pork, religiously. The rice is so yummy with the broth that they pour on it. I also recently tried the pan fried noodles and oh my gosh, it was delicious! I am really impressed with the consistency on how the food tastes every time I come here. I highly recommend going here for roasted duck. The jelly fish and pigs ears are also some of the sides that I enjoy from time to time but those are delicacies so it might be weird if you've never had them before. They're definitely good tasting so if you're feeling adventurous feel free! The service a hit or miss but oh well! 

Also this place CASH ONLY, so bring some.
