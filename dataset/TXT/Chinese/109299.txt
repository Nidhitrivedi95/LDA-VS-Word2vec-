lmfyEVKm3CDGWg18LeRhgA I love the thai toast, pad siew, tom kha, crab rangoons, eggplant/shrimp salad, and all the curry dishes, (esp red!)

Pretty sure my roommate and I order dinner from here at least twice a week! The pad siew with chicken is the best around. I order it everywhere i go, and have yet to find one I like more than from Pink Pepper! 
I have yet to come for brunch but I bet I will enjoy it!

Plus the family is so nice, I hope their business flourishes! 

Note:
They're closed midday after lunch, and then open back up for dinner, so that can be a bummer when you're craving the food! And sometimes when You call to place your order it rings thru to a fax machine (or so it sounds) and you have to try back in a few minutes. But don't be discouraged, it's worth it!!
