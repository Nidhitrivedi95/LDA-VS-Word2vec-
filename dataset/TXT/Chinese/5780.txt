0c6PQILCLwRZ8FIB4AEsGw I wanted a light dinner so I went to China One and got some Corn egg drop soup.  It was quite a lot--a portion two people could easily share.

I did take out and of course they were quick as the soup is one of the standards that are always ready.

I'll be back to try some of their entrées, perhaps even try one of the lunch specials that my fellow Yelpers recommend.
