hPTx2Y5e4Czbr21XcbDN8g This is the fiance and my go to place for taiwanese beef noodles, even better since it's so close to home. We would each get our own beef and beef tendon soup noodle bowl and a large stinky tofu dish (to share, of course). The noodles here are made al dente, the broth is flavorful, the beef and beef tendons are soft and tender, and the portions are pretty generous. As for the stinky tofu, you can smell it miles away. Its crispy and delicious especially with the pickled veggies. It may not be the best stinky tofu out there but not many places make them anymore. It definitely helps cure the cravings. So don't forget to check this place out except on Tuesdays (since they're closed) and check into yelp for your 10% discount!!
