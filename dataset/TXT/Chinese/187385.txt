yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA Quan was such a sweet server did his best to be attentive even though his section was like half the restaraunt. Came with a party of 12 got sat right away even though it was busy we are visiting from westminster aka little Saigon in California but let me tell you it was some of the best pho I've ever had . Only reason I couldn't give five stars is because the rest of the staff sucked .
