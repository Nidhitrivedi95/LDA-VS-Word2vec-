iPtSfoSBj7r72pxDlM3pcg Literally the worst drive through of any place I have ever been to.... there is only 3 cars ahead of me and I've been sitting here for 20 minutes. Haven't even ordered. If a car wasn't behind me I would have left 10 minutes ago. Never again. If you're in a hurry there's a McDonalds next door.
