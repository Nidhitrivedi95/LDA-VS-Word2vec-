fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg I have eaten here several times now, and have been very pleased by the quality of food and service.  On my first visit, I wanted additional dim sum, but what I wanted was not on the cart.  The kitchen prepared a fresh batch in no time, and it was delicious.  

I am picky about places I eat, and I will go back again to this location. It's really good when I need to get a dim sum fix.
