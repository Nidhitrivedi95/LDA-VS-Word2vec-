Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A UPDATE: I've eaten here several times now (I've kind of overdosed on Pepper Cafe in the week since I've first tried it). To sum it up simply: this place is a GEM. The owners, the food, everything is just absolutely delicious. Even their Steamed White Rice is fantastic...I mean, c'mon!
