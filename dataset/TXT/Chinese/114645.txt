The two men that "served" (if you can call it that) us were clueless on where to seat us, and worse they were clueless about the menu. They were rude and shouldn't be working in the service industry. He argued with us about a dimsum order, and then walked out on us. Long story short, we felt disrespected and we're definitely not coming back to this establishment.
