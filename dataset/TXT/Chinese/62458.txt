dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw good stuff. not too spicy and not too far away from the strip. I'm amazed at how many better restaurants there are that are not on the strip and basically a quick cab ride away. Over here you'll find much better and like 3 times cheaper than what you'll find at the strip restaurants.

Do try the hot oil wontons, they are small, so an order for 1 is still ok. The beef noodle soup was good, beef had good texture, noodles were nice and chewy and crisp but soft. Lamb hot pot stew was good, but too much cumin in my opinion. The pan fried one was better. Sze Shrimp with peanuts was great. Always a crowd pleasure. One girl ate all the shrimp and left the peanuts!
