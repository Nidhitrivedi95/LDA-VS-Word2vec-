gFyntTks-Qd5CjDU8_2Kog I decided to give this place a try again after a few years.  The buffet still is pretty bad.  The buffet is small and the food quality is 2 stars at best.  I hold the 1 stars for absolute disasters.   Food has little taste.  Interesting there is no seafood (shrimp) on the buffet.  The wonton soup is chicken. Most of the vegetables are soggy.  Pork was "bad".  Chicken dishes were OK but were mostly dark meat.  

It does a decent business including carryout. I won't be back.
