WqXrmUVy5Ay3Scn4GPM9Ug We went here for a family meal one Friday evening. We made a reservation for four as the Danforth tends to get busy on Friday evenings but when we walked in..it was dead, better for us as we were all pooched from the week and thus could use the peace and quiet. We decided to split some appetizers, the "frites" with dill sauce, and the beer and cheese crock. I also ordered the apple cider fizz to drink. Our drinks and food came in fairly quick succession so props on that. The drink was literally nothing to writer about, drinking a cider is no different then drinking this so.. eh..not really worth the $10 price tag. The frites were actually wedges, but came out piping hot and the dill sauce was DELICIOUS. The beer and cheese crock was just Meh, it was very salty (I know cheese is salty!), it was lacking something to cut the salty and fat. For mains I ordered the mushroom linguine, my husband ordered the special which was a pork pie with bacon, my sister the mac and cheese and my mom the burger. Everything came out plated very nicely, but my pasta was dull dull dull, it lacked seasoning and the fior de latte made for a super weird consistency. My husband initially enjoyed the pie but once digging in, it was dry towards the centre, the mac and cheese was a bit on the watery side. Again not horrible, but not great either. The bill over $150 for four of us, a bit high for the mediocre food we received. I love the concept of this restaurant and the service was warm and inviting, but the food just didn't stand up. With so many other places to eat on the Danforth, we are unlikely to return for awhile.
