2SyYW8GiDZsqtPb-aCbosg Very decent noodle place.  It offers 4 types of noodle for selection.  When a friend told me about this place I am a bit skeptical because it's in a food court inside path, but the quality is above my expectation as a fast, food court meal.  My favour is BBQ chicken noodle and I normally add one order of shrimp wonton to go with it.  The broth is light yet flavourful, and the egg noodle is crunchy to my liking.  Chicken leg is tender and well done.  Other recommend item is spicy beef noodle which is quite yummy but not that spicy.  Price is cheap even comparing with other food court joints.
