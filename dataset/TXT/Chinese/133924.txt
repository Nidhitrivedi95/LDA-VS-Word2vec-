Don't enjoy your beverage too quickly because it's nearly impossible to get a refill. The tables are sticky. The cashier won't put his cell phone down long enough to acknowledge you and the servers will prop open the bathroom doors to the dining room to clean even if you are in the stall and you let them know you are there!
