LB7r3hZmb4NXb2jDQmmQ9w I have to say, this is the best place for spicy beef noodles! They have tasty, crunchy pigs ear and good seaweed salad. I believe it was 3 of their cold appetizers for 7.50 but best place for only these items that I've tried so far. Jelly fish here is pretty good. Service is standard Chinese service, but the ladies always do try to make an effort which is better than none I suppose?
