Cs8BaiKkyNU6mzxq9nTsmg We had a take-out order of Cantonese chow mein, stir fried mixed veggies, pork spareribs with honey and beef brisket on rice.  The weakest of the four dishes was the ribs--small portion, tasteless and a tiny container of what I assume was honey.  The next dish was the Cantonese chow mein--a very lacklustre effort.  The veggies were ok but the portion was quite small.  The beef brisket was good.

I know this place enjoys a good reputation but I was not impressed.
