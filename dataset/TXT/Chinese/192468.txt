Z4CA7jEArUT_D-1ZM4Bh1Q I get the feeling that little ol' Chop and Wok -- with its bar area, drink menu and kitschy tropical/beach bum decor -- is gearing up to be a twentysomethings hangout at night, and that's just fine. But I'll keep going for the quieter hours and the lunch specials, when the traditional Chinese chicken and vegetable dishes are all I need. Two tips: 
Try the crab puffs, which have been a Chop and Wok specialty for years. And park in the back instead of trying to maneuver in and out of a space from the busy intersection of Scottsdale and Shea.
