ag8gM2YKZkjndCvl2ti7kQ Traditional Chinese dumpling making at the window. This restaurant has home cook style Chinese lunch or dinner. Nothing fancy but nice meal @very reasonable price. I come here at least once per week. The has simple menu and fast service. Cost less that $10 includes tax and 15% gratuity.
