QS7_BPmaBNvznOMhcVBemg I ordered Hong Kong Won Ton Soup and Hong Kong Chow Mein. I asked for extra spicy flavoring if possible and it wasn't. Better to add soy sauce and salt. The sauces and food itself was good and didn't have bad service. If you have to stay at Westgate though, this place is the best if you can't spend the cash at Edge Steakhouse. The other restaurants didn't seem that good to try. 

The ambience is very nice and impressive. They are attached to the sushi and Benihanna so it looks huge, like a Japanese village.  Traditional Chinese food but with American flavoring. As in... Authentic Chinese ingredients but it's still lo mein.
