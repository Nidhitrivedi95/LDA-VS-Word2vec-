Z4MvEVylnZPW_vddQc2Ihg Went her for lunch with my coworkers and it's a great place for groups! You have tons of options to choose from to have grilled for you. Shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu, you name it - they can grill it. It's all you can eat so you can get whatever and however much you want. The grill time is pretty quick because it's such a big one and chefs seemed pretty experienced. 

There was also a desert section! Probably my favourite part of it was the chocolate fountain!! You can take any of deserts and dip it under there. Amazing. 

Overall, pretty good food especially if you're really hungry - it is all you can eat after all.
