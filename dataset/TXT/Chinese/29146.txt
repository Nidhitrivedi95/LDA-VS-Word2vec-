8YG7PRoZuHeKii0rtNvJFQ After friends recommended this place and reading yelp reviews, I decided to give this place a try.  Taking the advice of fellow Yelpers I showed up half an hour before opening, and I was already third in line. If you go that early you'll be able to still find parking in front of the restaurant.  The restaurant opened on time, we promptly picked a table and seated ourselves. By 9:06am, the tables were all claimed and people already had to wait which is crazy given there's no early bird specials and everything's at regular price (on weekends).  

The food was undeniably better than your average dim sum place.  A lot of the items were the same as other dim sum places but with a little twist.  For example the rice noodle roll with fried dough had Benito flakes on them.  The fried taro pastry had quail eggs, etc etc. Twists aside, the flavors were pretty on point.  Food wise it definitely deserves four stars.  

The service is where I had to deduct a star. They were timely on removing empty plates and getting service started.  However, some of the waitresses (one may have been a manager) were busy talking to each other the entire time. They walked everywhere in pairs.  I tried to get their attention by saying excuse me but also raising my hand.  She saw me but then continued to walk away with the manager in full conversation about how consuming honey's good for the female skin.  It took quite a few tries before they finally acknowledged us even though they were literally standing right beside our table the entire time.  I'd understand if the place was packed and they were busy running around serving people but as busy as it was, they weren't busy serving people.  

I would go back again maybe once or twice a year, but definitely won't be my go to dim sum place simply due to the volume of people and the crazy wait times.
