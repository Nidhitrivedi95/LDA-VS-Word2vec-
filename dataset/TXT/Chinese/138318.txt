qO6CWdRFfbOqDJ2UOulpaA I started going here since the place opened a few years ago. There was no other Chinese place in Surprise (that I knew of) at the time. Oil is definitely a main ingredient in their dishes. The beef dish I had once was pretty bad and never ordered it again but always loved the orange chicken with lo mein noodles. Lunch specials are pricey. Now that I'm a vegetarian, I have better options so I've never went back. The owner is friendly but always on the phone taking orders. They don't take American Express.
