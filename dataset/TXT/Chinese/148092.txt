sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA After a so so lunch experience at Congee Queen, I thought I try and make it up w/ another Yelp suggestion.  This place in my opinion will be a much better place to try and experiment during daytime.  I could tell the strength in its freshness will be better reflected during the morning/lunch crowd than the dinner since the constant flow of people during daytime will keep things fresher and hotter.  With congee, fried ghost fritter, rice roll, you got to eat them "steaming hot", not luke warm.  I will try again and see if I can give this one a 4 star if I can under better circumstances but for tonight, it's just an ok, nothing to write home about.
