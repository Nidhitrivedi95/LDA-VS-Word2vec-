Hands down best beef noodles in Vegas, probably better than most beef noodles in the 626/909 area too. For a Taiwanese joint, this place is as authentic as it gets. The noodles are handmade and the perfect size. You don't find beef noodles with texture this good just anywhere. The broth is a little spicy (legit Taiwanese-style), so try the mild if you're scared of spicy shits. 

The shrimp dumplings and wontons in chili sauce are delicious as well. Really reminds me of the ones you get in a Taiwanese night market. If you're down to try something new, I would also recommend the beef rolls.

I go here at least once every time I'm in Vegas and I'm in town quite often.
