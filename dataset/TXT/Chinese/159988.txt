U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q This is how I imagine a trendy Chinese restaurant in Helsinki.  White space with massive fish tanks holding hundreds of goldfish (how the hell do they keep the water so clean?) and minimalist touches throughout.  Food however, not so authentic.  The pork buns are better in Beijing (imagine that!); the flat noodle with eggs is tasty, but gooey; and the kung pao chicken is marked as "spicy" on the menu but really isn't.  Thai iced tea is gross in my book, but others love it.  

$60 for 2 ppl.  Not worth it.
