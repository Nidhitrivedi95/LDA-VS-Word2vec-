ax4ztJvW28xgGvI0OPqGcQ This place is like our kitchen. We come here almost once to twice a week. Most of the servers know my husband and I by name it's kinda nice. The food quality is great for the price. I can't even complain. We love coming here either for breakfast or afternoon tea time. Weekend mornings and afternoon tea is jam packed so make sure you get there early if you need a seat for more then 2 people. Otherwise sometimes the wait is roughly 20 minutes.
