hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Arrived at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon and were seated right away at the only empty table.  Food arrived very quickly!  We got the pork soup dumplings, pork belly slider, and thin noodles with minced pork sauce.  Dumplings were as good as any I've had in NYC.  The gua bao was huge, but that was the only thing impressive about it.  Noodles were freshly made and tasted great!  I'd want to try the wider noodle next time.  We also got a green milk tea, which was much creamier (and tastier) than across the street.  Would definitely come by if we're in the area again!
