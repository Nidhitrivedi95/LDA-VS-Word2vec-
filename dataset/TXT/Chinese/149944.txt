sr0rCMn-XtKATvl9adYQxA Dessert after dinner. Place was here for many years. I used to really like their steam eggs or egg custard. But this time was very disappointed. It doesn't taste good. Egg custard was watery. My Chinese herbed with egg dessert was plain, dull like no sugar. Egg was hard and plasticky. The coconut purple rice dessert doesn't have enough coconut milk. Meh. 

Too many competitions out there. Don't need to come here since it isnt spectacularly impressing.
