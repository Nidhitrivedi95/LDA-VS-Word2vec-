BsLyCu_lkEdkG42qmvZlnQ I had dinner with 2 other people at Plum on Cinco de Mayo because there was a huge wait at Mad Mex. We had no problem getting a table without a reservation and it was pretty quiet in there. I'm a vegetarian and I went with a vegan and a carnivore. We all had great meals. The service was very smooth and the atmosphere was relaxed, with nice decor. They have enough variety to satisfy any type of diet, and seating that would work well regardless if you're dining alone or with a group. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
