Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA My fiancé and I had potstickers and shrimp spring rolls for our appetizers. The appetizers were fresh, crispy, and delicious. For our entree I had the Beef Pho and my fiancé had Pork Ribs with XO sauce. The pho was amazing! I got heat level 6 and man it was hot so be careful. The Ribs were tender and the meat was falling off the bones. We will definitely be back.
