9rzfGwR--QUGn7BZJdm-Sw I've ordered at this restaurant, maybe 4 times, and I've always ordered the Genera Tao. The first two times it was very good: Fresh General Tao with a slight crisp to it.  The last couple times fell off. Especially this last time.  The general Tao did not taste fresh and the chicken was hard and chewy.  If I lived closer, I would have brought it back (pick up order). I wonder if it's because it was a pick up order that I did not get a fresh batch. Really disappointing.  This post is mainly based on my last experience here as it's so fresh on my mind.
