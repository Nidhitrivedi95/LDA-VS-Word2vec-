rBxFYhMxq2bIA9FGKIfCrA Pretty good but still not quite what I was hoping for. My family is Taiwanese and I miss my mom and grandma's cooking. So I've been trying to find a place that has Taiwanese style dishes to satisfy my cravings. I just haven't been able to find a place in Arizona that gets the Beef Noodle Soup just right. I tried the beef noodle soup here, it was ok, so far the closest to what I'm used to but still not quite there. I was also hoping for some yummy scallion pancakes but they didn't have them just by themselves, instead you can get beef wrapped in green onion pancake. What if I just want the green onion/scallion pancakes? Anyways, it was ok, just not super memorable.  Our server was really sweet and attentive. I will probably go back to try some of their other dishes and the ramen. Still looking for a great ramen place out here too.
