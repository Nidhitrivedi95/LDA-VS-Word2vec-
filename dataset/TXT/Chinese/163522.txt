URFhSrJPk7JM2pUtsuWsAg The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because a GIANT fly was flying around our table. We almost think it came out of the kitchen because I swear it appeared when we started serving ourselves. 

China Chili is great! The spicy garlic eggplant is so freaking good. The soup wasn't anything special, but is you order chicken they almost give you the whole chicken! It was more like a whole breast cut up into pieces as opposed to individual pieces breaded and fried and whatnot, so it is obviously more healthy... They give you a TON of food and the price is good. Huge place so you will almost always get a table.
