LKuzbx5Yt3yqiokUFdjVhg ordered the bulgogi, fried dumplings and crab rangoons. The rangoons and dumplings were pretty decent. The bulgogi tasted kind of off, and either the rice or the bulgogi smelled kind of like old socks. I may go back and try something else - see if it was a fluke with the bulgogi. The service was good, food cooked quick. The restaurant itself is not your typical Chinese/Korean restaurant. They've got a picture menu with hamburgers, fish & chips, and gyros in addition to the oriental food.
