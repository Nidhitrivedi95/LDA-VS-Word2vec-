OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Chang's Hong Kong Cuisine is located conveniently 2 minutes away from my apartment, which really is dangerous. 

Orchid's used to be the place to go for Dim Sum since it offers "all day dim sum"!

Chang's offers great service, great food.

The only thing I can add is that they should upgrade their signs from printed off papers to something more visually appealing.
