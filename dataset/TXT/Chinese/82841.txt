hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q I have been hearing about this place from many of my coworkers. They all recommend it but I think if you have had soup dumplings in NYC or California, you might be a little disappointed. But for Pittsburgh, this place is really good. They make fresh noodles on site. 

I came in and the atmosphere was nice. It's a small restaurant in Squirrel Hill in the busy shopping and food area. The menu was different. You check off what you want and give it to the waitress. I checked off crab and pork soup dumplings, beef and green onion pancake, and a milk green tea with coconut lychee. 

First came the beef pancake roll. I really was not a fan. It looks very good and I usually do like scallion pancakes. It was very pretty and I'm sure others will like them a lot. 

Then the soup dumplings came as they normally do in a bamboo steamer. I was a little disappointed that a few of the dumplings had their soup seep out before I even opened the steamer. They provide tongs for those who are unable to pick up the dumplings without popping them with chopsticks. I just used my chopsticks and picked them up into my soup spoon and ate them with a little bit of vinegar. They were a little on the bland side but still pretty yummy. 

The best part was the bubble tea. I was pleasantly surprised that it was actually milk tea. Other places in Pittsburgh offer bubble tea but they don't actually have tea. The lychee flavor matched perfectly with the tea. The bubbles, however, were mushy with little flavor. I prefer when they are a little bit sweet and cooked firm but not raw and crunchy in the middle. 

Pittsburgh is sadly lacking in good Asian cuisine so this place is pretty amazing in that sense.
