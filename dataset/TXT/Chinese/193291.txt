ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ The Clever Koi is a modern take on traditional Asian cuisine. They serve wonderful noodle dishes, steamed buns and house made dumplings. They also have an interesting and exciting mix of hand crafted cocktails. It has a comfortable modern setting with a nice long bar and expansive patio that faces Central. 

We stopped in for happy hour the other day and were pleasantly surprised with the prices and variety of cocktails and eats. We started with the beets, they came with cucumber, pickeled ginger, bean curd and a lemongrass vinaigrette. It was beautifully plated, but the amount of soy was so overwhelming it was difficult to eat(and the beets weren't completely ripe). For the noodle bowl we tried the roasted pork, it came with bacon, mustard greens, bean sprouts, shitake mushrooms and a soft egg. It was delicious. I had to try the steamed buns and went for the squid sausage that the bartender recommended. It was amazing and I loved the aioli it was dressed in. 
I had "The Enabler" which was hickory whiskey, grilled lemon juice, burlesque bitters. It had a slow smoke flavor that stayed in my mouth long after the drink was done.

The bartenders were awesome, we had a great experience and will definitely be back.
