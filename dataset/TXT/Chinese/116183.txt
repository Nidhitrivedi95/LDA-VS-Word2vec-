n62dcL1e8BQA1_kUEYrldQ My family has been eating here for years.  We dine in at one of the big tables and order family style or sometimes just call in for a pick up.  Either way the staff is always friendly.  They have a few items on the menu that I measure all other Chinese restaurants Stop in and order your favorite dish and see how they measure up.
