eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ I fell in love with the Umami Buns food cart and was SUPER EXCITED (more so than I probably should have been) to find out there was a brick-and-mortar restaurant, too! I was already in love with ramen cuisine and I enjoyed exploring Umami's menu! The Pear Blossom sake-tini is wonderful for drinks and I had the pork dumplings, edamame, and miso ramen. Very cute interior, too :)
