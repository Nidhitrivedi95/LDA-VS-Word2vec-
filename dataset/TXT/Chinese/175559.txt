wJnhUJCOYkncLPZAwaMffA Came here for my dirty thirty b-day and got completely sloshed.  I don't remember how the food was despite it being restaurant week.  It's a difficult place to find when you enter the building but easier to spot from the street.  

Could be a solid 4 stars if the service staff knew their drinks. That is, one friend ordered a martini, she didn't want it dirty. They gave it to her dirty.  Later, another friend showed up asking for martini neat - and again, splashed with olive juice.  They gotta learn their mixology.

Overall, solid place to have a bday - for whatever reason they weren't too crazy busy so my group and I got rowdy and had a good time.
