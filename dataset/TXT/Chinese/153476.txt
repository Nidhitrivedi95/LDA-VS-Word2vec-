taet5lzHXhUGGkPrWcfmsg I love this place. I absolutely LOVE this place. Their dumplings are phenomenal and that spicy soy sauce they've got going on is just something else. 
The ONLY reason I give it four stars instead of five is the staff. They seem slightly careless, like they would rather be anywhere but here. And it's annoying that the friendliness of the staff is what is letting down the quality of this restaurant! 

I always get take out so it doesn't bother me as much as it would if I would have a sit-down dinner, but the fact that I actually avoid coming to dine here and prefer minimal contact should be a red flag.
