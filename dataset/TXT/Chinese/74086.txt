FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ Bad service at front desk very passive aggressive staff at front taking phone calls.  Puts our table of 12 by the back room where the staff goes in and out every 3 to 4 mins making one of my family members move her chair every time they go in and out! Worse dim sum experience ever. Food was just alright for the price and service you get.
