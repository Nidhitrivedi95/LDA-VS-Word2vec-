ovlWOSKVjGecnaPuZLv_OQ Fancy, clean fresh dim sum. There are no carts rolling around this place. Everything is cooked after ordering, so the dishes are hot & fresh when they hit the table. 

Weekends can be crazy, so call-in a reservation. It can be noisy in here. And yes, the place is super-gaudy and ostentatious, but this is where you go to impress your old aunties and uncles and non-Asian friends, so the bathroom is clean and they won't get scared.

It is pretty family, but there is NO diaper-changing station in the bathroom and the highchair is ghetto. Some poor sap in Chinatown constructed it together with plywood and there is NO lap belt or buckle at all: completely dangerous. You'd think for all that gaudy faux-gold, royal purple velvet seats, that they could at least buy a restaurant-grade highchair for $60! Stop being so cheap, and buy a real and safe highchair before someone's baby falls out of it and sues your restaurant.
