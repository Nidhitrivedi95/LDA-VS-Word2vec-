yEZn1XpLsEC9uBa-X4xAZw I first discovered Vua when hunting for a catering for 100 person call center lunch.  I was getting tired of greasy cardboard pizza and demanded for the lunch budget instead. I first tried Dagwood's with some success but when I ordered Vua grilled chicken sandwich. It was game over.  Vua was an instant hit!!  Agents raved about the sandwiches. That was back in 2010. 

I've been a faithful Vua-er ever since. There's been some changes the last several years but I can't ascertain.  Maybe in the beginning it was more family that were running the store because it felt like every sandwich was made with TLC. Case in point, recently, I got 3 large grilled chicken sandwiches to go and two were good. I took the third one to work for lunch with the intention of making my lunch mates jealous (muahaha) but joke was on me cause when I opened up the sandwich, the only thing staring me back was baguette and chicken with 0 trimmings. See my photo.  No love for my sandwich at all (T_T) I also always get 3 basil drinks (buy 2 get 1 free) They're like bubble tea but healthier!  The basil seeds hydrate like chia seeds and are so addictive to try to chew!  One cup had moldy tasting basil seeds which was really disappointing.  I couldn't drink it.  So again, it seems like the quality was 2 hits for every 1 miss. 

Dear Vua owners, if you're reading this, I'm still very sad about my sandwich and drink.  I've been a loyal fan for the last 6 years but recently it's been disappointing.
