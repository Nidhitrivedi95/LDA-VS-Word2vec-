iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A I am a new to the Las Vegas Area, I order out several times a week.  Never would I have imagined, that I could make Chinese food better than the native Chinese.  The rice and noodles are not done, the Orange chicken horrible.  The only reason they got 1 star the Egg Foo young was a 2 1/2 stars.  Please do not order from this resturant is you like good food!!,
