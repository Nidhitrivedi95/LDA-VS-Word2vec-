PgaHjsWV3whvHF1CHU1rZg I stopped in on a business trip. I had to get staff attention to be seated, but I will attribute that to poor space layout. If you walk in, don't stop at the sign unless someone acknowledges you...it is unlikely you'll be seen.
I have rounded up my review from 3.5 stars. The food was OK, the portion sizes not overflowing, which is good for me, but the service was definitely lacking. I was seated, my order taken, my drink and food delivered, then I was not visited again until I hailed a passing staff member for my check. The food was a bit heavy on the sauce, but the vegetables were perfectly cooked and crispy and not mushy as they often are in Chinese food. I would probably eat here again as it is quick and offers a good value.
