yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA We wanted something quick, but filling, before the Billy Joel concert on Saturday and decided on pho. This place has been on my "to-do" list for a while even though there are some very mixed reviews.

We waited about 5 minutes for a table, gave our order to the waitress, and were served about 5 minutes later. FAST! Tables here are turned very quickly and efficiently so they can accommodate the crowds. 

We both had the number 16, combo Pho, and it was very good. The broth was not too salty or watery, there were plenty of ingredients in the broth, and the entire meal came together well. I've had slightly better pho in Vegas, but not at this price point.

Dinner for two was right at $20, which I consider to be very reasonable. I normally pay in the $15 range, per person...

The restaurant was clean, food was very good, and service was spot on as long as you realize they are able to offer these prices by turning tables quickly. If you are looking to have a leisurely meal that lasts an hour or more, this is not the restaurant for you.
