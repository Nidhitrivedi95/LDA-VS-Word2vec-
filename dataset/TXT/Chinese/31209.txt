9ok8nLK-8emYWbt6kwd-HA I had dim sum here. It was pretty pricey.

There were flies everywhere. There was a spider on the curtains.

The food was alright but pricey for regular Chinese food. The only thing that stood out was the custard egg yolk bun. That was amazing. But expensive. I don't think I'd ever come back, it was just dirty and not worth it for me.
