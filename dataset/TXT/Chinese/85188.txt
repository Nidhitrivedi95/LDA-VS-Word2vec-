hIqq6npOS-mSl58H7uyCkg My girlfriend came here with her mom, and thought it was so good that she had to bring me. I'm here to say that I'm glad she did! Though we were the only two in the restaurant, the service did not suffer. They were very attentive, and friendly as well! I had the Cashew Nut Chicken and my girlfriend had the Asian Noodles. Both came out in great time and were very tasty! The way their spice orders work, mild medium and spicy, are quite accurate. I had mine medium and it was just as I expected! I highly recommend coming here either for a great lunch it dinner.
