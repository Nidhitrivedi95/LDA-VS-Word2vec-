ud45YT67UCbtNfRxNeR2Yg Wasn't really impressed.  We arrived at 9:00 pm, so maybe the food wasn't very fresh because they were closing at 10, but wasn't very impressed.  The place was ok, but nothing special.  

The plates were wet at the buffet rack & weren't too clean.  All I can say is that I wasn't too impressed.
