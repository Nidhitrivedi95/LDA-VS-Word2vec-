mRubgo8WfjraJkE5Bvbf6w I believe I  had eaten here once before.  It was just as I expected.  Very clean, counter service. Clean interior.  Prices are decent for fast Asian Fusion Food.  They have pictures on the wall that show exactly what you are getting.  Approximately 32 dishes. From Korean, Japanese, Thai to Chinese.  Reminds me somewhat of a food court type of restaurant.  During the week they have lunch specials.  Probably get better deals then.  We were here on a Saturday and prices were a bit high for what this place is.  I had the sesame chicken rice bowl with white rice (you have a choice of brown or white) with lots of chicken a couple of pieces of green and red pepper.  I believe I counted 3 pieces.  Little bit stingy.  Another person had the Pad Thai, and a Katsui chicken.  It's, clean, fast service, decent food.
