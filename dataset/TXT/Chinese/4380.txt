_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Came here for a friend's birthday and this place is perfect for large group considering how big most of their seafood dishes are.  First let's talk about the food.  This place is known for their seafood, you can do anything from crab, lobsters, fish and anything you can think of that is edible from the sea.  Also, there are many flavours you can choose from on how you want your food to be cooked in.  With a group of 12+, we had lobsters, king crab legs, rice, fish and a veggie dish which were all included in a meal combo we ordered.  Overall the seafood are pretty fresh and they are well-made.  They also give you plastic gloves, so you can eat everything with your hand and it makes digging meat out from shells that much easier.

Only thing I do not like about this place is all servers will try to upsell you to go with the more expensive "combo" no matter how many people you have.  I am guessing servers get commission on up-selling?  This way of doing business really irritates me.

Price wise, this place is on the high end, but considering how good the food and how fresh the seafood were, I thought the price justifies itself.

In conclusion, this place is good to come with a large group of seafood lover, also do not be persuaded by the up-selling tactics from the servers and you should be able to enjoy a good meal
