eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ Yep. Underwhelming. The noodles weren't very good (I had the tonkotsu ramen, but I thought they were ok (my two friends didn't think they were ok). Dumplings were ok as well. Neither, I thought, were worth the price. I've bought their pork buns at their food cart on campus too, and I was like "seriously? $7 for this little food?" I mean, it wasn't bad, but they can only charge that much because we're in Nothingtown. The only thing I liked was the green tea creme brulee; that one was really good.
