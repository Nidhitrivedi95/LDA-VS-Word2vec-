The lollipop chicken and dry chili chicken were both delicious.   My partner and I had mixed opinions on the chicken pakora.  We both agreed that it would have been even better with more meat and less batter.  However we both agreed it had good flavor.  He wouldn't order it again but I would.  We will definitely return. It is a nice treat to have in the neighborhood.
