NImT1XHwwUmoHaPEjIIwRQ I found this restaurant on yelp with rave reviews, so my friend (who loves szechuan food) and I try it out.

upon walking in, we are the only chinese customers in the restaurant. the menu is mainly an english one with our favourite szechuan dishes missing (ex. Sichuan Boiled Fish and Cold Spicy Beef). maybe that's our ordering, but every dish was too fried, too greasy and too battered. we could not finish what we ordered and ended up with 3 boxes of leftovers. as a chinese person, i cannot recommend this restaurant ... instead, go 15 mins away for a much more authentic and flavourful szechuan experience @ http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hot-spicy-spicy-north-york
