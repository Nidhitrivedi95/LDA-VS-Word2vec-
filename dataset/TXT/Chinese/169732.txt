Vu6yNbKinh-54QT8i27LCw Absolutely DO NOT order from here. We ordered for the first time last night after hearing they delivered to Tremont. We called at 7:38 and were told it would be 45 minutes to 1 hour. After 1 hour and 15 minutes we called. Without saying hello someone screamed in the phone "it's on its way" and hung up. My husband called back again to see when it would be arriving and he was hung up on again. I called then and asked to speak to a manager and the woman on the phone who we had now spoken to multiple times just kept saying "I don't know English" when I was asking questions. There was someone speaking clear English behind her and I asked to talk to him and he also pretended not to speak English. Our food arrived almost two hours after we originally called after two more calls from my husband. The delivery person was the man who was speaking in the background so clearly the food was not on it's way after 1.5 hours nor had it been cooked. It is completely unacceptable to run a business and pretend not to speak English.  Also, the food was decent (compared with other limited options) but obviously not worth a 2 hour wait and being hung up on multiple times.
