MLwVTDhM2DOESvKGcfKCsg I've gotten food from here twice, take out both times. I ordered the cashew chicken a few months ago, and found when I got home that I was given the cashew chicken, but no rice. The food itself was delicious and I was lucky I had rice in my home, but it put a damper on the experience. When I wrote back Magic Wok through Eat24, they asked what I would like to be done about it. I said preferably to be sent some rice (I had already changed into my pajamas), or if they couldn't do that, to refund me the price of the rice. They then quickly notified that the cost of the rice would be refunded:

Then, Wednesday night my boyfriend and I ordered more. Cashew chicken (allergy friendly, thank you) for me, sesame chicken for him, and two spring rolls. When we got home with the bag, we opened it to find only half of the rice was there. Maybe I should've checked considering what happened last time, but I figured that was a one time thing. I was a little frustrated, but we had more rice at my apartment again.

I will still likely go back because the actual food was good, but will be certain to make sure that they don't skip on the rice from now on.
