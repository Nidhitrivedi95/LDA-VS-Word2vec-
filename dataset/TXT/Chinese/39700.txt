awZx3Y1PAwhCUpt3WGZhKg Delicious, Well priced, and great service 5/5. I great place to dine, have some tea or just chill out with friends

I came to Kenny''s for lunch not expecting the best from a Chinese cafe/restaurant as most places in Markham is just mediocre but Kenny's noodles really shot it out the park.

I had the cart noodles, with curry fish ball, red sausage, and beef brisket. It was a 6.99 for 2 toppings a deal with 1.50 add on for an extra topping. It was delicious the broth was salty and hot, noodles cooked great, and the beef brisket was tender and SO flavorful!!.

The French toast I ordered was also amazing, toast filled with peanut butter fried and drenched in condensed milk it was crispy and soft and chewy at the same time.

I filled myself up with 10 dollars at kenny's the prices here are fantastic

Onwards my friends and I talked for another hour with often tea replacement from the staff and nobody who bothered us go leave soon!! Which usually happens very often in Markham.

I'm super impressed, and I can't wait to go back for more cart noodles and French toast!
