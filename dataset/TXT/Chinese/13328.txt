2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA The good: oh sodium high, this place is where you can indulge in salt and be the meat eater that you are. I purchased a groupon and it was $12 for $20 worth of food for 2 people. 

I love how you can go up and get your own food. They have a buffet section where you can take your plate and choose as you wish, and however much you like at one cost! Includes drinks and desserts. You can also order unlimited lamb and beef dishes. 

The bad: although the buffet is great, it may not always be fresh, and it can be lacking in terms of the availability of food, but they do have the main staples (fish balls, spam, and veggies)
