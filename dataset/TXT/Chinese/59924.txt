DL7V1_chkWkZtyG4_xNYfw The food is ok. Use to be MUCH better before they changed the menu. But what was really off putting is that there was absolutely nothing on tables. ..no condiments & then when we asked for some soy sauce our request was met with the answer that they were cleaning all the containers, we were brought a little bowl of soy sauce.  it was about 8:40pm & they were closing up. If a business is open till whatever time...be open full service till then. Not 10 or 15 min before. It's just rude.
