More importantly, they had no qualms about recommending other types of restaurants.  It just shows that they're genuine ppl.  Wei definitely pays attention to every detail of his restaurant.  Even the bathroom was spotless.  I saw him take his lunch with a couple of customers that looked to be regulars.  This is a very down to earth place.  As for the food, I thought it was good.  I had the beef ramen.  I was given plenty meat, and when I was running low on broth, Huyen brought over more broth.  I had some left over, and she packed it up for me and included extra broth.  Incredible customer service.  My fiancee ordered the Hainanese chicken and salt baked shrimp.  I thought both dishes were good.  The chicken itself was not very flavorful though.  I know that it is simply poached, but I've had it before where it was more gingery.  Wei mentioned that he was vamping the menu soon to include new dishes and some desserts.  I can't wait to come back and see what he has to offer!
