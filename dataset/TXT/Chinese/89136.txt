I62j-QfY4tO_gMKV-celEA Love this place!  

There is a relatively large selection of fresh fruits and vegetables all offered at extremely reasonable prices.  

The dry goods section is not quite as impressive as larger stores like T & T but they cover all the basics.

The prepared goods at this store is not bad.  In fact, it is much better than the prepared goods at T & T.  At T & T all the prepared foods have a fairly strong preservative taste and smell that really turns me off.  

One of my favourite things to purchase at the Lucky Moose is a collection of prepared tofu/ bean curd offered in an aluminum(?) container in the tofu section of the store - far left/ opposite side of the fresh veggies. The cost is $4.99 but totally worth it since you can make a meal out of it with some white rice.  This is far superior to the similar tofu/ bean curd collection sold at T & T.  The deep fried tofu balls are also extremely tasty too.  And I have just discovered fresh shanghai noodles for $1.29 - delicious!!!

There is an elevated second floor - accessible by ramp or stairs - that features a meat area and a prepared foods section.  Food up on this second floor is not too bad ... not restaurant quality but it is extremely reasonably priced i.e., purchased a deep fried crab type thing and I think it was less than $5 - can't quite remember.  

Western foods are not overly priced - I have found oreos sold for $3 and I think the price of chips are also competitive.    

Although the aisles are narrow and the place typically crowded, this grocery store truly does make an effort to be accessible to the handicap (or in my case, baby in a stroller).

And of course, could the name of this grocery store be any cooler?!  

The only downside to this grocery store is that they do not offer a parking lot - you must pay for street or garage parking.
