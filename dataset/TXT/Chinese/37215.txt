An-JJle53UMHokU4MwFktg This deer garden is not as packed as the one on highway 7, so already that's #blessed. The waiting time is not long anyway, because it seems to be larger. Dragged the boy to eat here several times because he lives 5 minutes away and didn't even know there was a deer garden here.... *cue JB music* what do you mean?¿? 

The service varies here. It's always quick but not always friendly.. one lady that works here is all smiles, all the time while the other one looks like she's never smiled in her entire life. All good, the food comes out fairly quickly. It's weird how the drinks always come AFTER the bowls of deliciousness, when they can be made so much quicker. 

The food is consistent with the other chain. My friend loves the fish soup base offered here, while I always head for the laksa. So good and yummy, especially for a cold day. I love the thick rice noodle + corn.. geeeez, I love corn more than I can love a human baby. They never skimp out on the ingredients, and I always get more than I can finish. The prices are high, but that's expected for a noodle bar. Honestly, I don't know if I prefer chef papa more or deer garden. It really doesn't matter to me, it's just whichever one I'm closer to. I'm a noodle head, so I'm always down for it. 

+ the iced lemon tea is way too sweet.. definitely get it unsweetened or half sweet if you order it unless you want to end up with a sugar migraine.
