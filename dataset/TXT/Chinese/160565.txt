U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q While I only tried a small selection of what they had I was amazed by the taste. One of my favorite dim sum standards is the bbq pork buns which I believe they did amazing well. The reason I went was roasted duck sounded realllly good with my drinks in the room. Took some roast duck to go and believe me even after I finished I was still sucking the bones. So amazingly good.
