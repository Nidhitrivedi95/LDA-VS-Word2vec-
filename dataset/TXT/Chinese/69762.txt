F_D-hssVHgarfpqWbFdXow Was here for a group dinner as this is one of the favourite restaurant of a manager in which I work with.  We were a large group (nearly 20) and not everyone seems the most enthusiastic about the Mandarin.  

The good:  Huge selection of pretty much anything you desire to eat.

The bad:  Lots of unhealthy fried food with smaller selection of vegetables and bigger selection of the stuff that will expand your waistline ten fold.  

I tried the sushi as a starter.  Last time I ate here (probably 5 years ago) the sushi was  pretty bland and sub standard quality.  I was somewhat surprised that the quality was better but the selection was pretty much "beginner sushi".  Next plate was a mix of some noodles, fried food and veg.  Food has flavour but seems a bit more bland when it's on a buffet to me.  

This place is clean and if Asian buffets are your deal then serve it up!   

For me it's just a so-so!
