P6SBB1EPVJ6VwVnxuY0mww I was very impressed with Jimmy Chungs in Edinburgh.


 All staff members were keeping everywhere clean, and the food was being replaced constantly.


 The food tasted very fresh and was nice and hot.


 There was a huge selection of starters, main courses and desserts - including gateux.


 I would certainly visit this restaurant again next time we are in Edinburgh.
