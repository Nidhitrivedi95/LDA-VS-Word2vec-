uFTcyheegHAdRobLf_4Siw One of the rare places that are opened 24/7 in the Uptown area (aside from McDonald's/Tims/Shoppers). I haven't gone here in the past, so I can't any comparisons with the difference in quality. I can say that it's a great noodle place. 

I ordered the Lamb Noodle Soup ($7.49 small). I loved how warm the soup was. It had a flavourful lamb flavour with a hint of ginger. The noodles in itself were hand-pulled and had a bouncy texture. Superb! It had onions, a date and some goji berries in it as well as garnishes. The lamb was off the bone and I had about 6-7 small pieces so it's a lot more then I'd expect.

The pig ears ($4.99) were cut into thin slices and were soaking up a soy sauce. I loved it. You could eat it two ways: cold as is or soak it in the soup for a softer texture

They understand mandarin and english, but not cantonese.
