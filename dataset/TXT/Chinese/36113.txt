AKJ2qjHbvxqTxMx8hjX7sw Hey everybody! They're back!!! 

After a long hiatus (one year) I'm happy to report the restaurant is open. The food was a little off, the crab Rangoon had too much filling and was more creamy than before. The spicy beef and scallops wasn't spicy even though we ordered it extra hot. We were the only people dining in ( it was late) but the take out was steady. I know several people will be overjoyed to know that they are back in business.
