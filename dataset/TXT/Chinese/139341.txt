qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA Four of us had dinner. Salmon was excellent. Had what should have been a great appetizer. Requested chili paste. Could not tell by red color that it is 50% added salt. Manager said others have had the same complaint. Enjoy your dinner but skip the chili paste. (Manager took the appetizer off the bill that I could not taste because of excessive salt in chili paste.) Use Sriracha sauce instead!
