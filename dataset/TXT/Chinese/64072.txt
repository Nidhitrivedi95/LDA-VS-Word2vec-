Unfortunately the texture and the actual cooking of some dishes were very disappointing. Take for instance the Seafood Fried Noodles. It was bland except for it being overbearingly spicy. The dish lacked life but had the visual substance. The major disappointment of the evening goes to the String Beans. According to our server, the string bean are "suppose to be like that as it was deep fried." I've had plenty of traditional Chinese cooking, and can testify that the string beans are definitely deep fried; however, for a brief moment and then stir fried. Ultimately with the texture of it still being crunchy and full of "life." The way it was prepared here came out as if I was chewing on grass! It was tough, and did I mention it felt like I was eating grass? [Aside: I've had eaten grass years ago as it was accidentally mixed in a chives dish, and I thought it fun to try it rather than putting it aside. The string beans that evening was very similar to the grass I had a difficult time chewing.]. 

The Pork Bun was pathetic. And I wasn't particularly happy with the Scallops - I was expecting a warm dish, not cold. The flavouring and texture of the scallops wasn't my "cup of tea." 

Now, to the good stuff. The mango pudding was a winner, but at $10 it took away from the "value" aspect. Finally, for me, of all the other dishes we ordered, the Beef Ribs was the best entree of the evening.
