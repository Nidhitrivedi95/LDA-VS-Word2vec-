tK-PQOhZo94fonbQVXaOSg What a shit hole. ..can't believe this place is open.. The food is over priced..prices are set for a wine and dine not fast food atmosphere. .dishes are big. .but the taste wasn't that great...The floor was so slippery and wet I couldn't get up to get napkins  was just gross..never ever going back..
