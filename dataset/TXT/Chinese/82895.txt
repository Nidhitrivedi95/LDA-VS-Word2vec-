hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q I have dined at Everyday Noodles twice and I have to say my first experience was a lot different from the second. 

The first time, my mom and I ordered the shrimp and pork wonton soup to share! You got 8 wontons in a big bowl which is perfect for sharing.  For my meal, I ordered the Dan Dan noodles and my mom ordered the hot and spicy wonton noodles. I really really liked the Dan Dan noodles! It was a bit spicy but nothing I couldn't handle. 

The second time I ordered take out. I ended up getting the pork soup dumplings and the hot and spicy wonton noodles. I had high hopes for the soup dumplings because I heard a lot of great things about them. Sadly I wish I could say I liked them, but I didn't. The pork inside did not look cooked at all and did not taste cooked. So I threw the dumplings out. There also wasn't a lot of soy sauce inside the dumplings. I would have to say that the soup dumplings I have ordered at jimmy wans taste a lot better and have more soy sauce in them, which I like! The only thing is you get 4 soup dumplings at JWs instead of the 8 at Everyday Noodles. For my meal I ordered the hot and spicy wonton noodles. The title says it all, this dish was extremely spicy! I definitely prefer the Dan Dan noodles over this. 

I would come back to dine here because I would like to try some other dishes, but I know I wont be getting the soup dumplings. The pricing is extremely reasonable and you really do get a lot of food!
