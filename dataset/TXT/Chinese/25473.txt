7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ Got the potstickers, almost ribs, Mac and cheese, Chinese chicken salad, General "Chows" chicken, and the loco moco. Not one of them was satisfying. Everything was too sweet and they used the same chicken for the General Chow and the salad which seems lazy. 

Also had an unfortunate start to the meal when the waitress awkwardly stopped us from taking a picture of the dragon installation quoting the chef has a strict "no pictures" rule for patron privacy. Lame and unnecessarily pompous. So word to the wise, snap your photos clandestinely.

Beautiful space and food presentation though.
