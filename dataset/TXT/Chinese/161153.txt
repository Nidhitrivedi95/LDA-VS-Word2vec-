Ucph9MH577u6j0zPK93amw I'm a bit disappointed in this place. I read some good reviews and thought they would have good food. But from the start, it was a bad experience. 

I ordered the Chow Gei Kew and lettuce wrapped chicken. 
My husband got the Butterfly shrimp with extra shrimp and crab ragoons. 

First we get a call from the place saying that they can't put in extra shrimp because there is no room for them. The shrimp were "too big" to fit more in, even though we already paid for it. Since I did it online, I couldn't get a refund for the extra shrimp. The lady said I could call a number to get a refund but I declined. Whatever, $3 is $3. 
Why they didn't specify you couldn't get extra in a regular order, I don't know. That should be something they tell you before you order.

The lettuce wrapped chicken was okay, not what I expected but tasted fine. The chicken came separate from the lettuce, so you had to put the two together. The sauce was good though. 

My Chow Gei Kew was not as good. As soon as I opened the container I got a very weird smell from it. It wasn't a rotten smell but it was very unpleasant and didn't seem right at all. The chicken tasted fine but the smell was so off putting that I couldn't eat any of it with out smelling it. I don't know if the sauce was rotten or the chicken or vegetables were, but I did not want to eat it anymore after that. 

My husbands was fine though. His was pretty much shrimp, bacon and fried egg in a brown sauce. Not very Chinese but he said it was good. Crab Ragoons were okay, nothing special. 
He did say that there definitely looked like enough room to put more shrimp in. 

Only reason why I gave it two stars not one was because at least my husband liked his food. I don't think we will be ordering from here again. Very disappointed.
