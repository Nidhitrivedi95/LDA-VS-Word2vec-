BwbPzuEuIN_oFmNRJIgHlg Ordered the beef stew with noodles. As the waitress was pouring the hot stew into the bowl, she ended up pouring some onto my leg which consequently severely burnt my thigh.  She's lucky I didn't make a scene. In addition we requested for our two pots of Ruby tea to be refilled and as a result, we merely had one refilled. In conclusion the waitresses do not listen,  are incredibly careless and are merely "working" by standing in the back of the restaurant, gossiping about everything and everyone that they have come across today. 

Pros: good music. 



PS the washroom is horrid
