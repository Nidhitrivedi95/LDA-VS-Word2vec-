I got the kung pau beef it was spicy and yummy fresh onions and green bell peppers that were good and not over cooked. The accompanying noodles were over cooked and turning into mush the fried rice was well just kind of bland and boring.  The staff was very attentive. Not bad in a pinch, but there are better fastfood chinese places.
