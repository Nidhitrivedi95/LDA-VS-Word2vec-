Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I don't care what South Park says, this place rules!

This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Casino.  We went in and were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait.... we were going to leave, but the host told us he'd sit us on the patio immediately.  Awesome!  

From the patio, you have a great view of the strip.  My only complaint was the awkward view of the back of the horse statue.....weird :-)

The wonton soup was delicious!  Big enough for two to share.

If you like tea, try the dragon tea.  I tasted some of my boyfriend's and it was amazing.  And it comes out in this cute little cast iron pot!

Entrées are large, I'd say order soup, one entrée and share!
