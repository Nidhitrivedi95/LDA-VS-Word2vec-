wcFscp4-QH0PJeIW1EOQEQ Worst pretense of Chinese food I've ever tasted. 
Tasted,  because my wife and I could not finish any of it. 
I had mango  chicken. The chicken was incompletely cooked and there were a few snow pea pods,  pieces of cabbage,  and firm,  tasteless mango.  
She had sesame chicken.  Tasteles and  overcooked,  
Our miso soup was generous in quantity but had almost no detectable miso.
The spring rolls seemed soggy not fresh as if they had been microwaved not cooked fresh. 

  We found it to be awful.  The common theme is: tasteless.
