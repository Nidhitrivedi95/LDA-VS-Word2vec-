The food itself isn't that great. Everything is either too greasy, drowning in sauce, or both. Also, I wish they'd fill the boxes with less rice and more of the entree. I've had the beef noodle soup, which is flavorful but greasy. Both the beef and broccoli and chicken and eggplant dishes had too much sauce. I rarely go; usually, I bring people here only because they're curious about the cheap Chinese food.
