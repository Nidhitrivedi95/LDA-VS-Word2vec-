1. Lunch set-menu $8.99 includes a main course (rice/noodles), a drink (can choose from a list of hot or cold) or soup, salad
Great Value.  They change the menu once in a few months.  There are 6 different options to choose from, examples would be braised beef with rice, marinated chicken with rice, soup noodles etc.  There are so many options that you will never have a problem picking something that you like. Nice because there is always a salad and some side veggies that come with it.  My only complaint is that the taste can be a little salty for me at times (however i believe that's the norm for Taiwanese cuisine).

2. Dinner set-menu $13.99-14.99.  $14.99 set menu comes with a main dish (rice/noodle), a side salad, a side appetizer (tofu/veggie), a soup, and a drink.  Lots of food.  Again the taste is a little salty for my taste.  But definitely good value.

3.  Very nice and comfortable decor as a bubble tea place.  Come by yourself, or come as a group, both very nice.  Service depends on the person serving you, some very nice, some just so-so.

4. **VIP card - $10 for one year, $20 for two year if I remember correctly.  Get it if you are a regular customer.  Get 10% every time! You will get your money back easily. 

5. ** if you like brewing tea, Carmen is the nice lady at the tea section.  She is very nice and knowledgeable and for sure will be able to help you.  I think she is there most of the time.

5.  Side note: This is a better place for bubble tea, because for example the Taro bubble tea, they use real taro in the drink... as opposed to other stores.  I was told by my friend that even some smaller Ten Ren they use only powder as opposed to the real taro in this store.
