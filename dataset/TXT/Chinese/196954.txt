ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg I must start by saying that consider myself a "foodie," and although I occasionally enjoy Chinese cuisine, I never consider it to be worthy to be considered among the "great meals" of life.  Until I ate at Jasmine, that is...

My husband and I were looking for a place to enjoy an early, light meal as we had tickets to two shows starting at 7pm. As we walked along perusing our choices, something drew us toward Jasmine. We spoke to the hostess and found there were tables available (due to being really early) and when told of our concern about completing our meal on time for the show, she assured us that they would make sure that we made it on time. 

Then along came Janet, our server. She was simply a joy!!!  Very helpful and friendly while also unintrusive.  She made suggestions when asked and even gave an impromptu chop sticks lesson!  

We really wished we could enjoy the "Jasmine Experience," a complete meal listed on the menu from appetizer to dessert, but we're concerned about being overly full, so we passed and chose our own meal plan.  We started with the hot & sour soup & spring rolls. Simply divine!!!  Main course:  sweet & sour pork for my husband (served in a fresh pineapple!) and the General's chicken for me along with sticky rice. OMG!!!  I tried both and can not say enough to do them justice!!!  The meat had the most wonderful crisp texture while at the same time being tender!!!  Fresh pineapple in the pork dish simply melted on your tongue!!!  We also enjoyed two types of cucumber based cocktails that we also enjoyed greatly!

Now, the food and service were enough to justify the 5 star rating, but we haven't mentioned the atmosphere. I'm not a fan of oriental decor, but this place is simply beautiful, and the great view of the Bellagio dancing fountains just brought the whole experience to life. This was among the best meals of my life!!!
