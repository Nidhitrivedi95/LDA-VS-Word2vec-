pTvL6Upfp91J1ryrCZpzgg I went here for lunch around 3pm on a Friday. This place is horrible. The majority of items were gone and not quickly replenished, if at all. For example, the sweet and sour sauce was in a pan to a depth of about 1/8 inch and was completely gelatinous due to old age. In fact, most of the food that tasted as though it was probably yesterday's leftovers- dehydrated and chewy. About half of all dishes remained empty the entire time I was there. As for taste, everything was swimming in an excess of oil (even for a Chinese buffet). 

The crab rangoons were sweeter than usual and I did not see any crab in them- definitely not the best I've ever had.

The desert selection was pathetic.

I will not be going again.
