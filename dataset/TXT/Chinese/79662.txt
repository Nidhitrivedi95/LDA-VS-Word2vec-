GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg Have been going to this restaurant often, because a family member is a vegetarian. Completely breaks the stereotype that vegetarian food is bland and boring! High quality food, well plated, and excellent and polite service. Probably the best Chinese style vegetarian place. For those who do not like the "mock meats" there is still plenty to choose from vegetable and tofu wise (ex. fruit salad spring rolls=yum!). In addition, to the people that actually care, they have  good quality tea, and a decent selection as well. One downer is that you will be paying ALOT for the delicious veggies and well...gluten(what they use to make the mock meat). However, I believe it's worth every penny [especially since i never pay the bill in this restaurant ;) ]! And there's complementary dessert too btw.

I recommend: the fried milk (dessert), pumpkin (mock) sharkfin soup, classic sweet and sour pork (you won't believe its not meat!) and the lettuce wrap!
