5GOrW-PkisP0eXlSxy4AFg I absolutely love everything I get from this place. All of the food is really good and the price perfect!

   That being said, my only complaint/warning would be the online ordering. I have ordered egg drop soup as my add-on for the lunch special several times now and have ended up receiving an egg roll. After calling the restaurant to let them know what happened, they asked for the egg roll back (I declined in fear it would make its way to someone else's order). I would recommend calling an order in if it contains soup.
