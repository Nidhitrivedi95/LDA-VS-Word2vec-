C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ This restaurant is a good choice for Chinese food, if you are in this area or Toronto. Nice atmosphere and a really good menu selection, especially the Vegetarian offerings. The food is really good and reasonably priced.

My only complaints, which kept me from giving this place a 4-star rating are: 1- One of the dishes they sent us was not what we ordered, but it was not a big issue (similar item), and; 2 - They did not provide rice with the entries.

Other than my only 2 complaints, I would definitely eat here again (either lunch or dinner) if ever in this area of Toronto again.
