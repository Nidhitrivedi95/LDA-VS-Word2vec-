jDZJsIyc3jXjcTtJk_p8ZA Standard American Chinese food. Nothing in particular on the menu stands out to me, and I tend to avoid their greasy MSG-filled food if I can, but credit has to be given to their service catered toward university students. Their food is okay once in a while, especially if you're in a rush. That said, it is strange to me how nearly every time the meal is brought out within 10 minutes (5 if you're taking it to go, especially the lunch specials). I try not to think about how much of the food has already been pre-made in the kitchen.

For a sit-down meal, the place is nice in that it usually is not too loud, and there are always available tables; the place is never overbooked. There is always at least one waiter around, so if you need anything they get to you pretty quickly.
