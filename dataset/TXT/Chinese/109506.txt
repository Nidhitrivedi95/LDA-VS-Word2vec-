lOW5kH6nHVOYfmoAfpWvHw This is my fourth review of Miu's Cuisine. We have liked it so much we return often. 

However some things are changing for the worst. It's starting to look a little long in the mouth. The floor really needs a scrubbing. There was an absolutely filthy table cloth on the table just inside the entrance; still there when we left. The long fluorescent lights in the ceiling add nothing to the decor and should be removed. Lastly the two tables holding the rice pot, food boxes and bags should be moved into the space behind the wall in the vacant room where the john's are. They are a distraction to the already bleak decor. 

To the meal; here again things are changing for the worst. We ordered our usual:

Hot and sour soup: Was way off flavor not even tasting like it and not very sour, way too much drizzled egg and had been reduced in size by 1/3.

Kung Pow Chicken: Again off flavor, and way too many peanuts - Just OK

Yu Xiang Eggplant: Way over cooked. The eggplant was so mushey you could not pick it up with chop stixs without it disintegrating; very disappointing. Told the waitress about it, but nothing was done! Not even an offer to remake the dish or a dollar off the bill.

Water Boiled Fish: Superb! the one saving grace of the meal.

The white rice was just tepid, almost cold.

Gone are the cloth napkins, replaced with small paper ones. A shame because they added a little class.

In all a disappointing visit today. It will be a while before we return.
