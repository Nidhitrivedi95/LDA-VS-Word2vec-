H94fBucKEuNKsjbSy7WODg We had a great time getting to know the owner Swani. She and her husband shared how they have been in business here in Tempe for almost 40 years. The food and service are top knotch! They were even nice enough to accommodate our huge party of 30 people.

Thank you for the great service and amazing food. We will be back again for sure.
