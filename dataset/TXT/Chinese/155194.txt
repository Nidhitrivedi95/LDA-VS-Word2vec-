I went in on my last holiday home and felt like I had stepped into a time warp. Even the prices were relatively similar to when I was younger. 

The food was also the same, with my favourite Chicken with Almonds still on the menu and served with an egg roll.

It's not haute cuisine, but it is yummy and the staff are still the best.
