OygJyqypKFZJIZ6r9dML7w New Markham Villa is in a hidden street of Old Kennedy which to non Markham/Scarborough Citizens, it doesn't even exist but to those residents especially of Chinese descent it is well known because it is in the same building as Club 300(Bowling Alley).   3.5 *Star*

New Markham Villa has been one of the places I frequent once-in-awhile for Dim Sum.  This time it has been a long while but I'm happy of the outcome as I enjoyed good quantity in some of the dishes(Fish Maw Cotton Chicken, Bean Curd Wrap, Beef Tendon, etc...) while ONLY paying ----$1.69(!)---- per dish on this weekday morning.  Quality wise is standard which means value-wise this is one of the CHEAP eats spots.  Awesome!

Outside of the special priced hours and during weekends the price only goes up to $1.99 each except for XL items which are $2.80 at anytime/anyday.  The selection list is reasonable and the patrons are again your accustomed elders with newspapers.  

The Congee cart is sometimes left in the corner where if you're a regular you can go pick up some Peanuts for snacking.  The Take-out styrofoam boxes and Bags are hidden away which might annoy some people that like self-serve(otherwise known as free goodies).

11 items for $22.64 plus on our bill the Tea was COMP'D.  This wasn't a Push-cart place but maybe they become one during the weekends when the crowd comes a-knocking.  The Dim Sum menu is in CHINESE, so bring me with you next time.   :P
