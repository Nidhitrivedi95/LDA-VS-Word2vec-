18xmM5Z3fwcI6UD0M4M8mg this one remaind me good times,it was one week after my birthday my friends of mine invited me there for a surprise party for me it was my first time to go there, they even bought a birthday cake by themselves from outside but guess what, in a buffet! a place full of dessert and sweet things  we couldn't even start eating the cake! btw i'm so thankful to them for that it was very thoughtful of them :) 

Anyway, basically  buffets are always great you can get lots of food for a cheap price per person but the point is i don't like Chinese foods very much i mean whats point of not having a meat that you can say with confidence  ok "this is it!.... i know what this meat made of " the thing im try to is i couldn't find a real taste of steak at all buffet, instead you there was a plenty of frog legs! good thing is they had chicken roast which is good because chicken is always chicken! they had peperoni  pizza too.

But I liked the dessert including: ice-creams,cakes, desserts in any culture are good and sweet :P in salads you have a variety of choices and for fruit melons and oranges and strawberries ...

after all it was a ok place
