U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q DISCLAIMER: I'm Chinese. I love food. So this review is going to be a generally harsher review - I WILL rate this according to what actual Chinese food is like. 

1. Overpriced 
But this is Caesars Palace after all. So just go knowing that. 18 dollars averagely per plate. 

2. Food was very American Chinese. Not at all authentic.

I had a hand pulled brisket noodle. The noodles were fresh but not very spongy and a bit flat and too thick. The soup was lacking in stock and had a layer of oil on top that was unnecessary and just made the dish oily and not tasty in the right way. But I will say that the beef brisket itself was tender enough.

I also had the Pork Soup Dumpling which was decent. The Pork inside was flavourful but the Dumpling itself was too thick and lacked sophistication. 

The environment is pleasing - contemporary looking and with goldfish aquariums inside. 

3. Service 
Is not great. It's alright. But not great. We had finished our meals for 15 mins already and no one came to get out plates. 

CONCLUSION
I'm giving this 1 star for the decor and the beef brisket itself.
