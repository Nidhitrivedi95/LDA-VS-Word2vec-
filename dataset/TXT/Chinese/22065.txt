6gF-m1csJtckBSJEmIpsTg Ordered the crab Rangoon tonight which were very good. We tried a new dish, Singapore noodles veg, which were also very good but extremely spicy. It would be even better toned down a bit. I like hot and this was realllly hot. Micheal stopped by our table and asked if we would order it again and we said prob not because it was so hot and he said he could make it next time with less heat just let him know.
