3Ou9p4zIJg4utQh7MDgKFg I just went to the Panda Express on Southern and Stapley to get one of their boba teas it is 1015 in the morning and they are open & like coffee drinkers I like tea in in the morning. I went through the drive thru I placed my order went up to the window and was told none of their Teas are  brewed...... and that's it. They did not tell me how long it would be if I wanted to wait they didn't offer anything and I feel if you're open for business you need to have everything available or make up for it not just tell me sorry no teas are brewed and shut the window. If you're a business and you have open and close hours that means when your open you should have everything available and when you close it means you should close at the time that it says and not 20 minutes early. I am so bummed about this place because this is my third chance I've given it and each time was horrible the time before this one I had to give them my order literally 7 times in a row because she kept deleting it .
