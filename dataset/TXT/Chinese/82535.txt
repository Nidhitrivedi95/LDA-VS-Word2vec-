haa0u6VwTWBXbIW0mxlSGw Just tried chocking down what this place called Kung Pao Chicken. About three pieces of chewy chicken covered, I mean absolutely covered in peanuts and cucumbers. Chicken fried rice also had the same consistency (chewy) chicken. Horrible, tasteless and I hope I don't have to visit emergency room later for uncooked chicken.
