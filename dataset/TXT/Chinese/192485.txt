The Mongolian grill section is decent, though you really need to be selective in terms of what sauces and liquids to use.  It's sort of a game of Russian roulette.  I enjoy the lamb, and I do recognize that all the meats are frozen (what are you gonna do for a $12 lunch?).

The traditional buffet table is small, but is more of a side-show compared with the grill.  There's a few quasi-dim sum items there, which is a nice touch.

Overall, not bad for a lunch spot or business lunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it either.
