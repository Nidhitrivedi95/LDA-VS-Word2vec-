M0A8RFdN1UqSd-tIqXFEBQ I read the reviews on Yelp after driving by on my way home.  I don't like fast food Chinese or Mexican.  The reviews looked great so we decided to give it a try about 3 weeks ago on a Saturday at about 6p.m.  There was no one there and a note on the door closed for emergency.  Seemed odd but being a family business we figured that no back up staff which is silly when in business especially restaurant business.  Last week we decided to give another chance and stopped there on a Friday evening.  Same thing closed but no sign indicating closed.
Not sure what happened but all the furniture is there but closed during regular hours.  Bummer because we need good Chinese.
