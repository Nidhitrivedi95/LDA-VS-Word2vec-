JPfi__QJAaRzmfh5aOyFEw I ordered spicy wontons and beef shank hand pulled noodle soup. Both really good! Service is great! Food is good, fast and reasonably priced. Broth is really good. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I personally prefer the hand pulled noodles to be a little bit thinner than this. Too thick and tough. The properly done string pulled noodle should be slightly thinner, smooth yet a little chewy at the same time. Again, this is personal preference. Overall, great place!
