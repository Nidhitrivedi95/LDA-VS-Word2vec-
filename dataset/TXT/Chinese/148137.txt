sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA Sam's Congee is an institution in Market Village. You will discover long lineups during breakfast and lunch. You will be pointed to sit with random strangers on communal tables. The place while is clean (to Chinese standards) isn't exactly inviting and the staff are not particularly polite or rude.
However, people come here for the quick service and most importantly for the food. I will proclaim that Sam's makes the best congee in the city! Their prices are low and the portions are average I would say.
Fantastic food, fast service and affordable prices -- these are reasons' why Sam's is my go-to place for congee (just not during the weekend mornings when the lineups are out the door).
