fTz6EQVya08b5ZzrYLsX-A A Groupon got me a 60 minute deep tissue massage for $35. Worth every penny. 

This place is definitely no-frills: the walls are thin (i.e. you can hear conversations in the next room and traffic noise from the Danforth) but they seem to specialize in acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine rather than posh spa services.

The staff is friendly and the massage therapists are well-trained. If you're looking for a fancy spa experience, this is not the place. But if you want authentic acupuncture and other such services, this might be the right place (as the name suggests).
