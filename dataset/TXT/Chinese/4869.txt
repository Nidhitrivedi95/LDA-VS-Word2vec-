_YerZzosnwAs6R6p1FNkUQ I tried this place for three reasons. 1)  I've been searching for a better Chinese food restaurant than where we go now. 2) Several weeks ago someone dropped off a menu at our house. 3) Decided to try something new. 

Delivery took only 25 minutets and the food arrived very hot. 

My wife ordered the beef with broccoli. I ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce. My wife took one bite and said the beef was tough and the broccoli was hard (it wasn't coooked enough). She also said her dish smelt weird. At that point I dug into my shrimp & lobster sauce. It was more like egg drop soup than any shrimp and lobster sauce dishe I have ever tried anywhere. I also paid extra and got fried rice instead of white rice. It was so bland it was inedible. Everything went  immediately in the trash

We  also ordered  Wor Wonton Soup and got a free entree which we were planning on having for lunch or dinner tomorrow. Since we put the entrees in the trash nd were hungry we decided to give the soup a try. There was large chunks of pork in the soup which looked good but after trying a piece I was sure that was not how the meat was supposed to taste. My wife agreed and we ended pouring it down the drain. We then tried the free almond chicken entree.  Again the dish was nothing short of  disgusting! so it went directly into the trash as well.

FOOD: wanted to really enjoy it, but honestly, the food was detestable. We both  nearly gagged just after tasting it. To say our food was dissatisfactory is an understatement. STAY AWAY!!!! PRICE: Wasn't worth the price even if it was free.. SERVICE: Fast delivery.  CONCLUSION:  I have rarely been this disappointed with a restaurant . If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This is the worst chinese restaurant ever!



Dinner cost $28.37 and it ALL went down the drain or in the trash. I will never order from this establishment again. STAY AWAY!!!!
