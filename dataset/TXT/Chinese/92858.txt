iuIkzvQRb4DVWOMhE4GI3g I have never been conflicted about a review, I am always straight forward. This was, well odd. We were greeted by a very welcoming hostess. Our seats were not even in the chairs and we had water and were asked if we needed anything else, awesome right?

Then we got the menu, my daughter and I wanted mei fun. And I thought I made that clear to the waiter, but obviously not. I know that different people call mei fun different things. So I explained thin white rice noodle and what he brought out to us was not what I ordered:-( I was so bummed. I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to send it back and then I didn't want be super bitchy. Morale of the story make sure you and your waiter are on the same wave length. 

I also learned that dumplings and Gyoza are different:( very different. We also had the California roll. It was not bad. So maybe if I am ever in this area again I will stick to the rice and sushi. I won't count this place out it was an honest misunderstanding, just pissed that I paid for something that I essentially picked at! Oh well I suppose that I have wasted more than 25 dollars on more crap. I did leave a tip.
