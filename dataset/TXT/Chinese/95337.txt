JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ make your own! mix beef chicken and noodles and a few veggies! and then create your very own flavor!. 

i get the large bowl and a to go box. fill it with beef and push it down with the wax paper. and keep stuffing meat in to the top. the pile on some veggies and pile up a huge mound of noodles! my bowl sits aleast 12-16 inches high!! but the key is to go and grab another lg bowl up where they make your food! this bowl you fill with your own sauce!! then hand them both bowls and its on!!! if you do it the way i said you will have a bowl and a to box filled to the rim! and eat it all day lol
