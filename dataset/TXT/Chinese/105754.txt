The server is extremely helpful and friendly. The portions generous but the flavor isn't there. 

For $8.50 you have a good array of dinner menus to choose from and for around $5 for lunch. Specials include egg rolls, wontons, soup, choice of rice and chow mein. 

I ordered "double cooked pork", it isn't double cooked pork. Rather it is just some veggies bbq pork stir fry. It was very disappointing and they should not have put the name up if the item is not what it's suppose to be. 

My friend ordered sesame chicken and it turned out to be orange chicken with about 20 pieces of sesame on one piece of nugget. I'm not exaggerating. 

anyway, probably won't be coming back to this place. Quite unfortunate because it has potential and a good service.
