D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Had dinner here today Tues Mar 29, 2016 at 8:30pm and like most restaurants in the Strip, it was overpriced. The Beef with Sukiyako over rice was disappointing. I thought it would be seasoned better.

The waitress failed to make eye contact with me, the one who was footing the bill, but made eye contact with the other two in my party. She did not receive a tip from me.
