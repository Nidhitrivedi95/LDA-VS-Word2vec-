BbPVtY7hzBPnpRrZMBElIg i enjoyed almost everything here except the seafood combination tray tasted like it was bad,it even smelled bad.The rest of the buffet was average for a super buffet.I liked the won ton soup it was better than most places but it was the only thing that stood out.I was kind of leery about all the food after i had that bad shrimp.I told the hostess about the dish and she told me they were fine and even ate one.They smelled like dirty socks and i love shrimp i know what they should smell and taste like.I hope i dont get the shits later.If it had not been for that dish they would have gotten 3 stars.
