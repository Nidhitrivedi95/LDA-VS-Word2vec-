OXW2erFOPT-Oov6wChxWYA 2.5/5 since my standards for Asian food are high.  When comparing the food quality with what you get up Markham, this place isn't that great and is over priced.  But considering there aren't much competition for this type of food around downtown, it's okay.  I got the Kung pow chicken with fried rice for an extra $1.  Skip the fried rice cause from the picture, is quite sad.  The Kung pow chicken isn't too bad.  The soup dumpling is average and the pot sticker is okay.  You know it's westernized Chinese food when they give you fortune cookies...
