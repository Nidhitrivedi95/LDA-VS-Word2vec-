Km0sT7E_dc2U1BkyRoy1xA Service was terrible first time here because dirty martini was closed. Sat outside on a slow Sunday, silverware was dirty took at least 10 mins with food at the table for someone to come by and acknowledge our existence. Decent drink specials food was terrible bland, pad Thai smelt like wet dog, beef shaking something "special" was again bad but more flavor than the pad Thai. Poor service as I said silverware and chop sticks both dirty. Don't know if this place has been around a while but I couldn't see it being around long. Avoid.
