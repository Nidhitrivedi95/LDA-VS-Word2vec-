RlNmDWJ0kkEWXW7yORJZVw $7.50 each for a group of six and a half people (the half person paid a few bucks) for 6 large portioned dishes, including tea, tax and tip = great value!  Congee Wong is often our default Chinese restaurant for random get togethers due to its central location from all four directions in the GTA.  It's the common denominator taste wise.  Nothing too great to brag about and nothing so bad that no one would eat it.  It also has enough menu choices so that most people shouldn't go home hungry.  The lines are often long, though they do move quickly.  Its a good choice for large groups if you're willing to wait a little.
