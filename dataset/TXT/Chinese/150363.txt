SUktrYdNQD8k2vvkM4OpfA The dirties place I've been into in my life . Roaches everywhere in kitchen . 
Raw meet cut in the morning left on trays under the freezers and fridges at room temp on floor all day .
Watched employee eating off customers plate before bringing out . 
Food containers left open overnight and all the sauces open at room temp . I'm in shock they haven't been shut down!
Took many pictures I will be sending to the health dept .
