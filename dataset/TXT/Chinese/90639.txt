IHX9FiUyNxxGFgFS5rTOxQ Best peanut butter dumplings in Montreal. Fried spinach and General Joe Chicken is THE best. Tommy has owned the restaurant for years and the food has always been great! All his chicken is white meat rather than the gamey scraps the restos in Montreal Chinatown use. He gets to know his regular clientele by name and memorize your orders throwing in treats of he likes you, Very generous portions for delivery. Super fast delivery or pickup. Dining room is fine, but usually empty as catering and delivery are his primary businesses. Highly recommended.
