RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg I Love this place. I think they have the best lemon chicken in all of Las Vegas. I don't eat sushi however my family does and they love it so I give it a five just because of the lemon chicken. My family likes it because it's half off of most of the sushi rolls not sure what time that is but it's in the afternoon I believe
