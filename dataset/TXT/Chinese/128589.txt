PglC8rgguMIlT621p1BLdQ Las Vegas has some of my favorite eats in the world but I stand by what I've said: They just can't do dim sum right!

But when comparing it to other dim sum places in Las Vegas, Yum Cha is okay. We ordered a variety of the typical standard fare. Most dishes are bland but still palatable. I like the squash/pumpkin found in the black bean spare ribs but I think they were using it as fillers to give less meat. Food was served hot from the steamers and didn't appear to be reheated leftovers from the day before so that's a big plus. Don't forget to look at the heated bar holding some more food like congee with Chinese doughnuts and liver and tripe with daikon.

The staff was very attentive and the place was clean. Yum Cha, cute name and all, is a decent place to get your dim sum eats if you're in town but don't go in with high expectations.
