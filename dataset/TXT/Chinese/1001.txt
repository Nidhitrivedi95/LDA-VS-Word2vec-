-Gxe5gKrskrgbWyLkz7UGQ Although Steph had said this doesn't in any way epitomise Scottish culture, I have to be a sharp tongued critic and disagree. Getting to stuff your face and pretending you're cultured for eating takeaway oriental food is what being Scottish is all about for many people! 

That's probably why a small part still apeeals to me. I used to live for Chinese buffets, but am growing more cynical as my palate develops with age.

Don't get me wrong, it's great for teenagers and big parties where you're having to find a good middle ground in terms of food. If your auntie hates Indian while your mum won't tolerate pasta, it puts you in a bit of a predicament. Step forth the buffet, since buffets are usually more Americanised that representative of a single country's cuisine.

Jimmy Chungs is no exception to this. For just over £12 at peak times you can fill yourself silly with sweet and sour, chips, and spring rolls to your heart's content. Jimmy's is big, well laid out and signposted so you won't get lost between kung po and banana fritter. The food isn't bad - it didn't make me sick, for sure - but can sit in your tummy awfully heavily after a meal.

There is where I agree with Gavin - the dreaded MSG is added, so that all you can eat turns rapidly from a glutton fest to feeling like you're pregnant. It's the closest men will get to experiencing pregnancy symptoms, but perhaps won't get away with the excuse of potent pregnancy farting as much as a girl would, even after a Jimmy Chung's.

But enough of my descent into Potty Talk - not to be avoided, but not my first destination, either.
