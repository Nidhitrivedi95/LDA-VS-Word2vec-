6KCe0TR1dz3GqkwBDwgRYA The Healing House has been my go to when my back and shoulders feel tense. Muki is a Acupuncture guru! There is also a membership program for $99 a month. It allows me to receive two acupuncture services a month, along with discounts and other services like massage. Super affordable and worth every penny.
