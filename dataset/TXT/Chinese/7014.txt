0oSWfLMJZnl2HhOc2lQb2g I love this place!! I have being going there since they opened.  I love everthing on the menu.  I am on the HCG diet and I go in everyday and buy the barbecue chicken and the fresh veggies.  It has helped with my diet.  I don't have to cook and it works.  I love the taste of the BQ Chicken, it's grilled fresh and the veggies are always so fresh.  When I am on my normal eating pattern, I call in special orders, for example Wonton Soup with out salt.  The house fried rice is so good, they put big shrimp into the mix.  Oh, my nephews just loves the orange chicken.  But don't let me forget to tell you about the staff.  The cooks are so friendly and get right on your special order.  And the cashiers are very nice and helpful.  I recommond the Red Dragon Express to anyone.  I don't like Panda Express because their food just doesen't taste right.
