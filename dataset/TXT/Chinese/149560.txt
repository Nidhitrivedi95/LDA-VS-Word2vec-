sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg From out of town on business, I was shopping for groceries and saw Tott's Asian Diner on the other side of the parking lot.  I looked it up on Yelp and saw the great ratings.  I tried the pepper chicken and was not disappointed.  I will try to make it back in the next couple of weeks to try the infamous orange chicken.
