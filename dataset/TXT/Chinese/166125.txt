VaLnPWq6cLnK5x2wXBVOKQ Another surprise tucked inside of a plaza. This is a very tiny Hong Kong Cafe. We came for afternoon tea and was seated quickly as we just missed the lunch rush.  They have a good variety of items for afternoon tea.  I chose the black pepper beef with fettuccine.  The other dish we ordered was on their lunch menu,  baked pork chop with tomato sauce with rice. Imo to really try if a hk cafe is good, you need to try a baked item.  
First and foremost the afternoon pasta dish was a really good portion (even for lunch) and their beef was really fresh and the sauce had just the right amount of saltiness.  They also added some mushrooms which was a nice touch.  Pasta was cooked al dente. I would definitely order this again and would recommend it. 
The baked pork chop with rice was delicious.  Ingredients were fresh, sauce was tasty and not too salty.  
One more thing to add is that their lunch combos come with a soup and garlic toast. The soup we got was cream of mushroom and I loved how they pureed it as not often do I see hk cafés doing this. Thumbs up! 

The only thing that was not too good were the drinks.  The honey lemon water was a tad too sweet and the yin yang drink was not as smooth as I am use to.
I would definitely come back though for their food!!
