1jNteKQ2JuF6Sk1SI9X23Q PF Chang's is alright--just alright. I've been here a few times and it's an interesting environment. The food is really good while you're eating it and they've made a good brand for themselves. Most of the time service is above-par. 

I would imagine it would be a great place to go to with your family, but ultimately I can't get over how their food makes me feel. 

The funny part is I'm not one to ever complain of a food sensitivity or be affected in the stomach, but there's just something about this food, perhaps that it's so salty and deep-fried that really has me feeling sluggish at the least after a meal here.

It also feels a little assembly-line and artificial.
