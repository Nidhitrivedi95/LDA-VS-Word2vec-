X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Damn...this club really packs in the crowd. I see reviewers commenting on the pickpocketing problem and I can definitely see how it could happen on the dancefloor. You are pretty much pressed up against everyone around you. My purse got caught on some guy's belt and he freaked out as I kept trying to untangle myself, thinking I was trying to either pickpocket or molest him (neither.. sorry, buddy!) I also didn't like how they forced us to check our coats prior to entering. Even the big European guys next to me were complaining about how cold it was. When you're a girl in Vegas, chances are you aren't wearing much. How dare they make me take off my mini jacket that didn't even have a back! I was super freezing and annoyed, but at least it helped us figure out a way to sneak our friends to the front of the line of the club. Ha! In yo face, Hakkasan!

Once we were inside, it wasn't that bad. The music was awesome as we went on a night Calvin Harris was spinning. Hip hop room downstairs was super fun, playing all the old school jams. And despite my own sloppy friends spilling a round of drinks on me, we were troopers and stayed until the wee hours of the morning. I'd go again, but probably not in the summertime as I'm sure it'd be even more crowded and stuffy. No thanks.
