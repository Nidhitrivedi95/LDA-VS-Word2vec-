AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA Went on Monday 2-16-15 around 7PM.  

Disclaimer:  I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan. 

Everything here is fake meat!  I've never had any form of fake meat before this night.  There are soooo many fake weird meats on the menu that I want to go back just to see some of this stuff.  Fake duck?  Fake shrimp?? Fake porkchop??? Fake beef?? Fake fish??  So weird. 

We had vegetable fried wontons...delicious!!! 

Husband had sizzling chicken.  He ate about half of it and then started complaining that he wanted to go to Smashburger on the way home and get something else to eat.  But he ended up taking the leftovers for lunch the next day and letting his friends try the fake chicken.  What a novelty! 

I had what was supposed to be house lo mein.  What came out was a pile of ramen noodles on a plate with fake chicken, fake shrimp, and veggies.  It was hot and the veggies were really good. I've never had lo mein where things are just dumped on top of the noodles...usually it's mixed in?

It cost me and my husband almost $40 to eat here so I probably won't go back but it was fun to try. I felt good after the meal. Ya know how sometimes you eat somewhere and you just hate yourself afterwards?  I didn't get that feeling.
