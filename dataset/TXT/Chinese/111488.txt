m9iqRUgclcsQs-z8c2FTeA This way my 1st time here and probably my last, why do they need to know when my last menstrual period was to have my eye brow waxed and my private info? And not to mention the outrages prices $30 for eye brow waxing just to clean up!!! I think the most I've paid at a spa was in Ca and it was $12 not $30 for 5 min lol.... Not to mention I waited 45 min when there was nobody in the waiting area
