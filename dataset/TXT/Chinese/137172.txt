qiRyyRWt6jmAxcoVW0-WHA We came here for lunch on a Friday. Upon first impression, we noted the large space, high ceilings and modern decor. The service was hit-or-miss. Some of the servers were friendly, and attentive, while others just tossed our food on the table and walked away, ignoring all inquiries. 

As for the food, I was very impressed by the soup. We had hot and sour soup, and ordered a second one, it was that good. Other than that, there is nothing special about the food. The salmon sushi didn't taste very fresh, but I did enjoy the seaweed on the handrolls.
