WLCdg4ib7-_7b8epoXRjAw Ho Ho Cherry House is the best place for a quick, tasty lunch! Usually they have two specials, one vegetarian and one meat, that run between $3.99 and $4.99. We generally just order one of both and always have extra to chow down on later. We religiously order from Ho Ho at least 5x a month and love that they deliver, too!
