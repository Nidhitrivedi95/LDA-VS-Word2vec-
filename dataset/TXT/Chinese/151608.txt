t-LnJne10SHAWATKYdQdJQ The HuHot has become my go to Mongolian spot - across the country they are consistently good with fresh veggies and lots of meat choices
My niece is allergic to shellfish - they made her plate from a separate area in back then cooked it on a cleaned and segregated area of the stove
I was impressed with how they handled her allergy while allowing us all to eat at the same place
Also the sauces - black Thai peanut is my fave!
