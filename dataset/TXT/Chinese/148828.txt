SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ My daughter had an appointment at the salon in the same plaza, so when I looked up Chinese on yelp, this came up. She was craving chicken egg rolls, and they have them so....I ordered by phone 4 items, and was told 10 minutes. That should have told me. But....
Hot and sour soup: not spicy, no vinegar, no shrimp or pork, no bamboo shoots. Tasted like oily chicken stock, (I bet it coagulates by morning), and had soggy cabbage (...what?...). I took out all the cabbage, added siracha and rice vinegar and could eat it. . Chicken egg rolls have just that. Chicken and a little cabbage. No more veggies or flavors. Fried rice: No peas, teenytiny bits of carrots. Miniscule egg. Cream cheese puffs aren't bad, but maybe more than 1/8tsp each would be great. Orange chicken: Not too bad. All sweet, though. No heat. We are there in the plaza 3/week, but will never go back. I did, however, call and give them my opinion. I hope they run with it. It was 100% honest and spot on.
