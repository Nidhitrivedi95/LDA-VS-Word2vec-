2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w Oops.... I really should have gone to Big Heng. Seriously, why do I try new things?!?!?

I got the Hong Kong Crispy Noodle, consisting of a light, crispy fried noodle, (read that as tough and not easy to eat), topped with seasoned chicken with vegetables in a light sauce, (bland chicken and mushy veggies drenched in oily water), with an egg roll on the side, (a little stick filled mostly with shredded carrots and chopped onions). Yeah.... no. 

My wife got the sesame chicken, (tasty, but slippery, and with very little texture, not even slightly crispy), and side of lo mein, ($7.25 for a little box of noodles!!), and both were better than what I ordered. 

I was expecting a much different meal than what I got. 

I won't rule out trying Big Buddha, again, but....
