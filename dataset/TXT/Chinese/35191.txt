I might still feel like this if it wasn't for Chop Chop. Aubergine has never tasted this good. Doused in fresh garlic and Chinese spices, Chop Chop does Aubergine like no one else. And it's not just vegetables that this restaurant does well- dumplings are phenomenal and the ribs sticky, sweet and melt in the mouth. Chop Chop is not your run of the mill, Chicken chow mein-MSG, Chinese restaurant, in my opinion it is the best in Edinburgh.

However, you might not get this impression from the outside of this place. Painted red and yellow, garish might almost be too kind a description. Inside the strip lighting and plastic tables make it feel a bit like a canteen. This odd approach to interior design might not be to everyone's tastes but trust me, it's worth it. The staff are lovely. There's rarely a long wait for food and a great selection of Chinese beers. Chop Chop gets top marks!
