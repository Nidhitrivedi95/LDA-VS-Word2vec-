pxYqUpCz1WQU5M-1tW3-Lw Sad to say, china delight was NOT delightful. 
Called in a take out order and was told it would be 30 min. It took 1 hour and 30 min.
Had to wait in the car as the heat was off in the restaurant.
Was comped 2 cans of soda as apology for the wait. 
None of the food had any sorry of "Chinese" flavor. Or any flavor at all. I think they forgot the seasonings conpletely. 
We ordered:
sesame chicken (more breading than chicken. Very thick and overly sweet)
general tso's chicken (same as sesame chicken but with a mild heat)
mogolian beef and beef with broccoli (these 2 dishes tasted the exact same. The broccoli was good but the beef in both dishes was bland and tasteless and chewy) 
chicken fried rice and shrimp fried rice (again tasted the exact same, bland, tasteless and while the shrinp were a very nice size you could see the black vein that hadn't been cleaned. Gross)
Veg lo mein (lots of veggies but NO flavor)
crab rangoon (normally stuffed with crab and cream cheese, these had a tiny dab of cheese with no crab or flavor)
shrimp egg rolls (these are very large but i only found 1 miniature shrimp at the bottom)
egg drop soup (bland and watery)
Kung pao shrimp (large shrimp but not cleaned and very tasteless)
Each dish had a decent amount of food but it didn't matter as no one wanted to eat much of it. I'll keep looking for a halfway decent chinese take out on the west side. China delight is definitely is NOT it.
