6N9NClBpOi-GoWckg137NQ As previously mentioned here, if you're looking for NYC style Chinese Takeout Red Dragon will not disappoint. It's as close to what I grew up eating in Queens or Long Island as I've found west of the Hudson River. Best of all, you can have Dinner for 2 for just about $25 with Soup & Appetizers. Delivery to my hotel was within promised time and it was hot & correct, something that's quite rare when it comes to delivery to hotels in my experience. It was without question my best experience of delivery of Chinese Food when traveling. I ordered what I call my "litmus test" of fundamental dishes and none disappointed. Chicken Chow Mein (crispy noodles) Pork Egg Roll, Won Ton Soup and Roast Pork Fried Rice. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll try some other dishes now that I have confidence in their abilities.
