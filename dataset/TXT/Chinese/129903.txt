Our server also suggested the sea bass or the yellowtail tacos, we'll go for those next time. For dessert we had the chocolate banana cake and it did not disappoint. The $14 vodka and soda felt like the disappointment of the evening. Better off to drink tap water!  With tip we were at $100 for 2 people.
