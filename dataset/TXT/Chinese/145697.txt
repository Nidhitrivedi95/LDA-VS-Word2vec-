S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ Being from Houston, I am very selective with Vietnamese food.  I could barely find a pho place that is good enough.  Well Pho Hue Thai has very good customer service even under the new management.  They took less then 3 minutes to bring water and menus  out.  Best dishes here:


1.) Curry Chicken Vermicelli (soup base)
2.) Banh Cuon (rice paper with ground beef)
3.) Banh Xeo ( Vietnamese Fried Crepe)

The pho, Bon Bo Hue , clay fish pot, and their rice plate are decent.  I would definitely still come back.  Great food and service!!!  With a very homey feeling and not too crowded:)
