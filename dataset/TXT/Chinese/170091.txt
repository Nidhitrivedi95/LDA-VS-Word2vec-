VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ I love King's Cafe. It's easily my favourite asian chain in Ontario. They're known as Zen Gardens outside of Toronto.

I've been enjoying meals at King's through it's various incarnations - anyone remember the huge photo menu the size of a phone book from a decade ago? It only gets better. The menu is much smaller these days but all the best menu items are still there.

The vegetarian dim sum steam BBQ bun is my absolute favourite item. I got hooked on them at the Vegetarian Food Fest a few years back and now I buy frozen from their shop so I can eat them at home. The spring rolls are also pretty good for heat at home.

The purple rice that accompanies most dishes is great here and if you're looking for a warm up on a cold winter night, their soups are excellent. Get a blooming tea to add to the experience.

Just an FYI that not everything is vegan, so be sure to ask if you're ordering anything prepared or with faux meats.
