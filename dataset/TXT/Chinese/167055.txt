VfWX3UCKvUnVktdOuR8TwA What a disappointment. $9 for 10 dumplings and they were barely lukewarm. Not to mention skins practically as thick as the filling. Honestly, you'd be better off buying frozen dumplings from Asian Midway Foods on Park Street or the Garden Asian Market in Middleton and cooking them yourself.
