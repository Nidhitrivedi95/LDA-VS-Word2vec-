fJCsDc353UC6eUn-kCBrGw I don't know why there are so many negative reviews for this restaurant. I think they are consistent and the quality of service and tasty food, and cleanliness. Olivia was our server today for lunch. If I was an owner of a restaurant I would be trying to recruit her. You can tell she likes her job and is an excellent representative for this company. I had the lettuce wraps. Yes I miss the assorted oils and mixes the servers would create table side, but I also understand it took too much time from more pertinent duties. Crunchy perfect lettuce cups and the chicken mixture just compliment each other. My Mom had the lo mien only substituted the rice noodles. She loved her lunch. Perfectly cooked fresh vegetables, tender noodles and just enough sauce. They pour a nice glass of wine at a decent price. And do make it for happy hour!
