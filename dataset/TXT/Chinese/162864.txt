uoV4aDfXbRmvyHSezdn--w Best Chinese Restaurant in Madison

I've eaten at Tai's Asian Bistro at least 20 to 30 times in the past year and have never had a meal that was less than good.  I recommend Tai's Spicy Chicken - crispy thin strips of white meat in a light but crispy breading (might be deep fried, but it's crispy, not greasy and nothing like the  thick, heavy, spongy, and oil-laden breading one often encounters on General Tso's or sweet-and-sour chicken), in a slightly sweet, slightly salty, garlicy spicy sauce that is excellent, a perfect blend of its component tastes.  The pork lo mein is also terrific with lots of pork and vegetables, and the Singapore Chicken, the Sichuan Chicken, and Kung Pao Chicken are all very tasty.  I like the fact that they allow substitutions of ingredients and will make the dishes extra spicy; the lo mein, in particular, tastes excellent extra spicy.  All vegetables are very fresh, as well, and are usually cooked perfectly, no raw, but still fresh and crispy, not overcooked and mushy as they often turn out to be in mediocre Chinese restaurants.

Service has been good, except for a few communication problems with, surprisingly, the one behind-the-counter employee who might be a native English speaker, who has nearly screwed up my orders several times. I guess I've become a regular with the more regular counter employees, though, who have welcomed me with a smile and ask "The usual?" (i.e. Tai's Spicy Chicken with broccoli substituted for the usual zucchini, which, incidentally, I recommend requesting).

I've never had the sushi there, but they seem to have a good selection.  I've seen several noodle dishes brought out to tables of Asian customers that looked excellent.

In summary, I think this is a terrific Asian restaurant.  It doesn't have the best Chinese dish in town (that honor goes to Happy Wok's Double Cooked Chicken), but second-best is still outstanding, and everything there that I've had is very good to excellent.
