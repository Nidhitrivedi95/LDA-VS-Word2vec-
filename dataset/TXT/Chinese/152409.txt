T3ASfec34b8-uYr3xZj8Lw I used to love this place! This place has gone steeply downhill since my last visit! I've had far better food at pei wei and even little hole in the wall mom and pop Chinese food places in mini strip malls than what we got tonight for over $40! 

We ordered pick up...Kung pao chicken and honey walnut shrimp. It was horrible! The chicken tasted like it was rolled in BBQ sauce, had hardly any onions, no peanuts, and barely enough sauce to coat the chicken, much less enough to mix with the rice! No flavor...It tasted dry and old. The honey walnut shrimp was absolutely disgusting. It was shrimp coated in what tasted like mayonnaise and tossed with some balls of honeydew melon and maybe 4 walnuts. No flavor at all. It tasted like something you would serve cold at a picnic.

I would take panda express any day over the crap they served us tonight!

What a shame!  We hadn't been there in a couple of years, and we definitely will not be back again!
