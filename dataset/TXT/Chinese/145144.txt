rXVLgV4Og3l98OTy6N2dJw I've probably been here a couple dozen times and every time I leave the establishment I am a satisfied customer. The wonton noodle at Wonton Chai is one of the best in the GTA and definitely the best in all of Markham. If you are looking for a quick, cheap and filling meal, Wonton Chai can help you out!

Food 4.5/5 - their wontons, fish paste, dumplings and beef brisket are all great. Their noodles are always fresh, whether it be their wonton noodle or their rice noodle. To be honest I feel they have watered down their soup base over the last couple years but nonetheless it is still pretty good.

Service 5/5 - service is very basic, like in most HK-run establishments but it gets the job done and it is very quick. No complaints

Price 5/5 - Price is really cheap for what you're getting, I believe its $6 for a bowl of noodles. thats roughly the same price as a Big Mac! It's definitely worth the money and probably the best bang for your buck in the area.
