_xAJZOKBMPOe47p1MphB2w Man, I don't even know. I've never eaten anything like this before. All I know is it was SO delicious and SO filling that a three person meal lasted us for three whole meals. And just like Louis CK, I don't stop eating when I'm full, I stop eating when I hate myself, so that's gotta be saying something.

The meal consisted of 2 fresh lobsters that they bring to your table for inspection, made deep fried and delicious. I can't even explain the huge tower of awesomeness they bring to you. It's daunting and intimidating. This is the type of meal you put a bib on for. We got some noodles as well, but they just get in the way of lobster awesomeness. Good, but skippable to make room for more fucking lobster! A huge vat of congee which I suggest you don't skip, because it makes it feel like you're detoxing your body from the deep fried deliciousness, thus enabling you to eat even more lobster. It's a sick and twisted cycle. A big bowl of veggies with goji berries. These veggies have a buttery flavour to them and again come highly recommended as it relieves the feeling of guilt you may have from eating all that fried lobster, further allowing you to enjoy even more lobster goodness. And a bowl of red bean soup, which I skipped in fear of barfing from all that food that just went into my belly.

For all that you get, the value is incredible. They screwed up our order a bunch of times and the service was slow, but I am willing to overlook that as long as I have that garlicy lobster goodness. I must eat all the things on this menu.
