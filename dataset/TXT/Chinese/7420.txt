0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ Been hearing the buzz about this place for years so finally took the plunge and went there.

Super busy but staff was attentive and nice. Got take out. All veggie options, and they did a great job. Everything was tasty and good portions. I can see why this is always talked about as one of the better hakka places in Sauga!
