Qn_mBXvKnn9VeOKym0Ussw The food is delicious and they have excellent service. But I will never order from this restaurant again... I ordered the wonton soup only to find dozens of tiny bugs in the broccoli. It's disgusting. I ate one piece of it so I'm positive I ate a mouthful of them. Like I said the food is delicious, I've ordered from them many times. But this is a bit much...
