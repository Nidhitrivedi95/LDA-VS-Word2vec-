Av5toUG7wweXfiX6FW4F0A My husband works in the barbershop in the same shopping center, and his boss told me to try this place out for lunch. The absolute cutest lady in the world works in the front.everyone that works there so nice, they found out I had two babies in the car so they brought me the menu outside took my order outside, came to the door took my debit card charged me all within having to go into the restaurant. So of course the next time we were in the mood for something, I told my mom and sister about it we all ordered and everything was delicious. I love the veggie spring rolls.
