ZDDzKXN_JXe7694zePRuTQ This place has yummy bubble tea! There was a lineup, but that's how you know it's good lol ;) They have a bunch of flavours (I tried hazelnut chocolate milk tea - like nutella!) and give you options to change the amount of ice and/or sugar to suit it to your taste. Kinda pricey, even for bubble tea, and the place is small so it can be hard to find somewhere to sit if you plan on sticking around, but all in all a great experience!
