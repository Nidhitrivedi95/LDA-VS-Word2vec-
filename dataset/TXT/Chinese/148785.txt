SmhrjxcsB-EIv8tAEHVqRA China Grill is a very run of the mill 'Westernized' Chinese restaurant. It is similar in to Chine Toque which is located down the street, but I feel that China Grill has better food. 

With all the great Asian restaurants in the Concordia ghetto area (which seem to be spreading westward) I think that there are many better options relatively near by. However, if you work in the neighbourhood and are pressed for time I would certainly recommend China Grill over Chine Toque.
