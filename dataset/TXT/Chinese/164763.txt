UXFLCGw1yOCajlMONYQM1w Its ports o call! hurry, quick call yo mama.

this is a super cheap buffet that is very descent in a good location!

i was left shocked, i expected school cafe food but instead got restaurant food. 

thurs is all you can eat! fantastic

Didnt like that the food was cold (i.e. french fries) but i figured people dont come ehre to eat the french fries. 

i shall come here again, especially when i want a full tummy and full wallet when i leave.
