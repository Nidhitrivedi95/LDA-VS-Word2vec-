OX0T9dWI8b7meu-ljTo22A I have only visited the location on Thomas and 28th st. I usually go here for take out wings specifically the lemon pepper wings which are so good. The other flavor wings are pretty good too. The service is fast prices are cheap. Every now and then my wings can be a bit greasy from the fryer but it is fried so I kinda get it. I love wings and kings wings are good.
