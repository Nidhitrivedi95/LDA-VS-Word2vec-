xDnTbCZ3z2EnwHIcXYu0wA Been going to this place for years a few times.  Their prices, and portions are reasonable.  The food is always great!! Chili chicken, chicken hakka chow mein, and pakora is yummy.  Though the place is small, it can definitely fill up quite quickly.  The place could use some interior design consulting....as the atmosphere doesn't quite match the restaurant's genre.
