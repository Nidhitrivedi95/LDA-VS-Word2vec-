XC7RBm6or4mf2LyKqQfuUw Wonderful place for a crowd, great food and drink. 
We tried the sea bas which was devine, flaky, soft. The duck was a bit dry for my taste but came in a delicious sauce that compensated nicely.  Decent selection of wine. Be careful if ordering by the glass, it's a hit or miss - some cheap Italian Pinot noir next to very nice Argentinean cab. The service was attentive, friendly, welcoming. The restaurant is well lit, warm. Prepare for a sticker shock, when you get the bill, but I liked it anyways.
