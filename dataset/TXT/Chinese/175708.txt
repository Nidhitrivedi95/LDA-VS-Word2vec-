Wk2vbs-Va9Alf8cZqqAVQA I literally had to join Yelp because of the absolute terrible experience I had here tonight.

We were a party of 6 and 5 of us received our food while the 6th did not for another 15 minutes. 

I asked the waiter twice and was given quick short answers because they were running serving the table next to us (party of 12). Finally I got fed up and asked to speak to a manager. While normally this should help the situation, this was not the case. 

The manager was not only rude, but confrontational. He began to explain that there was a mistake (mistakes happen yes) and telling me how many chefs he has (4) and how he can't have them all work on our meals. I don't quite follow how a restaurants staffing is the customers issue? I said that all our food is now cold. He said "no one told you to wait". I'm sorry, has common decency gone out the window? I was raised to be polite. I said I would appreciate something to be done i.e. the forgotten meal be given at no cost. And was responded with "I make 2$ a dish, I can't just do that". Apparently this is the manager/owner?? He should be ashamed of his customer service skills, or lack thereof. 

Oh and I threatened to write this review seeing as I have no other recourse... 20 minutes later he's offering a free drink. Needless to say at that point we declined.
