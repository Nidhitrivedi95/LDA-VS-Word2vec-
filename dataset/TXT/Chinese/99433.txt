Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Having only lived a year in Las Vegas, I often drive by Orchids Garden Restaurant.  When my husband said he wanted Chinese, we decided to give it a try. The employees were nice enough, however, we were not asked if this was our first time dining there.  We were unaware of the two choices they have 1) off the regular menu or 2) off the "rolling cart" menu.  We were a bit confused, so we decided to do the "rolling cart" menu.  It was challenging understanding the woman offering us the menu choices.  There is a menu that has pictures, but a lot of the menu items looked the same.  
Overall, the food was absolutely NASTY.  It was old and greasy.  The calamari was cold, so we sent it back.  All they did was throw it back in the fryer.  So now it was hot but overcooked.  My husband, who always tries to find something positive, did like the Fried Rice.  It was very greasy.  
When I woke at 2:30 am with a very queasy stomach, I realized it was from thinking about the food I had eaten at the Orchids Garden.  I definitely would not recommend this restaurant.  Still looking for a decent Chinese Restaurant.
