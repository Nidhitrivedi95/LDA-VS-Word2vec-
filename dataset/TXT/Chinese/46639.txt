BwbPzuEuIN_oFmNRJIgHlg This restaurant was not even worth one star. Me and my friends ordered five different plates but none of them were worth its cost.
Their signiture beef noodle had no flavor in their soup, noodles were not even well cooked. Don't know why it costs 25$.
Fried beef teppan did not even seem to have beef in it.
Spicy beef noodle used the same noodle as their signiture beef noodle and only thing I could see was hot pepper and thai chili. I don't know which spice they used but I couldn't bear with its smell. At last my friend said he could not taste anything because the chinese spice they used made his tongue numb. 
Stewed beef noodle also did not taste like anything.
Lastly, chicken teppan with curry was the most edible because it tasted just like ordinary curry. However, still don't think it worths 16-17$.
Didn't really enjoyed the time here. I really don't recommend their plates while you are still paying average 20$ for tour meal. Don't worth money.
