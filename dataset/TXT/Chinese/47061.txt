bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A Went for the lunch special before leaving town for the holidays. I ordered Mongolian Beef, and there were few slices of beef, and what was there was sliced so thinly that it was crisp, yet succinctly flavorless. What I mostly got was onions and a lesser amount of peppers in some sauce. One star for the eggroll - flavored with 5 spice powder and containing some meat it was better than almost all of the eggrolls I've gotten here, which are all pretty much the same eggroll over and over - vegetables, no seasoning and thus little flavor.

Maybe if I'd gotten a chicken dish it'd been better. Oh, and there was some soup...
