N7wlv3nrhDPuDDY8yX6QvQ We didn't want to travel too far for lunch, so my wife suggested that we try the hk style cafe near the T&T supermarket at Yonge and Weldrick.

I think I just found the worst food to eat in Richmond Hill. I had the beef brisket rice noodle soup. My wife had the fish ball rice noodle soup. These are incredible simple dishes one can order at a hk style cafe restaurant, how can they mess that up so badly?! The brisket was so tough and tasteless, and rice noodle is so soggy and broken in little pieces so I can't eat it with a chopstick anymore. Portion is big, but I only have soggy noodle in my bowl.

I couldn't finish my bowl it's so bad. Neither can my wife. Usually when I am hungry I am not a picky eater, and I was starving, but I just can't take another bite.
