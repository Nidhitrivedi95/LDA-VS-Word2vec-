OZF7EM-W-2-V0LQOYSYhBA Used to be one of my fav places to go for hakka food since they're down the street from where I work.  However, as the previous reviewer said, their quality has gone way down and their prices way up.  Not to mention if you order ahead, you still have to order when you get there because no one really wrote down your order.  Only reason I would even think of going back is their House Shrimp, it's really good but considering I haven't had it in a while, I wouldn't be surprised if the quality has dropped and price increased as well.
