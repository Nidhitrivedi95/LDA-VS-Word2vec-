fgm7DKVy1wuod6FTPvZqRw This place isn't even worth the 1 star. This is BY far the WORST Chinese food I've ever had in my life. All I ordered was chicken fried rice, and chicken wings. First the rice, by looks, it looked OK. Then I tried a bite, and it tastes like seafood. The "chicken" was dark gray, and had a very odd texture and was like chewing on a piece of rubber. Second the wings. I think these wings were cooked last week. They were SO dried out, i could barely bite into them. TOTAL waste of $$. I will NEVER go back to this place, and I would NEVER recommend it to anyone else.
