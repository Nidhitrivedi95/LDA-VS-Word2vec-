C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw Drove there for lunch special because of high ratings on yelp. I have to leave the review because it's not authentic Thai food. It's Chinese owned. Green curry chicken was not like Thai style but more of Chinese taste. Thai food is supposed to be cooked by Thai. Oops. Won't go again.
