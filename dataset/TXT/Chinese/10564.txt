Thats how much I love big wong! Its simple no nonsense cheap food who bring a delight to your tummy and absolute bliss to those hainanese chicken rice lover.

Having eaten hainanese chicken rice in London, Los Angeles, Singapore and Jakarta, I can honestly says that they have one of those great one that remind you of home. 

Thank you las vegas for having big wong and if you ever in las vegas and would like to try some extraordinary cuisine that will not make a hole in your pocket. Get your ass in here. Order some fried wonton, followed with number 2. OH YEAH!!!
