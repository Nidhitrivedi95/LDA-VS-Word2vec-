i_t_UJTSScw4srpb8aHUiw Good value chinese restaurant. Overall lunch is ok after 2:30pm, if your order is over $10 before tax, free bread or egg sandwich. Dinner is great and good price. if your order is over around $40 before tax. Free sour/sweet meat dishes. I forgot may be over over $50 or 60. free half chicken.
