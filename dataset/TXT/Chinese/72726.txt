fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA I went here yesterday to showcase how delicious and cheap Chinatown can be and my friend and I both went for steamed dumplings to put up a façade of eating healthy and save some money (fried ones are more expensive). He got pork and green pepper, I stuck by my mixed vegetables.

They were good, kind of slimy and hard to grab with chopsticks. We both wished we had ordered the pan-fried ones.

We did split a small bowl of tomato egg drop soup, which is simply egg drop soup with little slices of tomato and parsley, and it was good. We weren't super hungry so the size was OK to share but I think if we had gotten a large, that would have been an acceptable size, too.

It was also my first time sitting down and noticed that Dumpling House has a distinct scent but it did not stop us from chowing down. Yum yum yum.
