uAPMb111euz5jJF8_VeO2A Clueless of where to eat once we arrived in Chinatown -- no service to Yelp :( . I asked locals of where I could find the nearest yet best shu mai after dim sum hours. Couple feet away Ia casita was told to have shu mai and other dim sum plates if asked and was well priced for those on a budget. Waiter/ hostess gave me a sheet of paper and crossed out an area that was only for morning to noon dim sum. 

Place was well kept. Staff very friendly. Free wifi! They're dinner deals were unexpectedly cheap basing on our Chinatown in NYC. Dinner for 3 included: 3 hot soups, spring rolls, steamed vegetables, general tso chicken, chicken friend rice for a little under $24! I really came to Chinatown in search of some good shu mai.. Assuming that was my first question when arriving as well as ordering I would get that first.. I actually got it last better yet in a to-go box. I think they even forgot. I mentioned it after our big dinner and they offered complimentary dessert. Don't remember the name but it was a warm sweet bean soup, with tapioca. Eventually I got my shu mai to go. Food was cooked perfect! Not your local greasy Chinese restaurants.. Just wished I got what I ordered when I was craving it.
