WAb6ox5RrBtF7m5Cb6p56Q Their general tso chicken, kung pow triple, house chicken and other items are delicious and no one else in the valley makes it the way House of yang Does. I took another job and its worth the drive up on the weekends. I dump the shiracha sauce on it for added spice. Other eateries around me are opposite of the food with the same names. I think House of yang is unique. Not much in the flavor has changed since they were sold back in mid 2000.
