JfbbFcJgj8Zfn9SjGDnBgQ I got the roasted chicken with noodles and soup for about 5 dollars. What I say? The food here is cheap with great portion sizes. The meat is relatively good in size, number of pieces, and flavour, so I would opt to just get the meat alone. The noodles I got with my roasted chicken was a tad bit soggy and you could tell that they put very little thought into the quality of the noodles they purchase in bulk.  The soup you pour over the noodles and chicken was light. The soup honestly just tasted like boiled cabbage with chicken broth and a pinch of salt, a bit too light for my tastes  (note: I don't even like heavy broths).  It didn't seem to harmonize  well with my roasted  chicken. In fact, the soup watered down the taste of the chicken rather than enhancing it. Overall, this is a decent place to swing by for some cheap eats, but again, opt for just the meat alone.
