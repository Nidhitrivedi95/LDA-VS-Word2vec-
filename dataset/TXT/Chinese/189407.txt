Great service, semi-clean interior, minimal decorations, and decent food. Compared to LA pho, this place can't compete. It's about as good as it gets, in the desert though. 

The pho broth seemed to lack a little luster, and the vegetables weren't so fresh. I didn't expect fresh sprouts, and limes in the desert though. Can you even grow fruit in Vegas?

Like everyone else mentioned, the name alone makes it worth a visit.
