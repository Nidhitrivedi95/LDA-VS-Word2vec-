Yqgyx8SJ5SqFYc-4yH6Z1g I had a great foodie experience when I went to Shanghai and I wanted to relive that experience so I went here with a group. The restaurant was almost empty but the parking lot was full. Clean, bright and enough room.

We ordered crispy fried salty pork shank, pan-fried dumplings, crab and pork xiao long bao, yang chow fried rice, mushroom with vegetable and Chongqing chicken. The crispy fried pork was everything the name implies: really salty and crispy. I recommend dipping it in vinegar to tone down the salt. The pan-fried dumplings were a bit doughy and not as good as the ones I had at Yang's Fry Dumplings in Shanghai (the best ones you'll ever have). The xiao long bao wasn't soupy at all. The filling was good though.

We saw "Gold Marijuana Cake" on the menu. Really? Marijuana??? We were going to order it for dessert but when we were putting an order for it our server turned red from embarrassment. She said it's supposed to say "gold sesame cake" not marijuana! Lost in translation!

They gave us free dessert: cold mung bean soup. It wasn't good and I'm glad it was free. They have soy milk so I ordered it. They serve it cold but they gave me hot soy milk because that's what I had for breakfast in China. Yay! It was hot, sweet and simple. I did my happy dance.

I know I seem to be comparing the food here with what I had in China, however, to have these offerings here in Vegas is good enough reason to come here. Better than the Panda place. Will I come back? Maybe, for the pan-fried dumplings and soy milk. And no, they don't give you fortune cookies after your meal.
