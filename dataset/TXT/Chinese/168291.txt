VOsvscZOFYzcsdbmAlVkiA I work at Leslieville & I always look for lunch spots.  Loved "Back of House" originally but was sad that it closed down.  Walk by the store few days ago and was surprised that "Mean Bao" was going to open soon.  "Mean Bao" means chinese buns and they have lots of variety to offer.  Each item is $4 or less and $10 typically means a good lunch.  Jerk chicken is only available at this location & I'm looking forward to try the cold noodles!
