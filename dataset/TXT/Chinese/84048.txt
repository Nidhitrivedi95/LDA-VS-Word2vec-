hf2oiNqYYWoF2-iNYSnOMg I tried this place against my better judgment and got what I expected. I ordered a sesame chicken combo. As usual with Chinese restaurants here, there was only little bits of chicken covered in lots of batter. Where's the meat? The fried rice was bland and lacked a main ingredients, egg. The egg roll was way overcooked, almost burnt.  

Where's the authentic Chinese food in Charlotte??
