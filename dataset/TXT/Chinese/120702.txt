O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw I have been going to Rol San it seems like forever.  My favourite dish is hands down the spicy chicken with scallops and crispy seaweed.  Yes, it did give me food poisoning once many many moons ago, but that was not enough to turn me off of it for long. And their spicy squid is so damn good too.  Today I went with my parents for dim sum... as usual I got  my lunch favs - the shrimp rice rolls, shrimp and chive cakes, and sesame balls and all were perfect.  But I can't say the same about the dining experience.

As anyone who has dined there before knows, there is nothing fancy about this place.  The eardrum splitting noise of dishes and cutlery being gathered up in the top layer of the stack of plastic table cloths is constantly jarring.  The fact that there seems to be no smaller tables in the front dining room so sometimes two or even three parties are forced to share a large family sized round table.  The general noise level is a little maddening.  I know all this like the back of my hand, yet I keep coming back.

A lot of people are telling me to give up on Rol San in favour of Asian Legend.  I don't know.  I guess I'll try it and see what I think.  Or I could keep going to Rol San... it just comes to down accepting the fact that I can't go at any time when the majority of the rest of the population wants to eat lunch or dinner.
