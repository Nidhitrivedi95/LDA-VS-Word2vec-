bWucOPNoIjd8ECdiDyVq9Q Too much fun! My mom and I stopped by after reading the good reviews. By accident we showed up right before the performer hit the stage. How fun is it to be eating dining while watching Frank Sinatra, Elvis, and Johnny Cash performances, all by the same guy?

The service here was really phenomenal. While there wasn't an obvious hostess stand, we were greeted quickly after coming in and asked if we wanted to sit on the 'noisy side' or the 'quieter side' (basically, did we want to sit near the little stage near the bar or in a separate dining room). I think all the staff members came over at least twice to check on us and they were super friendly, sharing their favorite dishes and telling us to stay and watch the performance for as long as we wanted after they cleared our plates away.

Their food was yummy! I loved my 'cream cheese angles' (cream cheese rangoons basically) and the fried rice. I don't eat meat but I know what good meat looks like - my mom's plate looked like high-quality white meat chicken. They have a pretty traditional Chinese restaurant menu with lots of vegetarian options. It isn't super fancy but it tastes good! Definitely worth a visit, make sure you go in time to catch a performer. The atmosphere is really what makes this place!
