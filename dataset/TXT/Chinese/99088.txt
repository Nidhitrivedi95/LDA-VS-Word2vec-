Jur1iiejUFw_YCkfDfy1gQ Just left this place and was not happy at all. I got the taro and it tasted sour so I asked to return it... The manager got super sassy with me and wouldn't take it off my bill. My friends I came with have been coming here a lot and was not happy with the service as well... The other food was medicore.. Nothing to wrote home about.
