qSzICKCd041EdjjGNgMYrQ I like the fact that we didn't have to wait for a table on a late Saturday morning. Probably because other restaurants have deals for ordering before 11:00am. Not here. So, price conscious Chinese would come here out of necessity or convenience. We were the latter camp. 

The food was average and in my opinion slightly over priced. 

We entertained the set menu for dinner at just under $500, but it lacked the wow factor for that price. We'll return someday for dinner and order off menu and see how that fares.
