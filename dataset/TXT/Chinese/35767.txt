ag8gM2YKZkjndCvl2ti7kQ Overall I thunk the food is good. I came here on sunday night, pretty dead night for any business. However, this place still gets decent amount of customers. Dumpling is true north chinese taste. Good food and cheap, it's hard to find a plaxe like this in this area. But, only thing I don't like is the dishes they put on every table are not that clean. My sauce dish was little bit sticky =\. Overall, 3.5/5. I really like clean dishes. I hope i will have better experience next time.
