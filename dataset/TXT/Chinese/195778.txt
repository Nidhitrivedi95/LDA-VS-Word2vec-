ZilzayEdyk70SoI-wruJbg MY TORONTO STAPLE FOR CHINESE FOOD!  

Congee queen offers a great chinese food selection at great prices and quick service.  They also do large party tray orders which are always helpful for those potluck parties or big filipino parties as in my family!

I love their quick take out and especially the BBQ counter.  Always piping hot and fresh to order.  Amazing!

A few staples that I always order:  Cantonese Chow Mein, Yeung Chow Fried Rice and any of their soups.  Also their steamed rice noodles - ALL!

Be prepared that on weekends they are VERY busy!  Be prepared to wait ... but it is worth the wait .. trust me!  You won't be disappointed.  Service is ok - typical Asian service but they are quick and can turnover their tables quickly.

Will definitely be back at every Toronto visit!
