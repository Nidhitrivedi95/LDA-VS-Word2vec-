S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A I tried this place again after getting something I didn't like personally from the first time I've been. I got the beef noodles with oyster sauce and I got picky cause it tasted like gravy and I didn't like it so I decided not to give a low review cause of my pickiness. This time I got the stir fried beef noodles and they were excellent. Service is great and I enjoy watching them handpull noodles. Dumplings are good also, but I went with a friend who had a kosher diet this second time and doesn't eat pork so I was able to have a half order cause she couldn't eat them. She enjoyed this place as well as it was her first time.
