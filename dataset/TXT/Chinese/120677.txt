O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw I was super excited to try Toronto dim sum because I heard great things but I was sorely disappointed. This place serves all day dim sum which sounds cool but I like the experience of the cart. I'm not Chinese or that knowledgable of dim sum items so reading the menu didn't really help me figure out what to order. 
We got the standard shu Mai and har gow. Both were probably the best things here. The Shu Mai was a bit pink inside so that was weird...
The shrimp noodle crepe fell a little short for me. The rice noodle wrap was super thick and it had like 2 shrimp in them. 
I was really put off with how pink the beef meatballs were. If we saw these on the cart, we wouldn't have ordered them. 
The dessert dim sum were not as good as I usually eat. We got the milk tarts and the black sesame filled balls. The milk tart's crust was super thick and I prefer egg tart filling way more than milk filling. We also preferred red bean paste in our sesame balls and the black sesame was not good...
It's sad that I much prefer dim sum from Maryland than to here!
