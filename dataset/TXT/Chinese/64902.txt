ea3kF5zspg4eNmxSbZixsA We came here for a late dinner after driving 12 hrs from Chicago. We were thinking of going to check out Pacific Mall for dinner but decided against it. Am I glad we did! This place is great! Daughter ordered tofu with ground beef over rice, hubs ordered the bitter melon with fish slices over rice and I ordered eggplant with ground beef over rice. Daughter's tofu over rice was a bit bland but it was still great. Everything was delicious. I was surprised to find out we had a choice of soy milk or soup for drink. Place is inexpensive. All this for 19.35! Service was very friendly! Will definitely pop by again!
