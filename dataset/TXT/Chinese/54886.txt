CVRTly4ag_q5ua0R3iqrVw I'm a fan of all things kimchi. Their kimchi stew is unlike any I've ever had. Crispy rice is on the bottom of the clay pot and it makes the stew hearty. It has chicken thigh instead of pork and and the broth is tasty and simply in the way chicken noodle soup is simply and tasty. It's not kick or butt spicy, either. Just a touch of heat to make it interesting. Awesome for a casual Vegas dinner or if you're traveling alone. Sit at the bar. Watch the kitchen do their thing. And wait for some tasty food!
