fUKi8LlQhzsGntuZjfvLWg Unfortunately we hit them on a very bad afternoon.  It was packed with servers and very few customers and the service was horrible.  We did enjoy watching the cook prepairring our dishes while talking on his cell phone. Even more fun was to watch our waiter and two other servers stand and talk while our food sat on the counter we finally had to ask them to bring us our lunch.   The Dim Sum was laughable.  Oh well, with so many other wonderful places to dine around the Summerlin area I'll draw a line through this place.  I don't recommend  Rice Republic.
