QdganL5AW9E_fNoRVroLig It is an obscure place away from the main campus area. I hadn't heard about it till the start of my junior year, and my oh my do I regret it. The best thai food on campus, and it is not even expensive. Pad Thai is my staple order and they make it well, really well. I love the Pad Kee Mao they make too. The portion size is large. And for around $8 it is not expensive at all

 I don't have a single gripe about this place, apart from it's location. I don't know how, but this place needs to be better marketed so that people of CU can really see how good it is.
