I had the 2 choice meal with half Chow Mein/half Fried RIce, Orange Chicken, and Beef with Broccoli. The chow mein and fried rice was good, the orange chicken had too much batter, and the beef with broccoli was alright.

It definitely doesn't beat Panda Express, but it'll do for late night food! If you want something that's inexpensive and a pretty big meal, this is the place to go!
