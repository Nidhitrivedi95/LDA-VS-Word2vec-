gAT3p2Ooou4lUYiF4OKj7g Well let me start that this place has been around for forever, so they must be doing something right. I remember going here with my family after all my silly plays in elementary school and I still go here, I'm now in college. The food is really yummy  and the price is inexpensive. The restaurant decor is a little funky but I don't go there for that. The people who work there are super nice and will take very good care of you. They have weird hours on Saturday though, which is my only complaint. They open around 4:30 pm but the food is so worth it.
