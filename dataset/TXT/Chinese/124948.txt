oVtnnGat2Wco0ksQT1cGCA The service is really slow for the teppenyaki tables. We had reservations at 6 and we didn't receive our food until 7. We were not very satisfied with the service we received. Food was mediocre. Not sure if service is better for AYCE sushi but will not be coming back for teppenyaki.
