-wDNRL4lm1UgeFLG9KcrjQ Just picked up my dinner tonight and as always, it was amazing! This place has the best sushi in town. It's fresh, flavorful and delicious! I've ordered the Tiger Roll II, Avocado and Spicy Tuna roll. So good! The Chinese food is good too and that says a lot coming from a New Yorker!
