UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw One of our all time favorite places to meet friends for a drink over happy hour. Bar area fairly small so get there by 5ish to get the best tables. Happy hour lasts ALL NIGHT! Outdoor patio very large. Not sure happy hour applies there though. Great beers on tap, also good wines by the glass on HH. Many items on HH menu, varies from $3, $4, $5, $6. All are good, their strawberry salad a must for starters. Good bar staff, food comes up quick too. Dinners are good too. Nice for lunch too.
