V6mrVw6BpZhiE_Bn3G_Rog This is the place I go to all the time for dim sum, not only because the location is easy to bus/drive to, the service is always exceptional. The staff is friendly and the dim sum is really good compared to other medium-sized restaurants.

I also went to Best Dragon for dinner. I came with a big group of people so we ordered the set menu, which includes the Giant Lobster special, which is the best lobster I've ever eaten (I probably can't go back to small lobsters after this giant fellow) Peking Duck, Chinese vegetables, soup and many more.

Best Dragon is definitely a hidden gem in York Region. Again, I cannot emphasize enough about the Giant Lobster!!! It is the best seafood dish I have tried!
