aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg The first time I had the roast pork from this restaurant was at my hubby's cousin's Christmas party.  It was delicious.  What's there not to like about roast pork?  Uh, well...those of you that are watching your calories and cholesterol,  don't read this post.  Shoo- go away!! Or go and take a Zocor or Lipitor and come back to this post.  As I was saying, the crispy skin and the lightly juicy fatty meat was balanced very well.  The flavor was very nice and I knew I wasn't eating Sam Woo's roast pork.  It different, it didn't have the Sam Woo flavor.  It had it's own distinct flavor that was equally as good.  And I was so happy it wasn't Sam Woo.  In the Asian population, everyone knows that Sam Woo has the best BBQ in town.  

Two weeks after Christmas, I went back to order 2 lbs of roast pork for dinner.  The roast pork was consistent and still tasted just as good.  A week later the hubby and I went there for dinner and their duck noodle soup did not disappoint.  Oh yeah, I'm total fan of this place.  It's cheap and food is good and hearty.   Like most Chinese dives, they take cash only and you can communicate with them in English but if you speak a little Chinese here it goes a long way.... Oh yeah, this one here had to bust out in her Cantonese.  For this super Americanized Asian girl that was real hard!  Real hard but so worth it for the good food. -M2
