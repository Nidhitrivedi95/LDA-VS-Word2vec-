97V91GSG-OQvrvOc9GXoGA Tried this out tonight,  not sure we have the same flavors in mind but,  not the worst ever. 
General Tso 's chicken: Very fatty dark meat,  unable to eat about 1/3of out. Asked for mild and got what I ordered. The sauce was just kind of bland and tasted a bit burnt.

Fried rice (side) : Decent  but,  no vegetables at all.

Teriaki chicken stix: Came deep fried,  no sauce on it with a shot of Siracha sauce,  not at all appetizing.  I drowned it in the Generals sauce just to try it,  still very tough threw out two sticks to Co worker. 

Crab Rangoon : Everybody has their own recipe  and we do not see eye to eye on this one.  Sweet yet filled with diced onions,  specs of imitation crab.  Not horrible. 

Overall I don't believe that I will order here again. But,  the food was not horrible our overall bad just not for me.  I'm accustomed to Fairlawn House Of Hunan or Main Wok.
