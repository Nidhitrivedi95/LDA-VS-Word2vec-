OUB81Dpb6m7HjW4ZmeSlmw I stopped here for a light lunch a few days ago and just had to come back! I ordered the Siu Mai and the chicken and on my second visit, pork belly baos. My order each time came under $10 which is pretty flippin' awesome. And surprisingly it was very filling, the portion sizes are just right!

The siu mai is good, just like anywhere else but I noticed the quantity and size changed on my subsequent visit. The first time there were about 6 pieces and they were average sized. The second time I got 4 pieces and they were gigantic! I didn't feel cheated either way but do prefer the smaller size (weird, I know).

The baos I tried were excellent, perfect blend of flavours, textures and great "snack" size and priced just right. I feel like they should've gone the crunchy way with the pork belly but it was more like a fatty pulled pork - and they have pulled pork on the menu so...trust me and pan fry that sucker a la lechon kiwali.

Shout out to the fellow cross stitcher!
