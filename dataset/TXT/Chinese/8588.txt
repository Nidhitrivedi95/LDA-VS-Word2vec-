1jNteKQ2JuF6Sk1SI9X23Q Not sure what is happening with this place! I loved it down in Burbank California. Was so happy when it came here to Toronto. First 4 times it was exactly the same as down in Cali. Excellently prepared and fresh. Last 2 times( within the last 30 days) it was terrible! Dried out and salty and just sub par for what portrays itself as a fresh unique restaurant. I hope they get their act back together or they will be done soon!
