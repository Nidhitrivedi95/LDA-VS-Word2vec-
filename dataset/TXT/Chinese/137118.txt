qIRqFlmvHDRe7kWBAsuVnQ Ol the new Korean Chinese place. Had to check it out. Over all, disappointing. 
Avoid the pick hours.
Two of us had Jjajang myun and Jjamppong.
For Jjajang myun, the sauce seemed ok but the noodle... it is obvious they reheated on hot water.
Which also made the sauce watery...
I think the noodle is the basic. I would understand on pick hours but it was the slowest time of a day.
There were only two tables other than us.
The service was good. The server, a skinny girl, was very friendly.
I gotta give one more try but so far, i would rather go to the island.
