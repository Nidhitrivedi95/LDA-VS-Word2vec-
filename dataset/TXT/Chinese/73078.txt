FiEcKfGo-rbYyhoKHw_0MA Best hot pot in Chandler... well, that doesn't say much as there's only one Asian hot pot restaurant in Chandler.

Make no mistake about it, the portions are small. To feed a group of four adults, you are looking at to pay at least $60 to $80 for the total bill (if you order lots of meats). DO NOT order the rice for $2. Get the shabu shabu beef ($5), much tender and fatty vs the rib-eye ($4) slices.

Two things I like about this place: the soup base and the freshness of the meat. Sure, you can buy rib-eye slices from Lee Lee or Mekong for a lot cheaper, but they are not fresh and the quality is not as good as Tien Wong's. Besides, can you even buy Wagyu slices at Lee Lee/Mekong? 

The other part of the equation for a good hot pot is the soup base. Unless you're an experienced chef who knows how to mix/create a hot pot soup base, the packaged soup base mix you can buy at Lee Lee/Mekong is not even comparable to what you're getting at Tien Wong.

Recently, we just had a home-made hot pot, with ingredients/soup base bought from Mekong. It cost no more than $25 total and we had some leftovers. Yet, once in a while, we still visit Tien Wong. We come for the quality, not quantity.
