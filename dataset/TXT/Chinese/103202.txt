kKCJvvktaKxZ5iFKv3lxuA Yum!! Okay, no, this isn't authentic Chinese food and it's about as American as you get! I don't care, though! It's just what the doctor ordered sometimes! Location is convent and easy to find. Employees are very friendly and helpful. Bathrooms were clean. The food is delicious! Sesame chicken is my fav and my go to. I will definitely be back when I'm in ballentyne!
