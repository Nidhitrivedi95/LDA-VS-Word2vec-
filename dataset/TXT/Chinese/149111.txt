sOaeX1zQWuqbPcclvjtdeA I recently went here for dinner on a wednesday around 6. I sat at the bar and the bartender told me about their happy hour specials which is till 7 at the bar. They have selections of $4 craft beers, $5 appetizers, and $6 dinner which includes sushi and chicken lettuce wraps and more. I started with their Hunan Dragon Wings as appetizer. The wings were very delicious and flavorful. I prefer things a little more spicy and these wings had a little bit of kick to it. The wings had a sweet and spicy taste and was very delicious! I definitely would order this as a appetizers again! For my entree I ordered chicken lomein and vegetable fried rice. Although the fried rice was very good I prefer the lomein. The noodles had amazing texture and the spice level was prefect. The atmosphere here is really relaxing and the food is delicious. The bartenders are very attentive and helpful as well. I would definitely come back for the happy hour specials!
