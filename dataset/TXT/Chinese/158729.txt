tZEW8ESjrVmNGXvPnrR97w DO NOT PURCHASE THE V.I.P. CARD !!!
They bait you to purchase this card for $20 which supposedly will entitle you to buy one get one free on daily specials, get a free item with your purchase each visit and a 10% discount on a total bill.
Later you find out on subsequent visits that they find reasons to deny you what they contracted for. What was the final straw for me was my waiter informing me after I placed my order that I would not be able to use my V.I.P. card because I was dining alone !!! This was not something that was mentioned when they accepted the $20 V.I.P. card charge.
The food is good and the service is good but they left "a bitter taste in my mouth" with such "business ethics". May be this is something one can expect on one's travels in China but in the U.S.A. we do not expect to be treated this way.
For extra $10 they made on me the last time I was there they lost a customer !!
