13ngZbrJVhnngzhc-MlXYg Just ordered here for the first time. Ordered King Pao chicken. Came to about $10 after tax. At first glance it looks like there isn't much chicken, but there actually is once you get chowin'. I personally don't like the onions or celery they put in it, so the first thing I did was pick it out. This left the chicken, rice, peppers, peanuts, and other veggies like broccoli and cauliflower. The sauce is tasty but not as flavourful as I was expecting. 

The person working never tried to up-sell me anything extra such as spring rolls or a side of chicken balls, but I'm almost wishing she did just so I could pig out more and blame her. 

If this were a school project, I would give them a solid 75%. Would have been an 80% if there weren't any onions or celery. I'll probably be back but might try something more flavourful.
