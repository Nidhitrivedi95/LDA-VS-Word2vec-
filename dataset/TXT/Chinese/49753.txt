CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw I was I  Vegas for a nursing conference September 18, 2013.  We were on the strip, so my friends decided they wanted to eat at the Bellagio.  After walking around the hotel we settle on eating at The Noddle.  I must admit the food was a lot better than I expected.  I ordered the shrimp pad thai.  The dish was very ,very good; much better than I expected for a strip Asian restaurant.  My friends ordered a couple of different soup/noodle dishes.  They were also goo, but the beef was slightly over-cooked.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  This was a great place to eat after all the exploring and people watching on the strip!
