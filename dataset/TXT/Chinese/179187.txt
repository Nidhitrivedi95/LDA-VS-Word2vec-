X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg We waited to get in almost an hour, well its acceptable. But we were told the fee is $50 after they increased to $70? Its not fair, but they were pretty sure, after waiting an hour you cant just leave it. Smart Strategy though. And its super packed. I did not drink (Had the worse hangover a day before, I even did not want to think about it). 

Music was great. Of course , Calvin Harris. I only went there because of him. And the stuff rude ;( 
Id go may be. Not sure.
