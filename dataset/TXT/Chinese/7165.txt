0PM5oFKO29sZmL5efmHxug Ok just went there again because the default dimsum place was packed and the Grotto Noodle House was not open for at least another 30 minutes and I was hungry.

Went in to get a seat, as expected from a low end Chinese restaurant I was just overhand pointed to my seat by the waitress.  Is it just me or the more attractive physically the Chinese waitresses are the more unattractive their personalities tend to become when they are working at a restaurant.

Anyhoo, after doing the pattern matching between the Chinese order checklist and the menu which had English; I couldn't get someone to provide me the English checklist and their menu does not have numbers to correspond to the checklist.

So just a fair warning to potential customers, don't expect good service from here, at least unless the one that looks like the owner (some middle aged Chinese guy) is around.

I ordered two dishes for myself.  An stir fry eggplant with ground meat dish.  The dish itself was quite good, though it was a bit on the salty side, I think they can do with less, the taste is quite good already and masked with the salt they had put in.

The other disk I got was the pork/leek dumpling.  The wrapper is good again (or at least better than what I had tasted last time) otherwise this would've gotten them one star less.  The dish itself was good except for the high salt content.

I think they may want to to get some rice in order to buffer the salty taste, but I am not a big rice fan so I just had to drink more tea to flush the salt down.

If they fix the salt level, make it more non-Chinese friendly and get rid of those waitresses that do not really want to be there, they may end up with another star or two from me.
