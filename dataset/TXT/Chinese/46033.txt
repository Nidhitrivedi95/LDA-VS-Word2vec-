BUcTdN-rNE8urCCQuxSOQA I cant say that these dumplings are thee best in town since I was just visiting Toronto for days. I have no complaints. Service was decent and food was delicious! We first ordered the kim chee and it was something different compared to back home. It had a sweet taste to it. Next up was the shrimp and pork dumplings. I loved them not a bad for a mix of the two meats. The dumpling soup was sort of misleading. There were no dumpling in them so that was a disappointment for me.
