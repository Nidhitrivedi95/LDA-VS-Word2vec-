What I (regretfully) swallowed:

COMBO PLATE: ORANGE CHICKEN WITH STEAMED VEGGIES AND WHITE RICE: I was not sure what I was eating. Is there even any chicken in there? It was just huge clumps of heavily breaded something then heavily doused with sauce. Then I had a look at my veggies: Why are my carrots outlined in black? Why are my squash a darker shade of brown?

This wasn't a good idea at all. I was praying I didn't get sick on the way home.

Stay away!
