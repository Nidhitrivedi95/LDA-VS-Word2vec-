The forks and knives were smudged and gross, and the residue came off when rubbed with a finger. The plates had spots on them, little black ones like pepper. This has happened here before, too. I'm shocked the waitstaff doesn't at least look at these plates/utensils before bringing them out to customers.
Secondly, they really need to do something about the big round table closest to the front door. In the winter, people are constantly coming in through the revolving door, which blasts that table with cold air. Often, the door doesn't shut all the way, and we were so cold, we had to eat with our coats on! I did see space heaters near the entrance, but it didn't help. They should not seat people there in winter if they can't fix this issue, it was that cold.
