SktLID5_ywSlgVE-h3NB3Q NEVER EVER COME to this place! I odered 3 large fried rice for the price of $26bux and ask for more forks and chop stick because it would be 10 of us eating sharing, but the guy said we can only get 6. Terrible place. I always order large amount of food when going to Chinese food but this is the only place that said to me that you can only have 6? Wtf?!
