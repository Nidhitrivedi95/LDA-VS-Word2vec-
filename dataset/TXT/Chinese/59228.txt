DiCWSyoaBkIpOVUdIO7Jlg Dinner at Little Dumpling wasn't my choice, but I was open to trying it.

The restaurant serves Chinese AND Thai. It's one thing for a buffet or fusion restaurant to offer an array of dishes influenced by different cultures, but the red flags shoot up in my mind when I notice when a restaurant "specializes" in a wide range of cuisines.

Wonton Soup: Flavorless. I think I know how this was made - (1) Boil water and add frozen, mixed veggies, (2) Add 5 wontons. 

Panfried Chow Mein: It was fried, making it the best thing I ate out of the three items ordered.

Panang Curry: Curiosity got the best of me when I ventured to the "Thai" section of the menu. Sadly, the curry had a watery consistency. Not good at all. 

Service: The food arrives in an instant. 

Overall: I just have to pass up this place. Though the food is affordable and is delivered to your table almost immediately, I'd rather eat at Panda Express down the road.
