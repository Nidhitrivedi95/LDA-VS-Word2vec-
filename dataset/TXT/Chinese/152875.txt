T5iVkzBXvG5cG6de_TMquw We were in a hurry, and had about 10 minutes get some food for the road. The chef who owned the place totally got this and prepared us an excellent JB Roll. Crispy form the outside, soft inside, and mix with the sweet sauce, all well cut, all in a very short period of time. He was great! Definitely come back again!
