Z5OoLZ_gKDHZGKs6gtR28w the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever had at a fast-food restaurant.

I arrived at 8:45pm and the place was packed.  3 employees on the line and 3 cooking.  You could tell they were working hard to get everyone served quickly.

I ordered egg rolls with my meal, and they had just sold out.  It happens.  He asked me if I minded waiting for a fresh batch, and I told him it was no problem.  Well, it did take a while for them to be ready...to the point that most people might have started getting mad.  But, here's why I was impressed:

#1.  I have no idea who the manager was.  Everyone was on their game to get it done and you could tell that they genuinely cared.

#2.  While I was waiting, they apologized and I knew they meant it.  Two of them asked how my day was.

#3.  I was offered a cup to get something to drink while I waited (I hadn't ordered a drink).

#4.  When I left, he said:  "I'd like to offer you a coupon for the next time you come in.  Since you had to wait as long as you did."  It was an unexpected but nice touch.

In times that it's so easy to get pissed off about things that are beyond anyone's control, it's great to see that people actually care about serving customers.
