QmNrHxN7UahtdliH_kAuUg Recently "rediscovered" Ka Mei after deciding to eat here again in a long time. I still think that it is a tad pricey overall, although for certain items the quality and/or quantity is rather worthwhile. To me, it also now seems to be less comparable to Oriental Kitchen; there's a bit of overlap, but this place feels more homely and is okay for a small quiet meal, while Oriental Kitchen is better for groups and seafood.

In particular, many of their rice plates and noodles seem to be fine choices. Their fried rice noodles with beef (<U+5E72><U+7092><U+725B><U+6CB3>) is a Cantonese staple, and it was both tasty and sizable for the price. We also wanted a noodle soup but it was late and they apparently ran out of soup. Wasn't too much of a problem, so changed it to a black bean pork rib rice plate order instead. While this one could've used a little less sauce, the bell pepper and onion were fresh and the rib meat was plentiful.
