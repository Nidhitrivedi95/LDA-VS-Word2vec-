FmwDfn5J7Y8Uvv_FY7iUxQ They sold us 1.5 lb fish but they gave us 1.0 lb fish, if that was even 1.0 lb.  My wife is from a small fishing village and knows her fish size.  When we brought it to the attention of the waiter named Homer, he said if the kitchen staff says the fish is 1.5 lbs, then it is 1.5 lbs.  We told him to recheck with the kitchen.  Now the same waiter says this fish is 1.25lbs and was meant for a next table.  My wife told him this is less than 1.25 lbs and told Homer to recheck with the kitchen.   

Regardless, something like this should not happen at an expensive restaurant like this.   We are not in a third world nation where a restaurant can get away from cheating the customer like this.   

The waiter Homer has not come back yet with the final answer but he and the restaurant ruined our Friday night dinner.  

Well the waiter came back with a Fat fresh fish that he claims is 1.5 lbs and says it is the same fish.  The fish we were serve is no where near as far as the fish Homer brought to show us to compare.   Needless to say, we will not be back to this cheater restaurant.

Shame on the cheaters!!!!

After the bad experience at Blue Lagoon, we searched for a new place to eat Chinese food.  We found a place called Jam House Sea Food restaurant.  My wife and I love it here.  We mainly had dim sum only, but the quality was head and shoulder above all the Chinese restaurants we tried in Mississauga.  The food is clean, fresh and even the staff are flawlessly dressed and friendly (which is very very rare in Chinese restaurants.)  After the blue lagoon fiasco, we are very happy to have found Jam House.
