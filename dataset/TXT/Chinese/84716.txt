HI56ArpYEbhEUeRx9Curpw This has to be my all-time favorite restaurant. We order off the Hong Kong menu and we have never left the restaurant unsatisfied. Everything we try is excellent and has a very authentic taste. I hope to try every dish on the menu. The owner (or maybe it's the head chef?) is a very friendly older man who comes out from the back sometimes and says hi to people. This isn't the nicest looking place but since the food is so great and the prices are way low, I'll keep come back forever.
