QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw Surprisingly great hotpot!  We decided to stop by based on the reviews and it sure did not let us down.  It's a clean cute little restaurant with great parking.  It was pretty busy as we arrived around 8pm on a Friday evening.  

We ordered the Spicy kimchi broth with beef.  Wow!  The portion was huge!  They gave a lot of veggies (which we did not finish) and a perfect amount of beef.  The broth on the other hand was alright (a little too bland for a kimchi broth,  I was expecting a little bit more flavour) 

Staff was amazing!  defiantly a must if you're in the area and is craving a something little nice and warm.
