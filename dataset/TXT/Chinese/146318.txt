S37sKRRfkhFZRpxaYzWo_A Tried this place it for the first time with my boyfriend and everything was delicious!!! We shared the pan fried dumplings which were delicious. He and I each got our own entree but it was entirely too much food. He ordered the beef stir-fry with spicy xo sauce. Holy cow!!!!! His was amazing! By far the best noodles I've had. I got a chicken stir fry with shaved noodles and that was amazing too. Loved watching the noodles being made and the staff was attentive and friendly.
