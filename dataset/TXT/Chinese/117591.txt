nFktMPlUZh06-dGTg4HdPw I am shocked that this place hasn't closed down..  Came on a friday 3pm lunch to get the lunch special..  As i enter its pretty clear that space is completely empty.  I get moderately greeted as expected for a asian restaurant.  I purchased their black bean sauce chicken and total comes up just above 10$.  You have to add a dollar if you want a drink. I got my food relatively early. Upon getting home and opening up my food i now realize ive been robbed of my money.  Portion is TERRIBLE not even worth 5 bucks id say. 

Taste is very mediocre..  Ive been to many chinese restaurants and i can honestly say this one is by far the WORST avoid this place at all cost
