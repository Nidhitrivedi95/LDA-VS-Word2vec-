Very authentic joint, and the food and preparation and presentation was Chinatown-authentic. My only disappointment was that I missed dim sum by a few hours and no matter how much I pleaded, I could not get any dim sum. However, the hostess told me she'd be happy to accommodate my dim sum jones Sunday morning (emoji).
