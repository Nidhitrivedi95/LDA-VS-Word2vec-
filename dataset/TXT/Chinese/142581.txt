rkTFLIt_Z1bYMIuXfSyAqg Wonton Hut is located inside Markham town square plaza (highway 7 and Warden); it's right next to McDonald. 
It's a small little place with an open kitchen that you can see right through from the sitting area. Staff were very friendly, service was fast. As soon as you sit down, staff already bring you your hot tea and chopsticks. 
I always get my usual, shrimp wonton egg noodle soup. Wontons are full of shrimps, no fillers. Shrimps have nice texture. Chili oil is not very spicy here (the one at Jim chai kee is a lot better) 

Overall, fast and friendly service, good wonton noodle soup.
