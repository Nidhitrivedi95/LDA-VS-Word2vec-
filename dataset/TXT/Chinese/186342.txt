YAhRuV3oRkwGk3Or9PJ3Ww Happy Garden has surprisingly fresh tasting food. For my fellow Veg-heads, I'd suggest ordering the Vegetable Delight with a side of garlic sauce. And for the carnivorous beings, I'd recommend not eating meat.... I'm sorry I had to do it :) If you just have to curb that desire I'd go with the sesame chicken, steamed dumplings, crab rangoon or chicken and broccoli (Recommended by my meat eater travel partner)
