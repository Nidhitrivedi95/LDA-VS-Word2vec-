Oq76C1wZosdT0ZrA3dJPxQ This place is legit. If you are Chinese this place will not disappoint. The fish in hot oil is up there with top notch restaurants I've eaten in in China. The xiao long bao was on point. The waitress was helpful and very friendly. I knew it was the real thing when the menu had multiple misspellings and  Engrish words that made no sense. The location is a little confusing to find as they didn't bother changing the sign of the previous owner and just wrote the name of the restaurant on a white board outside. The only other legit place in Charlotte is Lee's Cafe, but I would have to say that this place is better for the price and taste.
