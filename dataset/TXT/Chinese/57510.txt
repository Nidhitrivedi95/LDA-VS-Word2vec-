D8a2usm9b-j89W9IrJ_Evw Nice off (but close to) strip option if you are craving Thai food. It is a nicely decorated, clean, business casual set up. Good parking. Prices were reasonable and lunch portions were more than enough for us. We got traditional Thai menu items: Pad Thai and the Yellow curry with the option of coconut white rice (yum!) The pad Thai was a nice balance of fresh and slightly sweet. The protein in it: Shrimp and steak were tender, flavorful  and cooked well. The yellow curry was delicious and had a nice balanced ratio between chicken and vegetables. The sauce was a bit thinner than I'm used to but it was really good. I ended up skipping the rice at times and just slurping the curry all by itself. It was that good! The chicken pieces was tender and good too. We finished off with mango/sticky rice which was also delicious, creamy and sweet. Service was excellent!
