emDKRy7zU0pqISwM71wbKQ Ate here for lunch today with my hubbs. Ordered Crab Puffs, Mongolian Beef and Fried Rice. It's hard for me to describe my experience here. When we came in the restaurant the waiter(?) asked us if we had a to go order. When we said we wanted to stay he seemed honestly surprised. I immediately felt uncomfortable and my husband and I exchanged a look but sat down anyway. 

Our drinks consisted of a single can of soda (split) even though we ordered two drinks and two Styrofoam cups with a hunk of ice in each. We ordered and the food came quickly and was decent. That is the only reason this place deserves a single star. The food we experienced seemed fresh and tasted good, despite what other reviewers experienced. It was the general "get the f*$k out of here," attitude we received via our "service" that striped this place of stars. 

No refills offered, no napkins, and everything was served on to go plates except our crab puffs, which was really odd. The unwelcome for a sit down meal was so strong it was palpable. We left as quickly as possible and we definitely won't be returning.
