LoB-Ho9DRsNcWkoz_a_vJA According to my 11-year-old daughter, "This is the best place in the whole world and if you don't come here then you are missing a piece of your soul." It's a fairly new restaurant, so they don't have many reviews yet. Come and try them out. It's worth a visit. Or two. Or three . . .

The customer service is wonderful. If we lived near here, we would be regulars because we know we would always get personable, friendly, and attentive service.

This is our second visit in a week. We fully enjoyed the pork with vermicelli and a spring roll, wonton egg noodle soup (but my daughter had them swap out the egg noodles for vermicelli noodles, which they were happy to do), and crispy spring rolls. The sauce that comes with the pork and spring rolls adds just the right extra touch of flavor.They also have a nice selection of canned and bottled sodas, as well as traditional Vietnamese specialty drinks. Enjoy!
