Qqu_MRaus17-4VVmzXq1_g This might seem to be an ordinary Chinese restaurant. Dishes are no different compare to others but if you taste the dish, you can tell a big difference. Flavours is just right, steam fish showed great knife skills and perfect steaming time. Seafood is always fresh. Chicken tasted very good with a well balance taste of Chinese spice and wasabi. Not too overwhelming. Will come back for sure.
