Tm2dKN_-DCdZfF2xMWrX7w Any place that serves bubble tea is alright in my book! This is one of the very few places in Cleveland that serves bubble tea (also called boba as my west coast friends remind me). If you've never had bubble tea, you don't know what your missing, unless of course your one of those people that aren't big into textured things. Essentially bubble tea is a creamy, beverage with black tapioca balls (or pearls) resting on the bottom. Think melted milkshake type flavor with flavors ranging from coconut to almond tea to taro, which is my personal favorite.

As for the food, Siam has the best pad thai in Cleveland hands down. I haven't had Pad Thai this good since my travels to Thailand several years ago. It is an absolute must to squeeze the fresh lime wedge onto the dish, which compliments the flavors perfectly. I have also tried the Chicken Summer Roll and Veggie Summer Rolls which are both flavorful and fresh and make for a tasty light appetizer and the dipping sauce is delish. The menu is quite extensive and has many different options to suit everyone from the carnivore to the vegetarian. 

The service is usually excellent although if you go on a day in which they have a full house it seems as though sometimes you get lost in the mix. The ambiance is quite different from other Thai restaurants I've been to with minimal being the name of the game here. They have a fish tank and thankfully, I've yet to witness them trying to catch someone's meal!

And don't forget to try the bubble tea!
