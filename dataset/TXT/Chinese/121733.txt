oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw We recently located from LA so perhaps out expectations for "decent" Chinese food are high regardless, the food did not meet our expectations. The shrimp were all batter and greasy. The sweet and sour soup had a thick unfamiliar taste to it. The only thing that was ok was the white rice. My order was over $70 USD so we certainly had a representative sample of the menu. The order was take out do perhaps that was the problem? 
Anyway, we continue our search for Chinese food in Henderson NV.
