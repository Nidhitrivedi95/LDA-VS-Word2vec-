7aZf5c1UNotq4MabBXMZLA Braised Pork Rib Noodle Soup- the best thing I've eaten in months. And hotttttttt. Slurp, sniff, blow nose, slurp. This broth is the real thing x17. 

How long has it been since I had to blow my nose throughout the meal? Oh my gunness. 

And the noodles. I've never been much of a noodle-raver but these puppies know my name. 

Also in my favor is an eight percent discount with Yelp check-in.
