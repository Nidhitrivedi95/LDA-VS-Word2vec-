Not sure I'd go here unless hammered but they do serve late, their spicy shrimp is amazing and perfect for soaking up all the liquor from the night.  As is their beef black bean on rice noodle, seafood fried noodle and hot/sour soup.  You'll need some Gatorade still in the morning if you've been here because not only were you hammered then but now you'll be dealing with some serious sodium and msg...but still worth it.
