dOGLTIMqqQZn8xxBRsU6CQ TREATED SO BADLY AFTER BEING A LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR 5 YEARS!!!! I have been ordering delivery from this place for 5 years, I called tonight to place an order and the lady on the phone rudely told me we don't deliver to you anymore! I tried to explain to her that they have delivered to me 2-3 a month for the last 5 years, she now starting yelling at me and said I told you 20 times we do not deliver there and hung up on me. I work In a casino/hotel on the strip and have always recommended them to guests and also ordered huge orders for my department! They charge for delivery but have always tipped 20-25 percent. I am so disappointed in this establishment of how they treated me and I will pass it on to everyone I know! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! You lost a great customer! Zero stars for you Kung Fu, you should be ashamed of your behavior!!!!!!!!!
