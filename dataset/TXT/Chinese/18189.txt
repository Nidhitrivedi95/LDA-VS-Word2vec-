5aGYZbjkXpCecz4QH2ZKFg With so many Chinese food places in the area this one has to be my 1st choice. I've sampled others so no, I'm not being biased. I rarely eat buffet style here, I typically just order to go and I am happy with it. One thing so will say is that sometimes they will charge extra for pork fried rice and etc, so make sure you check it because on more then one instance they didn't add the meat and I was charged for it. I wish they delivered and is would give 5 stars.
