KhYA1VGwy1naIiIAvPfolw With a fairly average interior (reminds me of Roberto's) with sit down restaurant prices, Chow Mein Express is the only Chinese restaurant within it's area so I really cannot complain.  The food is satisfying and they don't scrimp on the portions when we dined in.  Also, I enjoyed their Egg Drop Soup when I went; so it may have just been a poor batch when Miriam C. ordered.
