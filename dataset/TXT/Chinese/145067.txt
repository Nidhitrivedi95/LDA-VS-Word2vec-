rXJyCT9XqWD431B1lp4Thg This is a brand new restaurant at a very old chinese plaza that is famous for food. It replaced what was previously a vietnam restaurant. in fact they had not changed the decor at all in the restaurant. This spicy house i would say i had not much of an expectations, but the food was a pleasant surprise and has been very good and authentic. 

We had ordered 3 dishes. the snail is one of the traditional street food, in china and this was done very well. the spicy sauce was really flavourful and good, and not overly spicy. The crispy chilie chicken was very generous in portion price and flavour, it is a really good food. and i have it definitely at the top of food you must try again. It was flavourful and great. the eggplan tdish was a very different spice from what other restaurants do. and it is a unique spice they used that made it very alluring and not too spicy for those who don't like it. 

The service was typical chinese restaurant and is nothing to rave about. however the food was very good, of the 3 dishes we ordered. the only criticism one would have is that it is a bit more oily than some people are used to in food. I think a little less oily would beenfit it. but the price and portion and taste has made it a restaurant i'm excited to try again soon, in a bigger group setting. 

I would recommend those who love spicy food, to try this restaurant, as it is very good and has a lot of staples that they serve in china.
