MSYpFcm5FAkQYLcY6tkOgw I ate here once a while ago..I got the eggplant and tofu and it was really good for a take-out Chinese place. At the time I was confused as to why they quit was blue but now I know that's just how Chinese eggplant is LOL

However today I stopped in on my way home from work to pick up a lunch special and the smell inside was so horrible I immediately turned around and walked out.

It smelled like a mix between a wet dog, rotting meat, and sewage.

 I don't set high standards for cleanliness in restaurants , but this was just a bit too much

 I will never return and would give no stars if I could
