Bp7Qj64Qr8jvj3r7WBtmSg Went here with my fiance after hearing good things about their BBQ. At first glance, this seemed like a good choice because the place did seem pretty popular at dinner time, but the food was pretty meh.

We decided to order peking duck, the lettuce wrap (rainbow chop), and beef in HP sauce (I think that's the english name)?

The peking duck was probably the worst I've had. The pancakes were sticky, thick and cold.The duck was OK. The rainbow chop was terrible though. The duck legs weren't included and the meat/veggies was super watery. That was the first time I had peking duck I didn't like.

The beef in HP sauce was ok. Beef was super tender but the sauce was only OK.

Overall service was not bad. (Which is a good thing for Chinese restaurants)

I wouldn't recommend this place. There's plenty of Chinese restaurants in Mississauga that are much better and have similar if not better prices.
