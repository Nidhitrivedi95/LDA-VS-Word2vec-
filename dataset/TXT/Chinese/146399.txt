s3AG8m6Pzq-vON729pf0gw I have been to this place a few times in the past and the sushi was always good. I hadn't been back in almost 2 years when we went yesterday.

I was actually kind of shocked at how badly the decor and the cleanliness of the place had gone downhill. The bathrooms were disgusting, and looks like they hadn't been cleaned in a couple of days. The tables were sticky, the floor was sticky, the silverware was dirty and so were the glasses. This place needs to be cleaned thoroughly and needs to give instructions to their staff on how to clean because this place was really gross. We almost got up and left because of that. 

The waitress was very nice, but barely spoke any English. She got our order wrong, and what we ordered first as an appetizer came about the same time we had finished eating and we got our bill. Our kids meal was extremely late, and came just as we were finishing our meal. It was all messed up.

I got to say the food was pretty decent, the Las Vegas roll was good and everything we had was decent it's just not enough for me anymore. I can't go to a place that feels disgusting to sit in.
