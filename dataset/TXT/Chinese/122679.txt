OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Ok. We've been here a couple of times over the years for Dim Sum. The quality has declined severely that I had to make a review about this place. 

Food taste is alright. It's bland. 

I would be wary about the sanitation. We saw an employee dropped a Chinese donut, then picked it back up, and placed it back on the plate (back in the cart).....we also had rotten hai guo. That shrimp.....ewwww....lost my appetite. Probably should thank them for making me eat less. 

I don't want to go to this restaurant again, but what can you do with Chinese parents in Las Vegas?
