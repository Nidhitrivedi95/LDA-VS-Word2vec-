Q62lGVKqoKJ09lZNt2qpfw The chicken pakoras are delicious, and have huge pieces of chicken, and potatoe. They are very spicy, but heck it's Hakka, so suck it up. These things will clear your sinuses. These are the biggest pakoras I've ever seen. The chicken spring rolls I had ordered were not greasy at all, and we're really crunchy and light. I know I've tried other dishes here in the past and have never been disappointed. The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was cozy. Great place for take out or dine in.
