6uA2uRexFr8kfv7ghzryHg First time here, I don't find it as bad as the previous reviews TBH. Arrived around 8pm, there were 3/ 6 tables. There are customers, just not a lot. Restaurant is small and can only seat about 15-20 people max. I didn't ask for the use of the bathroom, but I did not see one during the time I sat there for dinner.

*Yunnan cross bridge noodle is suppose to be like this with 2 piece of meat and variety of different types of vegetables. Be understanding to the dish itself and the background before you make yourself sound so uneducated or inexperienced!!* 

I think it comes with normal amount of variety of vegetables. In fact, it comes with 2 quail eggs when most places only comes with 1. I find it filling. 

Soup- NOT hot enough, quail eggs were only cooked till poached level and my beef was like blue rare-ish even though I put those in first and stick them at the bottom. 
- soup was blend imo, not really to my liking. Yet I only tried the tomato soup base. My partner had beef brisket noodle and was meh. It wasn't bad with taste.. just that we had better ones... and there are better ones around the corner or near the restaurant. 

Price- quite pricey ($3-5 dollars difference) in terms of cross bridge noodles, and given the fact in that area along with other competitors, I can see why customer level was limited.  

Not my #1 place to go to, and not something I would crave for that I must come to this location for this type of food or kind of flavor.
