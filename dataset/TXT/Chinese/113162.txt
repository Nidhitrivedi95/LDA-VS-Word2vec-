mmt2tfx6HkMPVJs2Ecr-Sw We had planned dinner at our favorite restaurant in Montreal's Chinatown but since it was hosting a banquet, we ended up at this Cantonese restaurant walk-up.

At 5 pm, the staff was still in the middle of the family meal but they welcomed and sat us quickly. The restaurant featured disposable plastic tablecloths, mismatched chairs (some of them were folding) and tight spaces. Despite this, there was a line of guests that snaked down the stairs as guests settled in for a wait.

We selected a number of dishes, which when served family style, highlighted our love of sweet and sour flavor combinations. We gorged ourselves on crunchy stir-fried shrimp and chopped onions in tomato sauce; tender, crispy fried pork with onions and peppers in a sweet and sour sauce (my fave); fried shrimp and chicken with mayonnaise; savory crispy-skin duck with a sweet hoisin sauce, and a slightly spicy General Tso's chicken. A complimentary pork/black bean broth-based soup was served at the start of the meal, and similar to many other Chinese restaurants, orange wedges were served at the end.

With quick service and a hungry table, we were done quickly, freeing up the table for the other hungry guests.
