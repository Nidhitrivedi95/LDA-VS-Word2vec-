xxo0GsAFxQzUGStmCG6jWw I'm a big fan of grillin' Mongolian style.  I love Asian food in general, so this is right up my alley.  (I must be out of the loop and super-uncool because I have absolutely no idea what this YC is that you speak of...)  I feel this place has taken a lot of mistakes of other Mongolian grills and learned from them  Here's the lowdown on the pros and cons...

Pros:
**A wide selection of everything!  Meats offer the traditional steak, chicken, pork, but also options such as shrimp, crab (albeit imitation), scallops, and tofu.  Veggies have pepper and onion combos, mandarin oranges, celery, raw egg, and a few other options that I haven't seen at other establishments.  The starches are more than white rice here - they offer brown rice and udon noodles too.

**Seasonings and sauces.  They have a bunch of seasonings to put on your meat before you pile on the veggies.  I think this is a good idea.  I have no idea if my shrimp was more or less tasty because I did it, but it made me feel better having another option to make it my own.  Their sauces are all sugar based and they add them at the end (which is a plus) so they don't burn.  The how-to list of concoctions is handy, but I like to be brave and go it alone.  It's definitely a trial and error process.

**Price.  I think $8 is reasonable for a large bowl of Mongolian grill.  Granted, there are some tips and tricks to getting the most out of your dollar (pile high and push it down my friends) and some strategery to the order of which you load on your veggies.

**Happy hour.  I can't remember what all of their drink specials are, but I know there are $2 wells and they make 'em strong. Nuff said.

Cons:
**The all-you-can-eat propaganda.  As a person who never makes the most of a buffet, all-you-can-eat is not really for me.  I think how it works here is that you can go back and do a second+ bowl and move up to the $12 bracket.  I like a lot of veggies and I had a hard time getting all I wanted in the bowl (yes, even with all of the tips and tricks), but I would have willingly paid the $12 to get two bowls at the get go to make one bad mamma jamma of a stir-fry.  Maybe next time I'll see if I can finagle...

**Assembly line set-up.  You can only serve from one side of the item line and let me say, it can be a little daunting.  For a first timer taking their time and getting it all worked out, you start to feel the pressure as the line builds behind you.  It's not a process in which I like to be rushed.  It's not a big deal and people can go around or whatnot, but it's not very conducive to serving a lot of people at once.

I'll definitely be back to have another go at it.  Skip YC's and go straight to Genghis Grill, or so I've been told...
