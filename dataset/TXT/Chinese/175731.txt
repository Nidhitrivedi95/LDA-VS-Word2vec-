WKayXylpXcAEReoqgNK3tA Been here twice and both times a good experience overall.  It's a restaurant/sport bar but more upscale than your typical sports bar.  In the evening (at least the Friday night we were there) there is a DJ spinning tunes.  

The owner/servers (??) are really nice and friendly.   It's a Trini/Chinese style of food but per the server they are trying to do things a little differently to stand out against the other West Indian/Hakka places in the area.

I'm going to cut to the chase and just say ORDER THE PEPPER SHRIMP.  Had it twice now and I'm addicted.  I will always order this from here from now on.

Between the 2 visits had the mixed chow mein, peeper shrimp, pepper fish, wings, chicken fried rice and goat curry.  While the do have curry on the menu, they get this from Drupati's (located besides them) so you can only order the curry if Dru's is open.

With the exception of the chicken fried rice which I found a bit salty and more wet (I like fried rice a bit more on the drier side) everything was good.

For the pepper shrimp alone I'd come back
