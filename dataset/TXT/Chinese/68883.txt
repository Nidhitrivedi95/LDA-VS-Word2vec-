eW6HLU-M3xJOpGyKLrWxUg My husband and I ordered take-out from here yesterday. My Bangkok Shrimp was loaded with more water chestnuts than shrimp, and water chestnuts were not listed as an ingredient of the dish on the menu. I hate water chestnuts. It should be shrimp, scallions, and basil. I asked if I could add mushroom and she said ok, then I asked if I could please add broccoli, and she told me, "no, no add broccoli." I was willing to pay extra if need be. My dinner sucked. My husbands wasn't bad, he had the Panang curry with beef. The chicken and broccoli my son ordered was good. I won't be going back here, especially since it's too difficult to add a vegetable per the request of the customer.
