yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I often eat Pho but I've never seen a Pho restaurant that big. We arrived at 6:45pm on a Monday and It was packed, which is usually a good sign! The food was served really quick, like we sat down at 7pm, ordered (7:05pm), and the food was served (7:06pm)! It's was almost faster than eating at McDonalds!
