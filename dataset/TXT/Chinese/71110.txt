fAo-3jt3oD69nwnr5M6FLQ On my girlfriends first trip to Vegas we thought we needed to hit up a higher end restaurant.  We're middle class people, but I feel that I've ate at my fair share of nice restaurants.  I was disappointed with this place.

The decor was impressive at first.  However, once we sat down I noticed that the table settings we worn along with the wall decorations.  Also the seating was Chicago style where you are about 1.5 feet from the couple next to you.  I hate that soooo much.

I'll admit I played it safe and ordered something I knew.  It tasted just like it did in the midwest.  Which is highly disappointing.  I went here for something special.  Instead I got something that tasted like my favorite take out back home.  Only the price was inflated 5 fold.  Each of us had a drink, entree, rice, and shared a dessert, $150, after tip.

The staff was wonderful and friendly.  The chef even came out a couple times while we were there.  It simply was just average food.  Maybe one of the prefix tasting menus would of been a better experience.  However, the regular menu was just that, regular.
