cRTkev8c66o6q6v7FstjLA Great food, fast and friendly service. Visited this location for lunch with my father who eats there often. Wait staff greeted him by name which pleased him and they were extremely friendly during our meal. Food was delivered quickly to our table after we placed our order and tasted great. Portions are very large and quality is great...food is priced really well. Definitely recommend trying this location if you are in the area.
