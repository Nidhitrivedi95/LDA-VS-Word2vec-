RJnikmkw2aW4gF2zcmxfvQ If you enjoy spicy Asian food, this is the place. It's great! I'm always amused at the long lines that form here during lunch hours. Don't let the interior decor of the place fool you; it's the food and prices that will have you coming back for more. 

Service is prompt. Their system works. Order at the front, pay, wait (about 10-15 minutes), and then you'll have pipping hot Hakka food brought to your table to be enjoyed!

Tip: try the chili chicken and Hakka beef chow mein, it's far better than what's across the street on Airport Road (i.e. Asian Wok n' Roll among the other saturated Hakka places in the one-strip plaza that exist there). There are many other options on their  lunch menu; many of which I have yet to try.  Minus a star as they only take cash and credit only, and not debit.
