zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ The noodle bar is located on the first floor of the hotel. Sitting is a bit tight and crowded; okay for a causal quick meal with your friends but not ideal to hang out in large group. Place is crowded and quite loud; hard to chit chat in large  group. 
Price is a bit higher than other ramen places. Pork Ramen noodles was delish; broth was quite rich and flavourful. Server said their menu changes often with new items coming on/off menu; however, pork ramen has always been a consistent item on the menu.  Pork Ramen is $16 which is a couple dollars more than other places. A friend of mine wanted beef ramen; however, it's sold out for the day. They settled for  Chicken Tan tan ramen; it came with little broth and broth wasn't great; it had a strange nutty taste that I didn't quite enjoy. 
Their buns are quite delicious. One order comes with 2 buns and around $10 which is very reasonable. Bbq pork buns were flavourful; buns made out of rice flour; bbq pork was nicely seasoned. The slaw and pickles complimented the meat perfectly. I would recommend the buns.
