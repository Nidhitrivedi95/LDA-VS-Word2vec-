qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA Since I'm Chinese, I can only give the food at PF Chang 4 stars . . . but the day that I came here for lunch, the service was 5 stars if not 6 stars.

The waiter was so professional, so attentive I looked aroudn to make sure I wasn't on candid camera getting punked. 

In fact, the service was so good, when it came time to leave a tip, my hand had a mind of its own and left a 50% tip.

And I left a happy costumer, looking forward to coming back here again and hopefully getting the same waiter!
