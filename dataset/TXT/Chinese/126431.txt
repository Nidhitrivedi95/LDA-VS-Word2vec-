P0IY-8h2q--Uiw6vKIJ3QQ Really, really good Cantonese cuisine... Hot, fresh and DELISH...great dumplings, fried items were nice and light, not greasy... Shrimp was plump,succulent and perfectly cooked. Chicken was all breast meat and the sauces were great... First time I've ordered, I'll definitely be back!! Great job, keep up the good work!!




Just got dinner here again and realized why I LOVE this place so much.... reminds me of home/college...I'm from NYC... and yes... I get thats a 7996 mile distance from Canton...but it tastes just like home... in fact, I actually worked at a joint... sorry, .... establishment, w/the same name taking orders... before I left for a bookie joint...... settle down, it was college and it payed better.... probably because it wasn't strictly legit.... I digress... the food is quintessential, PERFECT Cantonese... I know because the folks I previously worked for were FROM Canton and this is the closest thing I've had since then. Tip of the hat to them, and the folks that own THIS Tsing Tao.... if it wasn't for those lovely folks... I'd have STARVED, and been broke through college... so thank them, for an engineering degree... sort of, and thank THESE lovely folks for dinner and the memory...
