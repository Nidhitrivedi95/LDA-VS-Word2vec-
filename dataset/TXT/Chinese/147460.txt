SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  The food is exceptionally good and very fresh and full of strong flavor.  I describe this cuisine as Americanized Asian food.  I like that they offer an option of brown rice with all the meals, and you can substitute most of the meats for tofu if you like that.  The Evil Jungle Princess is my absolute favorite.  A sweet and spicy peanut sauce on top of chicken, mushrooms, onions, and crispy fresh green beens that are cooked just the right amount so they snap when you bite into them.  I also love the Wango Mango chicken with big chunks of mango.  Everyone always loves the New Wave Pad Thai.  The Teriyaki Salmon is cooked to perfection, on top of a bed of wasabi mashed potatoes and green beens.  The Firecracker chicken tastes like wing sauce, so if you like wing sauce you will like this.  Otherwise you might want to pass.  The best part of this restaurant is the kids meals.  They serve them in a Bento Box, with little square compartments for each portion of the meal.  It's a great value that comes with a main dish of either noodles and chicken or wonton chicken, and edamame, and fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and a whole large bag of M&Ms, that the waiter was smart enough to secretly hand me on the side instead of serving it up with the rest of the meal.
