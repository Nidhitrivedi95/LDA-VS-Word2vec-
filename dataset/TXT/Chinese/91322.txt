IIWz96zl3D8thYIxv3-5mA If I were to ever give a five star review to a fast food restaurant, this would be it... but of course I can't as it is fast food. 

The BEST Chinese and Thai take out anywhere in the Charlotte area.. In Gaston county. They recently won 8th place in the Top 100 Takeouts category. I tried looking up the source - but all I found was their listing and menu. No ranking.

The point is, this is some damn good takeout. While it might not be everyday, I can easily fall into the statistic that Americans consume 2.5 million Chinese meals per day.. That's $25 billion in annual sales with over 46k Chinese food places is the country.. Well.. There the only ones open on Christmas.. What do you want??? It's tradition you know?

Health score at the time this was written was a 95. It is the cleanest takeout I think I've been in. I didn't wonder what was growing out of the ice machine.

If you're having trouble locating the place, it's right next door to the Food Lion and the pitiful excuse of a pizza place, Market Street pizza.. Hide your  wives and your kids from going into that pizza place. Yuck. 

What's good eats here: I like the sesame chicken, General Tso's, and the spicy garlic beef or pork or chicken. Good stuff.
