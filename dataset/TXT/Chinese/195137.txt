zgQHtqX0gqMw1nlBZl2VnQ Really nice place. A bit smaller than I expected. Personally, I thought it was too dark, but I did end up going around 9:30-10pm. 

I ordered the BBQ pork buns first and they took about 5 minutes to get there. They were exceptional. The pork was amazing and the bun was soft; not to my expecting but to my liking. It was presented really nicely.

I also ordered the Momofuku ramen. This took about 7 minutes to get there from when I ordered. The service here was very fast, which I liked. The ramen was decent, nothing too special in my opinion. I didn't even end up finishing it because it got pretty old after several bites. 

Lastly, the desert was pretty good; soft-served ice cream twist with cornflakes. But, like the ramen, it was nothing special. 

Upstairs there's a milk bar and another bar i didn't really get a chance to look at. And a floor above there are two more restaurants. 

Overall, 3.5/5.
