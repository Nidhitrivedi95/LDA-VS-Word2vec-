brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA We wanted to try something different - and saw a Groupon; otherwise we would have never discovered this hidden gem! The short rib was so tender and delicious. The dumplings were great... but amazingly their simple cucumber salad appetizer was, surprisingly, crazy good!  Overall a great Asian Raman/BBQ restaurant, with very reasonable prices and a friendly staff.  Highly recommend this for a casual and tasty lunch or dinner - you won't be disappointed!
