vX-FwyJ7eINXn_Gn6CqMFg Ive been here several times and they have been fairly consistent with their quality of food. Love the lettuce wrap. Definetly a go to place for chinese and filipino food. They have all the staple filipino food like lumpia and pancit. There serving is really big too. If your hungry, check this place out.
