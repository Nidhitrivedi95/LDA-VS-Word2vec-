lkM72Y21bjBqUGaW7iL7tQ Wow, I'm surprised by some of the negative comments - although I guess anytime you introduce dim sum into the mix it's going to be all over the map. 

I've been here three times for regular dinner and once for a dinner banquet ($700+ per table).  Every time I LOVED the food. 

We've had conch sashimi, vegetables in broth, egg with shrimp, lobster with maggie sauce, cold Dungeness crab, duck with taro, Peking duck, duck or chicken lettuce wraps, fried oysters in honey sauce, sticky fried rice, etc.   The food here is sooooo good, and it's not just your ordinary dishes.....

Service has been great every time we've been...but we go with regulars so that might help.
