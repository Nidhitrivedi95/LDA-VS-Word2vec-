KkmSbkWOWC3DtY-Sxa9PmQ We didn't come in with high expectations for this Chinese Restaurant in Peoria. Not many pictures on Yelp and decent reviews so we figured, why not. 

Overall it was average. Everything tasted the way it should've but not of high quality (think fast food take out). The egg drop soup was bland and the egg roll was mostly vegetables. The only thing we almost finished was the fried rice on our combo plates.

Don't drink the ice water unless you get a lemon or something because Arizona's finest was off today.
