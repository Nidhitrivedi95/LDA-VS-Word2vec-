Keep in mind that food is very subjective and my personal opinion is that they do an amazing job with their steamed dumplings and crab rangoon. I've had their fried rice and other dishes but frankly I prefer the stuff on their appetizer menu. 
You can dine in, carry out or have them deliver the food. I've done all three. The ambience is not much, very basic but I come for the food not for the decor.
