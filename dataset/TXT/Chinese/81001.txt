GWNmYFQw3WitfTPt5uGMvQ First I have to say I have been visiting this restaurant for at least 5 years now, and have never had a disappointing meal.  I read reviews that say much to the contrary and I just have to laugh.  I lived in China myself for two years. The food here is the closest to REAL Chinese food, not Americanized stuff thrown together like a Panda Express etc. where they are marketing to Americans.  

If you find that you do not like the food at Beijing, it is probably because you've never had it prepared like this before.  That's not saying there isn't a place for Panda, but don't discount Beijing if you've never tried it before because of that kind of comparison review.  

For reference, I would say I eat at this place, or have had delivery, at least 12 times per year on average over the past two years since I moved back to Vegas.  

Yes, their chairs could use a cleaning or redo; but having lived in China I recognize that this is just standard; but I am giving them the four stars for this as it is America and we do  have different standards.  

Love the food! Would like to see a sprucing up of their interior too.
