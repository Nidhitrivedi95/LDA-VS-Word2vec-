wNlpUnbCwAsMAu9Z1wc2nw I come here every now and then and have always had a hot, fresh, and tasty meal. I like both the regular egg rolls and their spring rolls too. I love their teriyaki steak on a stick which I always get. I'm a fan of several Chinese restaurants all over the area so I keep this one for a dine in experience rather than take out. It has a nice atmosphere.
