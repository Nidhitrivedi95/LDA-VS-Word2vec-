HG9m9eldYtnX_UeMt4Yy2w Been coming here for years! I remember when the door wasn't glass and everyone had to cram in the tiny space to wait for tables. :) I think I might be biased but I enjoy the usual foods here. Though the sui long bao seems to have shrunk in size... And some of the foods have gotten a little bland, but some new items are pretty good... Oh and the service is always fast. ;) 

I like the picked veggies with the rice cakes. No clue what it was called. Chow leen go, for those who speak Chinese. :) and the noodles in their beef noodles are nice and chewy.
