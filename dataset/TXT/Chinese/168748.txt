Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA Ate here for the first time earlier this weekend and have been craving their pho ever since! We ordered gyoza, drunken noodles, and filet mignon pho. All of it was delicious! We couldn't finish the pho because the spice level was insane- I ordered a 3 (1 to 10 scale, we were warned that the 5 was spicy). The beef was good and tender, there were plenty of noodles, and despite clearing out my sinuses, the broth was sooooo good. Like I said, I'm craving it as I type this. We will definitely be back!
