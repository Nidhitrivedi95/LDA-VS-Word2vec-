SVMR0kRmdd-bbSNTTECJBA I've been coming here on and off for several years.  It may be one of the best places for Chinese food in the Phoenix metro area. The seafood (I've tried several shrimp or scallop dishes) is always super-fresh, and large.  The vegetables are always fresh and never mushy or overcooked; always a bit "al dente" the way I like them.   The pan-fried dumplings, shrimp with broccoli, and almond chicken were just perfect when we ordered delivery last week through DoorDash.   Service has always been good when we've eaten in house.  

I don't understand the recent "greasy" comment at all.  Nothing has ever been greasy; quite the contrary.  The food has consistently been less greasy than most other Chinese restaurants.
