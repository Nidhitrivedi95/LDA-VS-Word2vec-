tVVZcFFt3ZlWVE7nptN3EQ So good!! We ordered teriyaki chicken, pork lo mein and beef with mixed vegetables.  All proteins were so flavorful and moist. The vegetables were crisp, the noodles and rice were cooked perfect
 It has been so long since we have found a good Chinese restaurant. We will definitely be back.
