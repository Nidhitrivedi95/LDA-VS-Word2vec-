cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw First strike: We order the chinese donut, and 2 main dishes (vegetable and beef)
The beef comes out first so we dive right in because we were starving.  About halfway through we ask our server when our other dish will be coming out.  After about 5 minutes she comes back and says "we ran out of green beans, do you want to order another dish"  Um....shouldn't you have checked this when you first put our order in the kitchen?  We decided not to get the vegetable dish and just finish our meal.

Second strike:  They put extra charges on our bill.  They charged us for 3 chinese donut when we only ordered one, and they kept the vegetable dish on the bill.

Third strike:  On the final check that was handed to me, the total had gratuity included.  Really?  Mandatory gratuity for a party of 2?  Whatever.  I gave them my card and when it came back to me for my signature, it said in BIG BOLD LETTERS "PRE TIP AMOUNT".
First off, this is the first place that I've been to where they actually had "PRE TIP AMOUNT" in bold caps.  It's like they were trying to draw attention to it.
Secondly, W T F?  You include a mandatory gratuity that wasn't mentioned ANYWHERE on the menu, and now you try to get tipped twice by saying the FINAL amount w/ gratuity is the pre-tip amount???
Shady shady.  I won't be coming back here ever again. And if you read this and still end up going, double check your bill.  Who knows how much extra cash this place managed to squeeze out of unsuspecting patrons.

Another thing I remembered, they give you white rice without asking if you want it or not, and then they charge you for it.
