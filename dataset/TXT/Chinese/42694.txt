bEG0Ok_A90aojts6miAfgw I frequently shop at the great Lee Lee market and have often eyed this restaurant, I thankfully had some time while waiting for some watch batteries to be replaced at the adjacent jewelers to eat lunch at Hop Kee.
Now, first off I am (as they say) a woman with certain endowments who should know better than to wear a white shirt to an Asian restaurant but I really did not plan it out correctly...usually this ruins my experience 'cuz I'm such a dummy but not this time.
Singapore noodles are sort of a hard dish-it's either oily and flavorless flourescent yellow with shoe-leather pork or an incredible marriage of char siu and curry.  Hop Kee was certainly leaning toward the latter.  I really liked this dish, so much so I wore some home without shame!!
