dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw The food was not bad but nothing to write home about.  We ordered a lamb dish that was more bone than meat that was overpriced at 14.99.  The green beans with minced meat was good but again, overpriced at 9.99.  The dandan noodles were tasty, spicy and appropriately priced at 6.99. Our last dish was a cold sliced pork dish that was small for the 12.99 price tag.  They even charge for white rice which is a sin considering the cost per dish.  

The place was clean and appeared to be properly maintained.   The doors facing West are annoying at 6pm as every time it opens we got a face full of sun and heat.  

The staff got the job done but spent their time between customers dashing to the lockers.  They were either snagging food to munch on or checking their cell phones.  After the 10th time this one server checked her phone, I thought she was playing Pokémon Go or something.  

All in all, the food was passable albeit overpriced.  The restaurant itself is small but clean.  The service was sub-par at best.   With all of the great places to eat in Vegas, we won't be back.....there are better Szechwan offerings.
