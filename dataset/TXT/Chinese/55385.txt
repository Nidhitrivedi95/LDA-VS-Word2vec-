cwWQB8LyFbxxiOzgfZdWCg Pretty good food for Scottsdale, they offer not just Chinese but few other Asian dishes.

Very clean and nicely decorated inside, located next to Safeway, I always enjoy their food and service every time.

Daily lunch buffet is such a great deal, weekend price is a tad higher than weekday but it comes with mimosa. 

I like to order from regular menu, I haven't had any bad food here. I wouldn't say they are authentic but their flavor cater the area residents well without being too Americanized.

Service is always good, friendly and attentive. Owner speaks Chinese and Japanese (and English) to me as he said I look like I speak/understand all the language.  Later I heard he spent 8 years in Japan. No wonder why their teriyaki chicken is pretty solid.

I come here a couple times a year for the past 10 years. May not be frequent but something brings me back here again and again.
