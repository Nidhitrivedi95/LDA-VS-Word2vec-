DDdX9rGk5v6OVoH9VMkk4w Visited Best Wok II for the first time this week for some take out lunch. I was impressed with how clean this place was. They have plenty of clean tables and chairs to sit at if you wantes to dine in. The women taking orders at the frony was very friendly. When I got home with the oder, the food was hot amd fresh, it had lots of flavor...some of the best I've had! I ordered for my grandmother too and she really enjoyed it; she only wished for some more wantons in her wanton soup. It was good and I recommend a stopping in and trying some for yourself!
