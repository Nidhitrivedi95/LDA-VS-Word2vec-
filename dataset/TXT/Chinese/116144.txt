n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw Worst location in Vegas! The servers are rude and portions are small! This place used to be great! But lately with the new cooks it's gone down hill! You ask for extra chicken which is $2 and they try to play it off like they are giving you extra but it's the same portion size. The last three times they have messes up on my order and I was promised a gift card! It never came In the mail! If you want pei wei please go to the one on sunset! It's worth the drive! The manager is sweet and their portions are so worth it! 
Avoid the one on horizon ridge.
