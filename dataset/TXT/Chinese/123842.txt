oMuQVUYemxZQP8AllRLAqw My family and I come here regularly. The menu is great as there is one page that is pure vegetarian. The waitresses are like those in Hong Kong, fast and ready at a moment's notice.  They are always very considerate and ask if you want the recipe changed; they will always notify you if there is garlic (which some Buddhists avoid), milk or cheese if you mention you're herbivorous. 

My staples here often include fried salted tofu and vegetarian baked rice with white sauce and mock ham, red bean ice.  The baked rice dish comes with mock ground beef, and if they run out, the chefs will gladly substitute fake ham!  Yes, it is a little salty side but you can't help but feel satisfied when you leave.

Great place to go if you've got conflicting diets in a group of hungry people!
