iyPtSR0s6EkvaQFbdJ_jVA Delicious dim sum and very attentive service. Tried a variety of the steamed dumplings which were a decent size, black sesame balls were delicious and piping hot, and pork buns. That said, the prices are very high compared to Chinatown. However, if you want a lovely dining atmosphere to go with really good food, then this the place. Only care about the food, then heading a few blocks to Chinatown will cut your cheque by about one third.
