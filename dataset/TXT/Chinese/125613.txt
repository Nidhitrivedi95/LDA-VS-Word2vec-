Oy2WnPyiOlPFvPKMIuOC8w I have a love hate relationship with Tin Tin. Every time I come home to visit my parents in Charlotte, they wanna come here. My dad loves his buffets so I always get suckered into it. It always seem like a good idea at the time but I always leave wishing I never came!

For those of you that have been to Minado(the king of all seafood buffets) this is a cheap imitation.  Sure they have oysters and snow crab legs and clams and sushi, butthe quality is not the same. The oysters I wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole because it looks slimy and yucky. The sushi/sashimi all look like it was defrosted and I can't get myself to eat thawed out raw fish. I also skip all the hot food because its all generic american-chinese sesame chicken kinda food. The only saving graces are the crab legs which are decent and fresh, simply boiled. The pecking duck which they carve for you on the spit and put on a white bun with cucumber, housing and scallions. And the noodle soups they make to order. (I like the spicy broth)

People seem to love this place tho because there is usually a wait in weekends. You also have to be hyperagressive with getting the crab legs. But I'm not down with elbowing my way to the steam table to get my grub on.
