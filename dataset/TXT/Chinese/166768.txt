vEwazCciremwBgkRJgfXtw They deliver which is why I order from them but they can be pricey for what it is. The last two times I ordered from them my food was loaded with onions! $22 for a bowl of onions with sauce! 

Update: the prices listed on their website and on some flyers do NOT reflect the prices. I bought sushi last night and was surprised to find when I checked out it was $2 more than the price was listed online and their only explanation was, "oh, well it costs more now." It's something to think about if you are trying to stick to a certain budget.
