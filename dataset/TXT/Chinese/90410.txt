IFXL6wMLBgBSGSiLBjtViA A friend brought me here, this is his go to place for hotpot and I was so happy. I've been to two other hotpot places and they weren't as great. This place wasn't stingy with their all you could eat. The place was super clean and soup base was delicious. The service was great too! 

We went on a Thursday night and surprisingly, the place was not as busy which was great! It was quiet. I felt like I was super loud from laughing too much but who cares. The food was great, tried things I would never thought of putting into my hotpot! I like the fact that they had more options to put into your sauce. I love fresh chopped up chili in my sauce. 

The soup base that we got was Satay, it wasn't spicy but it was delicious. The dumplings are a must get and spinach noodles had a yummy texture. The beef was great, I was very very happy. We got too full on the first round and will have to come back to try the other things they have to offer. 

Do come here, I like this place way better than Little Mongolian Hot pot.

Too bad you guys cannot see my happy face or my happy dance.
