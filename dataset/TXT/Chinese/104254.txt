Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg I think this place is better then the ones located near where I live. The waiter always gives up water, ice tea, and coke without us asking a refill all the time. I think he was physic LOL because of it. My wait time was around 20 mins not bad. It was crowed during my visit there. The service I got was good. The food that came out was better then I expected if not better then the California locations.
