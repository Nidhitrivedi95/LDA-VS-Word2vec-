SBNucLXc9dQP6VBj__XOmQ Went to Ling & Louie's with a friend for dinner tonight to discuss upcoming photoshoots and design work. 
We walked in and were greeted by the bartender, and then we waited to be seated for what seemed like forever. 
Finally the bartender ended up seating us and was very friendly, however, once again we waited, and waited, for a server to greet us.
I have been in the service industry for well over 10yrs and this kind of treatment of customers is just completely inexcusable.
 I was glad I was in good company because otherwise I may have walked out.
Once we were greeted by a server, she didn't seem very personable or attentive to out needs or making sure that we were satisfied. She didn't really even seem to care that we were there or not.
We ordered appetizers and dinner. I was very pleased with the calamari that came with semi spicy sauce.
I ordered the ahi tacos which were also amazing! 
I was so stuffed that I didn't get a chance to try any dessert.
If It wasn't for the awesome food I would have only given one star. 
Not sure I would return unless it were just to hang out at the bar and only to be served by the sweet bartender.
