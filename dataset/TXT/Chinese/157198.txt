TtaXPsMrTGyPsAlO5LFQ6w This is a wonderful little restaurant that is under new management. It has just reopened after the previous owners retired. The new owner and staff is personable, helpful and friendly. 

The buffet is gone but in its place is a wonderful new menu. Hubby and I each ordered an entree so we could share.  I ordered the house Lo Marin ehich had beef, chicken and shrimp in a tasty peanut sauce, hubby ordered Moo Shoo Pork, both were fabulous and the servings were ample enough that we had lunch the next day. 

AND they deliver (within a certain area). We will definitely be returning
