N_ML37GOTOLtGKWqRnbJRA I go there at least once a weak during weekdays at lunch time since my office is near by. Always full of people. They get real busy during lunch rush at weekdays. My favorite are the  Mongolian Chicken and crab puffs. They are awesome! Pretty much order them ever time I walk in. People just give it a shot, good place to go, try it! The favor won't let you down. By the way, the waitresses there are always friendly! Best ever!
