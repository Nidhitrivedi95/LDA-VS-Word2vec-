o5t33JVLpZWf269AEPB95Q I don't expect much from most of the restaurant in Chinatown area but Greens Vegetarian Restaurant is definitely a nice surprise.

Clean, nicely decorated, spacious and even a clean washroom!!!

I really enjoyed most of the food we ordered and shared but I love carb and veggie than meat.

Hot and Sour Soup ($6.99) - has a lot of ingredients and a nice balance of hot and sour

Spring Roll Platter ($5.99) - love mango and rice paper roll

Eggplant with Tofu in Black Bean Sauce ($7.99) - love eggplant and the nice sauce

Deep Fried Mock Chicken in Lemon Sauce ($7.99) - meh

Sweet and Sour Mock Chicken ($8.99) - love sweet and sour sauce and the batter is light and crispy!

Spicy Ma Po Tofu ($7.99) - really bland tasting and too watery

Singapore Style Vermicelli ($5.99) and Fried Rice Noodle with Mock Beef ($5.99) - surprisingly tasty and with fresh of the wok flavour

Assorted Vegetables Dish ($7.99) - good and healthy choice!

Service here has a nice family vibe, though a little slow.

I will be back to Greens Vegetarian for some well prepared Chinese food. I might just skipped those mock meat and opt for the fresh ingredients!
