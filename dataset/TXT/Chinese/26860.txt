7wFdubzWH4ig08AcoibXeA I am glad this place re-opened, again.  The menu is a mixture of Hong Kong style cafe food, and select-your-own-ingredient soup noodles and hot pot dishes that feature their famous homemade fish stock.  

There is a grand re-opening 50% off special that ran for about a week or so.  We deliberately waited until this period is over to give it a try.  The place is still packed on a Saturday night; a short waiting line formed after around 7:00pm.  Happy to report that the fish soup is still very good; its a thick broth with smooth and well rounded flavour, and none of the unpleasant fishy smell.  

Maybe I will order from the HK cafe menu next time.
