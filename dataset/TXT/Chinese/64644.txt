E9aC5bLfXdQVZ5csvLuLJg Maybe Chef had an off day. Beef Noodle Soup was anything but. Beef was stringy and chewy. Broth so-so!  Noodles and bok choy were good. Having had aromatic beef broth the taste of dish water was the strong point. Less noodles. less vegetable and even less beef is acceptable as long as the broth is good. So a bit disappointed.
