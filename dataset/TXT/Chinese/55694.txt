cXmlv2WBzuB6JLMhaCvLuQ I am in love! I had suspicions this place would be great after the first Cleveland Night Market and I tried the squid (photos on my IG @cleve.lin.d). I highly suggest the mapo tofu if you're not 100% into eating an entire kabob meal. But I would totally be satisfied on the skewers of meat alone..... Don't judge! I've tried this place street food style, take out, and dine-in. All very satisfying  experiences!
