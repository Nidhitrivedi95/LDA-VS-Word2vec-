X5uxdU9GHoUAqo2wmbg3OQ Came here for the first time on Tuesday. 
Ordered the Roti Canai and that was AMAZINGLY delicious! 
For my entree I ordered the Nasi Lemak. The egg with the curry was delicious, chicken was cooked well. 
Didn't like the anchovy but that's my personal preference. 
The service was fast and great but my complaint is to please don't have your staff stand and stare at you. 
I kept seeing the staff standing and just staring at us. 
It was uncomfortable. 
I get wanting to make sure that we have what we need but you can just check on us frequently, no need to stare the entire time.

Other than that it was a great experience and I will be back.
