1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent

Food (2: OK)
The menu is huge and the food is generally okay; we have been here many times and have noticed that they down size the serving portion slightly.

Service (1: Poor)
The servers try to take the order quickly. However, they basically ignore the customers after the food are delivered to the table. It takes forever to get the bill and the change back.

Ambiance (2: OK)
Dimly lit dining room, casual, very busy all day on the weekends, extremely noisy and waiting line could be long on the weekends. There is a waiting area which is separated from the dining room at the entrance. 

Surroundings (2: OK)
Located at a strip plaza on the north side of Highway 7 about 200 meters west of Kennedy Rd. in Markham. The parking lot is busy; it could be difficult to find a parking space during business hours on weekdays because the restaurant is on the same building as a Service Ontario Centre, next to a falafel & shwarma restaurant, and adjacent to a Japanese restaurant and other shops. Fortunately, there is another parking lot at back of the plaza.
