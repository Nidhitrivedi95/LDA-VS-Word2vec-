aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ This place seems to be always packed with people every time I walk by. Being Asian and all and knowing what REAL Asian food tastes like, I've finally pulled myself together to try this "Asian Fusion" cuisine. Service was prompted and welcoming but food-wise...... I can say that I've had better. The food here is basically the same as what you can get at those Chinese fast food places AKA the famous Manchuwok but pricier with fancier plates that tickles yours eyes with good presentation. I believe I can get better food in Chinatown that's half the price of what I get at Springroll. The food was pretty tasteless and didn't really satisfy my taste buds at all. Seeing all the people here I really had expectations for good food but I'm assuming the people eating here have no idea what good asian food really is. I wouldn't say the food was terrible but it wasn't great as I hoped. I got the Char Grilled Korean Galbi and Tiger Shrimps since it was the staff recommendation. The meat turned out to be very chewy and fatty while the tiger shrimps were dry and over-cooked. The only good thing here was the alcoholic beverage "Springroll-lini" consisting of alize and vodka. I know now that I will most definitely not be coming back here to full-fill my Asian cravings.
