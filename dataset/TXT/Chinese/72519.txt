fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Stopped in for a dumpling sampling on a weekend trip in the city.

Group of asian woman were standing in the front window making dumplings for all to see.

Tried the minced beef and pork/chinese cabbage dumplings.  AWESOME.

Walked out there (after 30 dumplings for 2 people), paid about $25 with sodas to drink.  Quite cheap in my opinion.

One of the owners came over and even chatted with us for a while.  Super friendly place.

Definitely returning.;
