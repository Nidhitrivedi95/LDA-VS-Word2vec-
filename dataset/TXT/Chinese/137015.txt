qi6uzJEhA9puZM2io46-_A Came here for a Birthday and we were treated great. Our main waiter was Lawrence and he was amazing.

I had the orange peel shrimp and it was great. I also tasted the walnut, melon and shrimp dish and it was wonderful too.

From drinks and appetizers to our main courses everything was wonderful.
I can highly recommend this PF Chang's.
