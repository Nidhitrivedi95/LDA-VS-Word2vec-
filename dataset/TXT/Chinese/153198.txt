t7wcfSi4yOLXGW6FBq0W8Q Place is nice and clean. Not very busy since most people line up to go to federicks next door. We stumbled in here because federicks was full and there were no tables for 45 minutes. Got a table here right away. Staff were super friendly but only 1 server was available/visible on a Friday night between 8 tables. The food was bmhorrible. No taste, no spice, no flavour! Fried rice tasted very similar to steamed rice. Pakora had no taste - not even salt. Chilli chicken didn't look or taste anything like chilli chicken. We regretted not waiting for our table at federicks every moment we spent in there. Hopefully food quality improves in the future before they lose all customers.
