Each year, a group of about 20 of us meet to eat Chinese style to celebrate the coming of spring. The events are organized by the beautiful Miss T who selects the location and menu.  Her choice this year was Grand Lake.  What a good choice too:  fresh food and good service for less than $25 a person.
