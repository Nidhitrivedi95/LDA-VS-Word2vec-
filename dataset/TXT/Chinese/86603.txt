HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA Even though I had seen this restaurant on food network and the rave reviews on yelp, I honestly wasn't expecting too too much when I came here with my Chinese family looking for a decent Chinese vote. Was very pleasantly surprised: the pork bao and wonton soup were both very traditionally made; were arguably better than something I would find in the 626. We had the shortrib grilled cheese and signature burger, which while both on the heavier and greasier side were extremely satisfying and very fairly priced. Great food would come again
