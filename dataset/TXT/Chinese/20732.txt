64Wt06TZjb9Se8q3kdeOJQ Oh my dear lord. It is rare that I throw away leftovers without any hint of regret or sense of waste, but that's exactly what I did with my leftover General Tso chicken and beef and broccoli from Number One Chinese Restaurant. I hate to be harsh, but the whole heap of it was terrible.

Last night my roommate and I had a hankering for cheap'n'greasy Chinese food--not the authentic stuff, but the highly Canadianized, deep-fried-everything version. What we got instead was a disgrace to any continent's cuisine. It always boggles my mind when a restaurant can't make the very dishes it specializes in. Have they spent years and years perfecting mediocrity?

We ordered two of the most common dishes in the Chinese food canon--beef and broccoli and General Tso chicken. I was so excited to indulge in these high-salt/fat delights. What we got was definitely high in salt, but low in flavour. Does anyone remember the General Tso chicken from Peter Street Deli? It was SO GOOD. My hopes were obviously set too high. This place should definitely consider a name change.

This leaves me to wonder where I should order Chinese food in Leslieville? After ten years of residency, I still don't know!
