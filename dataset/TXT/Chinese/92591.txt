IS_IWMsFRJii__17LsP1Og This place is right across the street from my apartment complex. I am very picky about Thai food. I ordered the stuffed chicken wings and the poh-tak soup for pick up. I felt a little bad because I dn't decide I wanted Thai for dinner until an hour before closing. They were very quick with the food. My expectations were blown. They flavors were very good and as close to authentic as I can get here.
