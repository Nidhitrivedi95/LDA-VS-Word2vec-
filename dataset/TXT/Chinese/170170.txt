VVUL1lzBOipXJlOG1wURMg A while ago, a friend mentioned this place is good to try if i love hakka food. We finally got the chance a few days ago while in the neighbourhood. ( way too far from where i live)

fish pakora is a must and it was heavenly. the bombay chicken was very dry and not spiced enough. the decor was quite cute. maybe i'll find a closer tangerine to try if there's one closer to me.
