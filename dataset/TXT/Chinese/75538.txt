fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA My reaction when trying xiao long bao for the first time: http://bit.ly/TtLSId

I wasn't sure what I was expecting but the texture of the XLB surprised me. The soup inside was slightly thicker than I had anticipated. Wish I had eaten it sooner... by the time I started working on it, it was lukewarm temperature. My bad!

The green onion pancake was A+. It was not overly pan-fried and the inside was moist and chewy. One of my favourites!

Deep fried silver rolls came with condensed milk. The outer layer had a hint of sesame flavour and the inside was a little dryer than I'd like it to be. Can't really say it's my thing.

For dessert, we had mango pudding. This dessert is actually 3/4 milk pudding and 1/4 mango puree topped with a cherry. I found the milk pudding to be overpowering and couldn't really taste the mango. 

We also had pork and shrimp dumplings, pan-fried pork buns, spicy and sour soup with noodles and pan-fried dumplings. No complaints there... just average stuff.
