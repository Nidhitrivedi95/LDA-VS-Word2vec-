AbadN65irz8uSL8z6fkoBg I love BBQ King! I would categorize this establishment as a hidden gem! Their food has tons of flavor and in my opinion one of the few Chinese spots that are not infused with any other culture. This is true recipes as if you were visiting China!

My favorite dishes here are the Crispy Pork Belly and Peking Duck! The pork Belly is so juicy with the skin being Crispy! When you take a bite the flavors are amazing! The Peking Duck is to die for! They make the skin so Crispy that when you add that to the bun and sauce you just can't get enough! 

The prices here I feel are cheaper than other Chinese restaurants which makes it attractive to come here. They have a great Lunch Special so definitely check it out!

The venue is where I would rate this low. It's a small restaurant and it's just very basic in design. Yes the food is awesome but there is so much movement within customer pick ups that it can get loud being that it's small. It's really a place to eat and then go! 

The service is ok. Sometimes they get so busy that they forget to check up on you. So sometimes your drinks or extra napkins may take longer to get!

They do offer pick up and many customers use this option.

Overall great food and cheap prices!
