yKuAM6kL5sSKtfoe9a3GpQ Aside from the ironic name, their lunch specials are pretty tasty and priced reasonably . They offer a selection of typical Chinese/Japanese/Korean dishes such as fried noodles, ramen, and even pork bone soup.

We regularly visit the place for lunch since its near work. The prices are OK even though the portions are slightly below average. It's a nice place to check out but nothing really outstanding. Will definitely come back to try out their hot pot.
