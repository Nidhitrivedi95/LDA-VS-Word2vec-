YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g Came here a Summerlicious lunch with a few friends. Ordered the chicken salad for appetizer, and the baked chicken for the main course. The chicken was okay although it lacked flavor. The baked chicken was soft and tender and flavorful and came on top of some sticky rice. The dessert was a tea spoon of very flavorful ice cream (very good), a small piece of sponge cake and a small fried glutinous rice ball in chocolate sauce. The overall experience was so so. After spending close to $30 on a lunch ... I was still hungry.
