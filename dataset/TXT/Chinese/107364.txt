l9vx-OTdDPU-oHZ17aVxdg My family and I went for lunch. No reservation needed. The parking lot was busy but we were able to find a spot. We waited a minute or so before being seated. Service was pretty sub par - they always seemed like they were in a rush and didn't really have any time to attend to you or answer questions. After we were seated we probably waited a good 10 minutes before anyone took our orders. Food came out sporadically. I personally got my entree after most of my party had already got their food. It wasn't very fun waiting while everyone else had their food and was eating. Besides that food was pretty good - we got the fish pakora and hot and sour soup for apps - delicious - entrees ordered were chili beef, garlic fish, chicken fried rice and general Tao chicken. Food was great we enjoyed our meal and had plenty left over to take home. I would suggest going here just for take out, it really wasn't the best dine in experience but the food was delicious
