szhJLmdLDVFTevm8fu0T4A This is my favorite dim sum place in Arizona. I'm such a huge fan of Great Wall. They never fail to provide deliciously prepared fresh food. If you love shu mai, spareribs, roasted duck, congee (rice porridge), char siu bao and many more traditional dim sum dishes: THIS IS THE PLACE. 
And please don't get me started about the baked goods. The custard buns are my favorite. Dinner is great here too for groups. You can order different dishes and share with your guests. There is plenty of dishes to choose from. If you are able to come during lunch, they do have lunch specials.  

Some people are not huge fans of the service at Great Wall, but I think it might be more of a cultural aspect or language barrier. But between me and you, I consider it part of the experience. :) As silly as it sounds, there is no other place like Great Wall, and it well worth it for the food.
