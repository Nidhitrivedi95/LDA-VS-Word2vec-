FEWTPBUv-QiugBe-2uXD4A Ordered tonight close to closing. The food was excellent fresh hot and delicious. I ordered on the eat 24 app about 20 minutes before closing. The delivery guy was very rude and told me "you know the place closes at 10" I apologized and said I didn't realize the hours of business. He grabbed the money out of my hand said whatever and drove off. This was after I gave him a $8 tip on a $30 order not to bad I don't think. I will order from here again for sure but next time I will be picking up!
