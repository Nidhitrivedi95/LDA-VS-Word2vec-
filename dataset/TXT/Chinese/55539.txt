cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw I went back to this little out of the way place for the lunch special today. I'm hooked!

The food is freshly made to order (even the hot and sour soup) and really quite delish! I also got a sushi roll to try it - very good! 

I got the lunch special, and it was a ton of food for $5.95. Their hot and sour soup is some of the best I've had!! I hope people will check this place out. Don't judge a book by its cover.
