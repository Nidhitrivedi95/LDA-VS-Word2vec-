0C1ME-oi2GtsHr8xsV9fsA My wife and I eat out 3-4 times a week.  We have a hard time finding restaurants that consistently serve great food and have even better service.  Cyclo has both, and Justina makes dining an absolute pleasure.  We have been dining at Cyclo for 3 years and it is definitely one of my top five restaurants in the Phoenix metro area. Cyclo does not serve alcohol but has a BYOB policy that makes going out to dinner a whole lot less expensive.  I highly suggest eating here as it is one of the better restaurants that I have experienced.
