rsQAS-k7GldsJm7UAtVyYA My favourite pho place. 
I usually get either:
- Vermicelli with grilled beef, grilled pork and grilled chicken 
Or 
- The regular beef pho.

Once in a while I'll be a bit more adventurous and try something else from the menu.  Haven't been disappointed yet.

Have been going here for years.
