QvEoE_oGwHPXvw5IylllNg The health department should stop by.....soon.  We have gotten take out several times recently. They are always screaming at each other in Chinese. It is a very uncomfortable atmosphere. But last night was and will be our last time. The owner...who is such a rude, obnoxious woman anyway....was breast feeding her baby....at the front counter.  Our food was not ready, so I sat in a booth to wait. It was disgusting to watch food being prepared as she breast fed the kid.
