INnZ6bYoIN2M7bcP7Cb3bw I was driving home from an event that led me in the direction of this place.  I pulled into the plaza to see if anything would grab my attention and decided to try this place.  Since there were only two of us, we kept it simple.  Egg rolls, beef fried rice and sweet and sour chicken.  By the time we got home and got everything unpacked, i couldn't wait to dig in.  I must say it was a little bit different but very good.  The sweet and sour seemed to have a slight pineapple taste which was good, maybe a regional recipe difference.  The rice was good, the chicken wasn't a big dough ball like usual, so that was great.  The egg rolls were very good.  When all is said and done i would go here again, but i must admit, I'm not in the area very often.  But I would not mind another meal here, thats for sure.  The people were pleasant, the service was fast.  This was an enjoyable experience.
