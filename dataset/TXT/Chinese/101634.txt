kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A My dining partner and I were craving noodles to warm ourselves up this past weekend, but we wanted fresh ingredients and we wanted something cheap. Noodle Man hit all of our markers!

It was packed with diners on a Sunday night, but we were seated and served at rapid pace. My partner had the beef and tomato noodle and I chose the hot and spicy noodle. Tip for anyone who loves spicy food: Szechuan peppercorn is a very different kind of spice- incredibly fragrant, warming, and at times NUMBING. There were times that I lost the focus of my palate due to the numbing effect of the peppercorn on my lips and tongue.

The hot and spicy, while challenging to the senses, was a bright and exciting broth with a touch of ginger and citrus. It was loaded with salty and unctuous morsels of ground pork, braised Bok Choy, and peanut.

The tomato and beef was mild, but had a wonderful umami quality, and was loaded with beef. It was very delicious and comforting, and would be suited to any non-adventurous palates in your party.

We also ordered the chicken and mushroom dumplings, which were served fresh out of the fryer and were incredibly juicy! My only disappointment was that we ordered them as an appetizer but they did not come to the table until the end of the meal.

I would advise trying to find a seat away from the door, as you will be prey to the wind every time it opens. But the blustery atmosphere at our table only served to emphasize the comforting nature of these delicious noodles.
