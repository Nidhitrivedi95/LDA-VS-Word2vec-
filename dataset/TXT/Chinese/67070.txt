elpS_xeOX_S5obTwx55kjg Great customer service, the owner tried really hard to have a connection with all of her customers. I enjoyed the fact that we get free hot tea and fried wontons with sour sauce, that is definitely a good touch.  The food is good at a very reasonable price. However, there is nothing special to it, you pretty much get what you pay for. 
So if you are looking to fill your tummy at a cheap price, this will be a good place to come!!
