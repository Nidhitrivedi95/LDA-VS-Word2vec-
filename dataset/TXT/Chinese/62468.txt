dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw Horrible restaurant. We were seated by very unfriendly waitresses, ordered, the food didn't taste well. Fried rice was horrible, I got the hot and sour noodle, it was pretty ok but a bowl of noodle 2:1 soups. So I asked for more soup, and yes, they are giving you chicken soups and it cost $3 :) sweet huh? A rice bowl size of soup cost $3. Well, I saw a group sat, ordered and left after the first dish arrived, so I DONT THINK I WILL EVER COME AGAIN.
