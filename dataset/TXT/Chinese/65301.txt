EAs61Wm1O6tLjCs8t2eP-Q Not good unless you're starving and there's no Chinese food within 10 miles!!!

Brand new place, 1st visit, ordered 3 dinner items to go.

The bad:   2x cooked pork was ok, sweet and sour chicken breading tasted like plastic, plum sauce was like store-bought-bottled and bad tasting, beef and broccoli had so much oyster sauce in the mix it was too salty to eat.

The good:  Large portion size, prices a bit high but ok for location.

There's a place right across the street with much better food albeit way smaller portions.

I might give this place a 2nd chance and try other options... maybe!

The ugly: go starving and love "buffet style flavored" chinese food or eat elsewhere!
