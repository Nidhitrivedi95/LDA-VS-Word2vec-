5aGYZbjkXpCecz4QH2ZKFg After spending the day at Carowinds, Our Family decided to eat here after searching YELP for a buffet style restraunt to eat at.  Prior reviews seemed favorable so Dragon Buffet  was the choice. 
Easy access off 485 & Tryon.
We arrived around 3:30, no waiting and only a couple other families were eating.  My wife and I, along with our 5 boys ( 17, 16, 14, 10 , 7 ) were seated, ordered our drinks, and then went to the bufett.

They have a great selection, including Sushi. 
The food was great, some buffets the food is dried out from sitting so long.
the staff was very attentitive to the buffet, keeping it clean and stocked.
Desert Bar and 4 selections of Ice Cream!

the restraunt itself was clean and attractive

The best part was of course feeding a family of 7 for $54

I do not know if prices change in the evening, but I can say Dragon Buffet will be a regular stop for us when we are in the area!
