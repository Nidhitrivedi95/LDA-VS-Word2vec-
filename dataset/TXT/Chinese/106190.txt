kZWjEMEM4vCBL9GaQy-spw I searched a long time for somewhere to learn and practice Tai Chi and found 9 Dragons King Fu. They teach traditional Shao Lin, Wu Dang and Hong Jia Kung Fu. I was excited that they also offer Tai Chi classes. Tai Chi is low-impact but builds strength and balance and it looks cool too.  I wanted something that challenged me while getting a good workout. 

Mrs. Kaneen is a great instructor. She has such a positive attitude and makes sure to vary the training from time to time so it doesn't get boring.  She teaches Yang style, Chen style Tai Chi forms, sometimes self defense, mixes in some health and wellness tips, and even some weapons training. The way she teaches you makes everything seem so easy, from your hand movement, foot work to breathing techniques. The small class size is perfect. Everyone gets her personal attention.  I've been a student there for 4 years. I would highly recommend it.
