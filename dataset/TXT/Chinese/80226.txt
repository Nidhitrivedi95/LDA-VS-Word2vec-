gopA-Q9KWwC8BLIRDhusgg The worst hakka food I ever had. No taste whatsoever. Freaky staff; you tell them you are allergic to something and they totally disregard it. They charge you even for something you totally disliked, have no consideration for their clients and speak Mandarin in front of you like you are some sort of an idiot! I hated the food and the service. It's connected to Howard Johnson and it's hard not to mention how dirty this place too. Dirty and outdated. I would give it a -15 if there was a rating like that.
