If you like spicy and sour food, this is the place to come to.

The cold noodle dish is prepared with hot chili oil and vinegar. There appears to be random bits of spongy soy product around. Not an issue, especially since they soak up a lot of flavor.

The "Chinese burger" is basically slightly salted pulled/shredded beef placed between two pan seared round flat bread. Highly recommended. Add a little bit of the leftover sauce from the cold noodle dish for a little kick.

BBQ: tried the lamb and beef tongue
lamb is highly seasoned, very spicy. There's a hint of game typical of lamb that you can notice, but only if you taste for it.
beef tongue is not as spicy, but definitely a bit chewy. 

Another dish, noodle based, is seasoned like their cold noodle dish, except everything is hot (temp wise), and the noodles are long and thick, with some green onion and bean sprouts. Again, spicy and sour, just the way I like it. Noodles are nice and appropriately chewy. Just the right amount of "QQ."

The Service:
it's a chinese restaurant. what more could you possibly expect?

The Ambiance:
See above.

Conclusion:
Sour and spicy food. BBQ is tasty (but spicy!) and not terribly overpriced for what you get. Will return in the future.
