7vFTldKs-b-wS5J56PGGew I've eaten here many times in the past 10 years and they remain consistent and give good value.  The other evening we tried a "new" dish from them, something we have eaten in many other places - spicy eggplant with pork in black-bean sauce.  Lots of small narrow eggplant in a delicious sauce but the pork was difficult to find:(  We also ordered our favorite dish (from them)   Salt and pepper Squid!!!  No one makes it as good, no one.  Tons of deep fried breaded calamari with hot peppers and spices on a bed of shredded cabbage.  Tasty tasty tasty, tender tender tender, spicy spicy spicy!  Give them a try, you won't be sorry.  The place is clean, staff polite and efficient and have been there since I started eating there in 2006!
