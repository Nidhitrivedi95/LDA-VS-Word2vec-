GU7ww3eoGTcXAze8VJtC7g Ate here before a show at the Mirage....the atmosphere is very modern, but a little too close to the casino and you can hear it in the background. Had a very nice table in the corner with cushions. Peking duck was prepared perfectly and was carved right at our table, but nothing else was remarkable.
