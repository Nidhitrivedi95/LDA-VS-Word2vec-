ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg I've dined at Jasmine many times, and I always have a great relaxing dinner there. For the decor, location & setting, they are 5 stars.  For their food quality, it is nothing spectacular, nor extraordinary, but just great.  Their peking duck is impressive, but not the best I've ever had.  If you want to have a good Chinese food in a fancy romantic setting(when making your reservation, request to be seated near the fountain), Jasmine is a must-try.  You will have a great time there.
