HVpwpXneaCWMeEBF7H8jpQ Love both Chicken bento box and pork chop bento. The fried chicken is a little dry. The pork chop is more juicy. By the way, the pork chop is fried pork chop instead of small pieces of pork ribs. A little different to my thought. 

The bubble tea is just normal level from my understanding, or maybe I have too high expectation. And you need to pay extra money for the hot and no ice choice!!!!
