dkCi6pb2tP-BPTGTgv23zw Tucked inside the Touch Salon, we got a pedicure while waiting for our Bao, super nice people in a little Bao Cubby Hole.  Three bao, mix and match and a drink $10.  Duck was to die for good, Chicken and Beef went down well also with my commrade Bao virgins.  A portion of sesame noodles rounded us off.  Delish....I wish we had a Bao window/truck in Nashville.
