rkVTKhUDO-VtrIu8esB75g Second day in Vegas and by now craving Asian food. We were going to see Celine Dion at Caesars Palace so decided to head to the food court there for something quick. Cashier was nice and friendly, but sorry to say the food was not up to par, not even close to Panda Express. Hubby had high hopes for the ramen since it's in their name. I ordered something basic that should be hard to mess up; it left me wishing I paid the $2 extra for the fried rice so the fact that they used a cheaper rice grain would have been masked.
