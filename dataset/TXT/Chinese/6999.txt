They have a very large selection that includes Chinese, American, and a very limited amount of Sushi.

They have a number of healthy options such as broccoli chicken and a small salad bar, so even if you are on a diet, you could get a healthy lunch for $6.95.

I had not tried this place based upon the bad reviews on Yelp.  IMHO: Those bad reviews are baseless.
