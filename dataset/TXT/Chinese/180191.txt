X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg When in Vegas, at least one of the nights ends at a club. I have higher expectations in Vegas and this one was just okay... perhaps my experience would be more awesome if another headliner was at the table. It was Thursday and DVBBS came on close to 1am. Not much remixes played and didn't love the drops. But to be fair, im more into the hip hop flavor at a club. Speaking of hiphop, there is a hiphop room. It was small. It basically looked like it only had enough space for table service. And after coming from the main room, the sound system was significantly weaker. 

The dreadful flights of stairs leading up to the club is not ideal for wobbly girls in 5 inch heels, so don't get sloppy. I didn't have any problems with security, maybe because I wasn't sloppy? 

The club was crowded and there were some people smoking on the dance floor. People dancing and spilling drinks everywhere. The thing that probably bothered me the most was that there were a lot of people standing around on the dance floor taking videos of the strobing and confetti. They did not dance at all. Just took up space. 

Shots were around $17, pretty standard vegas club price. Didn't take that long to get a drink. I thought it was going to take way longer. 

Overall, it was ok and I had fun. It wouldn't be my first choice though.
