We had a party of 7 and there were three large tables of 8 that were unseated the entire time we were in line. We asked about it after 10 minutes but the hosted told us we had to wait like everyone else. So all those who were a party of 1-4, ahead of us, were waiting for smaller tables that were all filled. So we waited patiently in the smoke filled casino. As we approached the front, there were two couples ahead of us and the host asked how many in your party? The both answered two and when she asked us we said, "Seven." And she immediately waived us ahead of the two couples...After waiting 40 minutes they line jumped us? What? SMH!!! This is absurd! Such disorganization. Not returning here anytime soon.
