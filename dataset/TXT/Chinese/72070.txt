FEWTPBUv-QiugBe-2uXD4A Oh man. I hate giving bad reviews, but the food was SO BAD. 
Knowing that we'd be ordering from here, I called a few days in advance to make sure that they'd be able to accommodate my dietary restrictions. They were VERY nice and very helpful. And when I ate their food I didn't have to spend the rest of the day in the bathroom, so they also listened and didn't put any of my allergens in the food. 

That said, the food was really pretty nasty. A lot of the people in our group took a few bites, and then went and got food from starbucks for lunch instead. It also had so much MSG in it that we all felt really bad afterwards. I'm pretty sensitive and it makes me super tired, which isn't fun when you're presenting all afternoon!
