GhWMl0J2gOOH61BhBMTAAA We have been going here for a long time but today, we are cutting our Genghis Grill card.

We were there about 10 minutes ago and had to leave. We were a party of 6 and was promptly seated. However, we waited a good 15 minutes but no one came to our table to get our drinks. We were totally ignored.

I like going to places because of the food AND customer service. Sadly they have gone downhill. No one seems to be happy to be there and no one even wants any eye contact. Totally different vibe than before.

Now we are seated at a different restaurant enjoying good food and service.
