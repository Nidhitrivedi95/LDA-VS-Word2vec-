bzz1t-CEN_G2MDdeirmySQ This place is great! Reasonably priced and I am from NY and like their food! I do not know if the name is just NY or they are from NY but they make good food! We have been looking for a good take out Chinese place since July 2012, tried about three others including China Tango and Panda Express ( very chain like) this place is bar far the best in town!

We had the general TSO Chicken, very good and tasty sauce, a bit spicy for me but it was good! General TSO is usually spicy so I cant complain.

Good also was the spring rolls, the lo mein and the chicken and broccoli, I look fwd to trying some of their other dishes and lunch specials in the future.
