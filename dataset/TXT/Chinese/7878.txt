18xmM5Z3fwcI6UD0M4M8mg I hadn't been here in probably 10 years, but as soon as I stepped in, I remembered this as my FAVOURITE BUFFET when I was a kid. We would go here all the time because my brother and I were bottomless pits back then, and my grandparents were incredibly indulgent.

It's pretty much the same as it always was in terms of atmosphere. It's pretty standard in terms of being a Chinese restaurant, but there are some neat points to it. There's a children's area where they have big leather sofas and a kid's movie playing on a big TV. There was a room behind the buffet area where a Korean couple were having their wedding reception. It's a huge spot and it was host to three different big parties while we were there.

Food-wise, it's pretty decent for a buffet. For one thing, it was lunch time and they had actual salmon sushi instead of just "crab" and california rolls. It was made right in front of you, and they were pretty quick about it, so it was surprisingly fresh. They also had dim sum, which was nice. The winner, though, was the breakfast/brunch buffet section. It was a section with scrambled eggs, bacon, breakfast sausage... basically Canadian breakfast staples. I didn't have any, but I think I found a new place to take my husband, who is pretty set in his ways when it comes to the first meal of the day.

I'm definitely coming back, with my bottomless pit friends.

Oh and parking tip: park in the back of the building, it's the closest to the actual restaurant, which is in the basement of the plaza.
