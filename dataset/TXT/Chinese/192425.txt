Z4CA7jEArUT_D-1ZM4Bh1Q It's simple - the food I ordered for a late night take-out dinner was phenomenal!  I had the Vegetable Lo-Mein and it was perfect - not oily at all, tons of fresh veggies - even the mushrooms! (anything worse than canned mushrooms???) I also had the orange chicken, made spicy at my request and it was delicious!  Not too much breading, lightly fried - very well prepared!  The servers were awesome, service was fast, price was very reasonable - really good experience - I'll definitely go back!
