POiWEckMIOqX7TgBxXgCzw My family has eaten here in the past and they enjoyed it, so when we ordered food for our out of town guest we were expecting to wow them. The food was mediocre, the combination fried rice was basically chicken fried rice with a couple of pieces of shrimp and beef.  Maybe the food was different because this time we ordered it as take out as opposed to eating in the restaurant?
