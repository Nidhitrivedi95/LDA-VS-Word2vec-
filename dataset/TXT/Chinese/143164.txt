rNqSjfRM09T-VOjRTAF66g Dim sum in Arizona wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. It's not the best, but I mean it does the trick. There was nothing special or all that memorable about any of the dishes that we tried. I always like the pork buns which was good here too. It was fluffy and the pork was sweet. The tofu with simple syrup was good, but I felt like it was too gingery for my taste. My sister said she loved it because of the ginger taste, but I wasn't a fan. They also had seaweed salad which was a first for me. I've never seen seaweed salad at a dim sum place, so I was happy. However, they gave us a lot and we couldn't finish it. All in all a good dim sum spot if you are craving it!
