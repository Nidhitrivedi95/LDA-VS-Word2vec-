Ordered pickup through grubhub, got pot stickers, Cantonese Seafood Pan-Fried noodles, Chicken and chinese sausage in a clay pot, Baby Bok Choy, and Roasted Duck on rice.  Total was over $50.  Grubhub text messaged me on the way to the place multiple times telling me that the order was ready, but I ended up waiting about 15-20 min for my order when I got there.  There was a guy hunched over the phone scribbling orders including credit card numbers old-school style, making me wonder about ordering directly from them.

Most chinese takeout I've ever had has been packaged where the dish + sauce is in one container, and the rice is separate.  Both the clay pot dish and roasted duck were about three quarters rice.  They still threw in a container of rice for reasons we're still trying to piece together.  Extra for caulking our roof?  

I guess the most disappointing dish was the roasted duck, as they used the back of the bird;  it was all bones and cartilige.  The one decent dish was the baby bok choy, the rest we pretty much threw away all the extra rice and ended up hungry.  We called the next day and talked to "Lee" who said the owner wouldn't be in for a couple of days, and that they didn't care what we thought of the food.  Needless to say, we will not be going back, and we will not be recommending this to anyone we know.  Total ripoff, you'd be better off buying a bag of rice and top ramen.  I'd say I got about $10 worth of food, and that's being generous.
