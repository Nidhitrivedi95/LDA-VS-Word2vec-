XqPMOwrJ0xjphyNQYcoPLg Looking for enough leftover Chinese food to last you all next week? Go here. The portions are MASSIVE. This cannot be overemphasized. A 'small' soup practically comes in a bucket with a ladle. My dad, sister and I (ignorant saps that we were) each ordered a starter and a main course -- and the waitress didn't warn us we were doing it all wrong. We certainly felt like clowns when the food came out. It's Hong Kong style, people, so we should've ordered one starter and one main to share. And we still might've had leftovers. The soups were tastier than the mains, which all seemed to be coated in the same 'brown sauce'. They must have giant vats of brown sauce in the back. In my opinion, nearby Chinese vegetarian restaurant Greens makes better food, in smaller portions.
