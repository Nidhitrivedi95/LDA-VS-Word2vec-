yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I don't know if pho shop owners gather weekly to come up with clever or hilarious names, but I like it. (maybe they do a weekly "Pho"ne Con"pho"rence.) The only thing more memorable than the restaurant name is the pho at this place. Pho Kim Long is delicious pho goodness in Las Vegas and it's open 24 hours. I never even considered eating pho in Vegas because I'm always trying to go to the buffets, but now I think I have to go here every time I visit thank to my drunk Japanese boss who suddenly craved pho. Because it's Vegas, it's one of the nicest looking pho restaurants I've ever been to. I just wish it was closer to the strip.
