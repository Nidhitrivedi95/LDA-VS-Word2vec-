Kxop0nGA-BUrwYD4EGhyPA Ordered fried noodles but not what i expected, decent though. Soup filled pork buns are like xiao long bao but thicker wrap or almost dough-like. Pork/shrimp dumplings are good too. The jasmine-like tea served is ok, but the highlight is the hot soy milk for free which goes well with the cold weather. The tables are covered with white plastic so its kind of awkward to the eye, maybe better if its the transparent table cover instead of plastic. its a plus if you are with a cantonese, mandarin, chinese speaking friend.
