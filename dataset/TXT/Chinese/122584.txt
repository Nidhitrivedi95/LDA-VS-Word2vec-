OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw I'll caution this review by saying I am not a big dim sum guy.  The food is just too greasy and not satisfying for my Viet palette.  Well, I got invited for lunch and it seems the same as any other Chinese restaurant.  The place was crowded so I am assuming this means it is good.  The restaurant is out of the way if you are used to Spring Mt Rd.  Overall, it was an okay experience.  Nothing to write home about.
