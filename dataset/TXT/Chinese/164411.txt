UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ I come here for lunch sometimes as my wife doesn't care for there egg rolls. That's a deal breaker for her. But I love this place. The lunch specials are perfect portions and affordable. I've tried several different dishes and you can't go wrong with any of them. However the general Yangs Shrimp is amazing. So delicious. Egg drop soup is bomb as well. My only gripe is the drink selection. I like regular ice tea and they have some sort of green tea. That's the reason for 4 stars. Others wise it would of been a 5. Go here. You won't be disappointed.
