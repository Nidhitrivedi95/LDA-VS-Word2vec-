tbMAjldMYhvDUS2gG5Fdxw I usually order from this place but today was the last time. I ordered a shrimp and tofu soup and it did not have any shrimp.. just tofu..with eggdrop soup. I called back asking why my soup didnt have shrimp? I told her you gave me egg drop soup with tofu. Then she says let me ask the chef. She comes back and basically says this nonsense about why they are so stingy with the recipe and did not do anything to fix the order. All they did was tell me thats how the chef makes it deal with it. This is the description for the shrimp and tofu soup on their online menu. "succulent shrimp, scallions, tofu and snow peas in seafood soup." This place can suck my succulent balls.
