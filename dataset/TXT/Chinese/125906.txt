oYpuRk0nDIc3qa-II9Sa9Q This place used to be good but the quality has dropped a lot!

I would give the food 4 or 5 stars. I've never been disappointed with the food. I particularly like the spicy garlic fish (very saucy, maybe even too saucy) and sesame beef.

The atmosphere and decor and stuff is the same as it's always been. Average - nothing special. It's not as busy here as it used to be so that might speak to the quality and service.

There used to be this one waiter that my parents and i liked, he was very attentive and efficient. Now however the service is hit and miss. It doesn't seem like they're assigned specific tables and just kind of wander which would be fine usually, but lately i find that they're socializing with each other a lot and not paying attention to customers like they should. 

I do not think i'm being picky since it has been like this the last few times i've been here. Like i said, used to be really good here everything considered, but not anymore.
