5OqrwhtZ3mcmUSwLINZTWQ Blossom is all about the little things.  How the server (Danny in our case) remembers you from a year ago... and where you sat.   How the hostess notices that you've got dark wash jeans and asks if you want a black napkin, instead.  How they serve hot towels (not cheap napkins) to wash your hands.  How they don't have to ask if you need anything (e.g., more water) since they're able to anticipate things in advance.

Great food. Great service. Always a great memory.
