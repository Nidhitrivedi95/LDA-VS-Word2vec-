6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ I love going here since it's always open late and in the area. The staff are always friendly and efficient at what they do. I usually only ever go for the Umami Don or Terriyaki Tofu Don and they are AMAZING!!! There's also a bunch of side dish options for those who don't want to eat to heavy which includes: terriyaki squid, numerous flavours of onigiri, skewers, and even agedashi tofu! 

You can also use your Vicinity points card here as well, which is another plus. 1 point per don, with every 10 points earning you a free one!
