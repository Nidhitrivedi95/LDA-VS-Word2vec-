QmNrHxN7UahtdliH_kAuUg I had a very "ok" experience. 

I went to Ka Mei with a Chinese friend and I was not spoken to once. Little did the server know, I speak Chinese. I did not engage in conversation, I just felt as if it was pretty rude not to even address me. 

The food felt like it took forever to come. I was constantly looking at my phone to see what time it was. 

The food was very good once it did arrive. Although, we were weirdly never served ice water. 

There were mostly Chinese people eating, however there was 1 table of Americans. 

I will give Ka Mei a second chance one day, but for now, 3 stars.
