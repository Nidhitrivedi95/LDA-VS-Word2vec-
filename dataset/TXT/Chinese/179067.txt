X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Probably one of the worst clubs Vegas has to offer.  I came here on a Thursday because Marquee wasn't open and I wasn't really feeling the other option either.  TERRIBLE MISTAKE!  Anything would've been better than Hakkasan.  I don't understand why this place is so crowded.  It took me about an hour to get inside and that was with me cutting the goddamn line.  The layout of the club is terrible.  Awkward walking spaces and it was just too crowded.  Like... where am I supposed to go?  Also, there are a million stairs so wear your most comfortable heels ladies cause you're going to be climbing up and down those steps all night long (if you decide to go here).
