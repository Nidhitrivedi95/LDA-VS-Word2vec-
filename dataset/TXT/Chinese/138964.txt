qsdHK1eQtXmAJNdVJxiC3w I love this place.  We try to have it every Friday to celebrate the weekend.  Delivery of course.   Sometimes it does take a while but is well worth it.  The food is hot and delicious.  My husband gets the combo Mongolian beef and really enjoys it.  I get the Large  Shrimp and Lobster sauce and it's incredible.  So Yummy.  I vote try it.  Very nice people.
