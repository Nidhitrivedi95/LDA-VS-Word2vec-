So, why two stars?  Because this Spring Rolls location at Queen West must be the worst managed location ever.   I ordered for a big group of people and called it in on the phone so I knew I would get this location close to us.   A Chinese woman with a manager tag goes to get my order, then berates me for not using their internet ordering system.  I just ordered 18 meals!  It was so disrespectful, the waitress apologized for her manager's attitude.

This is how you take an awesome restaurant at an amazing location and still have seats half full.
