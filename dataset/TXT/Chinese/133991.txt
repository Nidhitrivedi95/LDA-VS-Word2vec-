Q-eUzUjOwRlAXkwN8qDXXg Newly opened dim sum and dinner joint just north of Pacific Mall.  

Modern Asian decor, clean and bright the restaurant was about half full at 1pm on the Saturday we went.  We ordered about 6 dim sum dishes, I found the food to be clean, not too salty, not too much MSG and not overly oily. If you like light yet flavourful then this may be the place for you! 

Early bird before 11am $3 special price for small, medium and large plates.
