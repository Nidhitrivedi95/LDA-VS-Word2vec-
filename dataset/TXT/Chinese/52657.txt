cJzv3fbd7jL2ZHyFosFkOw I got delivery from here three times. All times the food was delivered in a timely manner! and everything I requested was brought. you can request chopsticks and I suggest asking for extra sweet and sour sauce. I'm not sure if they have their own mustard i just received the package one. I never dined in yet.
         Their beef chow mein is really good. and the hot and sour soup is good. the kung pow chicken is a little bit too much peanut for me. the eggrolls are good not a soggy one yet! my boyfriend orderd the orange spicy chicken and that was the first to go from our plates!!
