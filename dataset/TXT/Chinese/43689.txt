BH0K6SxPnY3wTRB7tA27hQ Let me just start off with the pros. The inside of the restaurant is very nice - a different atmosphere for most chinese restaurants. Our server was very attentive and for the amount of food that you during lunch was a good price for a meal with rice.

Cons:
1. We ordered half price sushi - after we ordered we were told that we had to buy a drink as well. I had already bought a drink, but my husband hadn't and was required to. The sushi itself tasted pretty good. My husband and I got 2 separate rolls (I can't remember the names). His roll was a full sushi rool (8 pieces). I had ordered a roll with tempura covering it and I got 4 pieces...and we couldn't see/taste any yellowfin tuna in the roll. We questioned the waiter about the tuna and the owner came over. She pointed out that there WAS tune in the roll above the avocado and cream cheese...we just couldn't see it. Wellllll the reason we couldn't really see it was because it was BARELY there! I'm talking about the amount of tuna in the roll was not comparable to the sushi I've had at any other asian restaurant. Half price sushi really isn't a good deal if you get half of a sushi roll with no rish in it...
2. I got the teryiaki chicken and my husband got the general tso's. Neither were impressive. Not horrible, but not great. 

We will keep on looking...
