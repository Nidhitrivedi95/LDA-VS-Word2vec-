I order delivery for when i have people over, everyone loves the food.  They are very consistant with the flavor.  I always order Cantonese Chow Mein, House Super Bowl Congee, Fried Rice Noodle with Beef, Beef Brisket Rice, Spice & Pepper salt squid, salmon fried rice,  fried chili turnup, and surprise dish is... Deep fried chicken wings. These dishes are always consistant. 

Only downside is the parking lot, get there early.
