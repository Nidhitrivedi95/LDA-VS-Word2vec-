SMXmELJ8jFBPDq3VWRlLeQ We had seen this places flyers in our mail and finally gave it a try, pleasantly surprised.  The jalapeño chicken was really excellent.  It was nice and spicy, chicken was deep fried and perfect.  My wife got the sesame chicken and said it was really great.   Hopefully people will support this place as we want to be able to eat here for a long time.
