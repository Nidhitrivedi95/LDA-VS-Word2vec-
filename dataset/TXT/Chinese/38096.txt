aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw Very dishonest. You can only get your 15% discount when you give them a 5 star review on Yelp. That's how they got all the 5 stars. Food was blunt and horrible. They have a banner outside the restaurant showing cash coupons will be given but we spent about $40 and get nothing. We do not support dishonest people. Then we have to give a 5 star review to get 15% off the bill. If the food was really good, you don't need to force people to do that. We do not need that 15% off and this is an HONEST review. Any restaurant on Spring Mountain can easily beat this. Try the food out if you don't believe!
