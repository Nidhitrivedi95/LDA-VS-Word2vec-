I haven't had Chinese food that tastes as good as this did for many, many years!  Absolutely outstanding!

The restaurant opened about a week ago, and I just had my first chance to visit for lunch.  The menu is extensive and very affordable.  Lunch prices start at 6.55 and top- out at $6.95.  Dinner ranges from $6.55 - $12.25.  Also a dedicated "health food" section on the menu for folks who are trying to keep their diets on the straight-and-narrow.  

Great lunch and dinner selections.  

The restaurant is clean and bright, new furnishings, lots of tables, and is staffed by very friendly people.  

I had the garlic chicken lunch special with rice and an add-on egg roll.  All of it was truly fantastic.  Service was very fast.

I am VERY glad they have opened their restaurant in Stoughton and I look forward to my next visit!

If you are in the area and looking for some seriously good Chinese food, give China King a try!  Your belly will thank you...
