tnvZOd2vNCLPQS1KEZxqog I always drive pass this place when it was being built and it finally opened.. thought I go and try it and because I was craving dim sum .. at 8pm..  

Food-
Generous size portions!! 

I think they had the best Har Gow (shrimp dumpling) I've ever had.. a lot shrimp! And the wrapper didn't stick to the metal steam container! I rarely see that! That's how you know it's good! 

I also tried the shu Mai .. it was good! Tasted like any other shu Mai so if you're craving it at night it's perfect! Meaty! 

I also had the pan beef fried bun? I believe ? that was pretty good! Pan Fried crispy  goodness with beef inside! would get it again.

Last but not least I tried the soup dumplings.. it's was good .. but not much soup in it.. and they didn't have those big spoons to hold it either.. which was slightly disappointing 

Service-
It was pretty much me and my little brother in the whole place and I think are waitress was also the owner? She was very attentive and helpful and really nice! She always had are water filled! 

But yeah would totally come back for when I get those dim sum cravings because most dim sum places here in AZ ends around 2pm. 

Just FYI it's a made to order dim sum so you have to wait a bit for your order.
