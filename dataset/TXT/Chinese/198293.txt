zXJilaBN28oUdX7Owf0fRA I just ordered from them. Time wise, super fast and had no problem finding my place so I am very happy with that. 
Chirashi sushi- hmm...ok...not bad. Fish wasn't too fresh but I wasn't expecting it to be... I mean I'm in Pgh and it wasn't top Jap restaurant... I just hope that they vary up the fish they put on the top. There was an unknown noodle like looking bed under fish (that some restaurants place under their sashimi) was just very unattractive. I've never figured out what that was... (I don't want to find out what it is, don't want to see it, and just don't want to deal w/ it) 
Miso soup- ok. 
Salad sauce (salad and miso soup comes with chirashisushi)- I almost always like salad sauce that Japanese restaurants have and this one was no exception. 
Vegetable udon- noodle and soup came separately (dahhhh...). It was truly vegetable udon. Not just veggie unon but VEGETABLE udon. It seemed like there was as much as veggies as noodle and I LOVED Loved Loved it. Onion was cooked and the crispiness was well reserved, not soaked in moisture. Soup/Broth-hmm hot and tasty... but the aftertaste or the texture remained in my mouth... felt like oil filmed stuck in the back of my throat as if tar stuck in the lung...
