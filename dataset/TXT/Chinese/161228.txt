UDE4VL0k8Zrko7RkJ4agGQ 4 stars?! For this place? Yes. I love chinese food and there are only a few places we get our chinese food. Grand China? Gross, it gave my sister food poisoning and the food was not that great at all. The other little dumpling on decatur is just too oily for me.

This chinese place, gives the right amount of food and the right amount of deliciousness each time we come here. We always get the lunch specials. Comes with soup and your entry. The noodle dishes don't come with fried rice though, but nonetheless you still get a lot of food for $5.95! Whatever dish we order or try, it always comes out delicious. I'm a sucker for their pad thai. Their chow mein is always so good too. Honey walnut shrimp is a must once and awhile because it is just, yummy!! Also their sweet and sour pork is what got me hooked to this place.

This place is also always so clean, people complain about the smell when they walk in. I've gotten used to it. But it is clean and you can sit anywhere. At least when they get health inspections, they always pass. Grand china always fails their health inspections. I wonder why? 

I also come here to get their taro boba. I love boba and theirs is just sweet and the boba is nice and chewy. Sometimes it can be a little 'too' sweet, so you might ask for less sweetness if you'd like. 

I only give 5 stars to places, I really like and enjoy. This place, I really like and enjoy. The decor can be updated, but its okay. I go there for the food and friendly servers. The server there, her name is Liz. She is always so sweet and gets your order out as soon as its done! She is very friendly and she knows my family very well when it comes to what we order. This will always be our go to place for chinese food. My family will never order from anywhere else!
