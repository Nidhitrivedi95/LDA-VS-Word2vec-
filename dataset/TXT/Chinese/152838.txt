T5iVkzBXvG5cG6de_TMquw I'm so sad. I've always loved this place. I went for dine in with my family and there was hair in my food. A black curly piece of short hair and my hair is super long so I know it was not mine. The bathrooms were super dirty, like a truck stops. I sadly will no longer be eating here
