qO6CWdRFfbOqDJ2UOulpaA We've ordered about 4 times. And it's not bad chineese. However, I am very allergic mushrooms and I don't do breaded chicked. Tonight we ordered take out. We have family in town. When we ordered we said "no mushrooms on this dish, she's allergic". Once we got the food home we noticed there was in fact these pesky littlw buggers that make me sick. Very sick. Imagine having family in town thaf you haven't seen for a long time, sitting down to eat after a long day only to realize you can't eat anything on the table and have to go back (we live avout 10 mins away). I'm so bummed. We will not be back. My advice, because food allergies are dangerous, is to maybe highlight when someone asks for something specific.
