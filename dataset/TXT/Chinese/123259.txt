OkKwxF0mGPUzRVOPAWSHFw Do Not come here!! The service is so poor. The food is so so. Not great. When this place first opened the manager then was pretty nice and food was better then too. This time I went back there are new managers there and there are very little customers. We went during peak time around 12:30 for dim sum. Anyways the reason why I don't recommend is that one of the managers sat down to talk to us and he stuck a pen inside his ear and started picking the inside of his ear and then flicked it on the floor. I looked at my family and quickly ended the conversation and left. It was disgusting and not professional at all. His shirt was suppose to be white but instead it was surrounded in black and grey dirt round his wrist and collar. The place was pretty much empty and food was not great and service needless to say was atrocious. Any wonder the place is so empty.
