y1PXa8oQSnEHuL7AmwOP5A Came in here to get some sushi but ended up getting their piping hot speciality, the Teppan-Taka Seafood. Excellent dish to split with someone. The sauce was really good and there was a nice variety of seafood. The staff was excellent and the place was clean. We will be back!
