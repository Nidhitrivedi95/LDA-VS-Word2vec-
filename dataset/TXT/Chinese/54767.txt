cUHPc4rW6qi3yTBPdQDCKw Today, I was lucky because I went with co-workers who one of them is from the Sichuan Province. He ordered for all of us and got 4 dishes which were all Szecuan Cuisine. He ordered in Chinese and he did not know how to translate in English to us. Please check out the photos that I took for the delicious dishes that we ate.

Emperor's Garden is definitely not for the American Chinese Cuisine, which I can see why this restaurant has mostly bad reviews. You will not find Chinese Broccoli with Beef if so, it may not be good. 

However, the authentic Szecuan Cuisine was really really good and very spicy which I love. 

I will definitely come back here as long as my co-worker is with me.
