vsoEZauF4lrADIqCYXySFQ I was very excited when I saw that a new Chinese place was open and that it is open really late!  Then once I saw their menu and saw that they have a tofu general tso's I had to try it. 

So I did and it wasn't all that great.  I am not sure how other general tso's are, but this one didn't have any broccoli at the bottom like other ones that I've had and the tofu was ehhh.  Some pieces had a really good crisp to them, and others were tough and chewy. 

The food is reasonably priced and you get a ton, but stay away from the tofu general tso's unless you really really like tough and chewy tofu and rice.  I know I will next time.

Oh, but one thing they do get points for is if you pay with cash you get a 3% discount, even on delivery.
