Mv3pO01Alty1pXQwi-Uy5A Friendly greeting when I walked in for my order, food smelled fresh and I could easily see the kitchen and our meal being boxed (clean space).
Food was fresh, great flavours, crisp veggies, firm, not mushy noodles. 
Steer clear of the pad thai, it's just "ok" and you can better somewhere authentic.
Shanghai and Singapore noodles are awesome- spicy, lot's of flavour.
