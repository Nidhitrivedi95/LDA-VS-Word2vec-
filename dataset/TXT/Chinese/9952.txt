1ZHBhMwi9rdXJ92QPHrWLw 9.99 for Chinese food buffet style sure why not!!
It's not that big of a place but hey it gets the job done! On weekends they got seafood out which are okay don't be  expecting some bomb ass seafood. BEWARE of the crush orange soda! It tastes like it has a grip load of soap in it! LOL!  They got some tv which is good I suppose to catch games and what not while you are enjoying your meal. They don't have their price listed anywhere so it was kinda weird to ask the hostess, but it's okay the foods not bad.
