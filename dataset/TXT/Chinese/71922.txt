Favorite dish here is the regular size Teriyaki grilled chicken steamed vegetables and light brown rice. The part I like the most is that you see the people in the back grilling your chicken so it takes the effect of it being "fast food". I have 3 children three different age groups and they all enjoyed having dinner here.  You can tell the staff gets along great with each other which is very nice to see however I don't think it's appropriate when they're saying certain curse words and they have customers in the restaurant... for that reason alone I give it a four-star
