X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg I got trolled by my promoter to get in line at 8:45pm because the I Heart Radio concert was also at MGM that night and she said it would be super popping. My friends and I were hesitant because who arrives at the club that early right? Well we did it anyway because we didnt want to pay and it super sucked because we were all wearing heels. Starting early and wearing heels is not the best idea. There was already a line for guys but the girls line was so short. We waited for 45 minutes before we could actually get in so we just took photos and talked to a bachelorette party in the meantime. Oh well, at least it was free for us :)

You get in and the venue is pretty nice but all I cared about was the hip home floor. There are tons of bottle service tables and surprisingly the dance floor is pretty small. They played pretty good music since I am not a fan of EDM so I was pleased with that. We kept switching back from EDM floor to hip hop just because we wanted to explore the crowd but it totally took a toll on our feet since we wore heels. That night, actually that whole weekend, there were almost no yellow fellows out there so I was pretty disappoint. I think it was mostly white people so if you want the asians, your best bet is XS. Maybe that weekend was a fluke but when I go to vegas next time, Ill just stick with Marquee and XS. Calvin Harris was there that night but our feet were dying so we left before seeing him and grabbed food. What a yolo.

**TIPS**
1) Just get a promoter and get in for free. Be wary of what time she tells you to arrive and add an hour to the estimated time so you wont have to arrive hella early.
2) So many staircases, so painful for feet. Just wear flats to the club mang.
3) Enjoy the hip hop floor!
