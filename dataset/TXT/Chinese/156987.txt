TSGBM2z5BTeJvYQAznz8Fg This restaurant and Pacific Buffet belong to the same owner(s). The food is very similar. The place is newly remodeled and looks very nice. We like this one just as much as Pacific. This one has cheese cake in the dessert section and it is one of my favorites. There is also a coffee/cappucino flavored ice cream, which is definitely worth trying.
