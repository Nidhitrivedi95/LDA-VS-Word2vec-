-RmFfWUyUU1RPIGtih7J-w I came upon this place on a reference from a friend. I'm glad I did! Upon entering the Restaraunt, the decor is distinctly eastern, which is nice. The staff seats you quickly, and even though I was obtaining a to-go order, I was offered a table.

I ordered the chicken fried rice, the chicken chow-mein, orange chicken, and some wanton soup. The fried rice was cooked to perfection, and the vegetables still had some bite to them (read: NOT mushy). The chow-mein was really good, and the orange chicken is some of the best I had ever had. The wonton soup was quite good, and I even ate some as leftovers the next day. 

The woman who assisted me with my order was polite and offered good suggestions as to their menu. I would definitely recommend this place as a good Chinese Restaraunt, and I will most definitely be back!
