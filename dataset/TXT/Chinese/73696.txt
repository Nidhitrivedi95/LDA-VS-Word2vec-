fJVrLAFaqcvzt1QAw12Uxw FAME is a legit concept, we just wished the food owned up to the name. The food advertised on the little papers are expensive and they look far from appetizing. We always walk in, take a gander at what they have to offer, but then quickly change our minds about dining here.

We've also tried Fuku burger's Tamago burger and jazz fries, but we were completely disappointed. Every flavor that we could taste was very salty. The burger didn't have any exciting pops of flavor and the fries became super swampy, soggy and terrible from the salt bombed gravy and mayo. The flavors were just too simple and fell flat on my asian fusion radar. We would try another one of their burger creations in the future, but we are definitely wary.

The reason why I'm not hating too hard on FAME, is because they have an incredible location at the LINQ - right smack dab in the middle of thangs! Plus, their "Boba Lounge" is not half bad. Their honey green tea is super refreshing and actually had a robust, full bodied, deep tea flavor. They also added the right amount of honey to sweeten it nicely. The boba itself is white/clear and had pops of reddish pink color which is really cool to look at, I just wished they cooked it properly. Most of the boba were super mushy and dissolved on contact, some were super chewy, and then there were a few boba that had the right consistency. The drink size is hefty, but for about $9, I wouldn't make my way out here for it. But if I'm in the immediate area and there's a real life boba emergency - I would definitely dabble.
