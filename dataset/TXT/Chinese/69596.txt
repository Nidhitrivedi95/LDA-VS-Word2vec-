F-AYOq1xIY2u_qmWUG5VBw So it was "on demand" spicy items on the menu for the family today .. Manchurian fish was the highlight though I dont accept basa to be a fish. Sea Bass is a good alternative, and I am sure will turn out much better (hope the chef reads this) .. Szechuan chow mein, chilli chicken and hot & sour soup were great picks .. chilli beef dry was good, but not the calibre of a true dry beef, as I have had at another Hakka restaurant .. good food, good customer service, hence consistency is the deal for success. Well done Hakka Ren!
