Q9veWOu7mFj881o3nqB4bQ The all you can eat hot pot is a pretty good deal, given that we are in Pittsburgh and there isn't a whole lot of competition. It's good to come as a group since everyone gets  to choose what to put in their individual pots and splitting the check is easy. The thin sliced lamb and beef were pretty good, but they were served still frozen solid. I like that you can also get Korean rice cakes and fish balls. However the fish filet and shrimp we got just didn't seem that fresh so I would skip them in the future. 

The food is solid but I felt like I was inconveniencing the servers when we asked for water. Also, their style is Chinese hot pot, not their Japanese namesake, shabu shabu. (I still haven't a place for proper shabu shabu.) They do have a mix of Japanese, Korean and Chinese options. I still like it, it's just more of a fusion hot pot.
