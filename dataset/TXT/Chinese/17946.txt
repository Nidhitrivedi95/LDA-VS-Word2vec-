4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A Came on a Saturday night with my large buffet loving family.  We had made a reservation for an early dinner at 6pm so didn't have a problem securing our table.  Most of our group ordered the seafood.  The seafood is a couple of dollars more for a plate of seafood.  Seafood isn't all you can eat.  The seafood dish comes with 1 oyster, 1 mussel, 2 shrimps, 2 scallops and some enoki mushroom per person.  The oyster was fresh, nice and plump!  Worth the extra $2 in my opinion. All the food was pretty fresh and I liked that the plum juice or lemon tea was included.  I also liked that they offered different soup bases at no extra charge like the satay.  I deducted a star for the slow service.  We found that our order didn't always come and we had to follow up and re order items.  They were also so busy it was difficult to flag someone down.  

Another positive is that the restaurant felt really well ventilated so it didn't get too congested with hot pot fumes.  Will try to return on a weeknight when it's not  as busy.
