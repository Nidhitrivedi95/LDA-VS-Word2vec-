The seats in the booths, while clean, have become too soft with age, so choose to sit at the regular tables so you don't sink too low on your seats. The array of dishes offered is not extensive, but what they do offer are adequate for a decent meal. There are hits such as the chop suey and misses such as the sweet-sour chicken with too much batter. In all, you can get a decent but not great meal here, and the price certainly is attractive especially if you're on a very tight budget.
