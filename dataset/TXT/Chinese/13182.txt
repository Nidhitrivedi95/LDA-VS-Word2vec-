2UaMR7lOJ3IcXizaDpv7KA This is a gem I found during Christmas shopping and I've been loven it ever since! There are two places in town that I know of that have one of my favorite mouth watering meals.....crispy duck curry, it's the big O of food;)! If you've never had it before I highly recommend you try, your mouth only lives once and your taste buds and tummy will thank you. The prices are fair, servings are large and friendly fast service:)
