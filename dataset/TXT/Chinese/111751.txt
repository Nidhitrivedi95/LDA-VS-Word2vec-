maGqjGXYPzal3YydKu8wjQ I don't think I have eaten at a Panda Express since high school. I don't think I need to go back unless I am in fact with someone in high school. Needing to grab something quick and get back to a hectic Monday at the office I was lured in by the drive thru... My food was edible, but very oily, lacking in any kind of distiguishable flavor and the meat was fatty. 

On the up side my fortune cookie was tasty and entertaining. But, if you want quick "Chinese" in the area, be slightly less lazy, get out of your car and go in to the Tokyo Express down the street.
