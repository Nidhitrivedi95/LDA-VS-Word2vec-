pdy6EAcJvZks1hKogxOj6Q We frequently get delivery from New Asian Kitchen.  We are quite close to the restaurant, but the food is always very, very hot when it arrives.  Most of the time it is 20 minutes or less.  Hubby likes his Kung Pao with extra nuts and extra spicy, and they happily comply.  I tried the pot stickers last Thursday for the first time, and they were amazing.  So great, we actually ordered some for lunch today which I picked up.  The dipping sauce is wonderful.  We like the crab puffs, but maybe a little sweet.  I have tried many of the entrees.  Delivery of deep fried items like sweet and sour chicken have the sauce on the side so things stay crispy.   I love trying different dishes.  Yui shan eggplant is a new favorite.  Moo shu crepes are a delight.  They will make any dish as a dinner combination for a small fee, but well worth it.  We love homemade Chinese, but I don't always have the time or the energy.   We are lucky to have them so close!!
