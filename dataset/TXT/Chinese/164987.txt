uxSL4FHWiO-fr2iae_d3Bw Was just there 9/7/15 1 35 p.m.  The hostess tried to set us at a table and we kindly asked for a booth instead because its more comfortable. Right then the hostess attitude changed and she snidely said we would have to wait.  we let her know we did not mind but then looked in the dining area and saw multiple booths open.  We then waited at least 15 minutes, and then just left.  Only gave 1 star cause you could not give less.  I even tried to call and voice a complaint with the manager and was told he was to busy.  Guess I am going to be to busy to ever spend $$$$ at P.F. Chang's ever again!
