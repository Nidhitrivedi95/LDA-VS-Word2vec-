puPY7gVy7RCz8bK1zkzdoQ This place js really good. I have only ordered take-out,  but it's pretty quick. The portions are huge, and everything I've tried has been delicious! I really wish they had a website or some way to order online, but it's so good I can look past that, lol. The owner guy is always really nice, and every time I've gone in and waited for my food there are regulars there and he knows their names. Regulars at a business are always a good sign! I will continue coming back. We've had the Lo Mein, BBQ Pork, Crab Puffs, Egg Rolls, Almond Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and Orange Chicken. All were delicious.
