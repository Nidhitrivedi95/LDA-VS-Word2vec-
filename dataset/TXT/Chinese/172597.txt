w4EX3F0KjJIXL7O1fFWXJw The wait staff were picked off the streets! They don't know what good service is. What a shame! Such beautiful decor but stereotypical unclean Asian restaurant bathrooms. We had to ask 3 times each time we needed forks, glasses of water, rice, drink orders and where did our teapot go?! When our teapot was returned, it was placed in the middle of my placemat because there was space as I was holding on to my bowl. If this restaurant wants to sell $500 memberships for $1 off discounted entrees, get your act together or hire all new wait staff!
