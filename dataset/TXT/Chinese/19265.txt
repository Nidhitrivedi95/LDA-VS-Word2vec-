5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g Brrrrrr...... It is super cold night here in Las Vegas (12/07/2013) we're talking mid 20's. Definitely soup weather. 
Thanks to yelp, we found one in LV's Chinatown that's highly rated. 

Service was very good. Specially accommodating a big group (w/ kids in tow)
Food came out fast and the soups come out pipping hot. 

Here's some of the rundown. 
Beef and Tendon Stew Soup w/ Noodles (Spicy) - the soup was very flavorful, the noodles were perfect, the beef was super tender and delicious. The tendons on the other hand were very very tough. It's a shame, a 5 star soup became very disappointing. 

Beef and Tendon Soup w/ noodles (not spicy) my wife's order was the same as my soup. Everything was good except the tendons. My sister in law had the same soup & she had tender tendons. (She got the first bowl) we got ours about 5 minutes after she got hers. I think the tendons were not yet ready. Like my wife said, 10 more minutes of cooking those tendons might have helped, I agree. 

Crispy Chicken Leg Rice. Delicious. The chicken had a five spice rub concoction on it and it was fried perfectly. The rice had some mince pork & sauce on it. Yummy. It also came with half a hard boiled egg and a couple of vegi side dish, both very good as well. This dish was for my son, but me and my wife ended up eating the whole thing, sans the chicken skin which my boy scarfed down. I highly recommend this dish. 

Everyone in our group enjoyed their meal. The kids specially liked the dumplings. 

The hot soup certainly warmed us up at least enough to brave the cold LV night and back to our warm hotel. 
I'll definitely be back
