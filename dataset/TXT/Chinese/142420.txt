RkqN70Pidy6_tAWMvodOLg I lalalooooove this place.

My family has gone here for over years now. We've been regulars for as long as I can remember! We always celebrate my dad's birthday here, other occasions as well. This place has two big party rooms so that's why we also keep this place in mind.

Their food is delicious! Very authentic tasting. Orange peel chicken is super yummy and the honey walnut shrimp is so creamy. Their beef and broccoli is very tasty and most of their food is large portions so you can share with the whole party! It's pretty awesome here. They also have smaller lunch and dinner specials which are definitely worth it. They serve sushi and my all-time favorite would be the baked lasagna--SO soooo good.

If you're ever in the area, do not hesitate to try this place! They also have wonderful ice cream and mochi for dessert.

Will always be a nostalgic place for me, will it be for you?
