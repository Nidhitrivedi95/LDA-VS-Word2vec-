6ZsiLiSWGK2pgw6t3LfzNQ Extremely bad service, came to the store in late night, we were told the chef is eating dinner, and would took 10 min. And we said there's no big deal. But we waited like 20 min and the manager told us there's another 20 min. We feel being trolled and the manager said well, you are always welcome to leave.......
