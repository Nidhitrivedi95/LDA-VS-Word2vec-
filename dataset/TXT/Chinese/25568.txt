7BZ2NdkysVLgWScSEvhILQ I was really excited about coming here. I love Asian food and my partner does not, so I was thrilled that he could order the "southern" stuff and I could get the Chinese. 

We started with the egg rolls, and I was having a tough time deciding what to order for my main. The egg rolls were not good. So I decided to move away from the Chinese side of the menu. I specifically asked what the fried chicken pieces were, because I do not like drumsticks. The waitress said it was a mix of thighs and drumsticks. Perfect. We got the 8 piece to share and each got the Sriracha Mac and cheese. It took FOREVER to come out. And then the Mac and cheese came, and it was cold. Not even warm - just cold. Since five minutes later we still didn't have chicken, I asked for warmer Mac and cheese. That came with the chicken, which was all drumsticks (after I had specifically asked and received confirmation that it was thighs). I asked if we could please get some of the thighs and was told that it was chef's choice on the pieces. Okay... So why didn't you say that before? The person running food then offered to only charge us for a four piece and get me something else, but we had somewhere to be and I couldn't wait. We said we would take the four piece charge and dessert (which we confirmed was premade) and be on our way. 

The check came and they charged us for the 8 piece. So we asked what happened there, and they said they would fix it. The check came back with a four piece price that had $2 more tacked on. Had the service been good (she was sweet but not good) or the chicken been better or our water refilled just once without having to ask, I probably wouldn't have minded. But those things were not the case. So I mind. And I won't be back.
