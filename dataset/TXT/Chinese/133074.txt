PuJicbFBW8VFAbXI1MS9Tw Wow! Dr Quan is amazing. I tore a muscle in my back last week and went into a terrible pain cycle. I don't like taking pain meds -- I want the problem fixed and not masked. I went to him thinking I was going to get acupuncture but he did deep tissue and tui na massage, traction and heat therapy. I've got to tell you, it was NOT fun. He showed me a few gentle exercises which I did as recommended. He wanted me to come back four days later. I didn't see any improvement but kept my appointment. More DEEP massage, etc. This time he did electro acupuncture. That was Thursday and I went from a 9 on the pain scale of 1 -10 to about a 6. I left   his clinic a few hours ago and I have even more improvement. This session was easier; massage, acupuncture, and cupping. Typically a pain cycle like this will last three months. I'm so glad I found Dr Quan!
