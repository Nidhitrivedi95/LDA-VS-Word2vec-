rROHsa0BQsKjxNnfYjBF9g I wish this wasn't one of the very few hakka choices for downtown Toronto. I've been disappointed more than I've been... appointed... with this place. All the dishes I ordered were already spicy, but I asked for them to be made extra spicy. The hot and sour soup and manchurian chow mein were palatable, but the 'spicy' hunan tofu was so very bland and was reminiscent of dish sponge material that had been sitting in bottom of the sink water for days. It was pricy too, $30 for 3 dishes even though I asked for the small soup, I received and was charged for a large one. Which I did eat most of... but still! I thought it was sneaky. I had buyers remorse when I saw Swatow down the street and remembered they have even better food for less money.
