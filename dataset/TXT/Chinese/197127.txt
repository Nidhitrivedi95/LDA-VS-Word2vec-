ZpMoI5EECS6Rm7KigN1gPg Best restaurant I have ever experienced. The most beautiful china and service is very professional. But the food is spectacular I have never experienced such delicious food it just melts in your mouth and right infront of you is the Bellagio fountains so it gives a great ambiance over all experience was excepcional. Definitely a place you have to go before you die.
