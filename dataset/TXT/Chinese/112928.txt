Mkpg9S2j0ZrZc3q-VjfLsA This Congee Queen never disappoints!

Spacious, uncluttered, well air conditioned restaurant with meals that are noticeably a cut above other congee houses.

I always order the same things here:

pork and century egg congee - well seasoned congee and their pork is so tender, like it's been braised for hours.

beef *see choy* hor fun - these noodles are so silky smooth and flavourful, i just can't get enough! Also comes in *black bean* and *waat daan (smooth egg)* varieties, which are both delicious.

BBQ Eel fried rice - if you've never tried this, the bbq eel tastes like the ones you'd get from eel sushi, and the rice is of a perfect firmness level, whereas other places can often serve mushy rice. Just remember to order it like a true fob and call it "eel fly lice!"

There is lots of free parking in the plaza, which is also home to Tim Hortons, Food Basics, Shoppers Drug Mart, and a TD bank.
