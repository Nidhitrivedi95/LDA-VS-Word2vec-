tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg my favorite chinese place. ordered delivery. it got here super fast and was fresh. weird fried wontons, but in a good way. the paper chicken is also very good. I got the sesame chicken as my entree. I appreciate how they package the chicken separately from the sauce so it doesn't get soggy in transport. huge portion sizes. great taste. definitely worth the price.
