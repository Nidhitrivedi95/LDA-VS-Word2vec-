kICgNgVRkIh4doz0atyMMA My Group had a wonderful experience at Hakkasan this past weekend.  The environment was chic and classy, the food was delicious (especially the Crispy Duck Salad) and the staff was extremely hospitable.  As a Vegas local I have not had the opportunity to visit until this point, but I will definitely be back.  

We ended the night for a cocktail in the Ling Ling room and had a blast.  The bartenders were very friendly.  

Thanks for a great night Hakkasan Team!
