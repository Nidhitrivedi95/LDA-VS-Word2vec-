OXW2erFOPT-Oov6wChxWYA I noticed that Lee Chen opened up near my office but didn't visit until recently. I came here on two different days. The first visit was on a Tuesday and the restaurant was busy but I was able to quickly get a seat. The second time was on a Wednesday and the restaurant was extremely busy. I had to wait about 15 minutes for a seat.

The interior is very spacious and modern with lots of tables. They definitely need all of the tables they can get. I browsed through the menu and was hoping to see some familiar dim sum items, but there were few. I ordered the xiao long bao and the Lee Chen fried rice on my first visit. The XLB looked hastily made, but it was flavorful and the soup was tasty. I guess that's what matters the most. I thought the rice was very aromatic and flavorful. On the second visit, I ordered the XLB and the pulled pork bao. I was going to order the pan fried dumplings, but the waiter told me that it takes a long time to make. The baos were soft and sweet. The pulled pork was juicy, savory, and very tasty. The sauce was spicy.

Prices were reasonable. I'll definitely be back, but with reservations.
