tDYcVluqZwieulc1iqxGXg Just called and placed a delivery order and was told it's to late for delivery. Okay thinking to myself I asked "what time do you deliver till" the man said "9:15" . I looked at the time and it was 9:00. I said this to him and his response was "it's just too late we are busy and hungup". What horrible service. He could have said I'm so sorry we are unable to at the moment instead of saying it's too late and hanging up.
