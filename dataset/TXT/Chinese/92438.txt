iRFaq249LVEFGeXLzPULnQ I was told this was the "Best Chinese Food in Las Vegas" .. I went to try after several referrals, I decided to try. The food was tasteless and slimy. Egg rolls had oil pouring out, orange chicken was slimy and had no taste. 

Our waitress was very nice and accommodating service is not the issue its the food.
