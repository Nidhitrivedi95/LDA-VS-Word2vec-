SvMBtzXfE-3H5pxoR7VD3w When I say I love sandwiches, I LOVE them. I'd choose sandwiches over rice, any day. But there's something about the club sandwiches here that doesn't make it taste so good. I'm not saying the sandwich is bad.. It's still good, just not good enough. I didn't realize there was the addition of fried chicken in it, so every bite was a bit of chicken. Not a fan of it, not at all. I'd prefer the sandwich to have egg, ham, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and mayo.. Maybe it's just me, but the chicken wasn't crispy enough.. Not like bacon.

Exercise.. Ex-ar-size. Eggs are sides.. For bacon.
