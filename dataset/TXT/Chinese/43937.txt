I am from California and was on a business trip to Downtown Phoenix and my group was hungry and craving Asian food and this was the nearest Asian restaurant to our hotel. We ordered for pick up/take out from Yelp and it took my credit card information. I thought this would just be for order and pick up confirmation but when I went to pick up my food, they asked for my credit card again. I did not notice the double charge until I arrived home, back in California. 

I called in asking to speak to the manager and the woman that I spoke with said that she was unsure if her manager would come in that day so I left my number with them and it's been three days with no call back. 

Also my previous experience: when I was there, the cashier who rang me up also said, "will they be letting you out for a lunch break tomorrow? Because tomorrow I am off and when it gets busy, they call me and i don't like that." 
Well, thanks for your awesome, positive attitude! 

I refuse to give service to this restaurant and will be warning anyone I know who will be staying in Downtown Phoenix.
