RJKbewB0SzRZpIvQmiF-dQ I would give negative stars if I could. I'm from boston where we have fantastic Chinese food and as a transplant I'm always searching for decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this is the worst I ever had. So far little Peking on Shea and 32nd is as close to good Chinese food as I've found. 
If you're an easy coast transplant constantly looking for good food to satisfy your craving for delicious food....avoid this terrible place.
