raHgmWxE8AVSivo92GX5Wg I love to experiment...with food.  So I decided to try the vegetarian Chinese food.  My previous experience with Chinese vegetarian food (about 15 years ago) was not bad and great taste, but it was so full of MSG, I drank so much water.  This place was a completely different experience.  A nice simple but elegant setting, the restaurant lives up to its name as it feels like complete zen in here.  Also, I didn't detect a hint of MSG and felt like homemade.  

I ordered a spicy eggplant dinner combo (available at lunch time), which basically comes with miso soup, mock dim sum (har gow and siu mai) and a bento box featuring the eggplant.

Miso soup - this was the most amazing miso soup I've ever had.  Not too salty and lots of tofu.  Real natural taste.  Probably the way the Japanese intended.  

Har Gow and siu mai - Props to the chef because the presentation and imagery of this was just like real dim sum.  Pretty good and for the siu mai, I couldn't even tell it was vegetarian.  

Spicy eggplant bento box (with purple rice, salad, spring roll and soy nuggets) - they really did make eggplant the star of this box.  There was so much (at least 20-25 slices) and the flavour was great.  The only minor improvement I would ask for is for it to be more spicy.  The purple rice was delicious and had a nice crunchy texture, which was different but good and the salad was awesome. The vegetables were very fresh.  The soy nuggets and spring roll was average.

In summary:

Why come here:You want good Chinese food without msg and without asking your mom to cook for you.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I think this was one of the better Chinese meals eating out.  

Why you shouldn't come here: You want cheap, greasy Chinese food or Americanized Chinese food

Final verdict:  Check it out.  Worth a try even if you are not vegetarian.
