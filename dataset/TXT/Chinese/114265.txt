Gold Mark Chinese Cuisine looks like one of those upscale dim sum restaurants, similar to the whole Casa brands. However, the outside looks somewhat unappealing as there isn't much decoration...not to mention the entrance to the restaurant faces away from Woodbine.

We arrived for dinner at around 8pm and found the place relatively full, but we did manage a table immediately. There were a lot of menu pages and options, so it took a while for us to digest...eventually we ordered half a roasted a starter soup, crispy chicken, fried crab claw, and mixed mushrooms.

Overall we found the dishes to be on the healthy side, which is good if you're one of those health conscious characters. It bears similarities to the Regal brand, which also specialized in healthy Chinese fine dining. However, we found the portions to be on the small side and the prices to be on the high end. Definitely expect to spend on the high end if you are to dine here, at least for dinner.

With so many choices for Chinese fine dining, I don't see myself returning in the short term. However I wouldn't give this place a direct red flag as the food isn't terrible.
