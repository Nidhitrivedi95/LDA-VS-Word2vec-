a5xUI7TvsNhM5gZr6KowDg I have been a regular for a quite long time but yesterday's experience was very disappointing. The waiter spilled the sauce all over the table and did not care to apologize at all--instead, he kept blaming me and the rest of the party for moving the dishes. The hot tea was never refilled or served on time. When the whole party got out of the restaurant he even frowned upon all of us for the amount of tip he got from us. 
Furthermore, the food was not authentic Chinese at all. We ordered one whole Peking Duck but it wasn't even close to the Peking Duck I've had in Philadelphia, D.C., and China! It was honestly my first time trying something other than the mixed vegetables and general Tso's chicken but it was again quite disappointing. 
Never going back to spend money only to get frowned on by a waiter!
