WmuoWetYC-4U2-V4taC6Wg Disappointed to say the LEAST. I've been going to Yueh Tung for years but my visit yesterday was horribly disappointing. We ordered the chilli chicken, chicken pakoras, and chicken chowmein and nothing had taste; the Hakka flavour was no where to be found, it was like eating boiled, tasteless chicken. We barely ate any of the food, we won't be going back. It was a waste of time and money, as we didn't take any of the food with us. 

When the waitress came to give us the bill and take out containers she insisted that next time we order less because we were wasting the food and made some other remarks comparing her son to us. 

Paid, tipped 50 cents but our waitress still didn't get the point and continued to point and talk about us as we walked out.

HORRIBLE experience, wouldn't waste your time or money.
