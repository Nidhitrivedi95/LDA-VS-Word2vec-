eab04KSBbf30FqB4cH8erQ The ramen is not cheap as others have said, and 12 dollars does seem like a lot for the simple ingredients.  However, it is tasty, and as someone who craves ramen a lot, its awesome to have a "healthy" ramen option in town to stop me from eating maruchan ramen. That being said, the BUNS are AMAZING.  They are also not cheap, 7 dollars for 2 small ones, but wow they are so good.  You can also get these buns at umami's food cart in library mall, usually there monday-friday.  I highly recommend the pulled pork buns, which have a peach-miso sauce (they say chutney, I say sauce). Will certainly be eating more of these buns in the future, but wouldnt go running back for the ramen (I had the miso chicken ramen), which is ironic because I had originally gone there for the ramen with no intention of trying the buns.
