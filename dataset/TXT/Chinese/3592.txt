_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Decent chinese restaurant on the strip.

FOOD: It was good!  I got the Vegetable Moo Shoo.  It came already wrapped, and it was good.  BF got the pan fried noodles with seafood.  He liked the crunchy noodles a lot, but said the fish was okay.

SERVICE: It was decent.  They were nice, and the food came out quick.

AMBIANCE:  It was okay.  It's not a romantic place, and it's basically right in the middle of the casino floor (between the sports room and a bunch of casinos).

PRICE:  It was okay.  Each entree was about $10.

Overall, a decent place for lunch or after a long night clubbing.
