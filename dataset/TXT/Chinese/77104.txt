GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw My mother can't handle Sichuan spice very well, so we got all non spicy dishes. We had the three cups chicken (<U+4E09><U+676F><U+96DE>), eggplant, and sweet and sour pork chops. I really liked how sweet the three cups chicken was - I felt it was too salty at a lot of other places, but the three cups chicken at Szechuan Gourmet is very sweet and flavorful. The eggplant was really good too. I felt the texture of the pork was a bit too chewy though. Solid place to order Sichuan food in Cleveland.
