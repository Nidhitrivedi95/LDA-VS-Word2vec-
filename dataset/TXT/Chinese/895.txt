-FcZY7a7qgxTUlTvwuyJnQ I have about 142 check-ins at Red Rock Casino, yet this was our first visit to 8 Noodle.  

This place, carved out of the Grand Cafe next door, is relatively small for a casino restaurant, brightly lit, pleasingly modern, with an open kitchen and a fairly limited menu.  

We usually don't order appetizers, but the couple at the next table were sharing an order of gyoza.  They looked delicious, so we did it, too.  (So much for New Year's resolutions).  The dumplings, filled with pork and shrimp, were plump, perfectly cooked, and very tasty.

My husband ordered the Five-Spice Beef soup - brisket and thick udon noodles in a delicious beef broth that was spicy, but not overly, and the meat was very lean.  I had the Spicy Shrimp over vermicelli rice noodles.  The shrimp weren't gigantic, but big enough so that the five of them filled me up.  I loved the noodles, too, but there was enough to feed a family of four, so a big portion of them came home with me.

Here's the first recipe I've ever published on Yelp:  The leftover noodles filled a 2" deep pie dish halfway up.  I beat up 3 eggs, poured them over the noodles, and baked until done, about 35 minutes, at 350°.  Then I covered the top with a layer of satay peanut sauce (from Trader Joe) and put the dish back in the oven for another five minutes, till the sauce bubbled.  It made enough for two big servings (this time with a salad).  The $14 for this dish went a long way.  Such a deal!!  :)
