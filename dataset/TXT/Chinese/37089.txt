AMM3qOH9DUQzJHm9Q3vHag Just had dinner here. Was hungry and found this place because it had high stars. This was the worst $30 spent. The only thing that was halfway decent was the cheese ragoons. The fried donuts were bland and they they were covered in sugar. Rice and noodles were bland and dried. The food was not worth 4 stars. I've had better meals in Thailand jail.
