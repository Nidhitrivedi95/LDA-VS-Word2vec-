AktuBx1W7c3ZdzwuaOp8xg Not far from the house I really wanted to try LD after seeing a flier.  So I popped in with the GF after seeing a movie thinking we could eat and chat about it..

With a few missed turn offs we finally located the place as it truly is tucked away and off the beaten path.  After walking in we were greeted but not in a warm and welcoming sort of way but rather in a stoic way.

I ordered up some Pad Thai and the GF ordered the Sesame Chicken.  The came out quickly and we began to eat.  The Pad Thai was fine but i did not really care for my GF's chicken.

I really wanted to like this place but instead I realized that maybe I don't live as close to it as I thought.
