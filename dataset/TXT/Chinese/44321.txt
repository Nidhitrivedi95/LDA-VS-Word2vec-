bj6Km1RvgD6oyppCe5yDog This food was not amazing.
I was fooling around on Postmates and accidentally hit the order button on my phone. Then I thought "why not" because I had wanted to try this place anyway.
I usually order egg foo yong and sweet and sour pork to rate a new place. The efy gravy was flavorless. Efy was as weird as every other Phoenix Chinese restaurant. Sweet and sour pork sauce tasted like it was burned.
I really should remove Postmates from my apps.
