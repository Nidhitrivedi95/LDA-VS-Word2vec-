Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg When you are hungry and want to avoid all the nuances of a high end restaurant then P F Chang's is the place to be if you are in a mood for a chinese meal. Food is delicious in this restaurant and the portions are generous. Restaurant has two floors. It is located in the Planet Hollywood's complex facing the Las Vegas Blvd. Lots of shopping is in its immediate vicinity.

I generally order the Chicken soup along with a spicy dish such as General's chicken and/or King pao chicken. The food is really consistent in taste and quality throughout the P F Chang's chain of Restaurants. I have no issues with the food quality and taste. The only area of opportunity is to get seated in a timely manner and the time it takes from ordering of the food to its delivery. During dinner hours there can be long waiting periods in the above categories. The pricing is economical and competitive with restaurants within its class.
