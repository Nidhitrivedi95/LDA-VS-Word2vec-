OaHJvi10dJbMIaQXg5e2Ag Very good restaurant for Chinese food, pho and even the chicken curry. Ask for insanity if you like spicy. They typically do one drop for most, I got 4 yesterday in the curry and sweat like crazy. Bowls of pho are big as you'd hope and good, meat is tender and broth great. General Tsos chicken is crispy and probably the best I've had anywhere. We come every couple weeks it seems and have started bringing friends probably once a month. Great family owned/run restaurant.  Vietnamese coffee is sweet, but real good.
