E1WG9lbypCMKlKhAjzWRsQ Surprisingly better than my expectation (which I guess were pretty low due to Titus' ratings)

Note: we arrived here at 10 or so and there were only one other couple, which may be why food was decent.

Overall, I would say the place isn't bad but the biggest problem it has is consistency and complexity of flavors. My favorites were the chicken cartilage, lamb kabobs, and shrimp.

First the bad, almost everything we ordered had the same spice mix which was good, but gets boring after awhile if u keep having different things with the same flavors. Another thing I found really bad was consistency. We would have 1 order of something and the first kabob would be too salty, and the 2nd one would be in dire need of more salt.

The good: for the price you're paying, it's honestly not bad considering most other ayce places are more in the 25-30 range. The lamb kabobs were generally pretty good, tender well seasoned. The shrimp was really crispy, so crispy that I didn't even bother with the shell.

All in all would come again.....
