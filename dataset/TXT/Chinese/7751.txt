0VtWeDkqzj9CE3MF0geWYA Used to come here quite a lot when I was a kid, as my parents were quite fond of the place. It is a testament in itself to see that the restaurant is still around about a decade later, with modern decor that changed with the times. So props for that! 

With that being said, the overall quality has gone down quite a bit over the years. The first thing now my mom tells everyone about the place is that they have the shittiest tea around! They give you a pot for your table, but apparently restaurants that are cheaper have better tea. Not a good start. 

Lunch isn't bad, as there are variety in specials. Unfortunately, the menu is quite confusing in itself. Only certain meals come with a drink, soup, or some veggies, yet they all sit on the same page... How would your customer know which one is which! To top it off, the server was exceptionally rude about it. She spoke to us as if we were stupid, and showed us a photo on the page to show that we didn't get veggies. Uhmm, nothing written on the page and photo is pretty much a poor representation 100% of the time. (We even got the veggies as she was talking to us... That shut her right up!)

Food quality itself is pretty good. Which makes up for the overall, giving it a 2. Quite a poor experience compared to what I remembered as a kid.
