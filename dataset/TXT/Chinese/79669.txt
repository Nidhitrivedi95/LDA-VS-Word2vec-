GkY6UWWn0Fz2ehcuBp66pg Went there today after not being there for a while.  This place is good.  Refined Cantonese vegetarian dining.  Portions are not massive, and the food is prepared with care.  It is evident in the quality of the seasonings and the product itself.  Delicate tasting food - not sure how else to describe.  They strive for a quiet and relaxed dining experience.  It is a very welcoming place and a pleasant environment.  Small restaurant.  One of our favourites is the stuffed, braised tofu skin.  Never disappoints.
