HDv-KchmLSlRr5MXxRkNqQ Decided spur of the moment to snag a Groupon for Ginbu and headed over with my fiancée. The Groupon gave you a discount for $30 of food, so we started out with some edamame, which was great. Just the right serving amount to not fill you up, and the flavor was excellent. 

We split five rolls between us and have nothing bad to say about any of them. We got a spicy tuna, a spicy salmon, a Philly, a volcano, and one of the special tools that they were offering. Preparation and presentation were great and the wait staff was very attentive even though they were very busy that evening. 

Also love the location because it is a short note ride from home. Definitely plan to return to Ginbu 401 soon, with or without a Groupon.
