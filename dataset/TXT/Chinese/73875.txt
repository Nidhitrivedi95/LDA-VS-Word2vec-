fmVKBldrSIgFPKigYcu1Uw Love this place and I love how close it is to home. We have been eating here for the past 5 years and it is always delicious. My favorite thing on the menu is their chicken curry, so much flavor and you get a large portion. The family who run it are lovely and accommodating to any special requests that I have.
