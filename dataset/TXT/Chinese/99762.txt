jvwzhzA9vsfJHCdlbLkHZw Went here for the lunch special last week for the first time. I ordered the beef broccoli which came with egg flower soup first which was deliciously fresh and hot. Then came the lunch platter! Wow! Beef broccoli, egg roll, fried wonton, fried rice, as well as 2 condiments of hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce. I thought it was delicious, all of it! Definitely going back.
