JQWIZ8MT-VGZzO5W5XCB5Q Seeing how 88 China Bistro is only a block from my office I eat there often. It is not the best Chinese food I have had, it is not my favorite Chinese spot in Charlotte but it suffices for a quick lunch. The food is flavorful, light and gets to you quickly all at a fair price. I really enjoy their hot and sour soup.
