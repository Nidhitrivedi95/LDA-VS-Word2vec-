bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug Came by for lunch and was seated super quickly with no wait. Lunch specials are 5.75 for smaller (but still decent) portion size and a drink. 

Got the chili chicken lunch special and shrimp pakoras. Chili chicken was served with white rice, which offset the spiciness nicely. Really tasty and filling and not too salty. Shrimp pakoras were made from shrimp paste and I couldn't really tell if there was any actual shrimp inside. There were also chilies deep fried in them, which made them extra spicy. I prefer the shrimp pakora from Lin Garden as it's essentially a whole shrimp that's battered and deep fried and has a better flavour. 

They include a 10% gratuity for dine-in. Service wasn't as bad as others have commented. Our water was always full, which is my usually standard, so I was pleased. Would go back!
