THsmhy9NXI6WOEhVnrv01A Used to get delivery from here years ago, but apparently they are now under new ownership and no longer deliver..my other half NEVER wants Chinese so when he agreed I had to take the time to go and pick it up..might not have the chance for Chinese for another 6 months. 

When walking in the interior had changed a bit, new tables, chairs and flooring. Noticed right away it was clean. a polite lady took my order and while I waited a man shelling pea pods made small talk. 

The food only took about 5 minutes and I was on my way. The other half ordered the Mongolian Beef dinner combo (combo comes with chow mein, fried rice, egg roll and a fried won ton.) Ordered sweet & sour chicken for the child and I ordered the Garlic Chicken.

The other halfs beef was wonderful, spicy but not too much, with a decent ratio of meat & green onion, the chow mein on all orders had large pieces of chicken..the egg roll was more like a small spring roll with translucent wrapper, still very tasty.

The low point of the meal was the Garlic Chicken, not enough spice and was more like a bland brown sauce without the garlic kick, not at all like the sauce I am used too.

Overall for $22.00 the meal was worth it and the next time the husband gets a hankering for take out it is going to be 1st on my list.
