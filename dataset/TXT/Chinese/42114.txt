bBdBNFFyIVUwY-L3kqa3zg Was not impressed by the Dim Sum here. I usually go to Chinatown downtown but wanted to give this restaurant a try as I just moved to the area. Not as good a selection as downtown Dim Sum places and our steam shrimp balls were undercooked - the shrimp inside was cold and still grey. Will probably just make the trek downtown from now on.
