lapNvwl_u-x_g9MlMjW1FQ Never been or thought of getting food from this spot but tonight we did because we wanted Chinese. I thought the price was pretty expensive! Battered sweet and sour shrimp was $12! They were nothing special and should have cost $8.00 the most! 

It was my bad but I didn't know that I was charged delivery fees so I ended up double tipping! 3 items (one being veg fried rice) and 2 drinks, we ended up paying $41! Minus my tip it came up $37 with delivery charge, still too much for the small portion and 3 items!!
