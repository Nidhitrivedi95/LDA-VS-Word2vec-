W90h9VXUSdRz1_uJhweVPQ We ordered 2 ramens, chicken drummies, grilled octopus and hamada.  All of which are small servings, the ramens barely have noodles floating in sour soup.  It wasn't even enough for 1 person. For the price of $17 each, I was expecting a big bowl.  The chicken drummies taste regular or I have tasted much better. The Hamada tasted okay but for the expensive price and you only get 4 small slices, it was nothing to be excited about. Thumbs down for me.
