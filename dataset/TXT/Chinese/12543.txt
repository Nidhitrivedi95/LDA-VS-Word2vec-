2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w My family and I have tried this place several times and have been disappointed each time. Sometimes the food is cooked well but other times it is been overcooked. It is also very expensive for what you get. The restaurant itself is very small so if you go on a busy night be prepared to wait a long time.  Most of their business comes from takeout but it is not very good.
