wCB9mquz6W0ZuO5pPZXeDg I'v eaten at the Chicago Chinatown location twice and thought I'd take a couple of colleagues to lunch on Friday, September 8, 2017 at the new Champaign location. We asked about one dish and the server's response was: "I am not very familiar with the menu." 
Seriously?
So we ordered: three entrees and one cold cucumber salad.
15 minutes later, during our lunch hour, the first of the 3 entrees is brought to the table.  Another 10 minutes and the second entree is brought to the table.  At that point we tell the server to cancel the cold cucumber salad and it is only then that he tells us they are out of the cucumber, so we were never going to get our salad anyway.
Fast forward another ten minutes and the first of the 3 of us has eaten all he cares to eat and requests a "to go" box.  Since it is now 12:35 and one of us is done eating and my food has not yet been served, I cancel my boiled fish order and return to work without having had any lunch.
The food may be very delicious, I'll never know.
I wonder if the "Celebrity Chef, Tony Hu" has ever visited the new Champaign location? So much potential, but apparently management is absent or just phoning it in...
