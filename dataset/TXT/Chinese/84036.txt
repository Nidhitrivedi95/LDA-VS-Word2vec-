HF_8znfrLUH_O2098Saj4w Had lunch here today with Robyn N. and Rand H.and for $4.99 you get a pretty good lunch. They have quite a few trays of food and some were good but most were just OK. The deep fried chicken wings were real good and they had a soup they called Mexican soup that had beef tongue in it , it was not bad but out of place in a Chinese buffet.the staff here are very nice and friendly ,I wish all the other places I have been were like that.So for a good cheap lunch head over to Chinese Gourmet Buffet.
