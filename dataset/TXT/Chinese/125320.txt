OX0T9dWI8b7meu-ljTo22A The hot wings, medium wings, bbq wings, and even the mild wings here are bursting with flavor! The nachos here are super simple and lack luster. Just nacho cheese sauce with yellow corn chips. No pico de gallo, guacamole, or meat. I see a lot of people ordering hamburgers at this place that is known for their wings. I have not tried a burger yet but they are popular so they must be half way decent. This place would get 5 stars if they had beer and if the place was bigger. When they are crowded during lunch you can be left eating out in the heat on their picnic tables. If you love wings and have not been to Long Wong's you are missing some tasty bird.
