1PMwRG0uWGxk2hIVEQj62A Very disappointed and upset! First of all, the parking was near impossible to find any spaces. We had to park in the "alley" behind the restaurant. Secondly, the hostess told us that the wait was only a couple of minutes but we ended up waiting for almost an hour. Thirdly, all of their VIP customers got seated ahead of us while we just sat there watching them. Finally, for all this heartache the food was not that great. I don't know why there is such a line up to go to this restaurant because personally I will never go here again. We were pressured to order our food and the food was extremely rushed. The taste was too salty and pretty pricey for me. Please avoid this place unless you like to waste your time and hard earned money.
