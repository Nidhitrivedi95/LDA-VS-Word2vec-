6ANVuBMmpkXpFd5Hzkn4_Q Close to the worst restaurant ever. Shrimp penang & beef dan dan were bland and tasteless and tasted exactly the same. I had to spit the shrimp out it tasted spoiled and my dining mates said the beef had a rainbow sheen. We returned all 3 dishes after 1 bite. I will say, the vegetarian chik'n lettuce wraps were ok. Overall, a waste of a 45 minute wait. Do yourself a favor & avoid this place.
