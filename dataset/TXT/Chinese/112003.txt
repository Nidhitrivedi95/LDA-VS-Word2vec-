MDeqp3L79cq3h11_nW5umw I come here mainly for their fresh produce and the middle eastern sections. Yep this is the best middle eastern store in the area. I do browse around for noodles and sweets from their bakery. They also have a nice meat shop and a seafood section.

In regards to their precooked meals sushi is alright, but I have been spoiled by AYCE restaurants that I can't justify spending anything more than $10 on a sushi tray. Steer away from their grilled chicken.

Store is clean and tidy. There is plenty of parking space.
