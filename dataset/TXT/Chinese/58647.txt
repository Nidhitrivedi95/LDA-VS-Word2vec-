DDAGwRR0SypD47XD7-ytjA Terrible for pick-up! Waited five minutes on hold after calling for 10 minutes to busy signal, got order completely wrong , then had to wait another 20 minutes on hold w phone on counter while listening to them take walk-in orders and seat people. Fried rice tasted like shrimp but was supposed to be regular fried rice. Omitted main dish from order and Then they hung up the phone without asking what we needed. Horrific!!
