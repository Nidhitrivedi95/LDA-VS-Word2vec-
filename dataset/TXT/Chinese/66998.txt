EKnbQlntPX0FsgAC94XniA I was excited to come here because I love soup and noodles, and this restaurant offers unlimited noodles! I must say that I have a preference for egg or flour noodles and that I'm not a real fan of rice noodles. 

I ordered the Tomato soup with shrimp (add-on). Not sure how to call it, but the condiments/side dishes came pretty fast, including 1 quail egg, 2 frozen beef slices, half crab stick, bamboo shoots, 1 tofu cut in half, corns, 1 slice of ham, black fungus, lettuce, and 3 other stuff. The broth came in boiling hot, and it is recommended to add all side dishes to give them time to get cooked before adding the noodles. The noodles portion is good enough for 1 person with medium appetite. They also give enough broth for a 2nd order of rice noodle. 
The rice noodles were of a good firmness, could be slurped very easily. The broth was also tasty.

However, I personally prefer a richer broth (similar to ramen soup), or if I could choose, i'd have egg/flour noodles in this tomato soup and I would have enjoyed it more. This is just a personal preference.
