KeQ1cK564cL5C_hBTFrqnA The food was good but it wasn't worth the price. The prices are too high and now they included gratuity (tip) in the bill. We always tip very well but after they included the gratuity I didn't feel like tipping more than I than I did before. The cost of the food is not representative of the price as I could have gone to Red Lobsters and got better quality food for the same price.
