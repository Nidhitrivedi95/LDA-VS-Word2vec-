8B4tanBgBpccBUWSEH4yLA As an Asian, I like to try Asian food restaurant first every where I go.
I went there to have lunch the first time I arrived in Verona for a week of work.
I ordered a stir fry rice noodles, she was rude and the beef tasted weird,  I believe its spoiled or far from fresh. and the noodle was tasteless, trust me, I m not a picky person, 
I never finished half of the plate. terrible. I hope they improve !!
