liGn7sPOvUuy3kcwbhRkbA I hate using the 'Race' card. And most all my friends would know I hardly ever use it.. Close to never... 
However.....I'm going to use it here at this place tonight.  My money is as good as anyone's money.. I wanted to enjoy a dinner experience with my parents.. 
Just because we're Asian... At a 'Fancy' Asian restaurant, we were treated like 'Asians'.. Meaning 'No respect'.. 
When the food arrived, they handed my food 'Across' my mom's face to give to me...the whole time eating.. NOBODY came by to ask how we're doing..
The table beside us, a 'White' family... When their food arrived, they were placed in front of each diner... Without reaching across another person's face...
And had SEVERAL servers came by to ask 'How was your food, how are you doing, everything ok??'
I had to flag down a waiter/waitress to refill my iced tea.. 
It's so sad these people are so ignorant to treat other Asians like this...
And it's too bad they are like that, cause I actually enjoyed the food. It was a bit pricey, but the quality was there. 
I would recommend everyone to come here if I had a better 'Service' experience. 
So if you're white... You'll enjoy this place. If you're Asian... Don't expect service.
