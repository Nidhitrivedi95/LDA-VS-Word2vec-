Every time I have come the same man is at the counter taking orders.  He write in beautiful Chinese lettering.  He knows his business and works hard at it.

Some favorite dishes are the dumplings which come with a very nice sweet and spicy sauce, the egg drop soup and the Jakarta fried rice which has a whole fried egg perched on top.  Recently a friend got the chicken curry which is serve with noodles.  It was way too spicy so I would skip that one.  The portions are huge.  The complimentary chrysanthemum or jasmine teas are terrific so make sure to take advantage of them.
