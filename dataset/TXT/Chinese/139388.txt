QvEoE_oGwHPXvw5IylllNg I never write reviews but this is one of the first times I've ever had to wait for my food to cool down after being delivered. It was hot and fresh, there was nothing missing and everything was correct. The generals chicken was great as well as the chicken friend rice. I usually never get won ton soup any more at Chinese restaurants (although I love it) because there are never any noodles but I decided to try and this place filled it up! Delivered in 20 min! Great!
