I have never eaten inside here, so I can't compare to some other reviews about the interior.

I will give them credit first in that delivery was fast, I was quoted 45 mins it ended up more like 20, the driver was very friendly, and the prices were reasonable.

The food left a bit to be desired though.  Lots and lots of rice, and an ok amount in the "large" containers too.  

Everything had too much funky oil on it.   The S&S pork was ok but the pork was a bit overcooked.   We also had orange chicken, which was not the least bit spicy as the menu noted...in fact crappy panda is spicier thank this, which was disappointing.   The crab puffs were probably the most disappointing, not much stuffed in and it was not a pleasant taste or consistency.

I'd probably give this place one more try because the service was very good, but would order different items and hope for an improvement.
