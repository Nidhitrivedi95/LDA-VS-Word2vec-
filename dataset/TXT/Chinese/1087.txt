I've always been a fan of their food menu. It's tasty and has many choices.  On weekdays,  their lunch combo special is only $10.99 and comes with soup, salad, main and dessert. Drinks are extra cost. I ordered the frog legs and lotus root which was pretty good but a bit too oily.  With a order of hot green tea the whole bill came up to $20 with taxes and gratuity. Not the cheapest lunch meals but great space to hang out and socialize with friends.
