aCQbOhehLeej31x6EMY5eQ my friend and I (wo girls) came to the location on 40 dundas street tonight august 24th at around 9pm... the HOSTESS was very rude. 
We gave our name and was told the wait would be able 10-15 minutes so we sat down on the bench outside the restaurant and could see and hear everyones name being called when the tables were ready. after 15 minutes we went to check if we had been called and this young maybe 20s women said we had been called. she blamed her manager saying that he went out and called our name and blamed us as well for not hearing him insisting we must have went for a walk when we didnt. 

my friend and i said no problem can we just have the next table for 2 then.. as this is usually what anyone with good customer service would do. but she insisted we are placed last on the back of the list and there are now 7 in front of us! I tried to say that we have been waiting cant we have the next table for 2 and she was rude saying 7 in front. then she sarcastically said ok im being nice here and how we can get next table but will still be another 15 minutes or more.. she was very sarcastic and snippy. i hated her tone and she was very rude and passive who gives attitude ..not very nice greeter at all for a resturant! we walked out and went to the pickle barrel right after! it was great. will not be returning to this location and neither will any of my friends.
