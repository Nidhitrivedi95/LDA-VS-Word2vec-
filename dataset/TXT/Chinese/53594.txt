Alright so to be courteous decided to take it to go. Mind you there were 4 other tables who were just getting food. They were very much still open and serving things. After placing the order waitress says "late dinner" "It's really late". Alright we said. Got our food handed to us once again says "it's late". We left 15 min before close while 3 other tables still sat. Food is good but hospitality completely absent.
