puPY7gVy7RCz8bK1zkzdoQ Because of my love for the Kung Pao Chicken I have returned many times to try everything else that I usually love. I have come back with my boyfriend, Sister and one of my good friends. The only time I sat down and ate was with my friend and we experienced a small wait. I am totally ok with that! It is good new for me, means they're doing well and I can continue to eat there for a long time to come.
My friend and I ordered A LOT of food to share between just the two of us. We got a Pu Pu Platter which I haven't had in years and it made me so stupidly happy. Everything on it was awesome. We ordered Beef and Broccoli, Sesame Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein and my Kung Pao. It was all delicious! The Sesame chicken was the one I cared for the least. I had never had lo mein before but the noddles were cooked so perfectly, the veggies had just the right amount of firmness, and the sauce was flavorful. 
My Sister and I ordered the Egg Fu Young with low expectations. We care for it in a very specific way and we are usually let down. Not here. Golden Valley is one of the only places we can find Egg Fu Young the way we like. Give it a try.
As always, the Kung Pao Chicken is life and you need to let it into yours.
