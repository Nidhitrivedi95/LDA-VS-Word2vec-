6Y5TyCM_zb7BmosuFzbzdg Being a former resident of Scarborough, I can attest to the fact that this place as been around for quite sometime, and for good reason.

The indian chinese food you get here is very good. For apps, try the fish pakora. The beef pepper fry is amazing, chilli chicken, manchurian fried rice are also some of my favorites.

The service is very good, and the lady (owner) is very attentive and very friendly, and yes she does speak hindi. :) In fact, she use to own the Chopsticks in Bandra (Mumbai).

The price is also right, the decor isn't much to write about. Check out the pictures on the wall as soon as you come inside, you will see just how many indian bollywood actors these owners have met.

I would suggest this place over mostly indian chinese places in Scarborough.
