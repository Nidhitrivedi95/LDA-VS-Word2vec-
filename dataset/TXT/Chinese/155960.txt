Todrg1F247iuDIm784XHfA One of my absolute favorite places to go to! The service staff is so amazing! I love how friendly they are! And the food has never disappointed! Their hot and sour soup is delicious! The lo mein is cooked to perfection, it has the perfect amount of flavor. It doesn't overwhelm your pallet but has you lambasting everything all at once
