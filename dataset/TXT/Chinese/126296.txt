oZfNL6ZFdITqfwJzcE-LyA If I have to order for delivery, my choices are limited. I try not to order pizza, because the pizza in Arizona sucks. With that said, I love to order Chinese, and this place not only delivers on time, but with good prices and great food. If you order over 20 dollars, the delivery is free, and that is a bonus. I love their egg rolls, always hot and a great taste. Did I mention the rice is never dry and old? Friendly service, and fast on time delivery makes this place my favorite for Chinese delivery.
