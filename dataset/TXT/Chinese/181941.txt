Xfod0UWr_9B-TOM6qxVIwQ Food was great! It came out very quickly, and it was hot and fresh. It was typical Chinese Food. Nothing really special, but we still loved what we ate. I had Kung Pao chicken/shrimp. The others at my table ate Mongolian Beef and the Happy Family. All the meals includes fried rice, crab puffs, and a spring roll.
