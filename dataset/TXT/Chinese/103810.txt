Kn57RIWAdnVfJHI1loLXOQ We are downtown people and went all the way to Scarborough (!) to get some Hakka food. 
The food was okay. I was pleasantly surprised that they had Caribbean food on the menu as well, that is not something I have seen offered before, and the chow mein with a Caribbean chicken leg plonked on top was delicious. The corn chicken soup was also amazing. 
The other food was alright, definitely not the best Hakka I have had. We ordered the veggie pakoras which were surprisingly disappointing. The chili chicken and dry beef and shrimp were all okay, but not great. Definitely watch out for them if you don't like spice - they have a serious kick. 
The price was great, though. Really well priced. 
The waiters were very kind, as well, and we got a room to ourselves without reservations, which was a plus.
