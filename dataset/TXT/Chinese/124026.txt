ooh_xgi3CZkblPNjomXyXA Still pretty solid food. But not always as jaw dropping as that first review. 

The consistency can be odd here. Sometimes the breaded chicken bits taste a little overdone... I don't know a better way to describe it. It's generally fine but when that quality dip hits, it hits hard.

Still a decent go to for a quick dinner but if I want something a little more consistent I'll venture out more.
