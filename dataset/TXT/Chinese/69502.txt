eZQbDYQTZk0_cBroVxnPWg I grabbed some lunch here while cruising the downtown area. The food was pretty cheap, but you could tell. Everything tasted like grease, so much so that I finished about 1/4 of my meal and threw it away, and paid for it the rest of the afternoon with an upset stomach. If you have an iron stomach and need a quick bite to eat, this might be an ok place to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way (at all) to come here.
