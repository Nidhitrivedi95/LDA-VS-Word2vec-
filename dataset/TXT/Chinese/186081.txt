y3vpN6sfipzEpn9Tt5wuog It's okay... not the best Chinese food in the area but definitely the saltiest.  My fried rice was more oily than it was fried and my lo mein was pretty soggy and the things I ordered generally tasted like they could have used both more and less time cooking!  I've been here a couple times and didn't really care for it either time but I went based on the reviews, plus it'd been at least 5-6 years since my last visit to China Dragon.
