TcGmeeNvbcvnQVmVmlWxlA Tonight was my 2nd visit. 
The 1st visit was very good. 
This time not so much. I ordered crab Rangoons.  They were warm inside and crispy outside. We also got the spring rolls. Crispy but inside bland. 
Our main dish was sesame chicken. Half Lo-Mein. The other fried rice. The noodles have a bad aftertaste and they were very dry. The fried rice was just ok. I'm a little disappointed because the first visit I really enjoyed. 
I probably won't return. Sorry
