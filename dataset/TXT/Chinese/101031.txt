We popped in here for a late lunch on Sunday. Our table of 3 shared a congee, a lo mein dish, and youtiao (deep fried doughnut sticks). I was quite impressed with the consistency of the congee, wasn't too thick or overly salty. The deep fried doughnut was very crispy and lo-mein noodles flavourful.

Only complaint was for the servers to bring the crispy sticks with the congee at the same time and also a few hours after, the MSG made me extremely thirsty (probably expected for chis type of cuisine).
