oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw Pretty good Chinese food to go. I get the salt and pepper chicken wings spicy because it's really not that spicy. Their service is very fast and reliable. I have tried their General Tso's chicken, eggplant tofu stir fry, chow mein, and sweet and sour chicken. All are pretty good. It's way better than Panda Express and not greasy.
