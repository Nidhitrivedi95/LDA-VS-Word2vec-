DId2r0a4C2ixCbuLApxx8g American Chinese food is greasy and terrible everywhere, and that's what we know and love about it. However, Chopstix has accomplished the amazing feat of actually making greasy, fried food taste bland.

One day, I came home craving Chinese and serendipitously found one of their menus stuffed in my mailbox, along with some absurdly good coupons. I placed a huge order and paid almost nothing for it. I guess I got what I paid for, because the food was barely edible. The Cold Sesame Noodles were just plain noodles--no sauce, and I don't think the Fried Rice was actually fried, but it was inexplicably neon yellow in color. I couldn't even find the chicken in my General Tso's--it was mostly breading and a sweet and sour sauce.

I learned my lesson. Trust me, don't get sucked in by their prices--just say NO to Chopstix!
