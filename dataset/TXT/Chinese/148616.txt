SLH_6FIjptg5BEJbYNld6w Not sure why this is called a noodle house but they didn't serve much noodles. Typical Korean food with some sushi and maki on their menu. We came as a group of six. Since they didn't have a table, they had asked for a couple to move to make one for us. I'm sure the couple wasn't happy about it. Place was plain. Ordered the karaagi and jap chae. Both dish made me question if they really are Korean. The chicken didn't seem to be seasoned other than the flour they used. For the price, the portion was minimal. The jap chae had a lot of soy sauce. Good thing I had a big lunch. I don't think I will ever come back here.
