pv0CUMRAJqOES16AayszlQ My wife and I have come here in the last month since it's the only real Chinese cha Chang tang (HK style cafe)... and to be honest, they are a work in progress. The first visit was simply horrendous. The food was mediocre, the drinks were tasteless and service was slow, however, it was understandable as the owner was the only front line worker and he made the effort to come talk to us and ask for feedback. Each other time we came back, the owner would continue to ask for feedback and we discovered a few good dishes. The fried noodles with bean sprouts and chicken steak with pepper sauce are exceptionally good. On this visit, we tried the vermicelli in pepper and pork belly soup with a side of grilled chicken. The vermicelli is a bit hard but the soup was very peppery and tasty. Again still a work in progress but the waiting staff is nice and accommodating.  We will continue to return because of a mix of convenience and feeling valued as a customer
