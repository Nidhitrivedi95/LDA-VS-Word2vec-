v1vcs-uSAQcjTFsHxS1dug The last few times that I have been there, the food has been horrid.  You ask for suicide hot and get sweet!  Ask for crispy and get it so overcooked that it is chicken jerky.  

We went to go have lunch the other day and noticed that someone new was hanging a lunch special banner and I asked him if it was new owners.  I was told it was.  

Unfortunately, the food is not the same and now I am looking for a new Szechuan place.  Any suggestions?
