OBW5Yw9LVQwe2Bem5oM7ng I had the spring rolls and a spicy general tao dish. It was very good, but a little over priced for what was ordered. However, if you want a nice, elegant , and tranquille  place to eat with a group of people this is the place to go. A lot of food to choose from , just make sure you like asian food!
