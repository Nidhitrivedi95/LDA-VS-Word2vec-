U9aA5H13y7t9xWnoQslV0Q If you are in Las vegas and you don't want to drive to chinatown to eat, and you have won lots of money and want to pay too much for noodles, you might like this place.  But overall, the hand pulled noodles is just OK.  The noodle itself is good but its what goes with the noodles that is just OK.

Though the beef pancakes are good, but thats the only thing I would stop in there to eat.  Everything else I can pass on.
