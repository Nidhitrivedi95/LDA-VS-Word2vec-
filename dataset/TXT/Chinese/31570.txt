9RSgLa87uZTZKdTvxy2qyg The worst PeeWee there is. Order here regularly for lunch at work, but no more.

I'd say conservatively 60% of our orders are screwed up or sub-par in someway. 

Where to start? Salads have had old, smelly fish, contained the parts of lettuce you would typically throw away, have some part of a label from an avocado or pepper mixed in, and some are missing dressing cups. 

Rice bowls have had overcooked rice, almost no meat, dry/old meat or were missing the actual edible parts of vegetables altogether. 

If you're really lucky, you'll end up with someone else's order or parts of their order mixed in and/or substituted for yours. And a few times, just completely missing parts of the order.

We have called almost every time this happens to bring this to the attention of the restaurant. Of course, they want you to come back to swap it out; not happening at noon on Peoria Ave. They have refunded us a few times, but it's not always successful. Got 1 gift card, too. 

However, this is even IF you can get them on the phone. More than a few times, after the phone rings 10 times, we've sat on hold for 10 minutes in slot #1 in the automated queue. Then called back, and had the same thing happen...

This is the only PeiWei like this that I've encountered. We like what they offer, but it's hit or miss whether they will actually deliver the product that every other store has no issue executing correctly. 

There's LOTS of competition around them, and a lot of businesses in the area that will spend a few hundred dollars a week on lunch. I know where my money won't be going anymore...

Sorry, PeeWee, you're out of our lunch rotation for good.
