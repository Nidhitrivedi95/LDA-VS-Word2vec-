JJzAOl3kQLfhOzB_vjf3FQ A previous yelper called this a hidden gem, I think he/ she had a mis-type. Must have meant a "hopeless" eatery.

The interior decor is actually quite nice. But the food must have targeted the native Chinese where their taste buds are different.

I came here on a Saturday morning with my wife for breakfast. We had hot soy milk, beef pancake, a bowl of beef Lamchow noodle soup, salt and pepper peanuts.
The bill came up to $20 which I considered high, given the portion of food they serve you, by about 20%. 

But the bill wasn't the issue. The noodle soup was strange. The daikon was not well cooked. Cilantro and green onions must be relatively inexpensive - they were lots of them. The noodle was not a home made noodle but from a pre-packaged supplier. Really not impressed.

I believe the soy milk was home made. Need tons of sweetener though.

Again beef pancake was filled with cilantro and green onions. The chef must have thought cilantros and green onions are the main stay for this dish. You actually need a magnifying class to find those tiny beef pieces.

The salt and pepper peanuts were very acceptable. The issue is that the portion is very small.

I would give this a 2.5 star. But I can't - so I round it of to a three star eatery. But I won't recommend this.
