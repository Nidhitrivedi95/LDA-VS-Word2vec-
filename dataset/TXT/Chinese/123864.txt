On5sceeptZSlLeGWDDGiwQ I have eaten from this place twice.  The first we picked our order up, and the counter staff was extremely friendly, courteous and what a delight!  The food was very good too.  The second time we placed an order, delivery came much quicker than we imagined.  It arrived in about 20 minutes.  The delivery man was super courteous, the food was clean and with the exception of the egg roll...  The food was even better the second time.

The first time I ordered Sesame Chicken, okay but a bit on the chewy side.  The second time, I ordered the curry chicken.  
Important NOTE:  Their curry chicken is UTTER Perfection!  I mean A-Ma-ZinG!
However their egg rolls are greasy and lack flavor (unless you like the taste of grease and bland cabbage).  Their sweetened iced tea is a bit overpriced for a regular sized drink which they will fill completely up with ice if you don't ask them not to, but it's tasty.
The fried rice is not good, It doesn't have any vegetables or anything else.  Its literally fried rice and that is it, but their lo mein is good.  

Their prices are about average, and the place looks clean enough.  There is parking in the store front parking lot, and there is a lot of seating if you wanted to dine in.
