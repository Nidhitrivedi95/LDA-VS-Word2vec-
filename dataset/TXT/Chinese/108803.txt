LjxuUvIQ-tWNHyGNfJ6UzA I've been to a Chinese buffet or two in my day -- and this one just doesn't stack up.  5 plates of food, and somehow I'm still left wanting ...

The pizza should be the first giveaway that they don't mean business.  Where are potstickers? Where's the calamari salad? That was definitely NOT sushi.

While I can certainly appreciate the food I did over-consume was good-tasting, as fresh as can be for an establishment like this, and visually appealing, frankly, there just wasn't much of selection.

Or I should say, the selection just wasn't what I'm used to.  Maybe I've been spoiled by the Bay Area; maybe I've been spoiled by southeast Tempe; maybe this place just isn't very good.

Bottom line:  if a gutful of Asian food is the plan, China Olive certainly gets the job done -- just don't expect a lot of differentiation in what you shove down your gulet.
