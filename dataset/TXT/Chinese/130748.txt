pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Delicious food and awesome service.

I had the spicy lemongrass ramen, tuna tataki, lamb robata, organic chicken robata, yellowtail tacos, coconut rice, anago nigiri, unagi nigiri, and sao paulo sushi roll.

All of the food were delicious! This place is a fusion of japanese, peruvian, and brazilian. Most of the portion sizes were tapa style,so you gota order several dishes.

The ramen was well flavored with the spices. The noodle itself were ok, but all of the veggies and porkbelly were soaked in the broth, which made them all taste delicious.

I don't have much complaint, maybe I can go without the tacos and chicken robata. You have to try the lamb because it's super tender and well flavored. The portion is slightly bigger, but order more if needed.

Rolls were small, but it's cute and has plenty of fish to rice ratio.

I would come back again!
