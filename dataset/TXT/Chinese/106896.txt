l5NUIeAo6Fk-Vx4nm3Xqfg Terrible Chinese food. Everything except the fried wontons and dipping sauce were blah. Shelf bought microwaveable  food would probably be nicer. I know this is an awful harsh review, but I'm being most honest. True Chinese cuisine tastes amazing is and this place definitely does not tickle the taste buds :-(

Rice and mains portion was very small...especially the rice (maybe 1/2 a cup?).

Service was very attentive and polite.

Price point for lunch specials are great - can't beat $7.95 for soup, wontons and a main!
