HQpMwOOrGND3GaRqMNV9ig I have been coming to this place since I was in high school.  Oh about 21 years ago!  Still the same facade inside and out.  It's nice to know that nothing has changed after all these years.
Hands down some of the best shrimp wontons in town.  If you're on a budget this place takes care of that with some of the lowest price food items of many similar places in the area.

In a rush?  They bring the bowls out as fast as you can say can I get extra napkins?  There is hot water and hot tea at the back counter which you can help yourself to at any time.  One cup limit per guest.  Staff have always been friendly and helpful when you ask them a question.  Looking forward to trying their other food offerings other than the wonton soup with noodle bowls that I always tend to lean towards everytime I come here.

It can get busy at times so my suggestion is to try to arrive just before noon as the nearby office workers are rushing to beat the crowds.  Seating for less than 50 people so it can fill up quick come lunch time.  Note they are always closed on Wednesdays for whatever reason.

Overall a great cheap place to enjoy some Chinese home made cusine!
