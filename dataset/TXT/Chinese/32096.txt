I always order the mongolian chicken (non spicy) and every time it is better than the last. The waiter knows us by now and always takes good care of our order and service is top notch. My family flew in from NJ/NY and we had to take them to this place...they loved it and want to come back during their next trip! Most people from the east coast know good Chinese food so this was a big deal to get their approval.
