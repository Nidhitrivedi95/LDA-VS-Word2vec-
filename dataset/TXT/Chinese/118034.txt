NKHvmp19c6wrm0dZXcLtmQ Love the desserts here because I can't have gluten, dairy or egg which is often in pastry desserts. But think twice about ordering takeout on a weekend--took more than 30 minutes! Unacceptable! The least they could've done was let us know BEFORE ordering. To make matters worse, a waitress actually pushed her body into me as she leaned over the cash desk to place a order slip into a peg. Then, she asked me to go stand by the door!
