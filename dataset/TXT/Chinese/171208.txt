vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I did not expect much when going into the Gold Coast. 

This was definitely an experience I would recommend to everyone.

For starters we had siopao and also ordered West Lake Beef Soup. Wow that a very tasty beef soup loaded with various vegetables. 

I ordered the Cantonese duck. Must say that was the best duck dish I ever had set my mouth into. For $12.95 it was a steal!

My wife had the lamb tenderloin. I've never had lamb tenderloin before this, and was very impressed with the taste & texture of the lamb. Was cooked perfectly. The vegetables mixed in with this dish could not have been a better choice.

For 2 people at dinner, we paid just over $50. Not terrible considering the quality we received.
