OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Yumm!! I love this place! I used to live in vegas for a short time and made this an every sunday event w.my family.....Good assortment of dim sum and it is actually cheaper than most dim sum places, (if it still is) erverytime I come back to visit my sis, I always go here. I recommend coming early though because they often have a line coming out the door, but i really like it. It sure is yummy! The only thing that I thought was kind of bland was the rice porridge, but I can excuse that for the prices lol.
