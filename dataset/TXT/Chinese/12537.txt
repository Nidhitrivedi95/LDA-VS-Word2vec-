2px99IppAcnxR238eq_8_w We went an HOUR before they closed and we walked in the door and you can tell they didn't want to serve us. we were the only people there, and our server before even saying hi goes "they are power washing the kitchen it's going to be about 20 minutes before you meal will even start to be cooked." we said okay and the server kinda rolled her eyes about it. it made me uncomfortable being a server you shouldn't advice them not to stay there. I even said "we can get it to go if you need us to leave early." she said "I'm stuck here with or without you guys" so we ordered and I food came out in about 10 minutes so you knew it was a lie about the kitchen. the food was good. average Chinese food, the manager checked in on us. it was good decor and nice prices. I would go back in hopes on getting different service. that's all. I guess don't go in there and hour before closing lol
