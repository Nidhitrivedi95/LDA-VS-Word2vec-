OnGPegQGuQ5_uuFLvezvKw I had Shun Lee years ago and just went back recently--I had the vegetable fried rice and my boyfriend had the tofu. I assumed he like his; he ate it all.  The fried rice was as expected, so I have no complaints.  It's a hop from my house so I may just go back a little more often.  It's back in the cut, so you gotta make sure you turn onto Colwick and it's all the way in the back past the Krispy Kreme and Domino's.
