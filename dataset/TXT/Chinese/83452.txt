hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA The buffet was good and the service was good. There was a good selection of food for a Chinese buffet. It is what it is plain and simple. The reason I'm giving 3 stars however is because the most crucial thing for me is that they did not have there food warmers turned up. So the food was barely warm. It just wasn't warm enough for me to eat. Also the price for 2 adults came out to 31.00 approximately. They do not include the cost of drinks. No free refills.
