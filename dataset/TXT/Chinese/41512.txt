Service was not that great.  The place was half full and we asked for a booth, which they said they couldn't give us because we were only 2 people.  Meanwhile, there were 2 people sitting at a booth.  Double standards much?  Halfway through eating our meals, there was another party of 2 who got seated in a booth. 

The food was mediocre.  Food lacked flavour and most of all, some stuff lacked freshness - some meat appeared to be overcooked too.  The bubble tea was nothing that popped out.  

The ambiance is dark...very dark.  It's like they're trying to make it like a dine in the experience or something mystique?  I don't know what they're trying to do actually.  

Nothing really worth going to as there is lots of really good Taiwanese places elsewhere in the city!
