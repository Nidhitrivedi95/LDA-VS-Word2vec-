_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA One of the better Asian food options on the Strip. For a restaurant on the strip in the Venetian, it's not that expensive... (of course if you compare it with the food in like Chinatown, it's pricey)

Get the beef noodle soup! Highly recommended by everyone. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Service is great. FOOD COMES OUT FAST.
