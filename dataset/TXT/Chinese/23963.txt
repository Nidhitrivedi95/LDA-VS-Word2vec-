6z-T_jIFrRQ4c6-BIvVBvA First time coming to this congee location and they definitely exceeded my expectations. The service was great! The staff had proper manners, good timing, and our food were served quite fast yet everything was cooked well! My favourite dish that we ordered was the roasted duck; well-cooked and tasted so yummy! I also really enjoy their sizzling dishes, especially the sizzling beef with ginger and green onions.

Exceptional experience here on any day or night and whatever the occasion may be. 
Definitely coming here more often!
