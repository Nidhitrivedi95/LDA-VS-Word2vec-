CbsS6VvPsIvpytUbLAu71Q The best food bargain in Cleveland!  The $4.99 lunch buffet Monday thru Saturday is a gustatory treasure.  I've found the roast beef occasionally wonderful, but sometimes merely good.  AYCE boiled shrimp are certainly a good deal, but remember to pick up a wedge or two of lemon if you use it.  I love the crunchiness of the Sesame Chicken, perhaps caused by overcooking, and they pack more filling in the Crab Rangoon than any place I know of.  Six flavors of ice cream are daily goodies (ask my wife, who insists on coffee flavor and peach), but stay away from the dried-out mini-eclairs and such.  Not the best Asian food; just the best for the money!
