mHV6YRI_KWIUsVtI4qXJkg Ordered from here instead of our regular place because it was easy to order off of Just Eat. We ordered many dishes and it was incredibly bland. The only dish we all seemed to enjoyed was the Sesame Chicken all else was a bust. Nothing tasted like it really should, was off, and just lacked. It was fine but never again. They gave us free egg rolls which was nice but not enough to make up for the other plain dishes. The other review is incredibly accurate and reiterates how we all felt about our many dishes.
