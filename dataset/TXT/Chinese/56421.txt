the place is welcoming..
bright and clean! kitchen is kept clean as well.. 
waitresses are very friendly and attentive..

the prices are off the hook and they hook it up with the portions.
we had the family combo which was only 29 bucks or something.. 
came with two choice entrees.. 
we had orange chicken & peppered steak
also included: appetizers & won ton soup

was totally enough for 4.. and some. 
had it the next day for lunch.. 
and it was just as awesome as the night before..

we're definitely going to switch up our delivery choice.

double plus: 
1. they sell boba
2. tutti bella is right next door!
