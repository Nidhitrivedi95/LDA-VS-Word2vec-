U4OLUFb9VxMmpMXm1ZF-cQ I used to frequent a popular pho spot in CenPho (see what I did there?) and put up with borderline abuse disguised as service for mediocre food.  I recently moved to Chandler and was desperate for a pho fix.  Saw this place while shopping nearby and decided to give it a try.  It's now in my regular weekly rotation!

My wife and I have always ordered the same thing, regular plain pho and it is consistently delicious and super fresh.  We usually get it to go and it's packaged better than most Amazon shipments I've received - all of the veggies (sprouts, cilantro, onions) are in separate containers, along with the hoisin/sriracha mixture that makes the broth so delicious.

The place is ALWAYS packed and the clientele is super diverse.  Service is quick, efficient and friendly.  I've never seen a single employee who wasn't hustling.

Worth a visit for dining in or tasty take-out!
