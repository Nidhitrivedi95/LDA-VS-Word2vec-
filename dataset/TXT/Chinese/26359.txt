This place was recommended to me by a wealthy friend who is from Shanghai and he said the food there is very authentic, lives in the area and goes all the time.

Came here for dinner, we didn't have RSVP so we had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table of 3.

We didn't go with their set combo but saw that most of the tables did.

Instead we order soup noodles and dumplings.  The dumplings were good, the wrapper for the dumplings was thin and the inside was tasty.  They have 4 different types of soup filled steamed dumplings on the menu.  The first order is $2 to $3 for a set of 5 dumplings depending which one you choose from.  The re-order is regular price at $5 to $6 which is average price.  So tried all 4 different sets and it only costed $12! Amazing deal!!

The soup noodles was good too, the soup base had flavour and didn't have a lot of MSG and was $6.99 a bowl.

Dinner for 3 was less then $50 for dine-in including tip!!

4 stars because the food was good and the price was cheap.
