hf761YTEXm0B1GdtGHGGYQ Just opened and my husband and I had lunch there yesterday. Great shrimp Pad Thai, tasty and spicy chicken Panang Curry, and the hot and sour soup was a bit thick but very good. Staff was warm and welcoming. We will go back. Not too pricey, $20 for two lunch specials (including warm and crunchy egg roll) and tea. Clean, nicely decorated and comfortable.
