fGrE4Om-cTh_JgQC42qx9A Okay, I have to write this review. Because this would be the 3-4th time that I come here about 40 minutes before closing. The staff is totally unprofessional. It's always the same story; I order something... and they are out. Their excuse is that because they are getting ready to close. And they won't even try to make it. I would understand if it was 15-10 minutes before closing. Bad customer service.
