osngclad-cS05yDq9CXPOA I ordered delivery from here and the food was pretty disappointing. I must say however, that the delivery driver was very prompt and polite. I ordered a 3 item combo, the egg flower soup, egg rolls, and pot stickers. The sautéed veggies were extremely salty to where I could only eat a couple of bites. The spicy chicken was pretty much a bunch of jalapeños with only a few tiny pieces of chicken. The orange chicken was decent, but definitely not great. The chow mein was blah. The egg flower soup had a weird taste to it. The pot stickers and egg rolls were just okay. I don't think I'll be ordering from here again as I have a lot better Chinese options in the area.
