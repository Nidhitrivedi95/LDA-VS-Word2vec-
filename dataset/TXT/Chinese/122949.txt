OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw Stoked to find this place in Vegas!  Came here on a Sunday and it definitely hit the spot.  This place pumps business but we were seated right away.  My boyfriend and I stuffed ourselves with a bill less than $25! Definitely a great dim sum find!  I will come back on my next Vegas trip!
