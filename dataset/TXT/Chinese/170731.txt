vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA There's always a long wait.  Expect 30min to 1hr wait on Sunday. The shiu mai, spring rolls are great.  The desserts were awesome.  I come there mainly for the buns with sweet yellow egg custard inside.  The sweet rice wrapped inside banana leaf was also our favorite.
Customer service was not good.  The servers always rush in and out.  When we want something they always act as if they cannot help us and we have to wait for the right  food carts to come.  It was frustrating.
Even though I hate to come here because the service sucks, it is still among one og the best place for dim sum when we have a craving for it.  So we stop by maybe once a year.
