Pu7GTgTzdjbxAhr8A73zGA We went to lunch at Ming's on 7/24/12.....4 total in our group.  We have been here as a group on a few occasions.  Today's service was at best BAD.  One in our group wanted a salad and to put Shrimp on top...told "No, you order from box menu".  That happened and our food was brought out.  The server kept his attitude (this is the same server we have had on several different occasions.).  He slammed food on the table, he did refill drinks though!  At the end, all the meals were placed on one bill...simple (Thanks boss!).  His service was at best BAD.  He was only tipped 10% for his service.  This guy had the guts to come back to the table, tell her that she only tipped 10% and to put more on the tip!  Wow.....words were exchanged and he walked off.  Never in my life have I seen that done.......STAY AWAY from this joint!
