Yid1IWRGWJw1qIHPsmUXaQ I enjoyed a take away meal from this location on the recommendation of the internet. We got a wide selection and most was great. A few things didn't travel home as well as others. Some highlights were the giant steamed prawns with garlic on the specials menu. The salt and chili chicken was tasty as was the chow mein and sweet and sour chicken. The special fried rice wasn't my favorite, nor were the veggie spring rolls, which I think would have been better in the restaurant, instead of take away. People were absolutely lovely. Would go back again!
