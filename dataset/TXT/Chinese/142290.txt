The 13 spices sauce was mostly salt because it was super SALTY. The fried pork belly tasted like popcorn chicken. The sauce wasn't spicy or anything. Basically just like soy sauce. The rice dishes were basically rice, 4 crawfish, and a couple of fried pork belly for almost 20 dollars. I was gonna said the service is ok but at the end of everything, they decided to say that it was CASH ONLY. Like thank god the 6 of us had cash or else what would we have done? There was no sign or them telling us that prior to us ordering. Then when I did give them cash, they gave me back 3.75 in coins only because they have no other change. Then they couldn't count 3.75 and I was shorted a dollar. Honestly, it was a terrible experience here. Would never come back.
