iddR-Z7pwpp90Cu8SFJ3QA This place has consistently served up great tasting fresh food at reasonable prices. The other Chinese restaurants in Mississauga really cannot compete with this place. I have noticed the staff at this place has been here virtually since the place opened and I know why.....they know the patrons and they know how to serve them. Simple as that. This place is euthentic!
