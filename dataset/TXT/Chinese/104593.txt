kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ Great Chinese place.   Took our order quick,  came out quick,  was presented nicely and tasted amazing!   One small thing that I didn't enjoy is the hour after I was done eating I could feel my heart racing from the saltiness of the food.   I guess you have to expect that from most Chinese places but if I find one that isn't salty and tastes like this place,  it will be a 5 all day!
