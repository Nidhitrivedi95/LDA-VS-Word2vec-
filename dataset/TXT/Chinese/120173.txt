O_J5e6aoskxhGx8meOm1Og Food was typical Chinese food.
WORST SERVICE  in east valley. I mean really worst.
The owner and the Server discriminates customers.
They seems to choose the table they want to serve and forget the rest of the customers.
If you want their food, try delivery.
I will not go back there,so does all my friends who were there with me.
Oh, also they charged $1.00 extra for couple of lettuce that I asked for lettuce wrap.
(lettuce wrap came with only 4 little pieces of lettuce ,I needed more)
No other restaurant I've been charged extra dollar for a couple of lettuce.

I don't understand why my review is not listed.
average food, worst services!!
