RJnikmkw2aW4gF2zcmxfvQ We can't help but go to this hole in the wall in Malton.  Why am I in Malton you ask?  I was wondering that myself.  Ah, just can't get away from it?  But if you are in the neighbourhood and want some super greasy Hakka food then this is your choice.  It's cheap as heck and the oil, chillies, and MSG go down nice and easy.
