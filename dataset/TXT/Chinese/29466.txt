9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw Prior to heading home from Vegas I decided to try out The Red Pot.  This is one of a handful of hot pot restaurants in Vegas and as we all know, Vegas is a town known for good buffets.  The inside had an upscale feel to it.  Also the setup for the different meats, noodles and veggies was unique.  You have an option to pick one or two broths for cooking.  I chose Spicy Mongolian Herb and the Premium Seaweed.  The quality of the food was similiar to your regular Chinese buffet.  However this place had various types of veggies like lotus root, black fungus, and bamboo.  As far as meats go there was octopus, filet of sole, salmon, mussels, clams and lamb shoulder.  The broth was decent but not mindblowing.  I did inform the server that I was dining there for the first time.  Despite giving me a discount for trying them out, they charged me $5 extra since I was eating there alone.  The Red Pot also offers free unlimited soda refills on those thirsty days.  The Red Pot is a hit or miss even for locals.  If you are from California I would stick to the Vegas buffets or wait until crossing the state line for better hot pot.
