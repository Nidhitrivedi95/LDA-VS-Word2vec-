WfgupKdYx1h0mKBmOmNQ3g We'll figure I would update my review.  Taste of China is a great place to bring kids even on a Friday night.   The orange chicken is very tasty and the white rice compliments it nicely.  I recommend dining in and ordering a Pepsi.  The soda is nice way to wash down your meal.  For the money the food and service is excellent, the secret is to Dine In for the best experience!
