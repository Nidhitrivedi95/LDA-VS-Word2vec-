XUIr1V4H5NUesEgeHGrQVw I met Dr. Leigh Lewis a few years ago in Portland, Or.  So thrilled that we have both ended up in the Phoenix area.  If you want an experience that is different from the typical doctor's office - just another number/person, then give her a try.  She will take the time to get to know you and care for you and is so accessible.  She has helped me with my menopausal issues and I have had acupuncture with her too.  I now use Dr. Lewis as my primary care doctor.
