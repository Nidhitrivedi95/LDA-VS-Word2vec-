ZuNJelvkJD4wsXNBRg6t5w This will be a short and sweet review. 

Go with the basics. Sweet and Sour Chicken, Pad Thai. Those are ok. 

I have tried the following and don't recommend them. 

Tom Yum soup. Shrimp was way over cooked and also I know what shrimp should smell like and the soup smelled a little too fishy which means they weren't so fresh. It's a very basic soup not enough mushrooms, or other ingredients. They were very scarce. And super spicy doesn't mean flavorful! Just like putting in a ton of salt doesn't make it taste better. 

General tsaos chicken... Made me sick 



I hate that this place is the okayest in the area. We need better options. 

I also hate that they nickel and dime you here.
