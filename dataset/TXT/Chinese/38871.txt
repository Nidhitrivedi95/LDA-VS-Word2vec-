AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I decided to check this place out after some of the other reviews. I trust my fellow yelper and decided to give this place a try. I ordered the lunch special,General Tso Chicken and spring roll. The chicken was crispy and the sauce was delicious.The spring rolls were excellent. Service was good and the environment was very inviting.

 I will be heading back to this place for sure. If you haven't eaten here yet I suggest you give it a try.
