AYr2URtjoQ8Toh8_Jr4G6A I only come here when I'm closer to this one than the other Rose Tea Cafe in Squirrel Hill. If it was not for the location, I would never come here. 

The service is awful even when there are barely any other customers. The main owner, a middle aged man who is always there during the day, will take his sweet time to wash dishes when there is a line of people waiting to go. I understand you need to get to the dishes and other tasks but where are your priorities? I've worked in the food and retail industry before and if I saw a customer waiting, I would take off my gloves and go help her. The owner even had the audacity to snatch the money out of my hand and throw my change on the counter. Oh, did I mention he will obviously glare at you if you ask one of his servers to help you since he's taking freaking forever! This isn't the first time it has happened. I've been here three times and on all occasions the same guy had the nastiest attitude. 

Second, we ran into a couple of my boyfriend's colleagues at this cafe and they were not allowed to dine in because the only table available was a three-seater not a two-seater even though it was super tiny. The owner was planning on squeezing three people at that tiny table? how? I'm petite and I even felt uncomfortable thinking about how cramped I would be with two other people. After some haggling, they were able to sit down. How cheap and transparent can they be? 

The only good thing about this place is the boba/pearl drinks are consistent with their other location.
