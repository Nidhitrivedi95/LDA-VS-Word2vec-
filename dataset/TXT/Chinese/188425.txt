yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I came here on a weekend after attending EDC. We were a group of 7 very hungry people. All 6 of my friends I came with are Vietnamese. The service was good, but the food was awful. I mean awful. All of us agreed that this was the worst pho we've tasted. It just tasted like canned broth with too much salt. Don't come here. Save your money.
