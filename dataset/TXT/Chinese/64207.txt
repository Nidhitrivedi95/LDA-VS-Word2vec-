E6tGAYZ2J1EIwCDHtVI1yg In our opinion this is the best Chinese takeout in town!! While we do love dining in also it is nice to have hot fresh food delivered in a timely manner right to the house and this place hits its mark! Some of the best Chinese and being from the Bay Area we have tried a lot of different places. We enjoy the Mango Shrimp, Lemongrass Soup, Pineapple Fried Rice & all the standard dishes we have tried. Very fresh and always such great customer service! Thanks again!
