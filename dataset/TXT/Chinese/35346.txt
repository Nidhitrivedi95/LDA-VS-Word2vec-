ae95XSsD37OQfOWF92GjNQ Been here 2x over the past two years and pretty much a standard Chinese and Japanese buffet spread. Typical
Chinese entrees, a sushi and sashimi station, grilled meats and dessert area. Station serving Peking duck on wrap paper was always busy! Spacious dining areas with interesting decor. Price on upper range of buffet pricing. Not a bad meal but nothing outstanding either.
