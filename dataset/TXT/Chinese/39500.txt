AVLj5MSJD1si-Rl6X6qTXQ There's a reason this is rated the top dim sum restaurant in downtown on BlogTO. Not quite high end, not quite a hole-in-the-wall typical Chinatown dim sum, but quality food! It's become a ritual for my ex-coworkers and myself to meet up here for lunch every once in a while. Oh man does this place get busy though! The most recent time we went, we went on a Sunday around lunch time and it was a 45-minute wait for a table of 3! To help save time, they ask you if you would be willing to share a table with another small party. We said no, but a lot of other people usually say yes.

When we finally got a table, we were waiting on our 3rd guest to arrive (yes, he was over 45 minutes late). The 2 of us got seated first and we decided to order for him because he said he was about 10-15 minutes away. When we gave our order sheet to one of the waitresses, she told us we should have continued to wait for a table since our friend didn't show up yet. It's true, but it was a little rude since we had waited our turn for a table. Anyways, our 3rd coworker finally showed up and we indulged in some delicious food! The owner came by a few times to either refill our tea or deliver the food, and he apologized for what the waitress said earlier. Such a sweet man! He made jokes, always made sure we were doing alright, and was always smiling.

Tea per person is $.80 and I would take advantage of the dim sum special if you can - $2.40 per dish on Monday-Friday between 9am and 4pm. They even have AYCE dim sum for dinner! I remember there being a minimum order of $20 if you wanted to pay a bill by debit, so either bring cash or put it all on 1 bill and split the difference later. Will definitely be back soon!
