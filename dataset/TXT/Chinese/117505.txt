NF6di6YcQxN0rDAleE7SyQ Ten Ren is a good place for me to hang out with my friends. I like to go during weekdays when they do not restrict you to use your computer. during the weekend, they won't let you stay too long with your computer. Their drinks are awesome. Mango Slush less sweeten is my all time favourite.
