6MhY_9EkUkKCvvN8rzXZzg Ok - so I used to live minutes from china town in NYC...  so I'm perhaps a little spoiled.  I realize that.   I still have not found a Chinese food place here in phoenix that I'm crazy about...I'm pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm not gonna.
That being said... this is by far the *worst* Chinese I've had here so far.
They are right around the corner from where i live so i decided to give it a try for take out one night...
they got our order wrong, it took forever, and it was completely flavorless...  I had a few bites and lost my appetite. 
Maybe I ordered the wrong things...  maybe I was there on an off night...  
who knows.  But as far as I'm concerned - Vegetable lo mien shouldn't be that difficult to get right.  My boyfriends meal (forget what he got) was no better.  
I won't be going back.  Its a real shame too since the location is ideal for me....
