zG3GJiIrF01bwgP0tQdkZg This restaurant was nice and clean and the hostess was friendly.  My waitress was obviously frazzled or frustrated or what have you, but was friendly enough when I asked questions.
As far as Chinese food goes, it was good.  I thought the Gyoza (fried dumpling appetizer) was actually pretty good.  
The water and green tea had an odd flavor to it, so I didn't drink much during my meal which was inconvenient.
I ordered the peach schnapps chicken with no spice which ended up being fine, just nothing special. Didn't taste any peachiness. Just a basic breaded chicken dish at any chinese place. My major complaint actually is that the chicken pieces are small so you're really getting way too much breading and little chicken. Portion size is fine though.
Bottom line: Ok, standard food. I'd try it again and get something else but I'm not in any hurry to get back there. I'll be seeing what else is around before I go back.
