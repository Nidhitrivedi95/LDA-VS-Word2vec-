VKmGedwOk-16D7OawNg_ng We have a NEW Champion!!

This place was recommended for its sushi by a bus driver that I have come to know and HE NAILED IT!! A good sign I was in the right place was the amount of local Asians eating there.

After eating Cali Rolls for months on end and NOT eating any for 2 months or so, I was "Jonesing" for a fix and this place fixed me up good. They had a wide variety of rolls including spicy tuna, shrimp, eel, as well as rolls wt the orange fish eggs & various rolls wt spicy sauce. All were fresh and very good. The wasabi was kicking as well.

 Other stations offered your basic chinese fare such as brocoli & beef, whole fried shrimp, baked mussels wt cheese, Lo Mein, Fried Rice, sauted green beans, spring rolls etc.

There was also a station wt a chef to cook items to order & Tempura broccoli, sweet potatoes etc. And the price was right = $7.56 total. The desert offerings seemed kind of pedestrian & I grabbed a little muffin of some sort to eat on my walk afterwards & it was pretty good.

The location for me is kind of "off the beaten path" but well worth a return trip and #1 as far as all the buffets I have been to yet for the variety that included sushi.

I highly recommend it for Lunch.
