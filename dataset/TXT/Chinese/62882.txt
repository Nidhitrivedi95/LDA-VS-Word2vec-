DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg Finally decided to let my husband take me here since I found out they offer vegetarian subtitutions. Hubby got the small chicken Mongolian brown rice bowl (they made a mistake and made him beef but no big deal) and I got a small tofu pei wei (supposed to be a sweet spicy sauce) quinoa  (+$.99) bowl. Overall the food were tasty but were honestly drowning in their sauces. Those were the drawbacks that made me not give this place a 5 stars. But service was good and the atmosphere was nice (better than Panda Express). Affordable tasty splurge food. Yes splurge food because that much sauce on a bowl is not healthy. Will come back again but would definitely ask for only a fourth of the amount of the sauce, hopefully they'd do it. Being Asian, I wouldn't get or advice getting noodles here though. Go to an authentic Asian restaurant for that...but thumbs up on the Thai / Sambal style chilli sauce on the side PW.
