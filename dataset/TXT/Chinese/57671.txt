D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA Horrible food. Horrible service. Disgusting atmosphere. Don't come here. Save yourself the trouble and go down the street anywhere else. Do not get the chicken ginger rice. The chicken is served cold and the rice is hard and old. Steamed veggies are filled with oil. The chicken noodle spicy was not spicy at all. It was just salty ramen packets. The wonton soup was served cold. If we were not all starving we wouldn't have are a single thing. Half the food was sent back. Avoid this place. Slow service.
