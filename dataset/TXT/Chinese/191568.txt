Baseline is a changing from our living there 20 years ago. Most of the businesses have changed or been replaced with new buildings and businesses.along Baseline. 
This place had a vibe look to it and after our business in Tempe i pulled into Flo's for lunch. It was a very open floor, many tables inside and a nice patio outside with hanging wired lights which gives a feeling of fun. Of course it was lunch and no need for lights but the patio was clean and had a modern look. Have to go back some evening and enjoy  the ambiance with the great food. 
Back to lunch. It took us a little extra time deciding as it was our first time eating there. I coped out and went easy ordering the Chicken teriyaki and a app of pot stickers. My wife had so curry something. It looked and tasted good. I enjoyed my meal and the service was more than excellent. 
As Arnold says, I'll b bac
