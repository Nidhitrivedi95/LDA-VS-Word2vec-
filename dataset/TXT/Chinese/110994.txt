M-rqZ56wTGSNoIIsBSlhDA At the end of the day, HK style cafes (and that's applying to all of them) should have a breakfast menu. Oatmeal, egg sandwiches, ham + macaroni plus a tea/coffee combo. And sadly, this particular cafe does not, which really disappoints.

I was here at 10:30am with the fam and looking forward to a cheap breakfast. Alas, we had an early, cheap lunch instead. I had the daily special - baked pork chop on fried rice ($7.95) - I have a sneaking suspicion that it was not actually baked, but merely cooked. It was aighhttt, good portion of it.

Also tried the baked fish filet with cream sauce on fried rice ($7.95). Now this one was quite good! Despite, again, not being baked. 

Overall, a good deal to be quite filled, especially since it comes with drinks too.
