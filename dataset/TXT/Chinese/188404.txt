yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I actually wanted to give this place two stars because I really don't care for it, but I realize it's a popular place and there must be good reason for that. It may be that I just don't care much for pho in general, so I'm hard to please when it comes to the subject. 

Based on the outrageous line that exists nearly every time I've been there, be it 8pm or 4am, this is a definitely a hot spot in town. Fortunately, there were only two of us so we were sat quickly. The hostess seemed annoyed at the amount of ppl waiting for tables and was just wanting to get everyone out of the waiting area, so she barely made eye contact, and a smile was entirely out of the question. 

The server possessed the same quality of indifference toward us. I realize this place is probably quantity-driven versus quality-driven, so I tried not to let the poor service bother me too much. He only came by when it was time to order, and we had to flag him down for a refill on soda. Honestly, the "water-refill guy" was more attentive than our server. 

The food was mediocre, but again, that could be because I don't have much of an affinity for pho. The broth was pretty bland, so I found myself continuously adding to it throughout the meal. Even though I ordered my pho with rare steak, I only had about 3 pieces of meat in my entire bowl. Incredibly disappointing. I will say the shrimp and pork spring rolls we had as an appetizer were delicious, however. Better than the soup, in my opinion. 

It took awhile for us to get our credit card slips back after giving them to the server to pay. A tad annoying since we were in a hurry. 

Overall, I don't plan on returning here anytime soon, BUT if you are a pho lover who doesn't mind bad service and are just there for the food, this might be the place for you! Again, I know it's one of the most popular places in the city, and there must be a reason for that, right?
