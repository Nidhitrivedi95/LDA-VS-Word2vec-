JJi7c7uiTzCqeWNTsldgXQ I've been wanting to try this place, nestled in the Virginia Manor shopping center...but I'm also really lazy on Sunday nights. The convenience of ordering delivery online through Yelp has just changed my life! How amazingly easy and convenient!  They send an email with the status of your order so you know it was placed, and I was pleasantly surprised when my food came even faster. 

We ordered basic Chinese takeout items, 2 vegetable fried rices, chicken and broccoli, and vegetable steamed dumplings. Everything (including price) was exactly what you want from Chinese takeout! The portions were huge, easily having a couple lunches out of it. The chicken and broccoli was just perfect. Fried rice was tasty too! The dumplings were good, they weren't that hot but also I think I prefer egg rolls. Anyway, we will definitely be ordering (through Yelp!) again in the future!
