dvbcUnKv2awsIxog7dO4vw Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty packed. Good thing we came before the crowd as we saw tons of people come after us waiting for table.  This place won't "wow" you with its decor.  It has this weird swinging door to divide the washroom which reminds me of the saloon doors from the old times.  haha. 

Food speaks volume and I can see why this place is rated highly on the yelp community.  They have daily special for $6.95 which includes soup and hot frink ($1 more for cold) There were 3 choices today - Steak in peppercorn sauce with rice or spaghetti.  I got the Baked Porkchop with Tomato sauce on rice/spaghetti and the last option was the Portugal chicken on rice/ spaghetti which my wife got  Both dishes were good and the porckhop was pre-chopped up and crispy.  We ordered 2 cold drinks - cold lemon tea and cold ice milk tea.  

Overall, I will need to try this place again especially for the afternoon tea time 2-5pm.
