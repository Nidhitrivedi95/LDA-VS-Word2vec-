2KOXNZVoxpcwen_JmIQdfA My family are pretty much regulars here. This location is probably one of the better ones in terms of service/quality. This place is pretty much an all-arounder, they obviously specialize in Pho, but their Rice/Vermicelli/etc dishes are pretty good too. 

The family dinners (We normally get the Dinner for 4) are a combination of super good dishes and the Sour soup (Canh Chua) is lovely! Of the numbers of places we try it, this location makes this soup very well. The staple dish, Pho is almost always on point - it has it's off days, ie. slightly overcooked noodles, etc. 

As for service, let's remember that this is an Asian setting. Most Asian places don't focus nor care about service, not unless is geared towards the more upper-class (and prices too, duh). There will be times/days where you will feel the service is meh in comparison to N. American-styled places especially during rushes, that's common almost anywhere. But on off-peak times, I noticed the employees really try to interact and serve to the best of their ability. English is obviously not their first language, but they really make an effort to be friendly, etc.
