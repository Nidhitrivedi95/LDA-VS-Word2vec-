Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg The service was great and the wait was pretty fast. I ordered a glass of SA Prum Riesling and the Ahi tuna salad. I love the wine and the service was friendly and quick. The salad was lacking flavor with a huge amount of lettuce. I thought it was just ok. I prefer the ahi tuna salad at the Yard House. I wish I had ordered the spicy shrimp appetizer instead it's one of my favorites instead I was trying to be healthy and the meal was a bit boring.
