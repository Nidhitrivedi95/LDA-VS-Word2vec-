773ovbZW7HvfaNy5laUznQ Definitely one of the better options in the Gastonia/Belmont area...we really enjoy the sushi. Some of the best around. I like the chicken pad thai, which is filling but not terribly spicy. The sparerib appetizer and gyoza (fried dumplings) are awesome! Chicken basil dish is wonderful...and my teen son discovered there's enough to top a package of Ramen the next day for leftovers!

Great staff, nice location. Definitely drop by!
