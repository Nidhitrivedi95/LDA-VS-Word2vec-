J_btDyZbIv0hZNjrw56zlA I was craving Chinese Fried Rice so we stopped in to New Sky at ~3pm on a Saturday afternoon.  The Chicken Fried Rice was OK (bit bland), the Sizzling Chili Chicken Hot Plate good (interesting crispy chip-like noodles as a base)  and the Calamari was excellent (very tasty). Service was above average.  Wait for food was slightly longer than normal but it was a lazy afternoon for all. I'm still searching for a good Chinese Fried Rice but hear that Swatow Restaurant should be my next stop.
