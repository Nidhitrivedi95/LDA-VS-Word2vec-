I don't want to give it one star, but there's not an option for NO STARS on here. This place is CRAP.

It's located in Chinatown about 10 minutes away from the Las Vegas strip. My family and I entered and waited to be seated. We waited for about 5 minutes. The joint was pretty empty except for two tables. We really shouldn't be waiting that long since there is a hostess stand, but the hostess was no where to be found. Weird...

Anyways, we were seated and were immediately asked in Mandarin what we wanted. My mom asked them to speak in English and the waitress said, "What do you want?". Rude much. We ordered and our food came 10 minutes later.

What we found most surprising? Charging for rice. We're Chinese and we frequent Chinese restaurants a lot and it's always complimentary rice whenever you order a dish. We ordered roast duck, soup, beef and broccoli, and the beef chow fun. We asked for rice and they gave us two small bowls and there's five grown adults here. I see other tables had the large red containers of rice while we didn't. 

When we got the check, they added 18% to 20% gratuity even though we were not a table of six. On their menu, it says they add in gratuity for tables six or more. We didn't want to tip at all, but they already included it. 

Don't dine here unless you want to be mistreated. There are numerous plazas and restaurants (pho/Vietnamese, Japanese, etc) surrounding this crappy place.  The service sucks as the servers are lazy and give you attitude if you try to get their attention. Also, PLEASE speak Chinese to them if you MUST dine here. My mother made the mistake of NOT speaking Chinese which I think made them believe we weren't Chinese and thus, gave us bad service.
