AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I'm a new vegetarian and love love love this place!! It's perfect for vegans as well. I liked it because the first time I went I was transitioning and felt like I was cheating but we wernt!  You have go get the general T's chicken.  It's probably the best thing that will happen to u. We also got the spring rolls, roti app (OMG bomb!) Pad thai, tofu dishes,and much more. So so so gooood!!!!!!!!
