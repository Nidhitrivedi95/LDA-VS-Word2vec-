-06-Fdi30wJx-JA8P7CAng New to the area, my wife and I have been searching for a go-to Chinese restaurant. We were in the Avon area for a doctor appointment and noticed the restaurant as we were traveling to another destination. 

Located in a small strip mall, the restaurant is less than impressive. In fact, it resembles more of a takeout place than dine in. The restaurant is spartan and seats only about 12 people. 

The menu is typical of a Chinese restaurant. There is a luncheon selection that offered about 10 or so items, priced around $5. My wife ordered chicken chow mein and I ordered Kung Pao chicken. Both were ample servings. The food was served hot and both meals tasted great. The meals were served on styrofoam plates and with plastic cutlery. 

Good food at a great value! You can't go wrong.

Unfortunately, the restaurant is located a bit too far from our hometown to consider as a regular take out restaurant (which is what I would recommend).
