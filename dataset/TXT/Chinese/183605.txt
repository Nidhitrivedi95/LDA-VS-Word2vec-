XqPMOwrJ0xjphyNQYcoPLg A decent place to come if you're looking to feed a hungry hoard fast, this bare bones diner is known for serving monstrously large portions.  The food itself is satisfactory and the menu selection consists of the usual Chinese fare, but there are better options to be had out east in Scarborough or in the surrounding neighbourhoods.  Newbies to Chinese cuisine may enjoy the food, but don't bother if you've got a choosy palate. 

If you're scratching your head over lunch for Monday, bring a food container here on Sunday night; chances are you will need to take-out. As a bonus, Toronto Vegetarian Association cardholds get 10% off.
