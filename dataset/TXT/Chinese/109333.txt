LnYkQ2Hjm-klqYJVgZ1cEQ I think there are only two words to describe what is Sakura, value & chaos. Sakura is located in a tiny little spot in the middle of the 5th Street Arcade downtown. I love the location because of the small shop atmosphere  in the Arcade and the wide mix of people who frequent the building, plus it's close to my work. Sakura is in the tiny "food court" of the building and is really a gem. I bring up "Chaos" to describe Sakura because that's what your experience is like when waiting in line for your food. 3 ethnic Asian guys are running the place, 1 cooking, 1 preparing to go boxes and the other guy taking orders and grabbing drinks. The typical person comes here for the "hibachi" style meal of Chicken, Steak, Shrimp or Veggie Teriyaki. The prices are wonderful ranging from $5.99 to $6.75 for an entrée. They do serve sushi and combo meals but I tend to stick with one of the main four.
 
The line is always a pain in the butt at lunchtime (I have been there a handful of times between 12 and 130) and it is always busy during these times. You wait and once your order is taken it is almost becomes a no holds bar death match to get in another line and fight for your food. I've seen it look like a Royal Rumble on one particular occasion. Eventually someone will get you your food but sometimes it is a struggle.
 
The food though! You get a fresh protein with a heaping side of white or fried rice and veggies (lots of onions, zucchini and mushrooms). Oh and that YUM YUM sauce to add really makes this meal fantastic and filling. Don't get me wrong it's not better than say a top hibachi place but for $5.99 how the hell can you beat that. What can I say I enjoy the food, the line is a pain but well worth in my opinion the best VALUE lunch spot downtown.
