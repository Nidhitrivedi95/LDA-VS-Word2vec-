1CeWMRJwyFkQ-fc3MR1Dmg Normally I really like this place... good flavors and good value. I was there recently and it was busy so I got take out.  my MSI complaint is with the city beef brisket on rice.  there were about 5 pieces of meat but only 1 was really meat... the other 4 were fat... not fat and meat but just fat and silver skin.  if this were my first meal with them they would have given 1 star... but I know they are usually better. Please consider trimming the fat a little more before cooking.
