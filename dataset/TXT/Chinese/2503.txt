_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg Egads! We have been waiting for a good time to try Hibachi Grill Super Buffet, hoping to experience a new and tasty oriental buffet. We walked in tonight and were amazed at the huge number of buffet tables, Wow I though this is going to be good...

Problem is that this is not an oriental buffet. It is a buffet with some oriental style food like products displayed upon luke warm to cool buffet tables. Nothing, not one single thing had the look, feel or flavour of real food.

I know that buffet restaurants are designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator, but this place is working hard at reaching a new low and it's not even very inexpensive; 2 dinners and 2 sodas was $27.00!!! For this sort of money I can find real food all over this valley.

Do your self a favour, eat someplace else.

(Oh by the way; in Arizona in the middle of summer a restaurant really needs to have AIR CONDITIONING!! Not big groups of fans! Hibatchi Grill Super Buffet is NOT worth your time or money.)
