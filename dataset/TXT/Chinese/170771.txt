It's important to let the hostess know how many people there is in your party. For drinks, they provide complimentary tap water. However, there's a flat fee per person for a pot of Chinese Restaurant Tea. The dim sum was delicious. However, I didn't like how the windows on the dim sum cart weren't very visible. I felt that the dim sum could have been more presentable!

We got the following:

1. A bowl of steamed rice topped with chinese mushroom, diced chicken in bone, and ginger. It was served in a tall wooden bamboo looking container. It came with soy sauce on the side. I felt that the rice was a bit bland. I didn't like how the chicken had small little bones.

2. Eggplant topped with shrimp in black bean sauce. It came in 3. It was tasty but on the oily side.

3. Pan Fried Sticky Rice Cake filled with Red Bean Paste on a round banana leaf. It came in 3. It was crispy on the top, sweet and savory.

4. Steamed Beancurd Wrapped Tofu Ball topped with English Peas, Corn, and Chinese Mushroom.

5. Steamed Crystal Shrimp Dumpling. It came in 4. I liked how there were big pieces of shrimp and no fillers in the dumpling.

6. Steamed Fish Paste Ball, which came in 3, consisted of fish paste, coriander, diced Chinese sausage, topped with a gojiberry, and over a bed of enoki mushroom.

7. Steamed Roast Pork Buns, which came in 3 and were fresh from the oven.

8. Chinese style Crepe filled with crispy dough and shrimp and topped with soy sauce and scallion.

9. Steamed Beef Ball, which came in 3, consisted of beef and parsley, served over a bed of beancurd, and drizzled with A1 sauce.

10. Steamed Sticky Rice with sausage, scallion, egg, and dried shrimp. I was surprised there wasn't any Chinese mushroom.

11. Egg Custard Tart. I liked how the crust was slightly burnt!
