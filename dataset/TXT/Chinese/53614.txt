cPEo3-TmIqCwHLFGKZgwGg Read about Chou's Kitchen from Travel & Leisure's "Best Chinese Restaurants in the US".  Had to give it a try!  Needless to say, my expectations were high.  The food at Chou's is pretty good, but I wasn't blown away.

Dumplings are handmade, which is a nice touch for sure.  You can't go wrong ordering these.  You won't get any sauce with it - just mix your own soy sauce with a touch of vinegar and spice.  I'll admit that I have had better dumpling elsewhere, but Chou's dumplings are pretty good for the Phoenix area.

Spicy beef and tendon dish (frequently recommended by other Yelpers) is good.  Could be spicer, but not bad.

I also ordered the meatball dish (known as Lion's head).  Nice flavor.  A little stingy on the number of meatballs though.

Service is slow, but then again, this can be expected from small mom and pop chinese restaurants.

Overall, this gets a 3.5 from me.  I'm not sure how it made Travel & Leisure's list, since it wasn't fantastic (though I've eaten at a few of the other restaurants on their list, and they can be hit-and-miss as well).  Still, a solid option.  Bump it up to 4-stars since I like to support local businesses.
