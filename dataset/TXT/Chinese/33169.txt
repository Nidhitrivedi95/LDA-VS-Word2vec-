a3jFGgoWbPkPGENEafiXwg Came here Last weekend on Friday lunchtime, My husband was very very hungover & was not in any kind of way being patient. We walked thru the Casino saw No wait here. You do not have to wait to be seated at this 24hr diner in the heart of the Casino. We both immediately sat ourselves & was greeted with a nice smile by Angie the waitress, she took one look @ my husbands face & says the Hangover Burger is what he needs. We took her advice it was made in a Jiffy by the two cooks that you can see them waiting for Angie to put the order in. Soon after had a really nice hot cup of coffee. I was really impressed by how good the coffee was. By looking at this place you would not think it is anything special. But trust my review, I am coming from experience of being a waitress of 13 years with IHOP Corp. Fresh ingredients, made fresh off a Hot grill & a hot steamy cup of GOOD coffee that they always came by to refill gets my VOTE every time. The Hangover burger also to my surprise had a fried egg on top, which can you tell I did not read the menu. LOL, How did they even know I like my egg fried Over hard? I have no clue, all I can say is I gave her a $20 dollar tip to Angie, who I can hear her waiting on other customers coming from all walks of life & she treated everyone  like they were family.  After she even made me a cup of coffee to go back to our room,(even though we were staying at the Grand Hotel) We left after that & my husband says "You know what, I feel much better after that meal".
Yup, Angie was right honey, as I replied. We live in L. A. County & I just cannot wait when we end up in Downtown Vegas again to swing by the cafe & have another Hangover burger & hopefully catch Angie on her shift.
