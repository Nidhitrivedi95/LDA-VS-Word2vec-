uiShreF9oKvzuqxWWxECAw Tried this place for the first time today with a co-worker. I've heard that it's a popular chain for their buns. So it was a must try. We each got one of their special bun. They were very very tiny, about 2" by 2" for $2.10 a piece. We also got their Tianjin style hot and sour soup and their most popular fried rice, according to the server. Soup was $8.99 and rice was $13.99 

Bun was not bad, flavour was good, nothing super special though. Soup was different than the typical hot and sour soup. It was heavy with black pepper, which I didn't mind. It was a lighter version than the typical, in terms of flavour and sourness. Fried rice was really nothing special and definitely not worth the price. It was just a mix of chopped shrimp, Chinese sausage, mushrooms, beans, with roe on top. Taste was meh, can get the same thing for half the price. Portions are not generous.

Service was good, servers were very friendly for a Chinese restaurant. Decor was very nice. This place used to be a Korean BBQ but they have fully renovated the entire interior. I can say I've been, but I wouldn't go back. Not worth the value for the high prices.
