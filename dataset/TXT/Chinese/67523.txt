emOpqfJTtRHMd8dUg_AAsw Dimsum - wide- array of selection, and affordable! 4/5

Our first time to C-Fu was about a year ago. We weren't impressed by the taste and quality of the dimsum there and left with so-so taste in our month. Today we went back again for their dimsum and surprisingly found out that they had improved the quality a lot! We have 5-6 dimsum carts around us all the time and the service was good. The food was great as well. We will go back for dimsum again.
