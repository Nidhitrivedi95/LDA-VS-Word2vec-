MDInVOKvIetk_OIpKd2Ofw Love this spot. Very traditional. A bit hesitant on trying some of the "non-commercial" menu items but so far everything that I have tried has been amazing. The House Special noodle bowl is fantastic, definitely one of my favourite soups ever. Try the broth as spicy, the noodles remind me of pasta noodles and are super soft. This is definitely one of the "go-to" favs in the area if not the city! Try it out, you won't be disappointed!
