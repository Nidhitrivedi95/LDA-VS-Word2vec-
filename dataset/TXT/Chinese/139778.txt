qy6RM3qsgXTanVH-TlJaXQ We ordered the dumblings, the boss man highly recommended it. He said they make them in house. 
Basa fish dumblings - very good 
I would go back again for them
Singapore rice noodles - decent
Salt and pepper squid - this dish is why they didn't get 5 stars
Smoothies - boss man said only real fruit, I think he's right
