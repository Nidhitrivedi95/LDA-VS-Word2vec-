SxjNgkzAlUG-wt2rSbc2HQ My friends and I used to frequent Kom Jug Yuen across the street but sadly they closed last year. :( We've been looking for a substitute go-to spot for Chinese food and so far this place has been working out pretty well. Their huge serving of General Tso Chicken easily serves 2-3 people if everyone also orders their own side of steamed rice. Place is clean and service is good. It's also one of the few places in the neighbourhood that isn't crazy crowded on a Saturday evening (i.e. 6-8 p.m.).
