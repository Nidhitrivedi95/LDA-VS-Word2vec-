The menu is extensive and often times overwhelming, but try to narrow it down to a few good dishes. Like most people, I recommend the Crispy Tofu, Peking Duck, and Three Cup Chicken.

Don't go looking for typical Americanized Chinese dishes, you'll regret it because you have an opportunity to try real, delicious Chinese cuisine. Also, if you share a bunch of dishes amongst a group, your total won't come out to be unreasonable! It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but generally tables clear out pretty fast so don't be discouraged.

Yum!
