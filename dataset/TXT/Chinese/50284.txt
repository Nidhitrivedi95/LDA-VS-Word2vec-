cEFnJrDaz7BLO0xOCJlF6A First time here for late-night dinner. The food was slightly cold and the waiter told me to heat it up in the microwave.

Service was slow, and the food was just bad... Although for just about 13$ you can fill up your stomach.

Please don't come here unless you are desperate for food at 11pm.
