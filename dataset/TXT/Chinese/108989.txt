LKuzbx5Yt3yqiokUFdjVhg I studied at Yonsei University in South Corea for a semester so I am familiar with good Corean food and service.  I had Dolsot Bibimbap and a soup which I cannot remember the name of.  The waitress was very friendly and we talked about Corea for a couple minutes.  The "service" was very good by Corean standards since i was given free kimchi and other small dishes when I sat down. And was given a refill on the kimchee during dinner. The waitress was surprised when I asked for rice with my soup because it is a very traditional way of eating soup. Both dishes were very good but next time I will ask for it to be spicier. I will ask for Corean spicy next time. The meal was on the expensive side since I ate both dishes but if I went with my wife we would have ordered the same amount and been satisfied. 

I will be back with my wife.
