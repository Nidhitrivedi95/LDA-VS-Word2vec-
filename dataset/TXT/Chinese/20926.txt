68jn0s0snbO5dhasLaVvDw I lurve Hainanese chicken rice. To me, it's kinda like pizza...there's no such thing as bad chicken rice. While that may be true, I have not found good chicken rice in all my years of being in the US...till now. 

If you can't get to Malaysia or Singapore anytime soon, then come to Flock & Fowl. This is Hainan chicken rice. 

If you have a skeptical SO who does not believe in the magic of "just boiled chicken and rice", bring him/her to Flock & Fowl. The dish will speak for itself. 

Everything was done right - from how the chicken was poached, to the jelly under the smooth slippery skin, to the evenly chopped pieces of chicken, to the flavorful oily rice, to the chili and soy sauce condiments that tasted like they were straight from a hawker stall or kopitiam in SEA.

The restaurant itself was small and cute, and service was wonderful, and the other items on the menu looked delicious as they were being delivered to other tables. The Vietnamese iced coffee was yummy too (not too sweet) and the Indonesian fried rice that was on special was tasty as well. The only way you can possibly go wrong here is by coming by too late in the day - they do sell out.
