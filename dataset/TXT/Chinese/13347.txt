2UFl9gLOQrSGY2sPu6U-kA I came to Little Sheep Hot Pot for a UYE organized by Teresa C in the deep freeze of winter.  This restaurant is spacious.  The decoration is nice and modern.  

Customers are partially self served at Little Sheep.  After placing our orders, the waiter delivered the raw meat plates (lamb and beef), which we could re-order, to our tables.  We had to go to a serving area to obtain ourselves the other raw food, such as vegetable, chicken meat, pork belly slices, fish fillets, dumplings, fish/squid/meat balls, noodles, fungus, etc.  There were also plum juice, lemon iced tea, pop, etc.  I was quite happy with this arrangement, as I could get the food faster this way compared to waiting for servers to deliver them.  There were an okay quantity of selections; not massive, but the most popular ones were all present.  Whatever they had, they were fresh and clean.  There was a dipping sauce table, so you can mix your own sauce.

Note that the serving area had a lot of shelves, but many shelves were mislabeled.  It was not a big issue to our group, cause we just picked accordingly to the look of the food.  If we didn't know what something was, we just ate first asked questions later.

Services were not as prime as the food.  We got seated quickly.  The waiter serving us explained the menu to us in the beginning, but we were still confused.  He just left mid sentence!  Gone just like that, as if his attention was diverted.

Note also the menu says it is $20 AYCE.  This is not the true price because $20 does not include any soup broth; you get a pot of hot water only.  Soup broth costs extra $1.50 to $2.50.
