xdphjWZymq-3dqOWmA_wwA First of all they say that they're debit machine has been broken..well, this is been over for a month now why are they fixing it?  In addition their food portions are very small and the food quality has gone down drastically. For example I used to order the special soup and it used to come with lots of meat and veggies. And the and the rice plates used to come with an assortment of additional sides but now there just seemed to be thrown together and the portions are super super small. The food doesn't taste fresh please see the picture below for more clear results
