wcFscp4-QH0PJeIW1EOQEQ I wouldn't recommend ordering take out/delivery from Wang & King. It took an hour and twenty minutes for my food to get delivered and when it did arrive my order was wrong. I had ordered shrimp fried rice, two sushi rolls, and cream cheese rangoons. When it arrived the shrimp fried rice was barely lukewarm, the sushi container felt room temp, and instead of the rangoons I got a box of half hard/half mushy noodles. I can't speak to the quality of the food, as we immediately went to Wang & King, food in hand, requesting a full refund. To the managers credit, he was very apologetic and refunded the full price without question. However, when we arrived there was at least 4 or 5 takeout bags just sitting on a table, who knows for how long. After we received out refund, the manager gave us the chance to take the food home, but sushi is not supposed to be warm, so we declined. 

I've been coming to Wang & King for years and I am sad to say this restaurant has steadily gone downhill on our past few visits. Despite being consistently empty, the service is always incredibly slow. The last time I went, we waited over 40 minutes for our sushi rolls. It seems that anytime they have more than two tables seated, they struggle. 

The food is OK for the price point, but if you're willing to pay just a few dollars more, you can find much better elsewhere.
