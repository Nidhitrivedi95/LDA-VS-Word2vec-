yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I came for a weekend lunch with people who described this as "the best pho ever." Seriously? This pho was not even close. I ordered the small rare steak and well done flank noodle soup. My "meat" was all fat didn't even taste that good. The broth was okay, nothing special. I liked the calamari, which was served with toasted garlic and jalepenos. I'd say skip this place.
