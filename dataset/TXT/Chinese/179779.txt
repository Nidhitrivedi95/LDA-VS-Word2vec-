X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg If you like EDM its a great place to go, otherwise, I do not recommend it.  Not only is it the same type of music, the alcoholic drinks are a rip off.  $20.00 for a drink and $10.00 dollars for a bottle of water? Really? Its also a big inconvenience to have to take an elevator to the club.  I will leave this place to the younger crowd that is full of energy and does not mind sweating out their expensive water the whole night. Pass.
