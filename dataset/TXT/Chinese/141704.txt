rgTcICdtCXoNXc71Z7-t5g it was our first time to order their lunch special for delivery yesterday. The chow mein and Flamingo Palace chicken was really tasty so those were good. We were quite disappointed with the crab wontons because it was soggy and bland - same with the egg roll and egg drop soup. It tasted like water with food coloring in it. Not going back. :(
