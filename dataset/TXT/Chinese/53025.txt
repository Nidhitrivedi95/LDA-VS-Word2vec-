cm5pya6toFXn6sJT4FVGyg I have to say that I miss Eddie Chan's, which was in this location for about 25 years. The food is about the same, but the prices were better. Oh well, economy and all that.

I've only had takeout from here. I feel like I'd be dishonoring Eddie Chan's memory by sitting down to eat.

A bit better quality than you might expect from a hole-in-the wall joint in a creepy, half-deserted strip mall.
