_dfqxi1krqXmVHoGkfPnXg I actually like this buffet a lot.  I've even been there on my birthday so that tells you how much I like it.  Not everything is perfect, but the food is good and fresh.  I like the sushi bar that has a ton of variety.  The ingredients are always fresh.

I've eaten there several times, during lunch, dinner, and between and that's when you really know how good a job someone is doing.  The food is still great at 3:30 in the afternoon.

The staff is always nice, but very quiet.  Not a lot of conversation goes one, but they smile a lot and wait on you very well.  I've taken my tablet and attended business webinars while there so was there for over 2 hours and the staff was STILL attentive.  

It's one of the bigger buffets I've seen with several rows of food.  They have a great dessert area with different kinds of yummy ice cream.
