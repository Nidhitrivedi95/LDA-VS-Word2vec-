VvSmE1NnTjnaTPHT0WrCaQ we ate this sunday there. it was great. im a strict vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater but loves veggies as well. ok, so one by one what i liked...
- the atmosphere. extremely, super relaxing, even invited u to meditate with the music they had. 
- the variety of food, wow, it took us so long to decide, there were so many options, so many styles that it was very difficult to decide. 
i had the fake chicken with mango, asparagus, ginger, carrots. when my order came let me tell u everyone around was looking over and asking the waitress what was that...because it was so colorful, the veggies were perfectly cooked, not too much, not too little. usually i dont like fake meats, but this one absolutely thumbs up, it was so tender and tasty. all my plate was a perfect blend of flavours without using any invasive spice. 
my husband had the chicken thai and he was so happy with it. 
- so much food we took some home. 
- so healthy, not ur typical place were u settle for a veggie option but here u have a real delightful experience. 
- we also had 2 spring rolls each
- and a teapot of jazmine tea 

all of this came to $43 (there are cheaper options, like combinations and menus, we decided we wanted something more elaborated, hence, the price) 
the place is spacious, no one was rushing us, the waitresses were all so nice ready to answer any question. 
is not just a place to eat, is a vegetarian experience to enjoy.
