NyGlEmuYcpZSKfk6IwJeSw This was my first time at Tavernakaya and I was intrigued by the menu.  The different cuisines mixed together were fun but also unfocused.  I can't decide how I feel about this.  

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and very approachable.  The dining room was comfortable but really loud.  

We ordered the chicken meatballs, shoshito peppers, a dragon roll and the two-cup chicken.  The meatballs have a great seasoning/marinade but the fact they were chicken did not match it.  

The peppers were decent.  They could have used more charring.  The chicken was really good.  It was more sweet than spicy but it still had great flavors.  

I will give it another try but I won't go out of my way to go back.
