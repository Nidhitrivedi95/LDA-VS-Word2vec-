1lReBAd4iLe0rBLKiurw7Q Came to A La Kitchen around 8pm on a Sunday night and the tables were pretty much all filled. My party of 3 waited for about 5 minutes as the waiters scurried to clear a table for us.

One of my favourites from A La that's a MUST order is the Braised Beef Noodle Soup ($8.99). The broth is slightly spicy and very flavourful. The kitchen gives you a generous amount of beef for the price (4 to 5 pieces per bowl) and the noodles are cooked to perfection.

We also ordered pan fried pork dumplings ($5.75) and they were super crunchy on the outside, but the meat was definitely juicy and hot!

Although we didn't order steamed pork dumplings ($5.25), they are also among one of my favourite dishes here. They have soup inside the dumplings and you add a little bit of the vinegar on the table to it. The vinegar they have there brings out the flavours and it's like a hot and flavourful explosion in your mouth - so definitely be careful of the soup explosion!

We will continually come back here just because of the deliciousness of the food!
