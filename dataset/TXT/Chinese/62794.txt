DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg Watered down P.F. Changs never tasted so....just like you'd expect.

Pei Wei is a mystery to me.  It isn't quite what PF Changs used to be (I think the quality has drastically decreased over the last few years) and it isn't take-out Chinese either.  They offer a few different influences in their dishes (Korean, Thai, Chinese, Japanese) but all are bland and disappointing.  They're missing the point here.  Either go for the low cost, greasy take out we all love, or the more refined, pricier fare you'd find elsewhere.  

Unfortunately Pei Wei is lost in the middle where it should be.
