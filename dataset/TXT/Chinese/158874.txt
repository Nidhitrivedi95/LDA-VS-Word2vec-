U1XLS-uQJVnQRvshnvAeXQ I'm reviewing only the shaved ice. We got there at 8:30pm and they're already out of all flavored shaved ice except Green Tea but only for one serving left. For 3 toppings and small amount of green tea cost us $9.75 (very expensive ) and it was not even good... And they forgot the condensed milk (which we charged for it)
