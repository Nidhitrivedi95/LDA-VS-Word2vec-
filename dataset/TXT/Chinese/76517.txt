gAT3p2Ooou4lUYiF4OKj7g Ordered take out tonight 7/22/15. Garlic shrimp is heavily breaded and soggy. The shrimp are very small and have the tail on them still. Lemon chicken was awful. It was breaded, dry and tough. The lemon sauce came in a separate container and is really awful. Tastes like the smell of lemon pledge. Thankfully the spicy fried rice and vegetable fried rice were good or we would have had to order a whole other dinner from somewhere else. I probably won't return. If I could rate 0 or negative stars, I would, but 1 was the lowest available.
