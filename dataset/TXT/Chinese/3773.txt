_k3PJI3mSS3eIpV8FZ6Tqg This is a rather new (or renamed/redesigned) place, so I was interested to try it. The decor is new and clean looking. The staff members were a bit quiet, but did a good job. The prices were decent, but the portions and food were not.

The skewers cost $2 each and came with almost no meat on them. Some of the pieces were 100% fat. However, the spice rub showed promise and the lamb skewer had pretty good flavor. 

The chicken rice came with what seemed to be plain microwave-quality white rice. The chicken, while in nice white meat pieces, was completely flavorless and had thick fatty skin atop it. The sweet chili sauce was obviously out of the same bottle that can be purchased at the supermarket. 

Although there was nothing particularly bad about the visit, there was nothing remarkable either. Overall, the food was extremely bland and did not make me want to come back.
