Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg Located in Planet Hollywood Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip, this is a chain of Americanized Chinese food, that being said this visit was my first and a little bit not great. I am willing to give it another shot and I will update this review accordingly. The service was incredibly slow, my water was never refilled. The food once it arrived was not hot. The 'Cafe latte" was in fact coffee with milk, that is cafe ole, for those of you keeping score. The soy sauce would not come out of the unclean and clogged container. As I said I will go again, and update my review, but they have some work to do. If I could I would give it 2 1/2 stars but I can't so sadly I must round down.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!
