TWkL-VHo6P-WwL8iTvqlYQ If you are in the mood for Asian cuisine, this is the place.  This restaurant is located within a half mile of where I live, so I always order food to go.  The staff is excellent, the food is very, very good, and the pick up window is usually fast (sometimes they get very busy and you have a bit of a wait).  They also have what they call "curbside delivery", which means you can drive up to the south side of the building near the take out door, and stay in your vehicle.  They will come to you. Try the hot and sour soup, it's the best. Several of their dishes are made with hot spices, which I love, so if you are calling in and order and don't like your food spicey, be sure to let them know.  Pei Wei is a less expensive chain associated with P.F. Chaing's China Bistro.
