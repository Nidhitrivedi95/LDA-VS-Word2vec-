CCRgGKhzxSpl38w7yhqKUw Tried it in spite of 3-stars rating coz we were famished!! So glad we did, coz the food was awesome - we loved it. Dim-Sum was really good. Fried rice was flavourful. Pad Thai was so-so - it had a fishy flavour; something was off and I cannot nail it but it was not bad.

Service was commendable - courteous staff. Dim sum carts were there - one of the server seemed slightly annoyed telling us what was in his cart but he turned around soon and was courteous soon-after. Rest of the folks there were smiling and do a nice job.

Our server Shixiang was particularly good. I will try this place again. It was actually not that expensive compared to other restaurants in the strip.
