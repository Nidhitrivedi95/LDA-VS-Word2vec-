Gh1BoQNMGkh91pSHqvDRAA My Wife and I found this place after moving to Las Vegas a year ago from Orange County, California. We were soooo excited and happy that we found a Great Thai Food place with Great tasting and with consistency since we are absolute die hard fan of Thai and Chinese food. But on the third visit we placed order by phone for pick up. Upon arriving home and looking at dish we ordered (Mongolian Beef was one), food did not look anything close or taste anything close to Mongolian Beef which we had for soo many times. White color cooked meat in a runny watery beige liquid. Being one of die-hard fan of this dish and having it for past 25+ years I never seen a Mongolian Beef looking like this. Total disappointment. 
Today 8/28 my wife and I figured to give them one more chance. What a Mistake that was. the best part of the lunch was cold can of coke. Pineapple Curry which I ordered was sooo watery. My wife's food had totally different color (Same Dishes we both orders the first 2 visit) and tasted completely different. When asked why the food look  and taste so much different they could not give us an straight answer. Appears they use the earlier customers left over and mix few stuff to serve the new customers order. That seems the only explanation that we can come up with if the owner claims everything in the restaurant is the same as before. 
Bottom line going to this place is like rolling the dice. if you are lucky you end up with good food otherwise you are in for an experience which turns you off from any Thai food.
