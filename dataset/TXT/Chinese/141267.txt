rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ This restaurant was amazing!!! Our server Brian was super!  He was so attentive and nice.  The food was piping hot and so much flavor.  This is our first time here and I am sorry we didnt find this place sooner.

The best General Tsos chicken i have ever had.  Very crispy, i asked for mild spice and it was perfectly spiced. 

My husband enjoyed his Orange Chicken and ate it all, usually he takes home his food but not this time.  One daughter had the Shrimp Lo Mein and it had tons of shrimp.  Other daughter had the Sweet and Sour Chicken and she loved it.  The mini eggrolls and potstickers were delightful as well.

Great service, hot food, nice flavors, good prices made us impressed and we will definitely be back!
