cPXasVLtq_1gmuSg65TUfQ For the average first-timer to this buffet, it does a lot of the things Mandarin Buffer already offer. If Dragon Pearl wants to stand out, it would need to acquire the courage to cut the CURRENT menu in half, and bring in NEW dishes of food, flavour, and spectacle.

     I went in at around 11am on a Sunday, the price is $21.99 which is fairly expensive depending on your opinion for buffets. My advice is to eat minimum 3 full plates of whatever you like PLUS a bonus plate for desert. Optional 5th serving is bowl of yummy soup or fruits to finish off your day. In this way, you would "get your money's worth" for the price you paid per person.

     Seating, table space, cutlery, room decor, and (of course) food are ALL acceptable and above. YOU COME for the food but YOU STAY for the chance to talk with your friends, family, or co-workers!

Bottom line: you can't go wrong with Dragon's Pearl. Just remember the dragon will burn your wallet when you come in large numbers.
