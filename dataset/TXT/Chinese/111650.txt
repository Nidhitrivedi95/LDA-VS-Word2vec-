M9zu5KTyVwVC-45Mn8Wp0g Nice to have a authentic Chinese restaurant near our home. The atmosphere is bright and clean nice to eat there. Also, they own the Ohana Hawaiian BBQ next door so if I want Chinese and my kids want Hawaiian we are both satisfied! We've ordered quite a bit of dishes from here and loved it all! The only thing is food comes out sporadically..this last time we ate the our rice came out last..I need that with my food!
