Kig-T7wfebjGIpgSKcdlKA After 20 years living the area, I finally got a chance to visit Big Bowl.  It was a sunny afternoon and I could not make up my mind between Pho or Vermicelli.  I decided with the Vermicelli!  We ordered the minced shrimp on sugar cane to start.  When they brought it to our table, I was a bit taken back as was my friend on the presentation.  The sugar cane sticks were cut and we had to hold on to the cane like a corn on the cob.  I decided to be dainty and used my fork.  The minced shrimp was ok, nothing really special.

When I got the vermicelli, the presentation was pretty but my chicken look dry. And it was dry.  The noodles were flat.  The only saving grace were the vegetables.  I had to ask for a second bowl the sweet and sour sauce/broth they provide you with your vermicelli to rehydrate my chicken.

My friend's pho bowl looked good though.  I tried some of the broth from his soup and I quite liked it.  He enjoyed his meal.

We were chatty and ended up getting three refills of tea, the waitress was attentive and did not seem to mind that we were just hanging out and chatting.

Overall, I give this an average review.  I have had MUCH better vermicelli at other pho/vietnamese places.  I will try the Pho at my next visit for a true Pho experience at the Big Bowl.
