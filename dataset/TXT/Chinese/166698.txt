vede55OuMkwUNd4wnr8GqA Went to this location last night for a birthday.  Never again,  will know for next time to fake an injury.  Food is barely edible.  I couldn't distinguish one meat form another.  From bland to salty to odd looking sauces.  I didn't sleep well after this.  I may be a little scarred.
Good news is there's lots of selection so you get to choose what food to make you cringe.
