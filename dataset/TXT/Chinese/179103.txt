X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Went clubbing here on Sat night, and waited 2 hours just to get inside the freaking club -_- I was on the guest list with 7 girls/1guy, and although everyone got in for free, the wait was just ridiculous. I tried to contact my promoter,  but he just didn't respond. 

Once inside, all I saw were guys everywhere.. & at one point, this guy even asked if he was in a gay club. Oh, and it was crowded to the point where we couldn't even get to the dance floor on each level. Then this fight broke out, so my party decided to leave after a span of 30 mins?  

Wish this didn't happen, especially with it being my friends 21st.
