HG9m9eldYtnX_UeMt4Yy2w The food is a hit and miss here, but it's still a great place and I enjoy most of my visits! This is the place I go **CURRENTLY** when I crave Shanghai food (I'm still on the lookout for the best Shanghai dim sum in Toronto!!!) because it's pretty close to my house.

I stopped coming here when I discovered an amazing Shanghai dim sum restaurant in Scarborough years ago. However, it closed and I returned to 369 Shanghai...

Service is extremely fast. My family usually orders 6-8 dishes and the food (at least 4 of our orders) is served in less than 5 minutes. Our tea hasn't even cooled yet. 

===========IN SUMMARY: food is hit and miss:

------------Hot and Sour soup:
Large: enough for 6 rice bowls

*On MISS days: it's still quite flavorful, it just doesn't have the spicy part. I'd say it's way too mild and not worth getting.

*On HIT days: It's well done, 4 stars!

------------Soup Dumplings / xiaolongbao
Skin breaks quite easily. NOTE the two versions! First one is the original with pork meat, the second one is made with crab meat instead.

*On MISS days: when they place the dumplings beside each other (since the bamboo basket is so small), the skin tend to stick to other dumplings. So when you pick one up, the skin will rip because it's attached to others... The soup inside will spill everywhere, AND THE MEAT will break apart too. The meat is soft and already in pieces (it's not "balled-up" well), so that's why it also comes out when your dumpling rips. Sometimes the dumplings aren't that hot...

*On HIT days: when you can pick one up perfectly without breaking the skin (meaning the skin is held together well, but still thin enough so it doesn't taste like flour), the dumpling is quite good. 3.5 stars.

------------Wonton in spicy soup/sauce (I forget the menu name!)
I love this dish, but I am bias because I've never had this anywhere else! There are about 10 small wontons drenched in dark red spicy sauce. The sauce is so red it actually looks pretty scary for the faint of hearts. 

*On MISS days: Am I becoming immune to this?? Sometimes it's just not spicy. If you want to try this but are not prepared for the spiciness, maybe hope for a MISS!

*On HIT days: When this is spicy, OH MY it is deeelish. 

------------Beef Soup Noodle
Hmm this one is pretty decent here. I prefer the original Beef Soup Noodle (thick noodles) over the other one (glass noodles). Glass noodles tend to soak up all the soup... This isn't very yummy when the soup is gone.

The beef soup here is flavorful enough for my taste (I don't like a strong one), and there are plenty of beef to share!

------------ALL OTHER DUMPLINGS:
I've had quite a few different dumpling dishes, and overall I'd rate them 3.5 stars. Sometimes the skin is too thick, but the meat is almost always plentiful (which is highly important!! wtf are dumplings with only a dime amount of meat!?)

===========IN CONCLUSION
I still come here and I enjoy the food! I love Shanghai dim sum in general and my expectations for Shanghai dim sum is very high, hence the critical 3 stars. 

Nonetheless, I recommend this place! I mean, it's still in business after so many years, with the SAME STAFF (some) for 5+ years! One of the servers didn't speak Cantonese but she learned it when working here. Today, she speaks it fluently!
