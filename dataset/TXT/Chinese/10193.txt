1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA Food is great, for the price and value as well  We drove from LA to Vegas, and stopped by here for dinner.  The person appears to be owner who is very friendly (and loud :)) but you can tell the passion and believe in his products.  He recommended a few items, along with our own order, we had a great dinner.  I liked the won ton soup, pork chop rice, and hai nan chicken.
