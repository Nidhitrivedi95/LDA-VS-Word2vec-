OHFH6ALQqq35NiEbD1eXuw As a previous San Francisco resident, I am always on the look out for an amazing Dim Sum place to go. SF ha some of the best I have ever tasted! This place was recommended by a friend, so we gave it a try.

It was really good! Not amazing, but really good, solid classic Dim Sum. Price point is pretty good, service was very attentive. I would go back, if asked.

Still searching for the ultimate "Dim Sum Sweet Spot"  and have come really close, but will continue the adventure within Las Vegas! Oddly enough so far the one at Rio Hotel is my favorite. Lots more to try!
