Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg Food at the Planet Hollywood location was good as usual. Awesome seared ahi and spring rolls.

What I didn't understand was why the service took so long and we were at the bar? The bartender seemed to have a hearing problem and we almost had to beg for a check because he just wasn't paying attention. Dude, we're right IN your face.So I took off 1 star for service.
