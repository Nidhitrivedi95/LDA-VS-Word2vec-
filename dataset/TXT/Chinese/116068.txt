n5jTCFF6LqNIAz6Jx5-3tw Driving south on Eastern after being in class all morning, I needed to stop for a quick lunch but  wanted good food,not just fast food. Stopped at Pei Wei. I ordered Spicy Chicken. My  buddy had a salad. My dish had a good amount of stir fried chicken with a mixture of stir fried vegetables  and some rice. Very tasty and not too spicy. More than enough for a lunch portion, all for under $7. My buddy had a lunch salad. It was a large portion. He reported that it was delicious. This is an excelent alternative to a fast food joint.
