ypu32D_yjErCge-2cgga3w This was one of the few restaurants open after the Cirque performance in Chinatown, I recognized it up on the second floor of the street with a glowing OPEN sign.   It was pretty quiet late at night, we could sit by the window over the street, they have a big capacity for many guests.  The waiter was funny/quirky and attentive, and the food came out pretty quick, generous portions for a good price (orange beef: so addicting!).  Hot tea was presumed and welcome on a cooler night.  Everyone was welcoming despite a slow and sleepy night.
