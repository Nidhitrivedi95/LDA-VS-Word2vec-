They took over a hour to prepare the food, I then called three times each twice the phone went to voicemail and the third time a lady answered the phone "hello" then hung up on me. For such a small basic Chinese restaurant you'd think it would be quicker. Save yourself a lot of time and go to Panda Express for the same food and a fraction of the wait.
