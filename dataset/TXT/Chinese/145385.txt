s047uGIPJPtJlo_vf5ESQQ We only do take out. The service is fast and the food is good. We usually get the veg. fried rice & veg. lo mein along with some egg rolls & I really enjoy their hot & sour soup. You can walk out for under $15 with a coupon which they put on every take out menu. We live in the area 
(definitely don't consider it the wrong side of the tracks) and when we want a quick & easy Chinese meal we call Best China. These other yelpers are right, they do give you huge portions. We have leftovers for lunch for a couple of days. All and all pretty darn good & great value!
