W6HgKXp-gXozKjOqGqIOXg By the gods I miss this place. Not only do the make the world's best Long Islands but the karaoke is to die for. This was a haven for the world's worst singer (namely me). The song selection is off the charts and the environment can't be beat. Its definitely one of those hidden gems but I'll take it over ANY nightclub in Ontario.
