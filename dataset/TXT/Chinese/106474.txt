l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA I frequented this place often when I was visiting my parents in Mesa. I had heard of it on Triple D (Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives) and had to try it. It was simply marvelous darling! The ordering process was a bit of a beezy to get through, but once you get it you're golden. Also the employees were friendly, patient, and helpful. The wait for the food was kind of lengthy, especially if you're starving, which I was. Nevertheless, it was well worth the wait. I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, who'd a thunk it, Chinese and Mexican fusion? 
The portion size is massive. The Jade Red Chicken is a cross between Panda Express' Orange Chicken and sweet and sour chicken. The Emerald Chicken tastes fresh with its layers of ginger and green onion (without leaving you with overwhelming onion burps for the rest of the day). The chicken is moist and has never been dry and overcooked. The Cuban Black Beans have a smooth consistency and taste even better knowing it's made with olive oil rather than lard. I always choose the plain white rice so as not to overload my taste buds. To end the meal on a sweet note, every meal comes with a warm, freshly-baked (at least that's what it tastes like) Snickerdoodle cookie. I would actually consider coming here just to get the cookie.
Parking was ample. Crowds were large at times and it can get pretty loud. The decor was kind of a miss, but I'm clearly not there to admire their walls.
