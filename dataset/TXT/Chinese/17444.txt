The bad:  The restaurant was a little dirty, and the food was not what I was expecting. I ordered the lemon chicken lunch meal,the chicken had a weird texture and off flavor. The fried rice was not fried rice....it was white rice with soy sauce covered all over it. It didn't taste bad but was not what I was expecting.
I tried this place because it was recommended by a co-worker, but I will not be a returning customer.
