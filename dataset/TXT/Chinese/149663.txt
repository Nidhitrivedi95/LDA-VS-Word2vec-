sQ6DZZLLJRfwUr0eDWKDDg I went for the first time today to Tott's at lunchtime.  It was excellent.  The service was friendly and accommodating (they had no problem substituting my rice for broccoli) and the food was fabulous.  It came to our table very quickly and everything was hot, nicely seasoned and very fresh (love crisp broccoli!)  I can see why this place is so busy/popular.  I will definitely go back.
