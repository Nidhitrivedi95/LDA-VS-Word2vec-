dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw Ordered garlic spare ribs to go in the hopes they would be like another restaurant's fried garlic spare ribs, but alas  I was grossed out by their rendition.
The little chewy, fatty pieces of pork deep fried in a strange batter with flecks of MSG buried in tasteless pseudo garlic-like crumbs was terrible. At least my dogs enjoyed it.
