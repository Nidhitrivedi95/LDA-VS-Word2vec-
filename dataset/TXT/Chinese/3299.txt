_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA This place is conveniently located inside The Venetian Casino. We came around 8pm on a saturday evening and it was not packed...yet.  The service was not very good because the guy kept forgetting us and rushing us to order. However, once we got the order placed--the dishes came by super fast.

We ordered:
- Chicken/Mushroom Noodle Soup
- Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce
- Shrimp Dumplings
- Hot and Sour Soup
- Cold Jelly Fish Side dish


The Chicken/Mushroom soup came in a nice portion sized bowl and it was not cheap. My dad said the flavor was good , but my mom preferred my hot and sour soup better. There were lots of chicken and mushroom bits in the soup and it was hot (temperature). 

The Chinese broccoli was excellent, the sauce wasn't generously drizzled on the broccoli which we preferred. The dish was a hit and i would've ordered that again if i came the next time.

The Shrimp dumpling (dim sum) was good, but not worth the price. It came lukewarm or not even warm. The dumplings were sticking with each other. but, nonetheless it was food. 

Hot and sour soup was a hit for my mom and I. I liked it , there were lots of flavor and it gave a kick (spicyness).  I would order this again, but for 5 bucks for a cup is SUPER EXPENSIVE. the cup was not a big cup..so get a bowl if you're hungry. 

the jelly fish was a slight dissapoint out of all the dishes we tried. It lacked flavor and it wasn't as crunchy as I would have liked it. 

Overall, we had a good experience, it's legit chinese food that I missed while staying at LV. Definitely not like LA , but its vegas and food is not cheap. I still would come back and try their spicy beef noodle soup. yum!
