-ORqiS4L-8pq3dLsUazXTg A nice small take out restaurant. The people there are nice  and always seem to have a smile on. As a seafood lover, i ordered the spicy seafood which is a thai dish. Love it, great taste, goes well with white rice. Black pepper chicken is one of kind, i recommend this highly. As for the appetizers, the crab rangoon and fried dumplings are great. Overall a good experience at Asian house. Will recommend.
