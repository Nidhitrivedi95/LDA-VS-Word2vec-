bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA Warm Winter - Cold Service

After walking around in an atypically warm winter, myself and my girlfriend decided to explore a new restaurant to celebrate the lunar new year. 

Unfortunately, we chose this place.  The décor is fairly plain, but this was really no problem to me.  The waitress that first saw us distractedly motioned us to sit at one of the side booths.  After taking our coats and scarves off for a few minutes, the waitress came by with a couple of warm teas which was very nice.  I said "thank you", and she turned around and walked away without even so much as a glance in my direction.  She then brought us some utensils, napkins, and the order sheet.  I thanked her again, and her robotic face made no expression as she silently drifted back from our table.  I've experienced cold service like this before in Chinatown, so I wasn't really surprised.  I wasn't impressed either.  I immediately asked my girlfriend if she wanted to go somewhere else.  She said no, and that it would be fine here.  

Unfortunately, there's something about rude service that puts me in a foul mood and therefore, I was not able to enjoy our dinner.  I was reasonably pleased with the taste, and speed at which our order came to us.  The broth seemed somewhat greasy, but flavourful.  If it came down to the quality if food, this place would get a half decent score, but the sour service ruined the experience. I did not tip and I won't be returning.
