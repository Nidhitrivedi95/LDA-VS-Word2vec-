hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Food is good, although it is slightly overpriced. The waiters/waitresses are nice, too. It can get noisy because the chef slams the dough on the kitchen counter a lot, but I suppose that's one of the selling points - you can actually see the chef make noodles right in front of you. Good for casual dinner. Can get crowded at times.
