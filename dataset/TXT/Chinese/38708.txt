AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA This place is a God sent!!! When my wife and I first became vegan we had a hard time finding food to eat. We didn't know what to cook, what to eat. We just pretty much didn't know what to do. We searched for vegan restaurants and came upon Veggie House. My wife and I were unsure of eating vegan Chinese food but we gave it try. We went and asked the waitress if everything was vegan and it is except for a couple dishes that have egg in it but you can ask to have without the egg. We ordered Walnut Shrimp, Orange Chicken, House Lo-Mein, and Beef and Broccoli. When we first got the food on the table it looked like normal Chinese food. I took my first bite and it tasted amazing. Not just amazing for vegan food but amazing overall! This place is the best Chinese food I've had in years period!!! You wouldn't even think it was vegan. My wife and I took family there and they didn't even know it was vegan. They thought it was all actual chicken, shrimp, and beef. Their minds were blown when we told them it was vegan lol. I frequent this place about once a week maybe twice. Hands down a must place to go for anyone who LOVES good food.
