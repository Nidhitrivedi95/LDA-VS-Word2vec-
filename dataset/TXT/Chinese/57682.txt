D8yYMxz0p6oQnOQnLRUIyA This is our new go-to place for noodles while in Vegas. Hubby and I shared the ramen with pork noodle soup and couldn't even finish it all. The broth was so full of flavor and the pork was delicious. Service was friendly and efficient. Will definitely return and try more menu items! (Note: if you enjoy people watching while dining casually, this is a great little spot.)
