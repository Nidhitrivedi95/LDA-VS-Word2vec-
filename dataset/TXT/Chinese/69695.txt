f-ookZOX4pBNldaOHMkJ4A This is my go-to Chinese takeout spot in the city! Delivery is always fast and tasty, their hours are great. I enjoy many dishes from here including the spicy shrimp, general tao chicken, pork fried rice, etc. The only thing I've tried and not liked was the crab soup. 

Definitely recommend, staff is also very friendly.
