LbeJgPgKKHw5qH0f02NHEQ My go-to Chinese food in Pittsburgh. I've never been disappointed in my many meals. I often call in and get to-go food, and the nice ladies that work the phones/front counter/cash register are always friendly, greet you with a smile, straight to business, and usually don't have to ask, they remember me & load me up with plastic silverware plates, & napkins. Their restaurant is always clean, has a small bar area with booth seating, and the other section has more of a fine dining atmosphere. They serve you hot delicious tea and ice water upon sitting down.

If ordering delivery, they only deliver downtown during lunch hours because they deliver via bicycle. I compared the price when ordering delivery via yelp & foodler & foodler was cheaper (& also - that's a middle man to Meals Delivered - but I like my foodler points/convert to $).

The usually offer a coupon on their website.
