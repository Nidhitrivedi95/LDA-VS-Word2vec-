DsT7r6NlTWzA1RTwkze8VQ This has become one of my family's go-to restaurants and it is pretty good. I like it because the food isn't too "heavy" like some other Chinese food. Today I ordered calamari and wonton soup. The calamari was okay but the portion was small (not sure why I ordered calamari from a Chinese restaurant, so this is my fault) and the wonton soup is pretty standard. However, their other food is good! I've had the chicken and broccoli and it is good!
