VVUL1lzBOipXJlOG1wURMg I love this place and I use to drive all the way from downtown just to get it! I am so happy they opened another location. 
I recommend the dry garlic paneer and the spicy manchurian paneer.

I like to get take out and I have only eaten at the restaurant once and the service was friendly and fast. 

I dont know many Hakka Asian places but I love this one!
