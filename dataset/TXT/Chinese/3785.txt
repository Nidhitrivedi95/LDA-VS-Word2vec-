_k9XuYMkS3zwm87CCUjCoQ If you wake up in the middle of the night and you has this Chinese food urge?

If you party till 3 AM and you are drunk and hungry?

Midland Court Restaurant maybe the place for you.

Prices are average, Food are average.. But at 3 AM? What else do you expect?

$14 for a choice of 2 dishes from this huge menu..

The chicken and the beef we got were just off.. too salty, too saucy...too dry... just not too good!

Friendly staffs though... Maybe you can ask for some Cold Tea next time!

I think I rather go to sleep on an empty stomach!

Special thanks to my friend that ate everything as I hate to see food going to waste!
