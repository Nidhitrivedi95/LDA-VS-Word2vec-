I learned about this Las Vegas franchise after my co-worker shared her great experience.  My co-worker smoked for many years but after a few cold laser sessions, she is no longer a smoker.  There is a 90% success rate for smokers to stop.

I went for weight loss.  I cannot believe how my metabolism has increased, my desire for water has greatly increased, I sleep better, and am much more logical with my food choices - instead of just eating to eat.

Eileen is highly knowledgeable and compassionate.  There are four sessions for weight loss, and if you need a "touch up," that can also be scheduled.  There is no pain involved whatsoever and is quite relaxing.

I am amazed and highly impressed with this therapy.  And if you refer four people who actually proceed with the therapy themselves, you get your money back (verify this policy is still in place).  Well worth the investment of time and resources.
