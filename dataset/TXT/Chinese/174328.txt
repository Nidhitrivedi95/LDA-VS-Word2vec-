WCkh_ZcsWKU1wx4bqyU9KA This is a little restaurant at the end of a shopping center that sits down in a hole off Johnston Road... but you do need to locate it and go inside - the food is super tasty and the service is crazy fast.  It's a perfect lunch spot; get in, order, eat, get out and back to work on time!  They have a wide variety, delicious soups with the fried crunchies, and their eggrolls have shrimp in them - not the usual minuscule pork pieces that most of these little places use.  Yep - a hidden gem for sure!
