6gF-m1csJtckBSJEmIpsTg Consistent.  Great Cornelius spot.  More of a foody joint than 'fine dining'.  

Skip the sushi (they don't have enough volume on sushi to maintain it and should stick to what they do very well - Asian Fusion.  

Basil chicken, Manchurian, etc- excellent.   We eat here a few times a month.
