618yZxC6stz-Un4xLsp5vw I have tried a number of Chinese restaurants since moving here. I have learned that there are very specific differences between authentic Chinese, New York Chinese and Chicago Chinese. Being from Chicago. I think this is closest to what I like as a quick take out after a busy day. I will say, I'm not crazy about the egg rolls I like big, thick egg rolls. And the pot stickers are a bit doughy. I always order the Beef with ginger and onions. Soups are very good. Again, everything is good and consistent. Not a place to stay and eat in. The restaurant is a bit cluttered. The staff is always nice. And we always have coupons, a plus. Give it a try.
