UydVmlfxab6O-CSnjeGZRw Definitely not a fan. The food was so so. Not worth the price IMO. The service was also extremely lackluster. For a Sunday night with only 2 tables it sure did take an awfully long time for our food to come out. Our appetizers also came out after our entrees. My glass was empty about half the time. Even with a groupon I feel like we wasted money by eating here. I would go to PF Changs instead.
