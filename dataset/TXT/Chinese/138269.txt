QnJmteSnJgEc7PfJ45imOg Very good food, very fresh. I hate when I go to Chinese buffet restaurant and the food is not fresh and they all look like it's been there all day. Dry and burn. Customer service here is excellent. 
The restaurant is clean. I live the salt and pepper shrimp. So yummy. Also fresh seafood and fresh fried chicken. Price is very cheap tho.
