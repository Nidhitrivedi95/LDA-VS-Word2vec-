qEe0mdIax3pz3DH4RPj3sQ Best sichuan (spicy) chinese spot ever. Very authentic, always delicious, and has remained as my go to place in case i'm out of dinner plans. 
love: cumin lamb, picked fish soup, lobster/crab (if they're in season), chive pancakes, xi'an noodles, chilly chicken.
relatively clean for a chinese spot, always leave here with a happy belly.
