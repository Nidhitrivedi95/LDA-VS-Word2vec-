4XH5nRjUVKyRNituBAwW6A I was here for a group dinner with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday. This was my first time at this hot pot restaurant. The restaurant inside is big and there are individual rooms that you can book for larger groups. You get ice tea and plum juice for drinks. They also have different soup base that you can pick from too - the selection of soup base was good, quite a few choices to choose from. It is an all you can eat hot pot place. In terms of food, there were a lot to choose from on their menu. However, although they had a good choice of soup base, I thought the flavors were just too weak. For instance our side of the table order the fish head soup base, I didn't really taste the fish head in the soup. The service is not great, but for a place like this, I wasn't expecting much service to be honest. The servers were nice but sarcastic. There were a few times that I or one of my friends had to go up front to ask for service - although to keep in mind we had a large group and was placed in one of the rooms that was really far in one of the wings of the restaurant. I seriously think they should have a bell, like the ones they normally have in Korean restaurants. Overall, this place not bad for all you can eat hot pot.
