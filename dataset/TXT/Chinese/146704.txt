S6dARuOrrOXd4xSiTHti8g This place is seriously good eats. Not sure about the American Chinese menu, but why would you want that anyway? The Szechuan style food is hot, flavorful, and delicious. Run, don't walk, to have the Diced Chicken with Dried Pepper Chongqing Style. It is so spicy and deliciously addictive. My mouth is watering just thinking about it! We also had the sautéed shredded potatoes with vinegar and chilies and the dumplings in spicy oil. Waitress was super nice and our total including tax was $31. This place is awesome.
