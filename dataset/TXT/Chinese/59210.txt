DiCWSyoaBkIpOVUdIO7Jlg Service, staff, and atmosphere is very nice. Clean and stylish. We got the Family Meal C which included really great appetizers and a spicy shrimp soup. The entrees were pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, and yellow curry. Everything tasted great, EXCEPT: I came here because I was craving yellow curry specifically. What came to us was not yellow and definitely not curry. It had a pasty, jelly consistency and tasted so very bland. Nowhere even near curry-- I asked if they made a different version and was told no, not really. I wanted to give 2 stars for that disappointment but ended up giving 3 because everything else was good. Just stay away from curry.
