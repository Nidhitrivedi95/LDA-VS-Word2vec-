rkTFLIt_Z1bYMIuXfSyAqg Wonton Hut has become a quasi-regular weekend hangout for me whenever I'm in the mood for some wonton soup.  The product here is consistently good.  The shrimp wontons and cuttlefish balls are large and cooked well, with a nice springiness to the shrimp.  The fish paste balls are appropriately fishy.  The egg noodles are cooked to perfection as well, al dente the way I prefer (if you can apply Italian terms to Chinese cooking).  My only gripe is with the beef brisket, in which case I got a couple of small chunks of actual brisket along with a few thin strips of tendon and other assorted less desirable pieces.

The place is steadily busy during the lunch hour on weekends, but turnover is pretty fast so the wait isn't long.  Service is brisk and business-like, but the owner is very friendly.  The fish tank is purely for decorative purposes - you can't order a live fish and eat it.  Speaking of décor, the bright green walls are kind of kitschy in my opinion, but won't give you a headache.  Prices are reasonable - usually coming out to about $16 or so for two including tax and tip, and I usually get extra toppings and noodles.

The space that Wonton Hut occupies has seen a lot of turnover in years past as no restaurant seems to be able to make it work there.  I'm glad Wonton Hut appears to be reversing that trend, and I hope it's around for a while.  Recommended!
