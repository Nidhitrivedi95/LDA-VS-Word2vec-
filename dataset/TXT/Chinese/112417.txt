mHcfv-cdbx1LtR3n3FoooA My place for Chinese foods mostly because a few minutes drive from my house, like it could be my lunches or dinners when my wife out the town or traveling! I come here often and it is my favorite place for Chinese foods! It was small and very nicely place with cleanly space where you felt comfortable sat and enjoyed your meals lunch or dinner! The price is average, the services good, the waitress wry friendly, and the manager very willingly if you needed to talked! I love it, place! I highly recommended!!!
