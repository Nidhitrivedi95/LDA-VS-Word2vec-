_HePiPCk9tmgezshWwZGOw Always on the lookout for good delivery restaurants in my neighbourhood...this has been a challenge for years. Love the food here...tasty, fresh, nice selection of dishes, good portions & prices. They also have some dishes offered at $2 if your order Is $30 or more. I have a lot of food allergies and it's never been a problem. The food has been consistently delicious...I will be ordering regularly :)
