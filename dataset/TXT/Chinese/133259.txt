pv59B7swR4T6LFYK4aNwBA I live quite near this place and I think its name, although cheesy, is actually pretty cool.  I've been here twice and enjoyed it on both occassions as the service is quick and friendly and the food is delicious.  Inside it is small, clean and quaint with a really nice owner who is quick to process and prepare your order.  The menu has an extensive range of chow mein, sweet and sour and szechuan dishes.  In particular, the chicken kung po is excellent for its rich, spicy sauce with peanuts, green peppers and chillies.  With this I had a bag of prawn crackers, a coke and a portion of special fried rice which came to only about £6.50.  
Yummy Yummy is a great Chinese takeaway and well worth a look is you're in the area.
