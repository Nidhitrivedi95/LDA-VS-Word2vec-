hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q It was my first time with the boyfriend last night and we both loved it. Was so crowded when we came and thought we gonna have to wait awhile but nope, about few mins later they seated us right away! 

Literally ordered 8 different dishes (no lie!) and finished most of them and just took home some of the leftover shumai. Our server was such a nice guy and he even asked us twice if we're sure about those 8 dishes because thats a lot of food  

I enjoyed my time there -- the atmosphere is nice and different. If you're from like CA or something like that dont compare too much. For us here in the burgh its a different style yet reasonable dimsum place. Def gonna come back soon!
