Ms_el67lrNsKBmdEXVxl6Q Very sad. My first visit was excellent, I thought I found a new hidden gem. The whole family loved it and it was very reasonable. Second time, the food was not up to par, not even half as good as the first time (I ordered the same items.) The third time, the chicken was INEDIBLE... it was not white, it was not dark, it was gray chicken. It seems as though they had quality ingredients just for the initial opening. I guess they figured they established themselves enough to be able to start ordering the low grade meat. It was awful, I won't be back.
