GDpd9KZdUgnjcoCWTTphqw Gave it a third chance. Definitely better this time. I think you definitely need to choose the right dishes. 

5 stars for their Yu Shian Rou Si (shredded pork with garlic sauce). It was a perfect combination of savory, sweet and spicy. Loved the texture of the veggies in there; although still not quite sure what the main veggie in it was (maybe radish? or some other root veggie). They also might have had some fungus in it. Either way, loved this dish. Would definitely get it again. Only $8.95 too!

3.5 stars for the dry pot. We got the option to pick 5 veggies and 5 meats; $19.95 for a small dry pot. It was pretty spicy, pretty numbing. Bf thought it was too one dimensional. Did not think the tastiness was worth $20 though. 

3.5 stars for gan ban si ji tou (green beans). There was no meat in this dish! Thought it would be like the one they have at Wonton Gourmet (green beans + garlic + shredded pork). Tasty, but the 1st dish stole my attention.

1.5 stars for the kung pao ji ding. We have gotten this everytime we have gone to this place. It is an inconsistent dish. This time, it was salty, but would be tastier with more vinegar and sugar. 

Price: for 4 people + 2 beers, $61 pre-tip post-tax. 

Bottom line, would come here again for the Yu Shian Rou Si. 

Tip: if you pay in cash, you don't have to pay tax.
