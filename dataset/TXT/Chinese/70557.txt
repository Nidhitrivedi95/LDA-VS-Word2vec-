f8R1qFYugdhQRR-ym8SUxg First impression of the place was quite nice. Modern Decor and Red ambiance with Red Panels on the ceiling to match their restaurant name, "The Red". We ordered 6 dishes in total for a party of 6 ppl. 

1. "Couples' Lung Slices" it's simply a spicy dish that consist of Beef Tongue, Beef Slices & Beef Tripe. The presentation of this dish wasn't that appealing. It really looked like it was just dumped onto a plate. But the taste was quite nice and it was full of spicy pepper oil at the bottom. But downfall was it didn't have enough tongue and tripe. 

2. Chicken & Corn Thick Soup. The soup was quite large for a large lol. Taste wise was not bad either. 

3. Pipa Style Tofu with Snow Pea Tips, Mushroom, Black Fungus, & Bamboo Shoots. Quite tasty I especially liked the tofu and greens. 

4. Vegetarian Spring Rolls. It was ok. But nothing special.

5. Crispy Rice Cake with Chicken Slices. The crispy rice cakes were quite tasty and the chicken was on too. I didn't mind this dish but not everyone enjoyed it :P

6. Duck Egg Deep Fried Shrimps. This was delicious but yet again. The presentation was lacking. Used a big dish for a small amount of shrimps. Again looked like it was just dumped onto the plate.

Overall the food was not bad. Would probably try it again and try more spicy dishes next time.
