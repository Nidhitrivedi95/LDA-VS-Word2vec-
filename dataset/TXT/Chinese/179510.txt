X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg The club is a good size, incredible sound in the main room and I agree with other reviews that the staff from bartenders to bouncers were very friendly with no attitude. Waiting in the general admin line kind of sucked because they did not letting anyone in from that line till at least 10:30pm. Oh and yeah the $75 cover is steep but you can win that back on the tables after the club if you are inclined. Overall great experience for preview weekend (bingo players). Be prepared to shell out some major coin once you get in if you don't partake in what those crazy kids are doing these days. Water $9, redbull $9 , Bicardi coke $14. in the end it was worth it and as long as I don't ship my $ at the tables I'd go again.
