o56LV-WnalGB0URVvoOh4A Just had dinner there.  The service was impeccable and the food was fresh and tasty.  Ordered the walnut shrimp and house chicken, which was juicy and tender.  I love that this quaint restaurant still brings out a pot of hot tea as a standard, which isn't standard anymore in most Asian restaurants.  A must try for Asian cuisine!
