C5azlhXSTOlqVAM3nl95nw One of my favorite to-go spots!! The grandma that works there is super hardworking and friendly... you walk in and she greets you right away. 

I love the Singapore noodles and Basil Beef here... the prices are pretty cheap too! There's limited seating and it's very small, not the best place to seat and eat since the whole place consist of like 5 tables. 

But the food is great I recommend this place !!
