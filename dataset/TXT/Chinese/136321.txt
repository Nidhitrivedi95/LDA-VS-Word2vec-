qgEKyJfuL5LBA6D3V9nR9g Came back here with my folks for a quick lunch.  Had the crab meat xiao long bao, which were just ok (lots of soup inside), the pan fried buns were soggy inside and the meat was terrible.  Shanghai noodles were just ok as well, I like the soy to be a bit more complex and flavourful, and then drunken chicken was pricey as they remove the bone but it's mostly drizzled with alcohol sauce and not nicely marinated (plus sliced too thin to enjoy the fatty chicken skins).  Overall a disappointing meal, even my parents said they wouldn't come back.
