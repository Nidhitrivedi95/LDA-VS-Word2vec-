dVhGY-mNwTWQzK01Zxuclw 6/18/2014 - Went with my girlfriend to eat lunch. They seated us immediately, but did not ask us for any drinks until I flagged a waitress down after 10 minutes of waiting with no service. After we requested drinks and food I had to stand up and ask again foot our drinks at the front counter. Food came quickly, but waitress never came back to us nor spoke to us again. Had to stand up again to ask for bill.
