l9vx-OTdDPU-oHZ17aVxdg I love dining at this place! The chicken pakora is my absolute favourite! It used to be a lot spicier, but it seems that they have skimped out on the chunks of green fresh chillies within the batter and the pakoras are a lot smaller than they used to be.  I will try the Scarborough location again, as I feel like they are more generous with the portions. 
Have tried other dishes as well at both locations and I've never been disappointed when it comes to the flavourings.

Affordable, delicious, a must try!
