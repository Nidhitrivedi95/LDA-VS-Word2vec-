f1ZKauu7dCB6iplmKqplAQ Hong Kong Garden was recommended to us as a great place to have dim sum.  We are from the Eastcoast USA, so we were eager to experience great West Coast Chinese food.  We were very disappointed, both in the food and the service.   We had a large variety of dumplings-all seemed like the same things you can get in the frozen section of an Asian food store.  The Xiaolong Bao was undercooked and without flavor-straight from the frozen packet.

We were there the day after Christmas.  Maybe that was a mistake, as the place was mobbed and in spite of calling ahead and being told we had a table, had to wait over half an hour to sit down.  

We will not be back.
