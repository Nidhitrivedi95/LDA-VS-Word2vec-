However...the food was not great. Acceptable, but there are plenty of other Asian restaurants all over the city with excellent food. We chose this one because it was convenient, and they had happy hour until 7 (!). The catch: happy hour is only available at the bar or the sushi bar. They will also give you their happy hour prices at the outside table, but of course, this isn't option in March. No one mentioned this to us at the front, or we would have asked to be seated at the bar. The bar is also not very big, so if there's more than four or five people, I guess you're out of luck. Looking at the menu online, I see that they have it printed right at the top. So I guess you need to read the fine print on the menu.
