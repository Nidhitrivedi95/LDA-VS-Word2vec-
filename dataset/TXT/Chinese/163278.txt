UPSzbM6D2SkarWAINq1I9A Pho to go was good but next time I will eat in, I had to reheat the broth which was not a problem but I still think eat in next time should be the norm. Also had ginger chicken, it was okay...I thot it would come with some spicy wild type rice but it was just plain white rice, chicken an onions were good. Nothing notable...

Again...I think eating in would be a better idea and also having an idea of what I REALLY wanted to order would be a good idea so next time I do a little research on the menu and maybe even learn a little Vietnamese so as not to get the quizzical looks of confusion!!!!

HA!!!!
