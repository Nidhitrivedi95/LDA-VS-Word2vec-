Easy to miss the "street" since it's a small sign for a parking lot and not an actual street so slow down once you're near to avoid missing it.

We got our usual go-to szechuan dishes: the suai ju yui (water cooked fish in Chilli oil sauce), mapo tofu (no meat), sautéed string beans (no meat), and spicy sour clear noodles. Also got a 3 choice cold app plate. Good portion sizes as we took home the majority of the tofu and fish dishes despite the fact that we were starving since we just finished a bikram class.

Food came quick after we ordered and everything was flavorful with lots of garlic/spices, not overly or just simply oily like some szechuan spots.
