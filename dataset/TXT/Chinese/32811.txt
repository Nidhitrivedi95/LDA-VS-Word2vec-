a2NSxkmX0_eqvdwJ2rjPVg Highly, highly recommend this restaurant.  We have eaten there a couple of times and find the food outstanding.  The portions are large so we order appetizers, 1 entrée and 1 large side.  So much food we could barely finish....but saved room for the flourless chocolate cake with real whip cream.  The staff is fun, informative and attentive.  This is my favorite Scottsdale restaurant.
