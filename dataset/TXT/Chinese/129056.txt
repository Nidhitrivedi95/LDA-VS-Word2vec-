pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA On a hot Vegas weekend stay, my bf and I limited our dining choices to the Venetian and Palazzo (conveniently connected).  We stopped in for lunch without reservations or doing any prior research, except for the two minutes at the entrance perusing the menu.  They had only been open three weeks, so the staff seemed very eager to bring in any and all people.  Our server was extremely friendly, trying her best to make us comfortable and answer any questions.  I think she was Asian, but she said she grew up in somewhere in South America, and had an indiscernible accent.  She made everything on the menu sound tasty, but we were only looking for a light lunch.  I had the samba blt which was had yummy chunks of lobster, a bit of mayo heat and applewood smoked bacon.  It came with a side of fingerling potatoes with a sprinkling of some kind of cheese on top, which is called "fries" on the menu.  The pickles, I did not like - too tart.  I tried everything on my bf's anticuchos combination bento.  The box usually comes with chicken, beef and shrimp, but he requested the shrimp be switched out for the miso sea bass.  Its sweetness is best taken in small quantities, such as one skewer.  I liked it, but it is probably too sweet for some.  The tuna roll was acceptable.  It's incredibly dark inside, which makes the bright mall atmosphere outside all the more apparent.  I'd like to return for lunch, because I could envision this place being a too much like a noisy nightclub for dinner.
