ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ This was my third and last time at the Clever Koi. I say this as for the third time in a row, we had to wait ( two of us) at least 10 minutes after being seated to have anyone even recognize or talk to us. This was after being looked at by many employees without even a verbal acknowledgement or hello. Very poor customer service. 

After waiting for the apparent requisite 10 to 15 minutes even to get water, we had to wait an average of  another 20 to 25 minutes for drinks, then apps then dinner. 90 minutes from being seated to eating is absolutely unacceptable. Then to top it off, after self-parking in the lot, and being in the restaurant for over 90 minutes and dropping well over 100 bucks, the valet attendant intentionally parked a vehicle directly behind mine in the middle of the parking lot and blocked me in. It took him 10 minutes, after I asked him to move the car blocking mine, to move the car out of my way. He then had the balls to tell me to never park in "his lot again!" That absolutely sent me to the moon. I will NEVER go back to the Clever Koi as I have never been treated so poorly in my life at a business. I will certainly never recommend anyone to go there. Absolutely shameful.
