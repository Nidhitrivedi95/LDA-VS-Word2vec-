5WhDd9MnacntXYURmvgMZA With all the good ratings on this place I decided to come and have a taste. It's a beautiful place for fast Chinese food. Beautiful decor. I got a menu and began too look. 
I decided to try the 3 item and had it to go. The lady asked me of I wanted noodles or fried rice and I said fried rice. Then she preceded to complete the rest of the order.
She said I was going to get orange chicken and veggies. Surprised that I was not allowed to order my main entree was strange. She wrote on a styrofoam container and disappeared. I an not a fan of orange chicken but decided that with all the high ratings that I mine as well try. 
I also ordered a side of spring rolls.
I got my order and went home. I got one spring roll that was soggy and fell apart when I tried to pick it up and no sit sauce, napkins or even a fortune cookie. 
Just a fork. The main entree was rice. It took over half of the container and a bunch of vegetables. I only got a tiny amount of orange chicken. Only 9 small peices. Not going here again. It was good but I wish I was able to pick what I wanted for y main entree and side.
