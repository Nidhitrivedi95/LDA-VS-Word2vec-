_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA Trust me, you're much better off eating at Panda Express.

Went here because some Yelpers said it was a decent Chinese place on the strip. Repeat, the strip.

First off, the location sucks. Yes, it may be in the Venetian, but it's in some odd corner where the smell of smoke is intense and you're looking at nothing but Sportsbooks.

We were seated promptly but it took about half an hour for water and menus. The food was honestly forgettable. Yes, there was variety, as well as Dim Sum, and the quality of ingredients was good, but it didn't live up to its claim of authenticity, nor did it taste spectacular. We had the XO Shrimp and the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles. And it was overpriced as hell.

Like I said, you're better off eating at Panda Express somewhere in Henderson, or in Vegas if there is one. Sure it's a chain, but the food is freshly made, hot, and tasty.

Two stars for bad environment, mediocre food, and slow service.

Another fine review by S.G.
Whoop, whoop, whoop!
