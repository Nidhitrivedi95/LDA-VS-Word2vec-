zTGxLMOd9crAz0XNzqrcrA Now that's what I call mediocre!

I'm not a snob when it comes to Chinese food at all. I've experienced both unnecessarily authentic Chinese cuisine and hyper-Americanized Chinese food and I will go for something in-between every time.

So this place seems like it will fit right in with that, but it doesn't. The service blows, they have a $7 minimum charge for credit/debit cards - when I told them that was not allowed withiin their contracts with the credit card companies they gave me a blank stare, I walked out.

The couple of times I have eaten here I was not even mildly enthused about anything - the fried rice has no soy sauce flavor, or any particular flavor at all, it reminds me of those microwaveable rice cups. The meat was chewy and decently flavored but the portion was pretty small- not worth the price.

Don't worry, there's about 15,000 Asian restaurants on Green St - I'm sure that you'll find something...
