5VXlHFrYZZzj7zfZEsz5nQ We ate here on a Friday night and were able to get right in. The food was quick and fantastic! I wanted to take three more orders to go. If I had the room in my hotel mini fridge I would have. Noodles were cooked perfectly. The pot stickers were made from scratch which is hard to find sometimes. The fried wontons were filled with something other then cream cheese which was a really nice change. The sake was one of the best we've ever had. Would recommend this place to everyone.
