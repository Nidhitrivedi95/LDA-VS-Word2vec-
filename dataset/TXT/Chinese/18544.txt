5Dccw539NNtnyCgTu5ed5A Update! We were craving thai curry so we decided to call thai house. We wanted something new, we tried the green curry 5 spicyness with brown rice. 

The green was better than the yellow. The server on the phone told us that the green was spicier than the yellow and we she right on the  money. 

Next time we are gonna try the red curry. But the green was pretty darn good.
