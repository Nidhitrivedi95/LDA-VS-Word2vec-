0nlocywsFHQmEt8_xbHNiw While I have coworkers that swear by this place, I must say that my initial experience was...meh. 

I placed a to go order for house pan fried noodles. The lady who answered (who I also believe to be the owner) let me know that the price on the menu was not the actual price of the food. While I had thought that to be strange, I didn't care because I was starving.

When I picked up the order in the timeframe stated to me, the food wasn't ready. Not a big deal but the lady then told me that the house special pan fried noodles (which on the menu reads shrimp, chicken, and beef) could only have 1 option. So I was forced to choose shrimp. I was pretty annoyed at this point because they had only started my order when I came to pick it up.

When I finally got back to my office and looked at the food, it was sitting in a pool of grease. There wasn't very much sauce and or flavor for that matter. What I got was oil flavored fried noodles with shrimp and a lot of broccoli on top. I was not happy.

Maybe this is was a one-time boo boo and I've had a rare unfortunate experience. Either way, you won't catch me trying this place again any time soon.
