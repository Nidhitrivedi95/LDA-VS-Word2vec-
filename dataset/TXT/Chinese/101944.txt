keQlXWfz2K7GukqaReVyow I am very pleased to have this place in my neighborhood. 
And my bf and I probably ordered the right things - sounds like what you order decides 5 star vs 1 star. 

Knowing that they are Sichuan restaurant, we ordered Cold mushroon (Enoki) in spicy sauce, Cold eggplant in spicy sauce, and the house speciality - Fish in spicy sauce. All of them were EXCELLENT - and I mean it. 

To me, the biggest selling point was their use of right spices. That clearly differentiated Ichiban from other Americanized grease-heavy crap I see in Madison. I felt like this is the food they'd eat, and that definitely translated in the menu.
