ooh_xgi3CZkblPNjomXyXA Picked up takeout when I first moved here 3 years ago and needed a moving break for some lunch. My dad is kind of a Chinese takeout professional so when he was raving about it, I knew it was good. I had orange chicken then. I probably get takeout from here once a month now. I switch it up between orange chicken, sesame chicken, Szechuan chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. Sometimes I add in the delicious hot and sour soup or the crab Rangoon. Everything is always hot and delicious, and I'm happy to say I've never encountered any mystery meat bites like you sometimes get with Chinese takeout. Highly recommend #1.
