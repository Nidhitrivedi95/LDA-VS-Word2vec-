ueBZ4UoRXdq1eXrlPgnf5A I made a yelp account just to write a bad review about this place.  I am not a food connoisseur by any standards.  I absolutely love Panda Express, Pei Wei, and even love most cheap, dirty, less than flavorful Chinese dives.  

This place is just awful.  The Orange Chicken tastes bland, overcooked, and, despite feeling starved, has been thrown in the trash.  I thought that was as bad as it could get before I tried the Lo Mein.  It looks charred and dirty, and tastes like it had been half cooked in rotten month old oil.  My coworker's General Tso's Chicken does not look better and apparently doesn't taste it either.

What I love most is that I waited an hour and a half for the food and shelled out $23 between me and one co-worker (we didn't even order drinks...).  The gentleman on the phone barked orders at me to the point where I wasn't even mad, just confused.

Words seriously cannot describe the intense dissatisfaction I am feeling.  In all seriousness, I don't know how anybody in their right mind could EVER write anything better than a one star review about this place.

Get in your 200 degree car and drive down to Jack in the Box.  The risk of heat exhaustion is well worth the pain you'll save having to choke down this North Korean jail food.
