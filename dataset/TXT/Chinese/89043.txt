i4CF-bIEfNeYoQ87klS78Q The ONLY place for great Chinese takeout in the area!!!!  We'd tried everything over the past couple years of living here and thankfully finally found this place- every other Chinese restaurant we tried was terrible.  We ordered General Tso's chicken, Orange chicken, pork egg rolls and pork lo mein.  All of the above were excellent!!!  Oh and prices are reasonable, delivery was prompt, and the staff was polite and friendly!!  So happy to have found our go to Chinese takeout place!!
