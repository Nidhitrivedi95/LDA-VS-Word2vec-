xjlMlnxWqMd3FGODA_z1NA Ridiculousness at its finest!
They don't even deserve a 1 star but yelp don't have a 0 option.
I live by the other china a go go on nellis and lakemead, apparently their phone number listed on the website is no longer a working number. I'd like to call and order on the phone and pick up to expedite process. Got 3 hungry kids at home.
So I called the Charleston location and ask for the Nellis n Lakemead location, and first person I talked to passed the phone to the 2nd person and told me she does not have the number for the location near me. She said try going on the internet and get the number from there......uuuuhhhhh heeeelllllooooo that's the first thing I told both of you and the reason why I called ur location to get the other location's info.
Smh
I got frustrated coz they act like they don't understand what I am talking about.
I like their food at China a go go but dang!!!! Worst customer service ever!!!
Bye!
