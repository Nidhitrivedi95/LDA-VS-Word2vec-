Really quite average. They don't deliver, and recommended instead that I contact DeliverMeFood.com.  I ordered the Triple Delight - $14.95 - billed as a "delicious combination of chicken, beef and sea scallops..." Rice was an extra $.55 for a tiny cup; a bowl of Hot-Sour Soup $2.95.  All in all this is not mind-blowing food, but fairly adequate for delivery or takeout on a cold snowy night.  With DeliverMeFood's fees and automatic tip, the bill came out to $26.89.
