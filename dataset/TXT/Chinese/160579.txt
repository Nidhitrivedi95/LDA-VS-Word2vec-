u9iy3hyA9HpETKi9qns__A I got takeaway here the other night because I just moved into my flat and had no cooking supplies (...ok I don't think I really need an excuse to get takeaway). Anyway, I haven't tried any other Malaysian food here in Edinburgh, but I did enjoy a good beef rendang back when I lived in NYC. I did not really care for the rendang at Nanyang though...the beef did not seem slow cooked and tender like I was used to, I found it quite chewy and tough. The sauce wasn't creamy and instead was mostly just chewy shredded coconut. Since I haven't had much Malaysian food around here yet, maybe this is the style, it just was not what I was used to (usually like it with a much creamier sauce with coconut milk) and I did not care for it. I probably won't be back anytime soon as it seems there are better Malaysian places nearby.
