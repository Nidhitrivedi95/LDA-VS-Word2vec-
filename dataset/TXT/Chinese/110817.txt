lXZvgVmIz-ko1OiCG-VDTw Good try noodle shop but not quite there to be anything outstanding. Not bad though.

Really liked the appetizers: Fried buns with condensed milk and the wings.

As for noodle- in my party, we tried different combos of noodles. Everyone thought their dish was alright. Personally, I got the Thai tom yum soup, thick egg noodle, wontons, and beef tendon balls. Soup was
alright. Egg noodle was mediocre. Wontons were actually the only good thing in my bowl! Beef tendon balls were basic. Milk tea was basically water.

Service was lacking. Not attentive. Took like 10 minutes after we sat down to get water..

Just get the wontons. Get the appetizers. Skip the noodles. I heard the clay pot rice bowl is good too though.
