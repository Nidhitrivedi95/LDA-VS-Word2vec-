Kn57RIWAdnVfJHI1loLXOQ I've only gone to Super Hakka a couple of times and I truly love it! The food is great, the customer service was good and interior is really cool. I believe they also deliver for a small fee. I stumbled across this restaurant because the restaurant beside it was packed! My only warning is that when they ask you if you want spicy or mild choose mild. The spicy was really spicy and my family and I can usually handle spice. 

Recommendation:
Munchurian Chicken
Chilli Chicken
