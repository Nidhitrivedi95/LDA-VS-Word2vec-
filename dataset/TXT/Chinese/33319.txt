a58P2BPCCbQgDMbEoLfWzg My first visit here was for dim sum and it's not very traditional with it at all as far as serving it. Then again, I don't know if pushing the carts around with it is very traditional in itself so take that for what it's worth.

The menu and offerings is pretty similar to everyone else in the area so I can't say there's anything that really makes this different from the rest in that aspect. One thing that we did end ordering was the pork belly. Now I haven't ordered this or seen it at other places but it was mind blowing. It truly melts in your mouth. The reaction is like soap to greasy water. Amazing.

My second visit was so Christmas Eve I believe and was for Dim Sum as well. The place wasn't very busy but the service was slow and the food wasn't great. It's almost like the expected it to be busy so they prepared all the popular dishes ahead of time and was going to reheat and reserve as people ordered. You could tell the food was a bit old. This was very disappointing. I doubt I'll find myself here again but who knows!
