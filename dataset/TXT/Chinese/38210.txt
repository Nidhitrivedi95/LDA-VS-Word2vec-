AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA I really need to keep bringing more friends here so I can try different dishes they order. I'm enjoying the Mongolian beef so much I have to order it each time. Really liked the eggplant too and I just love taking one friend to try vegan food to hear how much she enjoys dishes that she doesn't even like the main ingredient of, which proves how good the eggplant is. Plus after tasting our 4 dishes, she proclaimed this her new favorite restaurant in the city & she is an omnivore!!!
