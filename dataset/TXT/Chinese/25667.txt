7F6JYzEDGs2d2mYW_To57A Weirdd, I gotta disagree.. I liked their food and the service was very good maybe because my friend frequented the place.. But the staff is really friendly :) and the sichuan dishes were authentic! I guess i had a different experienc since I didn't go there for the dim sum but rather the actual dishes.
