This isn't a first date kind of place - there must be a clause in the Long Wong franchise that stipulates that any Long Wongs needs to be a complete and utter dive. I've never seen a single reputable looking LW establishment, but don't let the appearance deceive you - Long Wongs is a diamond in the rough.

The piece de resistance of every Long Wongs is their chicken wings. I'd like to believe that nowhere else on the planet could you find a more perfect blend of crispy, saucy, tasty wings. I've never had wings anywhere else that came close to being as good. I've tried most of their flavors, but my favorite is Honey Mustard. It's a perfect blend of sweet, spicy, sticky goodness. Other great flavors are Teriyaki, Honey BBQ, Honey Hot, and Medium.  

I've had their deep fried zucchinis, mushrooms, and their corn dogs (Foster Farms) and they're all delicious.

A dozen wings for $7-8 bucks isn't a bad deal at all. I've done larger orders for family get-togethers and work potlucks and the wings consistently get rave reviews. If you want good wings, you're not going to find anything better and you'll only end up paying more, save yourself the trouble and go to Long Wongs.

I'd recommend phoning in your order ahead of time otherwise it can be a 10 minute wait (and make sure you have the correct location).

If you can get over the fact that the restaurant looks like (and actually is) a shack, you'll be delighted at what they serve up. It's certainly worth a try, and I doubt they'll disappoint.
