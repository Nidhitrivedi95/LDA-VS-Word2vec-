5Lcit9Zt6TF9bmKoFMhF0g Very friendly place. When I first went in, I did not know it was a Taiwanese place until I saw Taiwanese TV shows being broadcasted on the LCD screen. We had the beef noodle and wontons with spicy sauce. I thought the food was OK, and the prices was average. But being Taiwanese myself, I found warm feeling about this place.
I'll definitely come back, maybe even bring some friends from work.
