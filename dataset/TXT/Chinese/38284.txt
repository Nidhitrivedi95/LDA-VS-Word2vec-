AtD6B83S4Mbmq0t7iDnUVA EXCELLENT!!!
One of the best restaurants in town! 
I've been there several times. The first few times I ordered the Orange "Chicken" (If I find something I like I stick with it). My friend had the Crispy "Beef". I had a few pieces of that but it was too spicy for me (I'm a HUGE spice wimp so it doesn't take much). We  try new dishes each time now. The noodles are great!  The desserts are fabulous!  

The only thing I haven't completely cared for is the Eggplant with Tofu. The flavor is good but the tofu was too soft.  

They may need a bigger location soon because there can be a wait but the food is worth it.

I absolutely LOVE this place!!
