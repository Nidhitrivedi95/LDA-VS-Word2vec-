1lnIoAIB6U5ywPTC2LG8aQ One of my worst restaurant experiences.

The first issue was that our order sheet was 'somehow' lost, and we ended up writing our entire order again. This was our first order after waiting for 20 minutes. Second, when our revised order finally came through we asked for things like more soy sauce, water, etc. but they NEVER came. Lastly they forced a 10% service charge on the already expensive bill with such poor service.

They were extremely understaffed the night I went to the point where they had to call their sons and daughters to help out. I saw several people from other tables stand up with their order sheet waving down a waiter with frustration. The food was not exceptionally good for the price you are paying. With such bad service I would discourage anyone from trying this place to pay for their child labour...
