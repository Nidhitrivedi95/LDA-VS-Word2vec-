fnLiPkJL0ur4-pS99bgqGA I would give a 2.5** 

It's not a bad idea for a quick lunch. Prices are average for any chinese food (hk style) cafe. Food taste wasn't bad but not extra ordinary like "wow" I'll go back or have craving for. 

I just didn't like how there's quite a lot of MSG the time I had it. I was having dried mouth, thirsty and thirstyyyyy for the entire day. 

For similar noodle soup or plate of rice, I think I'd go to a better location. Lots of different restaurants around the area in Markham.
