They had things that i do not see at buffets very often, like crawdads, a variety of fish based entrees, spiky general tso's chicken and the crab rangoon was really exceptional.  The only problem with the average level of the food was the far below average attention to signage.  The service was on par with what they are supposed to do and did watch our table to collect plates as often as we left them. 

Even though the food and service were average, the television playing the ambiance music of popular classic piano songs with a slight asian feel did make the atmosphere quite whimsical.  But what really made the music special were the random images that went with one song, and as my ten year old daughter was watching, asked my wife innocently, "what is that?" As my wife looks up, she says, "Well, thats apparently a nude beach."
