tQaIWc9qeiB1IU163LKlAw Panda Express is the type of place where I would go if I was interested in eating bad chinese food but also don't want to get sick. It serves very americanized chinese food with understandable names. I think that their portions are somewhat small for the price, but at least its safe to eat at and gets you done fast. It is a 3 star restaurant except I have to deduct a star for the strange odor that comes out of the restaurant onto the sidewalk and for the small portion sizes.
