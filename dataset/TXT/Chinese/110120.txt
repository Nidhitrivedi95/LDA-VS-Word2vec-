lUSAupdaVSoEaUO63RdPZA Received flyer in the mail and that we'd check it out for delivery. We ordered the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, honey walnut shrimp, General Tsos chicken, an order of pork chow mien and a side of egg rolls. 
My only problems were is that in all the chicken dishes we got mostly dried out pieces. The honey walnut shrimp was very good and still crispy and the pork chow mien had generous cuts if pork. The portions were more than enough and good for the price.
