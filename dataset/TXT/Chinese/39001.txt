AtUtG-oQp1rkk6ZdYcfSzw We decided to try Cafe Hollywood since we have been to their other location and liked it. They did a good job renovating the old Burger King into this new decor (the two giant Oscar statues at the entrance are a bit too much). We got there and it was busy but we still managed to get a table. I find the menu a bit limiting since every page seems to have a time restriction. I ordered the baked garoupa on rice and my wife ordered the curry beef with rice, both from the chef special menu. We both found the food okay but nothing extraordinary. We had the french toast for desert and that was good. It took us a while to get a staff to come for the bill. Overall was not that impressed so I will probably stick to the original location.
