s9zNmeJIu83WVL56QNLD2A Omg.... I just left this location, had 2 plates to-go and the server "Precious" was a little bit unfocused. I had to repeat my order to her and she still didn't give me the sauce on the side. That was minor though, the food is what really disappointed me. The food presentation was good, however when I got it home... I noticed the rice was different from what I am used too and it had no flavor. It looked like white rice with carrots and corn and soy sauce in it. Not good! And the food was cold! They may need to turn up the heat on their steam table.... I'm sure it wouldn't pass Health Dept Code for standard temperature. Sorry, but I won't be returning to that location again.
