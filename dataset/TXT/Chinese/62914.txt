Portions are just past normal size.  I really like picking up an order of chicken fried rice.  Lots of yummy in the big bowl.  Sesame chicken is another favorite I get regularly.  The spice is just right, hot enough to compliment the dish, but not send you into a coughing fit.  

Bottom line, I've never had a bad experience at Pei Wei, highly recommended, even if you have to drive across town to get there.
