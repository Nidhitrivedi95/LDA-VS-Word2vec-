cI7k9zqs_pl3byUDE4cpdA The food here is hit or miss. The food is either really good or hmmm not so much (but maybe that is more personal taste than actual critique).

Personally I love their Kung Pao Chicken because they have the most peanuts of any that I have ever had and the brown chile sauce has just the right amount of spice. They serve a decent bowl of Sweet & Sour soup. The Mongolian Beef is a reliable contender. And they have very reasonably priced lunch specials. 

Aside from the food, I have one other criteria for Chinese restaurants... When you are sitting in a booth, the walls should not be covered in little dots of decaying bio-matter. I should not have to guess what rotting sauce is spread across the shell-inlay-ed picture of a woman carrying water over a bridge. Golden Phoenix passes this test. Not to mention that I don't think they have ever made the Dirty Dining report...

Overall, they are a better choice than some of the options in the area and if you are in need of a party spot, they have a reasonably sized private room for such an occassion.
