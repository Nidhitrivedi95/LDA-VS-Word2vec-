A6lKCuTrDSJ_eFKyumZCJQ This is a review I couldn't wait to write.  I am so glad I stopped to get something to eat at this restaurant.  It is located right on the casino floor, along with other establishments.  The menu is varied and I opted for a soup bowl.  I was pleasantly surprised by the large size and the vast amount of meat and vegetables included.  There was the BBQ pork, chicken, and 4-5 large shrimp.  For $3, I added thin egg noodles (ramen).  There was no skimping on anything!  The soup was full of flavor from the ingredients and the broth, however, I had to spice it up with Sriracha.  I thoroughly enjoyed this meal.  I wanted to get more to take back to my room but I would have had to get in back of the line that grew continuously.  It's all good, I may make a trip back tomorrow to get another bowl.  The only downside of this meal is that I can't say when (outside of tomorrow) I will experiene a noodle meal this great.  What a way to take a break from gambling!
