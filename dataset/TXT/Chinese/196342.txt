ZlrHrg7jrbO6blqwfa0MkQ Some very solid Chinese food, but definitely a little more pricey than most.  Otherwise, 5 stars.

I have no clue why it took me so long to check this place out.  I love Chinese food, the more authentic the better.  Anyhow, I finally made it for a quick lunch.  $10 lunch specials are about twice the price as most places, but still not that bad of a deal.  Especially when you factor in the quality.  I nibbled off of everyone's dishes at the table.  General Tso's, Hunan Chicken, Hibachi trio, Szechuan chicken, etc....  All pretty solid.

No complaints, other than a little more than I'm used to spending on Chinese food.  I'll be back.
