Most of the food seemed disgusting, with a waiter basically bringing out a noodle soup that consisted of a bowl of warm water, and a block of dry, packaged noodles. The waiter then just placed the block of dry noodles in, and left, without stirring or anything. The chicken was decent though, and I think it was the Kung-Pao chicken that was the best.

The service was adequate, but truthfully, hard to judge, since they did what was necessary to get out food, pay the bills, etc. but never had a conversation with us. I wouldn't say they were rude, or distant, but they weren't that friendly with the customers.

Overall, this place was disappointing in it's ability to deliver good food, and the service wasn't too friendly as well.
