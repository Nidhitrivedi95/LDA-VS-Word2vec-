pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA Jimmy our waiter definitely took care of us. We were going to see Le Revè and time was of the essence. He asked what was price range for each person, there were 4 of us, and what we liked & disliked.  Then we just sat back and he brought out amazing dish after dish to us. We were not disappointed with any of his selections. 

The vibe & atmosphere was great and food amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant.
