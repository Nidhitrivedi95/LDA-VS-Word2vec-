zTGxLMOd9crAz0XNzqrcrA This is my favorite place to eat Chinese food on campus. Golden Harbor might have a little bit better tasting food but this is about half the price. You can't go wrong with any schezuan beef or brocoli and beef. Also, I would highly recommend the Dry Chili Chicken off the Chinse menu. That dish is amazing.
