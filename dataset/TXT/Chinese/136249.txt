qf4w82L2F7xJwh1i82uYHA First time trying this place. Stopped in for a quick lunch while at a conference. They are located in the food court inside Northlake Mall. I ordered the fried rice combo with orange chicken and bourbon chicken. Got to the register to pay and they don't have ANY soy or duck sauce. Lady says they haven't received their delivery yet. I wish I'd known this prior to ordering and I believe that they deliberately don't tell customers because once you pay its too late. The orange chicken was too sweet and the bourbon chicken was just ok. There were some really dried up pieces in the mix. Probably left over from yesterday.  Really wanted some soy and duck sauce. Would have helped with the taste. I prolly won't return.
