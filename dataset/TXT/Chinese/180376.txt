X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg After having a horrible experience trying to get into Hakkasan last year, I thought I'd give it one more try this weekend. I visited to see the Chainsmokers on 10/18. My phone was stolen out of my purse on the jam-packed dancefloor. Seriously. They pack people into this place like sardines, and the dancefloor is full of bros who grope and push women around. 

And security? Yeah, don't expect them to help out if anything happens. When I realized my phone was stolen, I approached one on the side of the dance floor who proceeded to yell at me for intruding into the VIP area. I finally located someone who wanted to help me out (I couldn't hear his name. He was actually sweeping the floor. He had dark hair and glasses. He was the only helpful person in the place.) He directed me into a quiet staff only room where I thought I would fill out some paperwork about what's missing. The employee who watches security cameras in that room flipped out and told us we weren't allowed in there, so I had to yell out a description of what went missing over the blaring music in the club. 

I found out later in the night that security found my phone case (no phone) on the dance floor, but I wasn't told where, or if they would be checking cameras to find out any information, or if they would be doing anything else for me. It was basically not their problem any more, so they didn't help or show any compassion. I personally feel like when someone gets robbed at your establishment, a little empathy and assistance is the right response. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend anyone visit Hakkasan. 

My situation aside, there's 5 floors of dark stairs that patrons have to climb to get anywhere in the club (not fun after a few drinks in heels. Poor planning.) If you don't buy a VIP table, it's hard to get around and have any space to dance and have a good time. With so many fun options on the Strip, I'd stay away from Hakkasan and choose somewhere else.
