pJnN5PxqFPGZW2pJWkQtzA We have been to Ben's a couple times now and glad we have found a local place to get Teriyaki close by (after moving from Seattle to PHX, it's hard to find here...).
We have ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and the spicy Chicken Teriyaki Yakasoba and enjoyed both.  The regular Teriyaki is a little sweeter than we are "used to" but not so much so that we wouldn't keep ordering it.  I like that they are willing to customize your order and have been very friendly.  We'll keep coming back!
