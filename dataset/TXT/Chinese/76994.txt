gdb4gmSI5eJcuXLZ3BfgtA This place hardly deserves two stars but 1.5 stars isn't available. I ordered pad thai and the noodles and chicken were rubbery. The flavor isn't great either. My friend orders to go from here all the time so I have had their food on many occasions. It's never really impressive just another restaurant convenient to a lot of homes that are in an area where there is a serious lack of restaurants available. No good Jacky Chan! Up your customer service and quality of food or change your prices and be honest about the food you serve.
