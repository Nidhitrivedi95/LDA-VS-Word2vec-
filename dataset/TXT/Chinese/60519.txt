dnNjNkcYSjFudOLcOFkxlg Food is quick and mostly adequate. Had a really bad experience ordering the seafood pasta during happy hour and being served a full plate of noodles containing 1 piece of shrimp cut into 5 pieces. It absolutely had no place being called a seafood pasta. Realistically was more of a bean sprout and green onion pasta. 

Waitress was expectedly indifferent about our unhappiness and basically acted as if it was absurd to expect more during happy hour.

I understand that customer service isn't always the priority in joints like this, but if I wanted to be completely Lied to about my food, there are plenty of cheaper options in the area.
