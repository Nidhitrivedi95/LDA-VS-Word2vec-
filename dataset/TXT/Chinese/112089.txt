MdS6EHt2RZFpn9fQXZc9Ig Came by for a quick bite. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty nice/cozy. Fairly clean, quick service and pretty cheap pricing. 

Went during "afternoon tea time" if you are familiar with HK style cafes. For the price, it's ok. I got the fried chicken wings and fries. It came with 3 wings that were smaller than average, and a plate of shoelace-style fries. The fries are similar to McDonalds, except they didn't seem fried long enough so they weren't as crispy/hot as you would expect. 

A little disappointed on the size of the wings that came with the order, even if they were a little bigger, 3 would be ok? 4 would have made up for their small size. 

If you are looking for a quick and cheap bite in this area, it's fine to go to - but there are definitely other options if you look a bit more.
