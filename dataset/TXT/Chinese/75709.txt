fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA Came to this dumpling house lastnight. It was 45 minutes before closing. Sat down and the waitress said it was last call. Ordered a bunch of dumplings and when the pan fried dumplings came out I ate a few and realized the texture was mushy. I looked inside the dumpling and it was raw. It was pink and as I dug my chopsticks through it, it was red in the middle. Gross. I lost my appetite instantly. I complained to the waitress and she said she will cancel the dumplings off the order. After about 30 mins I had a bad stomach ache. I am also pregnant. I suffered food poisoning all night. I will not be coming back to this place ever!
