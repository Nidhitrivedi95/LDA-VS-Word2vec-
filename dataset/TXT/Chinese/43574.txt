bg3YcuqVyQofTz5d4kKgug I had a craving for Hakka-Indo food the last time I was in TO and we dropped into Federick's.  It's been awhile since I've been here and they did a pretty good job at renovating it.

There was one dish and one dish only that I really wanted.  Chili chicken, dry and spicy!  We also ordered some Hakka noodles as well as mixture of pakoras.  

When the chili chicken come out and I bit into it I remembered why I loved the chili chicken so much.  It's absolutely delicious!  I found the noodles a little oily but the meal itself was great.

I made my friend get me an order of chili chicken take out from here when he came to Ottawa the following week.  It was delicious cold and also delicious reheated!
