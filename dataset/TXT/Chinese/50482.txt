ceuvH6NpDhpT1p4q1w93pA IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO MSG BEWARE!!!  I had poisoning after only eating half of my order last night.  I almost had to go to the hospital.  THIS IS JUST SAD!! It's been about a year since I've eaten here and I used to all the time!  Never have I been more disappointed for spending twenty dollars on Chinese.  For being "home made" and "authentic" I sure did get the wrong idea.  

Also they could even close my container when I ordered extra beef for the two dollar extra charge.  I lifted the container out of the bag and noodles were spilling out...I felt puzzled.

Later I felt nauseous as it all came back up!  Now my weekend is ruined from msg poisoning all for twenty dollars!

Such a shame!  Bad quality and unprofessional.  Will NEVER return for any Chinese craving here!  For the price I paid, I expect more! At least to not be poisoned!!!!
