EhTYPpGzs2MfDspt1nU7Hg Best chinese food in markham before unfortunately recently i dunno if they changed chefs but the food isnt the same anymore. Service has become horrible. I ordered for delievery waited over an hour... no apology turns out they forgot it was for delievery. Also my daughter found hairs in her chicken today...done with this place
