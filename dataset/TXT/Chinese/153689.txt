taXKuFldSoerm9SXrckh_w I was super excited to try this place because of all the great reviews but I wasn't too impressed. I wish I could say more positive but really the only positive was the yummy tea and the great service. My boyfriend got the Mongolian beef and he was not very impressed. I got the chicken lo mein and it was better than his meal. I really did not enjoy it. It has this greasy burnt taste. I can't even explain it. It gave me a very weird after taste. Like I said, the service was awesome but I don't think I will be rerunning.
