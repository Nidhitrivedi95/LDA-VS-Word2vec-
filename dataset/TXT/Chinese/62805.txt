DW0ZvWuYaSvMcB_3LG5RGg If you read the rest of the reviews and look at the plate size you will notice that they all basically have the large round plates.  Well last night we ate here and ordered the large or regular size entrees and got the once used appetizer size plates.  I felt really cheated because we've been coming here since it opened.  Over the years we've notice the massive change in people working here, the ones we knew are gone and everybody is new.  Food tasted mediocre and hasn't changed in years, but it was worse before so I guess it has improved.  Gotta work on trying not to scam the paying public cause it will catch up.  Use the right dishes for the service and no one will complain. Will I go back, maybe in the far future cause it's really not worth the money.  Being from Hawaii I know oriental foods and I love good Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, any Asian cooking and Vegas has nothing like back home.
