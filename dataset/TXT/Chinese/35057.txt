aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg I've been here several times before but this will probably be my last.

Service here has always been questionable but they would at least get the order correct and the BBQ meats were generally good.

This day, it was horrible.

We ordered Wonton Noodle Soup, Congee and added a 3 meat combo with BBQ Pork, Roast Pork and Ginger Chicken.

After a little while, the Congee and Noodle soup came out.  The meats didn't show up until the Congee and Noodle soup was almost finished.

To make it worse, they gave us Duck instead of the BBQ Pork.

After trying to grab a server for a few minutes, we gave up and decided to just eat what was served.

The Ginger Chicken was anemic, compared to past meals, and the Roasted Duck just tasted off and mushy.  The Roasted Pork was good.

We ate, left most of the Chicken and Duck, paid and walked out.

On the way out, one of the servers was cleaning something up and put a "wet floor" sign on the ground.

Walked around the sign and before you know it, foot slipped and fell hard.  It wasn't water.  They spilled oil or grease on the ground and didn't bother covering it up.

These people are generally clueless, rude and generally act like they don't care.

But ... still came back for their BBQ meats.

Not anymore.  They're just lucky I don't sue.
