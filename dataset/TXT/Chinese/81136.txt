GXbag8-ubKs5qb1dMNyMTQ The Sugar is the only choice for Chinese dessert in the area so if you in the area and want to satisfy your Chinese desserts craving you kind of stuck with it.

I can understand why the service is lacking on a weekday lunch hour since there is only 1 waitress who taking orders, making drinks and desserts and delivering the orders from kitchen. 

The Lingzhi Essence Jello ($5.99) is quite sizable compare to the one served at Herbal Harmony but it is lacking the intense Lingzhi taste.. wondering it there is hardly any in it? 

The Coconut Fresh Fruit Sago ($4.79) is a nice surprise. Though it is a little too sweet for my taste but it is loaded with FRESH FRUITS! no canned varieties.. that is an extra 0.5 stars. The sago are a little crumbled together but is quite acceptable.

Have not try any cooked food on the menu. But I think The Sugar really try to hard to has so many varieties, you do sacrifice quality over quantity. Since there is so many eating place in the same plaza why don't they just concentrate on making better Chinese desserts instead??

They accepts Cash only!
