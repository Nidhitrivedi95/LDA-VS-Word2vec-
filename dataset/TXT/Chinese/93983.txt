Jc2jTrilr_FPfFpJztnZxQ Excellent food! Shanghai noodles were delicious and the chili chicken dry was the best I've had! And the spicy pepper shrimp appetizer was awesome! Oh ya don't forget the Thai spicy chicken soup was great although be aware there was tofu and peas but still delicious! 

I'd come back again for sure!
