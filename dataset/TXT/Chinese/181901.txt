Xfod0UWr_9B-TOM6qxVIwQ Great find! This place is fast, very reasonably priced, and tasty. I love Hawaiian fare and this place has the classics:) I had the fried shrimp with, of course, white rice and macaroni salad. The shrimp breading had a nice crunchy texture and the macaroni salad was fresh and had the right amount of mayonnaise. My husband tried the vegetable roll. I love sushi and am always on the look out for good sushi. I thought the roll was great - especially for the price. The ingredients were all thinly and neatly chopped and looked fresh. The rice to vinegar ratio was good, not too tangy. We also tried tofu vegetable dish. My husband spent 3 yrs in China and he said that dish is exactly the style of stir fry he loves. Again, fresh veggies, and the tofu is a fried tofu. Sauce was a light gravy not too strong and good amount of saltiness. I can see why this place has 4 stars. High quality food for a really great price!
