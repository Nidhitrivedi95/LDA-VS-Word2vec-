KOPittXGiS_CpoAYdPpqGQ I must say, I was pretty disappointed with this place. Came in here with my wife and the sister and brother in law. This place is very over priced for a Chinese food. Appetizer of egg roll is $15, and there's only 3 little pieces of it, that's $5 a piece., same thing with their dim sum, it was $15 for 4 tiny little dim sum and they taste liked a cheap take out Chinese food that you can buy from the comfort of your own home. We had 4 dishes and 2 appetizers and it cost us $200 ! This is the most expensive Chinese food we've ever had in our life. I wouldn't be writing this review if there were a wow factor from the food that we had. If you guys want Chinese food, do yourself a favor and go to the Chinatown part of Vegas, and that's probably more authentic and taste better. Also the service at this place is horrendous, once you finished with your plate they're there right away to take your plate away, can't even wait a minute like they want you to leave ASAP. This place is no different from panda express except the price which they up 1000 times more. Our vacation in Vegas was awesome except for the part that we wasted $200 at this place. We could've used that money to gamble. So beware of this place!
