kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A Solid four stars. Decided on this place due to returning to the airport and it was on the way home as well as other elite yelpers reviews.  First off can't beat there affordable pricing. Second the food was above average.  My husband and I shared the following:

1) spicy pork wontons $6 4/5 sauce was good

2) hot and spicy noodles $8 4/5 great flavor just wished instead on minced pork it was chunky meat

3) chicken and mushroom noodles $8 4/5 love the chunks of chicken and mushrooms but wish the broth was spicier 
 
Overall my belly was satisfied. If this was closer to the house I would probably we here more.  Recommend to others give this a try.
