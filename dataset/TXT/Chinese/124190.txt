oQg9JbKz7T1Zmm6GW1plrQ We used to be regulars here. It had been a while since we visited, so we stopped in for dinner tonight. I got a bad feeling when I saw the big plastic "Buffet" sign hanging from the roof. 

The big surprise came when we stepped inside, though. They completely remodeled, replacing all the tables and chairs with booths. It felt very different and impersonal. None of the staff we were used to seeing were working either. 

We ordered 4 different dishes and crab rangoon, and everything was different and much less appetizing and flavorful. For that reason, this will be our last family visit to House of Mei. 

We didn't eat from the buffet, but we checked it out before ordering, and everything looked like it had been sitting out for a couple hours. Nothing looked fresh.
