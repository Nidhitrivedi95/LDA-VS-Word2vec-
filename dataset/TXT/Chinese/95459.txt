JhEtJbGjAqKDHCZ11i3qoQ Good food.  Large portion.  The small size is Huuuuuuge! The interior of the store needs some love. Feels a little lonely and forgotten. I like Ghengis Grill more as far as taste and ambiance go.  Ghengis Grill offers way better seasonings and marinated meats. The portion sizes here are way bigger however. The soup is a nice option.
