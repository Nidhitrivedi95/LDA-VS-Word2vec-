0v8icS8wOOgEDiHDCOQkZQ I had take out from this place yesterday. Ordered the chilli chicken dry, manchurian beef with gravy and the Bombay fish.  The food is decent and the service was above average.  I did not like the chilli chicken dry, it was not juicy and it was hard.  I do love the manchurian beef though.  It is soft and top quality, not chewy like many Chinese take-out restaurants.  The Bombay fish was okay, but could use more flavouring.  The food needed a little something more to distinguish it from the other. They seem to be all mildly spiced. (I ordered extra spicy, it was just semi-spicy). I think if the food had a little more herbs, some parsley, cilantro it would make the food a lot better.  Food wise, this is a three and a half.  Washroom was clean and service was above average, so that's a 4/5.  The food is just ok but service and place is good, so it's in between a yay ok and I'm a fan, but I'll err on the nicer side and give this place a full four stars.
