yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA FAVORITE Pho in Chinatown.   Open late night, this is it.  Why look further, they are awesome.  The Awesome Noodles, Drunken Noodles and the FULL Chinese menu besides the trendy pho and vietnamese is all insane.   The Spring rolls come with a bowl of peanut dipping sauce that you want to lick clean, bu tknow its totally fattening, but get one to start.  Its enough for two!   I also love the Combo Pho here, its balanced perfectly.   The staff here is ON IT!  Great service.  Great prices.  INCREDIBLE Food.  Get some.  #1 place for Pho in China Town, I say!   Yummy!
