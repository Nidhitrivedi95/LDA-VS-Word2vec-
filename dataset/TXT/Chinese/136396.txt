qgEKyJfuL5LBA6D3V9nR9g The restaurant is very clean and quite large. I came here because I wanted my first taste of the famed Xiao Long Bao (soup filled dumplings) and where better to try it then a place named after the very food! I totally get the appeal. Juicy and savory. The xiao long bao here are very good and very satisfying, much more than your average steamed dumpling. 

We also had the shanghai style pan fried pork buns which are also really yummy, albeit a bit oily.

Pan fried pork and chive pockets. These are delicious but oily.

Spicy & Sour Soup - The small is perfect for two people who are very hungry. Nothing particularly special.

Everything was seasoned perfectly. Service was a bit brisk and cold but at least food was brought in a timely fashion and the staff was easy enough to wave down.

Overall I really like this place and would come here again, maybe frequently. Definitely want to invite people out to this restaurant.
