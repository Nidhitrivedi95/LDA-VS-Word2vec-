zDbRhfmrhXdXy1o8uKTrAg Today's visit the service was much improved from the previous week. I ordered the crab wonton's and the beef broccoli.  The beef broccoli arrived immediately and was fresh and hot. The crab wonton's did not arrive until I was nearly finished with my entrée. The food is fresh, but the service is not reliable. Last week my entrée sat on the counter for almost 15 minutes before they served it (cold beef broccoli ) & the restaurant was not overly busy.
