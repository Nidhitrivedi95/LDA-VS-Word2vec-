Spring rolls came first which were delicious. Then the calamari (which I did send back because of the amount of grease pouring out of it). Then the vegan phó was served. It was delicious. I've been here before and it's always a hit with me! Absolutely fresh and flavorful. Not too salty! Great amount of veggies, and plenty of smiling faces. Good place for large families although expect a longer than usual wait time for a table! They are always busy
