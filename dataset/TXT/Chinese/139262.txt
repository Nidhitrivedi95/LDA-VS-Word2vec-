qutQLFutEyHy440jpADnxA I have been here a plethora of times. Guests always want to eat here. Must be the HUGE doors out front. Or the carved horses other places. Its a nice looking place. Food is PF Changs good. If you have never had authentic Chinese, this is probably like discovering nirvana. But its salty, lots of similarity in sauces and drinks, while good, are expensive. I had a gift card, Had to go.
