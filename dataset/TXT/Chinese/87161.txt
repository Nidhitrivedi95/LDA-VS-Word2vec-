You have the option of having it with spaghetti or rice, and I opted for spaghetti (which is my preference for any baked dish at an HK-style cafe). My friend had a meatier version with pork, beef and mushroom sauce. The service was quick and to the point, but beware if you can't speak Cantonese as the servers aren't too fluent in English. The menu is in English, however, so you can make do with pointing at the dish you want from the menu and saying key words like 'bill', but don't expect much more than that. The food was great half way through and the portions were good. However, the food isn't exactly on the light side, so I felt a little overwhelmed with the heavy sauce and fatty slices of fish after that. Please ensure you have a lot of room or have a high tolerance for fattening foods! Also, the dishes come with a cream soup and a drink for an extra dollar. For most, it's a great deal, but the cream soup has chicken bits, so beware vegetarians.  Most clients ordered iced tea as their drink, which surprised me because  HK milk tea has always been the holy grail of HK-style cafes in my opinion. My friend ordered the said milk tea and I ordered coffee for that morning caffeine rush. His milk tea came almost instantly, but my coffee arrived only after I reminded the servers three times - yeah, my two cents is to stick with the milk tea or iced tea if you need a beverage immediately... Overall, this is your typical HK-style cafe with minimal service and heavy, high-calorie dishes. If you're looking for some cheap eats that isn't McDonald's, then it's worth a shot. I wouldn't see myself going out of my way to come here though because it's the same as other HK-style cafes in my backyard of Scarborough.
