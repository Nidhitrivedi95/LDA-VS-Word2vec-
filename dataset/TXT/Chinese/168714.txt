Vs7gc9EE3k9wARuUcN9piA The food is awesome! We decided to try this place on a Saturday night when my son and his wife were visiting me from Cali.   We were pleasantly surprised at both the service and the food.  After reading the other Yelp reviews,  we were expecting a little larger eating area but it was actually just the right amount of seating. The server was knowledgeable and helpful.  Everything we ordered was excellent! We ate family style, and all the dishes went together perfectly, even tho we didn't plan it that way! I will be back!!
