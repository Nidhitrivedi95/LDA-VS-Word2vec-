b41zjWT4pzcTgNY04eKAvg im a fan of go for tea but not this location. I came here several times because i live nearby 
the service was always such garbage. It was my go to location for late night or cant decide what
to do place. but then one night we waited so long to be seated, servers kept walking away from us and when we finally got seated they practically served us water and FORGOT ABOUT US. We placed our orders drinks and food and waited, then 15 mins in two tables got seated after beside us and they placed their order after us and their food and drinks arrived before ours. We asked several servers to check on our orders the one that took our order was nowhere to be seen. Then we waited for an hour and nothing came the tables beside us already all finished eating. We just decided to leave it felt bad at first because we already ordered but we gave them several chances to check on our food. I now to go the downtown markham location and avoid this location at all cost
