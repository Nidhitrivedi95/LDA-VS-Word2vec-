H_eO04NZAQIDcbtFQ4BUag Absolutely the best Chinese restaurant we've ever been to. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! The owner has a great sense of humor & very warm personality. The food comes out so fast, hot & is delicious. She is very attentive & friendly. The prices are ridiculously reasonable for large portions. Can't go wrong with the daily deals. Can't wait to come back & try other entrees!
