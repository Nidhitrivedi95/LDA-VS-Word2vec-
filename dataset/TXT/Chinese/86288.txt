HPLB1Tr8ZB5UkD-2umKPdA When my husband pulled into the parking lot, I thought what are we doing here?  I had no idea inside the "neighborhood" casino was one the best places to enjoy some very tasteful delights.

He had told me about the menu, even showed me pictures of the food, but it wasn't until I took my first bite of their pork belly bao that I knew I was hooked.

We knew we had to try the bao and the burgers so we ordered both.  When the bao arrived to the table, they both looked so appealing, making my mouth water.  

The pork belly was a big strip of pork  which was decent in size, with a layer of fat and a crispy skin.  The cilantro and pickled mustard greens with peanuts pulled it all together.

The Peking duck bao was good with a hoisin sauce and cucumbers, but it was the pork belly bao that stood out.

We ordered their Fat Choy Burger which made the top 10 burger list, but we asked for the egg over hard, I don't care for runny yolks. The angus beef patty was juicy and cooked to perfection and the braised short ribs were so tender it almost melted in my mouth.

I loved the onion jam mixed with the secret sauce, and talk about full strips of bacon, loved it.  I was told the bun comes from La Brea Bakery it was so yummy.
