GJ_bXUPv672YwNg4TneJog Highly overpriced! $6 USD 6.8 oz imported soda water. Sounds mai is ok but not special enough at $15 USD for six pieces served in an oversized bamboo steamer (over compensating). I am from Manhattan so used to pricey dinner meal items but with quality and special unique concept. Better off getting traditional dim sum.
