yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I found the after party guys! It's at Pho Kim Long! 

Ok, I will probably have to re-visit this review because when I was here, I was intoxicated and I seriously thought that my food was heavent sent. So, for now, we'll go off my only experience...

Love this place for the fact that it's open late, service is fast, and the food was perfect (for being in my condition, atleast). My girlfriend ordered a beef and broccoli dish which I was eating off her plate - GOOD, I had combination pho of some sort - GOOD. For these reasons, I am def'ly going back. Yes, my food was additionally delicious b/c I had a few drinks in, but friends and family have gone here several times and raved about the food, so, I am sure it would be just as good sober.

FINAL ANSWER: I found my pho place in Las Vegas! Def'ly must come here especially after a night out drinking.
