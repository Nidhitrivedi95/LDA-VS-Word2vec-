TYEQ38ONpmYMYv378IByhw Always find myself coming back here for their Salted Egg and Pork congee. By far the best I've tried compared to many bigger congee franchises in the GTA. Afternoon tea special is of great value as well. Large portions with free iced drinks from bubble tea to red bean drink (many places charge extra). Too bad it doesn't start until 3pm. 

On the weekends, it can get super busy so expect to have to wait. Also, they don't accept credit unless you order $10 or more. Unfortunately, the place (floors, tables) were a bit on the dirtier side in my opinion. If they had kept their place a bit cleaner they would get 5 stars in my books.
