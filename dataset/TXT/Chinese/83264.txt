hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Yum!  I think I had the pork noodle soup - but definitely the fresh noodles in it.  You get a choice of several different kinds, including rice and flour.  The kitchen is open and you can watch them making the noodles; it's a fascinating process.  There was enough soup in the gigantic bowl for three people, too, and the prices are very modest indeed, so it's a fantastic value.  

I will definitely return to sample other things on the menu.  It's very telling that the place was packed with Asian people, several of whom were kind enough to point out what they were eating when I asked.
