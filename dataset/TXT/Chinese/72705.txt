fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA Our family lives in Toronto and have been going here for quite a while. They took us last week and WOW were these WONDERFUL. The pork and chives pan fried dumplings were delicious. Hubby who has only tried steamed was a little leery of the dumplings but ended up trying and really liking them. We will definitely go back to the Dumpling House on our next trip to Toronto! We just wish we had this type of restaurant here in DC.
