Once my girlfriend and I went to RG for dinner, and about 20 minutes after ordering the waiter came out and apologized for the delay.  The kitchen had lost our order.  To apologize, the manager brought out a free appetizer and entree.  On top of that he waived the entire cost of the meal.  RG really cares about its customers.
