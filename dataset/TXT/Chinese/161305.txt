udKD_WVoQZYww1sDYdebPw I visited this restaurant for the first time for lunch. I have recently changed offices and my usual Chinese restaurant is a fair distance away by car. 

I ordered the fried rice noodles with beef and bean sprouts. I was pleased that his place had it on the menu. It was tasty. The beef was a bit tough, at times, but it wasn't the case with every bite. 

The place is cramped. I managed to get a seat, but it can be busy. The parking lot is crazy, thanks to the Tim Horton's. My friend had a chicken dish with a lot of mixed vegetables and cashews. He actually got confused eating it because there was far too much going on with his dish and said that he wouldn't try it again. 

It's unfortunate that there isn't soup that comes with the lunch meal. I'd give this place four stars if it did.
