C1JNZrYl3H-YzF1dys9SoQ I chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews and was overall pleased.

Menu:
Ginger Beef - highly recommend, gotta love spice though!
Peanut Chicken - recommend
Chicken Balls - recommend
House Special Rice - bland, tasted better with soya sauce
Vegi Spring Rolls - blah, pass.

I opted for delivery. The gentleman taking my order was very pleasant and the food arrived uber fast.

Lastly - make sure to request fortune cookies. They didn't include them, and what's Chinese food without the fun little fortunes? :)
