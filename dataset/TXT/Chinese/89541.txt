ENVIRONMENT - Great date night restaurant. Decor and ambiance is exotic. We felt seated very comfortably and could chat away without the background music or other tables being too loud.

SERVICE - Friendly and prompt.

FOOD - Both the noodle dishes just didn't feel quite right.. but that's probably why it's Asian-fusion.
+ Pho (beef and meatballs) - This was approx $8, and it was a good size, with generous amounts of beansprouts. However, this is not your traditional Pho broth - you're better off going to a legit Viet place for pho. The beef was also the thick slices of beef, which I'm not used to. Pho usually comes with the thinly sliced beef. Not a fan of this here.

+ Spicy seafood noodle soup - Approx $12. The waitress asked me the level of spiciness I preferred. I told them mild, but this noodle soup was far from mild. It wasn't even spicy at all, you can probably increase your level of spiciness if you're more tolerant.  This is a  little more on the expensive side for noodle soups... which they try to make up for it by offering more tilapia fish fillets in the noodles.  It also comes with shrimp which was not very flavourful. I don't think I'll get this again next time either...

+ Thai Iced tea - $3. This was the only item on the menu that I thought was authentic. For those who have not ordered Thai iced tea before - it's on the sweet side fyi!  

I probably wouldn't be coming back if I'm in this area..
