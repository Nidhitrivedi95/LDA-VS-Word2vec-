vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA I've never actually had dim sum before, and this place came highly recommended.  My friend got there before me and waited in line to get us a table at lunch.  (Yes, there seems to be a line there. Always.)  The place is loud and busy, and nothing too fancy- wouldn't be much a date spot, but delicious to go for lunch or dinner with a friend. servers come by with carts of many dish options and you can choose which small plates you would like to get.  We ordered about 4-5 plates and the bill was about $30.  Overall, very good, affordable, and a fun dining experience.
