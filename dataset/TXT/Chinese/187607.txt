yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA The food here is awesome! Always made fresh and tasty. This spot is one of my favorite places to eat! Its also open 24 hrs. My only problem with this place is the service. Sometimes i never get checked on or get a refil.... Cant go wrong with anything i order, i know i will like it! They also have bobba drinks to which is a plus.
