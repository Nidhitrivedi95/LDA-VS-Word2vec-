bCa0CY4F74N5lCEVOquKkg My friends and I decided to go here when we walked by on a whim. We looked up the menu before entering and was excited for the type of food served here. We started with the dim sum with the pork belly bites and pepperoni arancini. Both dim sum choices were delicious. For entrees, the crispy pig face roulade and seared hanger steak were selected. Although the pig face roulade was good, there was not much to the plate so it left me wanting more. The same feeling was with the seared hanger steak. It left us feeling more. The one redeeming factor were the drinks. I highly recommend Jambie the Genie and Scorpion. Not only were they a lovely combination of liquor but the cups they came in were awesome. The food was good but I would hesitate to go back because of the serving size to price ratio.
