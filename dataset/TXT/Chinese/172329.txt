w0ArxcJ0XsyK1ZwrIf3gpA Tony and I stopped by for a bite to eat on fight night.  My thinking was eat and flee, but we were very surprised at this down home real bar environment. As we entered we heard "The Voice", that of course being Jake (lol).  What a suprise, he made us feel at home right away, I was even enlisted to pull names for the drawing (yeay) anyway the food is off the chain, drinks very good and the feel of this place is just like ....hummmmmmmm  kinda like "Cheers" that T.V. show.  I must say that we have adopted this place as our new hang out. It takes certain personalities to make or break a place and I must say Jake you are the Best!!  We will see you again!
