AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw I really wanted to love this place especially because I like supporting neighborhood restaurants instead of the big chains.  However, the food is just marginal.  The egg roll was so small, lacked flavor and was very mushy - perhaps it was a frozen variety?  The cashew chicken had very little chicken and cashews and way too many mushrooms.  The mongolian beef was okay, but not the best I've ever had.  Ordered the crispy honey chicken for the kiddos and it should have been called the mushy chicken.  I think if they would infuse some more flavor to their menu then this could be a great place.
