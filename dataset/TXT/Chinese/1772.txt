-UPP0Q_kZsuQ2zZ1k7lbyQ Tasty Delight has been at the Finch & Leslie Square for years, under various names, but the food has always been the same -- Hong Kong Cafe food, mixing Chinese stir-fry dishes with steaks and other Western fare.  The food here ranges from average to great.  Its lemongrass pork chops are maybe the best I've had anywhere, better than the Xe Lua Vietnamese/Thai restaurant in the same mall.  The black-pepper chicken steak is slightly above average, with a sauce that's hot but not fragrant enough, but the texture of the chicken steak is good.  The mixed steak platter is a bit disappointing, with the sausage being pretty mediocre, and it's filling but not especially delicious.

However, one big plus of this place is the service.  The staff is more friendly than at most other Chinese eateries, and seating is pretty comfortable.
