DQMaUSbKsRtB5lJD3egqxQ Ordered food here and was happy to see that they were open early as a lot of the other places in the area seemed to open much later.  I called and was put on hold for about five minutes so I hung up. I got a call back to place the order but I should have stayed away.

I ultimately ordered the spring roll and the spicy chicken fried rice.  I got spring rolls and regular fried rice. This was a big problem because the regular fried rice looks like it was boiled in chicken broth with a few veggies tossed in it.  It would have been salvageable if I got some chili packets but that wasn't the case.  

I called and went over my situation with the the person that answered and was told that she couldn't do anything because her driver wasn't there and neither was the manager. I didn't see why this was a problem and suggested that she place a new order and have the driver deliver it when he gets back. That made a lot of sense to me but made no sense to the person that answered for some reason.  

This was a bad experience all around.  This was my first time here and it will definitely be my last.
