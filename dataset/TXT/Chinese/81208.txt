GxSxxnnUkLJrfR2aznPLPg I went here for Mothers Day, very disappointed. The place was nearly empty and now I know why. No variety in sushi, they all tasted the same. The sushi at the grocery stores tastes fresher. The tempura was horrible, it was not proper tempura batter, it was heavy and greasy. Definitely will not be returning.
