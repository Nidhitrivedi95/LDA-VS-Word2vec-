bzMO8LJmJtgo3KuyWGKUxA We always come here when we're craving noodle soup. The sides are definitely the best part. They are so cheap and well portioned. Our go to sides are rolled onion pancake with beef (amazing but oily), fried squid tentacles (okay but cheap to fulfill the craving), and sliced beef in chili sauce (we ask for no ox tongue - great flavor). We've tried their beef and chicken skewers but I'm not a fan of cumin which this is drenched in. 

In terms of mains, we order sliced noodle in braised beef and ramen noodle in sliced beef. Both are good since the broth is light and clean. The beef is soft.
