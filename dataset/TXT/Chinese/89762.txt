IAqyeVG1ZMrv7hiV3FAB6Q There is very little redeeming about this place.  The food is subpar and frankly just bad in most cases.  I sampled 10 items and the only thing remotely good was the rice and frankly how could they F up rice?  I literally will never come here again and in hoping and hoping I don't end up sick before the end of the day.

Side note: It took 2 hours before I was sick.  I should have known better.

The building is old and dirty.  I don't see their health dept rating but I doubt it has an A in it.  Yuck.  I think I need a shower now.
