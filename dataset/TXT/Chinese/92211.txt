IpQG7s5l7ba5NxyzTxn7pg Great restaurant for Mothers Day and Easter because it's not busy during these holiday lunches. White tablecloths. Service is very good, and you can talk, as tables are somewhat close together. Extensive menu, and you can ask for anything off the menu. We always take home leftovers, so plenty of food. Have called in for carryout at dinner. Then this is a busy place.
