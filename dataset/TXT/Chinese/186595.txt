YBIhTjmEH3IEZW4Dr5ReRA Very delicious!!!! I truly judge a place by their egg rolls and by golly this place has the best egg rolls I've ever tasted lol.  Had the shrimp Lo mein, egg foo young with white rice. The portions are pretty big too!  Treated my daughter out and had plenty of left overs!!!  We both love it!
