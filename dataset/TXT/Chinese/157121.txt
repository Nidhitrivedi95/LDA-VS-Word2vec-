tsUFlp2DQw7Nk2I9mRL2hg This place is awesome. We always order to-go and the food is hot and fresh. The vegetable fried rice is some of the best I've ever had. The chili chicken with gravy is a MUST. Almost everyone who comes here usually orders that. We order it mild because it tends to be a little too spicy for my taste, but other than that it's great. Don't let the appearance of the place keep you from coming in and giving it a try.
