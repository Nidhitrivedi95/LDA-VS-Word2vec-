_j2EtQtgLuXGRBfbM5YwZA This place was really fantastic. First off we needed a place to grab a snack before dinner. We both enjoyed a very large and generous pot of jasmine tea. Next we enjoyed pot stickers and crab ragoons. Both were fantastic. Very large portions and more than we needed. We took some of it back to the room. The service was great and we watched the football game while enjoying our food. Will be back!
