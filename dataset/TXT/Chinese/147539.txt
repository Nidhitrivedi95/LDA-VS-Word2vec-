Good edamame.   
The salad was good, not great.  My salad was a bit smaller than hers.  Dressing was good.  I liked the fried egg noodles in there.  

I got the basil chicken on recommendations here and was pleased, nice strong interaction with the peppers and onions. Chicken was well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  

Wife (vegetarian) got the mixed vegetables with brown sauce.  Her flavors were a little too subtle for her taste.  She never adds salt to her meals but needed to on this.  

I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. It's a step up from your normal strip mall Chinese but not nearly as good as Thai House, Vietnam Grille, PF Changs or Enso. 

Dinner prices are a bit high - but I guess they have to pay the Stonecrest rent somehow.
