gwo0iQlgQIKGXGTJYqWc7w We love Jin Jin.. the lady at the front who answers the phone is always very nice... a little hard to understand sometimes but still very sweet. we love the Egg rolls, the crab and cream cheese Rangoons, and General Tao's Chicken! The ONLY bad thing I will say is... You cant get Swt. tea without lemon floating in it... the make and package the tea in Soup containers and all of them have lemon in them and I hate lemon!! 
Overall a really yummy place... but I do agree they do need some updating and renovations.
