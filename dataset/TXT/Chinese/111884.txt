MBirSnTW4pt2k7Ny6KC72w If I was able to take away the one star that I gave this restaurant, I would. The food was pure trash. I had to pay a $12 minimum plus a delivery fee and when the driver arrives, she expected me to leave my warm home and run out to her car in the rain.  The whole purpose of delivery is to 'deliver' the food to me. 

I ordered their General Tso's chicken but there was a memo that I didn't get. They decided to substitute my chicken for tofu, which I personally think is the most disgusting thing known to man. It was so bad I threw the shit away and ordered a pizza. Definitely a waste of the 90 long minutes I waited for delivery from a place that's a mile away. 

The best part of my meal was the shrimp rolls.  Not that they were exquisite or anything but they were edible and had actual shrimp. The fries were soggy.  

If you want Chinese food, stay away from this place. Don't be lured by their cheap prices. It's cheap for a reason.  You have been warned!
