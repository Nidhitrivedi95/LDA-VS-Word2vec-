pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA I was recommended to SushiSamba for a "date night." I made reservations just in case. I had to call back twice and adjust the amount of guest and time  but they didn't give me a hard time which was nice.
I thought it'd be a little more "upscale" so I definitely felt we were a tad overdressed. No biggie though! 
With it being our first time there, we were a little overwhelmed when our server told us about everything. So we opted for the option that Issac,the server, would choose everything for us.
It was a three course meal and it allowed us to try a little bit of everything they had on special for the night.
I don't remember the names of anything we had lol but EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. Though it sounded like we wouldn't get full, we both agreed the portions were perfect. Not too filling but definitely enough. There was space for dessert so that was perfect.
The staff was very helpful and speedy with their service! Issac was so great to us and very informative. Everything he suggested we had, starting from the drinks all the way to the dessert. $160 for two to eat= Great pricing!
