yfxDa8RFOvJPQh0rNtakHA I am currently sitting in the middle of the dining room feeling as if no care is given by management.Horrible and disrespectful service.  food came out very fast but was extremely cold as if it was cooked an hour ago. Actually it was a fried egg roll and it was cold inside and out so of course it has been sitting for a long time. When we asked for the food to be hot, the waiter said, "it is hot". such bad service and I am even taking in consideration that it is an Asian restaurant where service is not the number 1 concern or priority. I am sitting in my seat right now waiting for a manager, getting looks from my waitress as if I am lying about cold food. Unbelievable.
