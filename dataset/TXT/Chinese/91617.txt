ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg I expected David Lo Pan to appear as I ate my meal (villain from Big Trouble in Little China). This restaurant reminds me of his lair and I remind myself of Jack Burton (Kurt Russell). Eating dim sum is a pretty great way to wrap up the weekend on a nice quiet morning/afternoon. 

Lo Pan: And now, my beloved disciples. The moment of truth... the needle of love.
