t6ZIBNrQjvtwor8W-u3sUg From a Mott St. regular. Finally, Chinse food I can eat without having to go to the strip, and Cantonese doesn't seem popular in Vegas' China Town. I've tried every place in a radius from W. Lake Mead north Tulley Springs and from Buffalo east to NLV. Never finished a meal at any. Stumbled here thanx to the reviews.
 
I always test a new place with wonton soup (oh my, the real NY style crispy noodles), chow fun, beef and broccoli, and pork fried rice. Hard to believe any Chinese place could mess these up. but they have. The broc was bright, fresh and crisp, and the beef lean and tender. The soup was packed w/ fresh veggies and tasty quality dumplings. The fried rice, how can they afford to give so much, it will feed me for a week.

Ordered over phone and had it delivered. Okay now this review might start to sound fake, cause I ain't foolin 35 mins. later it was piping hot at my door. No s-- t. i have waited up to 90 min in this town for my food to be delivered. Losing not only my sanity but my appetite. Both the driver and the order taker was very friendly. 

Worked up a hunger gonna eat some Chop Chop leftovers.
