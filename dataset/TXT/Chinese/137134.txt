This place is pretty cute inside. Some might say overdecorated and cliche but it's unique to vegas at least. The decor is stereotypical Beijing chic. 

For the two of us we ordered jampong (seafood soup) with no noodles, jajangmein (black bean noodle) and tonsiu yuk ( fried pork). The jampong is super spicy. If you're not into spicy foods I would avoid this because it definitely has a kick. It doesn't have as much seafood as other places but the broth is stronger and more flavorful. 

The black bean noodle was good. It's not too salty and the flavor is mild. The tong Siu yuk was really good. The quality of the meat was much better than anywhere I've had it. It's lean pork meat with not too much batter and the sauce added sweet and vinegary notes to the dish.
