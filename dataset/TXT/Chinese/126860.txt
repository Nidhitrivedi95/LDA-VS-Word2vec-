P7r8DnVRIVfEhwl14x7zbg I've been here a couple of times and I absolutely love the dumplings!!! I go here with my brother just to eat the dumplings but I have tried their other items as well and it is pretty decent. If you're right on budget I would suggest getting any type of the dumplings and fried rice and you're good to go!! Would definitely come back again :) the dumplings costs $5.99 for 15 piece and the fried rice is in the 10$ range.
