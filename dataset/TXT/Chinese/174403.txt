wcn_uRigm1UXqjOEGW7ufw I recently purchased a plate of orange chicken and teriyaki chicken from this place with a Thai tea.  While the chicken was okay, I was very displeased with the boba inside of the Thai tea.  It was like biting into rubber balls and did not leave a good feeling in my mouth.  Would not but this tea again.
