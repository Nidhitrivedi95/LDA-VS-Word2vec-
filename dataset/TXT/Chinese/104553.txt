kP2wC0luve3mT5fcdrA3nQ I wish I could give this more stars, I really do.  They had good food and service for a great price.  

Unfortunately there was a man having lunch in the restaurant who was OBNOXIOUSLY SHOUTING rather than talking.  So loud, I could barely hear myself think when I was reading the menu.  I understand he was elderly,  BUT HE WAS SCREAMING.  Not to mention the things he was shouting were totally inappropriate like 'kids seeing naked men for the first time' and 'where to buy dynamite'.  

When I asked a waitress if she would say something to him, she just said "he's been coming here for years, he just can't hear well".  I understand that he's a regular,  but if they EVER want to gain any new regulars (like younger people who spend more money...) they need to tell this guy to QUIET DOWN!!!
