9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw I have been here three times with my friends since it open. Good variety of soup bases and dipping sauce to choose from. I am not a big fan of Sichuan hotpot. So, the level of spicy is perfect for me. 
I believe the atmosphere is one of the best in Vegas Chinese restaurant. They have everything I want: vegetables, variety of mushrooms and torus, shrimp, crawfish, clam, fish/beef ball, seaweed salad and so much more. 
The only thing I am concerning about is the bowl is a little small and the place is little hard to find it when I first time come to here. 
I would recommended this place to my friends and love to come back.
