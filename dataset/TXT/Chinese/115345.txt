n0bg7kf6HcpFchCtxJyc5A We went for a friends birthday. Our reservation for 9 was delayed because they needed to set the table. We ended up being sat where the food comes out and every time a waiter passed by our chairs our my friends head was bumped with a tray. After the table behind us was finished, they said they were not resetting the area and we were fine for the rest of dinner. 
The food was ok. We did the pre fix menu and let them choose the best dishes. Like I said the food was ok, from what I have heard we didn't get the best. The walnut shrimp was really good. The desserts were great. And the staff was great. 
For the about you pay for a meal, there are better options in town
