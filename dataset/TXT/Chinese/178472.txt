x3JHj5h33ouzw_Ynj-utJg Do not go on a Saturday night if you're a couple, as most of their tables are for large groups. It took close to an hour for them to sit us down, but with such a high rating on this site we thought it was worth the wait. The food was fine but they sat us down at a make-shift table with cheap fold-out chairs held by tape. When you pay the same as everybody else, you expect to sit at a proper table like everybody else. It was disappointing. It made it difficult for us to enjoy the food. 
I spoke to the manager about it and his response was that we didn't have to sit there.  But what does one do when you're hungry and don't want to take the chance it would be even longer for another table. That's just rude.
I may try to give this place another chance, but next time we're going as a group with a reserved table.
