rEAFZFziiOWxSLsOLohccQ Another great dinner tonight just 2 days since my first dining experience here, & equally as great! I took my two aunts who also really enjoyed the fresh & flavorful dishes. We all really love the snow pea sprouts sautéed in garlic. Bright green, fresh & clean tasting. Tonight we tried the clams in black bean & garlic sauce and they were delicious. It's such a treat to find a great restaurant in this area that is not a chain or franchise! Joanne the owner is a delight along with her family...just a warm & lovely experience!
