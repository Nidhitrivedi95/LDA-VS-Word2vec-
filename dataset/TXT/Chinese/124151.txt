Oq76C1wZosdT0ZrA3dJPxQ Chuan Wang Fu has taken over ownership of the Umai Japanese restaurant. They haven't replaced the signs yet, but if you approach the door you will see a handwritten chalk board with the Chuan Wang Fu name and specials listed! 
My husband and I visited this location on a Sunday evening around 4pm with a group of Mandarin speaking friends who claimed this was the talk of the Chinese community for authentic Szechuan cuisine. We did family style, ordering several dishes to share and we feasted on spicy squid, sautéed eggplant in soy sauce, chicken with scallions, green beans, spicy beef with peppers, steamed snow pea leaves and a couple other Chinese dishes that no one knew how what to call in English. 
The authenticity of the food was verified by the happily fed Chinese people with us and so if authentic Szechuan Chinese food is what you are seeking, look not further! The only other verified restaurant in the area is Lee's cafe in Fort Mill.
