S1N5-ZXwR4fUIPs6dLnBYQ Not too bad Pho! Ordered pho a couple of times here but it seems to me that it has changed since the last time I was here. I'm not an onion fan at all and when they brought the soup out I saw onions. Usually it's just broth, noodles and whatever meat which a little bit of green onions. But this time they added onions...totally disappointed. The soup was good and to top it all off you can create your own for $7.95. Their watermelon juice is delicious, you can tell it's fresh. Strawberry slush was way too sweet! 
Overall, this place was okay! The service was kind of slow, it took about 10 minutes for us to order and I had wave the waiter down to try to get the their attention. Prices are great, clean, and cool fish tank in the middle for the kids to enjoy.
