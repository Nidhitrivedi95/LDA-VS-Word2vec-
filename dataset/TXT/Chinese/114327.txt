mwERWE8IqgcmPHg3cpCfNA I'm giving this place 3 stars - 2 for food, and one for being non-smoking, a rare commodity in this area.

Like many places in the area, they serve both Thai and Chinese.  I guess there's not enough demand for pure Thai restaurants, so the Thai places serve Chinese dishes as well.

They have a good selection of lunch specials.  The food was just average - a little greasy, not super flavorful, though there was a good amount of it.

If you need a respite from the smoke, pop in for a Thai Ice Tea.  If you want good Thai food, I'd look elsewhere, unless you're stuck in the area and need to find food pronto.
