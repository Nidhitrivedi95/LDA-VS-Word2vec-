z_zyOfFO-OIYgCR5hstyTw Tried for first time and came away impressed.  It's not gourmet, but it's a great place for a quick bite that's a step between a pricier joint and take out. 

The food was fresh and surprisingly tasty.  The server had no problems with the custom orders our group threw at him.  The menu isn't adventurous but the  Pad Thai,  Basil Spring Rolls and even our kid's Fried Rice was pretty good and came in large portions that provided lunch the next day. The stir fry was light and fresh and wasn't drowning in sauce. 

It's right outside the Great Northern movie theatre so it's definitely going to be a spot we go to before a family movie.
