DtAND35Vc4dY7usrGtbR7w Best Chinese food I've had since I've been in the metro Cleveland area. The staff was friendly and attentive. I never saw the bottom my my glass. I recommend the Sesame Chicken. This place is a far cry from another Chinese restaurant in the area we had to walk out of because the host was coughing crap up, he may have had an incurable case of SARS.
