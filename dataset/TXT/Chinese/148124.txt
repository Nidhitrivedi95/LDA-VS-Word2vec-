sePTDv1dGHPID7kwuNzXaA Super cheap eats in Markham area.  They have a lot of variety of congees and delicious handmade fresh steamed noodles (aka rice rolls).  The chinese doughnuts were deep fried nicely with a nice golden colour.  It is definitely a legit HK style restaurant.  It's located inside the Market Village mall.
