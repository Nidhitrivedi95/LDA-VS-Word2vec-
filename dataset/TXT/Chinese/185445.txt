y-jepn_1nL1OipL7lNnRMA This place doesn't take reservations and doesn't enforce a time limit. The space is small so you can imagine the waits. We had a party of 8 and we were forced to wait almost an hour before the waiters told the previous customers to hurry it up, when they we're clearly just chilling. I definitely wasn't impressed with how they run business. 

Also, the soup base cost $25, on top of the already overpriced cost per person. I ended paying $40 after tax and tips. The food was good but not that amazing to warrant the $$$$ price tag. And let me tell you.... The waiter/person collecting our bill had the audacity to count our money in front of us and DEMAND for more tips, saying its usually 10-15%. Well did you ever think about how awful your service attitude is?! Tip is not mandatory. 

Never coming back.
