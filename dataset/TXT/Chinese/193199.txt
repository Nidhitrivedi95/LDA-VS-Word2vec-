ZCzey5aPhd7jYIoHsUfjmQ Every time I've come here it has been awesom i live right up the street so its nice to be able to walk up and have a drink and some food! The staff definitely makes the experience! Just from the start the hostess Savanah was a breath of fresh air even in the middle of a friday night dinner rush she got us water while we waited and everything i know how hard it is to keep a smile on your face during busy time! The servers are on top of shit too i love efficiency with a smile kick ass guys!!!!!! We love you Clever Koi!
