hcFSc0OHgZJybnjQBrL_8Q Love that there is now an authentic noodle house in pittsburgh- definitely reminiscent of the joints I found in Hong Kong. The noodles are made freshly in front of you - and you can taste it! I enjoy the beef soup and the pork noodles - the meat quality is not the best I've ever had, but it is always tasty and acceptable for the price. Some of the preparations haven't been my favorite - the Dan Dan noodles were a little too peanuty for my liking- but definitely have had good experiences overall and go back frequently.
