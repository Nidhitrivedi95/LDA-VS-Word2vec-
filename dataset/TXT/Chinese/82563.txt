haeyExjSiJNENQKTxTmiPQ I am giving two star because, Faley used to be better, at least the Rexdale location where I went first. The food is so so. It is family owned and operated and everyone is pretty friendly. 

The good part is all their chicken dishes can be ordered not breaded and fried, but you got to it right there will it's hot and your are hungry. 

And that's that :-).
