kABF0hYfAEnl166mn1zR1A I have ate here a few times. It's a good lunch spot. The food is delicious and the ambience is nice. I knocked off a star only because it's not fresh noodles...well yes they are raw noodles but they are not made in house. I was under that impression but I saw huge bags of noodles getting delivered while I was there. I know it's not a big complaint but I guess the brat in me is writing this review. Noodle man should make their own noodles and display it :)
