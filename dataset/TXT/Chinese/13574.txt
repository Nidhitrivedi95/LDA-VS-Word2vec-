2YBO1LEKIgyle0uX50u15Q Opted not to go with the house special beef noodles as my friends did, figuring I'd be getting my greasy fill soon enough at some buffet.  I got the "Sai-Men noodle Aloha Style (Broth)"

Saimin - I don't think any local Hawaiian would mistake this for something you'd order on the islands.  No charsiu - they used boiled chicken.  Huge piece of fried sweet potato tempura on top - not sure where that came from. And mushrooms....  That being said, it was pretty good.  Light flavors as I was hoping and a nice delicate broth.  Noodles are definitely Chinese - straight and a bit thicker than normal saimin in Hawaii.

Friend's Homestyle Spicy Braised Beef Shank Ramen looked really good too.  

Mongolian beef and Garlic Tofu / Eggplant dishes were also good. Not super spicy but they do requests for that. 

Sitting at the counter is also fun as you get to watch the old school cooks do their thing.

Service was great.  The guy in charge of the counter customers was very attentive and our food came out quickly. 

Another good sign was that 95% of the customers were Chinese.
