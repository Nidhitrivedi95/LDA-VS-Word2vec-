EZUhUW3S8qG9kEfnkWlZxg Fung Lam has become my new dim sum hotspot for those mornings when I'm craving their great variety of Chinese food staples. Ive been here on multiple occasions and the staff has been consistently friendly each visit. The food is always great and all the traditional items are right on point. Compared to other Chinese restaurants their service here is always pleasant and courteous no matter how busy it gets.

Edit: after multiple visits (4 approx) during peak dim sum hours it's clear that there are issues with consistency.  It doesn't detract greatly from the overall quality but would be a nice issue to fix.
