966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA I've returned to Wendy's several times since my first review six months ago.  The b/f and I have brought friends and family, some local and some from out of town.  Everyone has enjoyed the food, the service, and most of all, Wendy herself.  What a gracious hostess every time we visit. We came back again to have an early birthday celebration for Chad S.  I had the delicious mango shrimp salad, always a favorite choice that never disappoints.  We also brought our own birthday cake for Chad, his favorite Red Velvet from a different restaurant. Wendy and her staff had no problem putting it in the back and bringing it out with the candles we supplied at the requested time.  They even sliced it up for us--what service!  Wendy has become like family and we'll keep coming back for the food, service, and hospitality.
