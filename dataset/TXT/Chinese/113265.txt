MNwJ-40jcDZakqEQP4bk4g Family run and what nice people. Great service. Awesome sushi..... The sushi chef is from China town in NY and let me tell you he is amazing. He works Thur-Sunday. He just trained a new guy to cover his days off and he is very good as well. But if you have a chance go, go Thurs-Sun. The taste as well as presentation is unreal. They have a tempora house special that is to die for. I go once every two weeks sometimes more. I think im going to go again today because writing this review is making me hungry.
