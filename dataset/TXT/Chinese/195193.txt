I believe this is a restaurant suffering from identity crisis...Meaning I'm not sure what exactly I'm eating? They try to mix Korean with Japanese and with Chinese and Western flavour, so in the end the food comes out in a confusing taste. 

I ordered a Japanese yam cake and some brussel sprouts. The yam cake was kind of mushy and too moist, and it was overly salty drizzled in oyster sauce and topped with mayo (?!). I've been to Guu, so I think that's what they're aiming at. But it's farrr from the Guu quality. Didnt' like it. 

The brussel sprouts had kimchi made of apples (very confusing) and rice mixed with chili and cheese bits...okay? It was my way of getting fibre so I ate them all. But the brussel sprouts were very burnt and unevenly tasted. 

My friend ordered their signature ramen with pork belly. The soup was tasty and flavourfull. But I think for $14 I can get better from Kenzo ramen. 

Once was all I need!
