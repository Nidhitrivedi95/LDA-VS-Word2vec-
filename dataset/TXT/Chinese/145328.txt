S-RaYhvlDg8rgEOxaFeLHw OMG! The Szechuan beef dish smelled like rotten flesh.
I have a strong stomach so I thought lets taste it to see .. WOW! It melted in my mouth like it was predigested and tasted like sh__. I've never experienced anything this foul in my life .. disgusting!
The management only offered me a credit and had no explanation whatsoever. Since I will never eat from this fine establishment ever again, they get to keep my credit.
What a nightmare .. I don't even know if I was eating beef or something imitating beef
