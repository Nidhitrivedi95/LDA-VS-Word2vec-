fzHBvd0HZm1yB3UIMqZ3bA Try  Ding Tai Fung's 
Xiao Long Bao (a.k.a. soup dumpling)
Snow peas sprout and black(or Chinese) mushroom
Wonton
Pan-fried pork dumpling

Green onion pancake was good. Wonton was spicy --they had housemade wonton which was the mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and red chili oil - I can make it at home...but eat it here, otherwise I'd have to tip myself.

Yum at Ding Tai Fung!!
