I got the general tso's chicken,  my husband got the sesame chicken. Admittedly, you can BARELY tell the difference between them in flavor. It's very subtle, but the general tso's seemed to have a bit more spice. We were pleasantly surprised that the sauses were NOT at all goopy, gloppy, or gelatinous. It seems that so much chinese food has sauce that is more like jelly than sauce.

We also each got a chicken egg roll. Delicious, and different. I've never had a chicken egg roll before. Chicken was flavorful and not bland.

Delivery time through grubhub was timely.

We will order again, I'm sure!
