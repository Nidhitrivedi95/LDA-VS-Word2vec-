vx4YAA02Qz6khRD1fZ1MFA This place can get very populated during lunch and dinner hours so beware of the long lines! If you're looking to eat some authentic Chinese food, then this is the place to try! It recently undergone renovation in another area of the casino which made it way better. It is now more spacious with more tables and chairs. The interior looks extremely nice - modernized and brightly lit. I noticed that they started using a tablet to take orders which is a pretty neat transition.
You can come here during lunch time for some yummy dim sum or visit during dinner time for authentic Chinese dishes. My family loves to come here all the day and it's reasonably priced for the food. The service was really nice especially since the host always made sure everything was okay and if we needed anything else. The food also comes out quick. There's A LOT to choose from in the menu.

I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!
