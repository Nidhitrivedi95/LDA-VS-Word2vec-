n8KZA9G4FvGqDBWIscpz9Q Stopped by this place with my mom on a whim while out shopping. It's really unassuming looking outside, but the inside is nicely set up and pretty relaxing atmosphere. 
They have a big selection, including duck, chow fun, even some Thai stuff, etc.
I got the orange chicken combo and it was quite good, it was spicy and orangey and didn't taste quite the same as everyone elses' typical recipes. The egg drop soup was pretty good. I'll probably stop in here now when I go shopping.
