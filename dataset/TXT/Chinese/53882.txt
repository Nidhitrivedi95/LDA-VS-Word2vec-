The highlights here is they've got some premium dishes commonly found in asian restaurants like peking duck; red bean, black sesame seed, green tea ice cream flavours etc. The dessert section is almost similar to the Mandarin's having fruits, cakes and waffles. They have a mini noodle soup section which is quite unique. I'd say the grill and barbeque section is the best; best section in the restaurant and the best bbq grill feature compared to other buffets that have bbq.
