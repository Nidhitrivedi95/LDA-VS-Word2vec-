JRRduMZI2aU3UCjfNEQURA A must-try in the Montreal food scene. Over 50 types of dumpling ranging from vegetarian to lamb. An order of dumplings comes with 15 per order and one order typically ranges $10-13 depending on fillings. 

You can order your dumplings steamed or fried. I recommend one order of each style. Lamb and beef are better fried while the seafood and vegetarian are better steamed. 

We had shrimp with zucchini, beef with coriander, lamb with green onion, and oyster with pork and pickled cabbage. All were SO GOOD! 

Previous reviews said cash only but we had no issue with our cards. Perhaps depends on your carrier.
