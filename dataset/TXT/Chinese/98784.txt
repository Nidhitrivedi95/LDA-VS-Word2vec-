JTNdV6u3DK-wcqX7ZXl5hw Not sure why I waited 5 years to eat here living nearby the whole time but had a great lunch! Pei wei spicy chicken w peapods carrots and white rice lunch size with a drink for less than $10. I like that I can actually tell I'm eating white meat chicken! Very fresh and tasty but next time I will go for extra spicy option, although very flavorful the chicken was barely spicy. From what I saw at other tables, I'll be coming back to try more!
