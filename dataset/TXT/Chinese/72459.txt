fGurvC5BdOfd5MIuLUQYVA I have found the Holy Grail of dumplings and it's located in Chinatown, Toronto!

Omg! This place is so awesome! I absolutely love dumplings and had to give this place a try. We walked in and waited for 10 mins to be seated. The service here is really fast so you will never have to wait too long. The menu has a list of dumplings but it also has a lot of other things. You can get the dumplings steamed or fried, we chose steamed. Its around $7 a plate and you get 15 pieces. We as usual ordered too much in our hunger and were left with three plates of dumplings (lamb, minced chicken and shrimp&veg). We also got the house noodles. The house noodles were excellent and so were the chicken and lamb dumplings. The shrimp was my least favourite but the lamb is definitely going to be my staple order.

Just righting this review is making me crave more dumplings, its very reasonably priced and the quantity is just amazing! You will leave with a heavy tummy and a not-so-light wallet ;)

PS: Don't forget to take cash.
