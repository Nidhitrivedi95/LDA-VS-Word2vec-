Called to order crispy chicken in garlic sauce. These were their exact words (I kid you not).

Me: "I will have the fried chicken in garlic sauce"

Rude Chinese: "Stir fry"

Me: "I would like the crispy fried chicken on your menu"

Rude Chinese: "look lady you want fried chicken wing go KFC this Chinese STIR FRY"

Me: beep (censored)


I've had it. I'm tired of these filthy low budget Chinese restaurants taking peoples money and treating them this way. I will NEVER eat here.
