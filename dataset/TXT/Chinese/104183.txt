Knnc473zh8m7IBC0oLTHkg Came here on a Friday night with a large group.  PF Changs was one of the very few places that was still taking reservations at a decent dinner time.
I figured things would be super slow since the place was totally packed.  But I was wrong.  Service was pretty good, and very fast.  Food was not only consistent, but actually better than PF Changs I've been to.
Also given the fact it was probably one of the cheapest places on the strip for decent food: major awesomeness!
