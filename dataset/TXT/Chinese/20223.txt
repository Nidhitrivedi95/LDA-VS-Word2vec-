5XIIUcmBADuz1h8W0QztVQ I was out of school by 9:30 a.m and with a serious craving for orange chicken. My local Chinese place did not open until 11 and I was starving. I drove past Panda Express on my way home and remembered they open at 10:00am. I had stopped coming to panda because the food always seems to sit out too long and it is always dry. Maybe it's because I was one of the first customers but food was crispy and fresh. Their orange chicken and chow mein are one of the best( besides homemade). Although prices are higher than the mom and pop owned Chinese food joints, it works great for emergencies like today.
