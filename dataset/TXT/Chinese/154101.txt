td-NOo-k4xhfVmO5X92uAg My boss and I love this place! Their lunch specials are rockin, $7.00 for more then enough food. They used to be all vegetarian, now they serve everything, but those healthy choices are still on the menu. I usually get the eggplant which is great. However their Dan Dan noodles are great on a cold day very hardy and warm.
