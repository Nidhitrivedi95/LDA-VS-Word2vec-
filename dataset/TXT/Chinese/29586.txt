966W5oXOBW0ZWhNYy0yjcA I order the NY steak and rice hear. I thought the steak could of had more flavor, but over it was good. It's good to know that their is another joint that I can turn to when I get tired of eating the same old great food on the strip. They serve a lot of HK style foods, like fish balls. And they gave garlic chicken wings. Like the famous words of Outkast "ain't no thang but a chicken wang"
