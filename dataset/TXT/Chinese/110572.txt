Lv9wzkvPrVG-VdPGcw53_A First time here. The food is isn't bad . Some dishes is very good but some dishes are not. Especially the fried rice was too greasy. At the end of the course the desert was good. I would give a 4 star but I have 3 star and will not come again because they didn't accept credit card. Restaurant like this should take credit card because it's not cheap. Who the hell carry $1000 dollar all the time?
