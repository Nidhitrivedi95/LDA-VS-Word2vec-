X8c23dur0ll2D9XTu-I8Qg Mediocre club. The resident DJ lineup is great, and if it wasn't for the talent this place would suck. From Above and Beyond to Tiesto to Showtek to Borgeous this place has great electro house, which is the next best thing for me since deep/tech house can't be found in LV clubs. Always get on the guestlist and as long as you're there early the line moves fast. Never have had a problem with bouncers although they're never really nice either. I guess this is the #1 spot to come get f****d up, there is always Lots of wasted tourists, everytime I come I have a problem with guys touching my girlfriend inappropriately. But I guess that's what happens when you mix alcohol with hot girls showing skin, although it never happens to the extent of Hakkasan lol. Anyways this place gets super crowded, good luck dancing, going to the bar, and going to the restrooms. Security constantly walking by to help the girls deliver bottles, they push you out of the way even when there's no where to go. Drinks are the typical Vegas prices, $10 for a corona and $18 for a Pineapple Tito's. 
Excited to see Kaskade Joining Hakkasan group, looking forward to see who else they sign for the 2017 season.
