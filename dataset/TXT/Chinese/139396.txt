QvEoE_oGwHPXvw5IylllNg I love Chinese food but this place is not great.  It is a bit dirty and I think the food is way over priced for the quality you are getting.  They have a couple of good things on their menu but for the most part I drive a ways to get better food.  They need to clean it up and get the quality under control.
