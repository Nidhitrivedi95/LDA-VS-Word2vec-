BIMICEFM917JQwi5l4q6Gw My family and I all ordered different dishes again this evening, and they were all great! Our order even included a few complimentary items for sampling that we will definitely order in the future. Anyone utilizing the yelp app to decide whether or not you want to try a place based on reviews don't let any commentary left by a person by the name of jeff c dissuade you this guy thinks he knows more about the restaurant business than anyone and alot of his posts are ignorantly written and spiteful,  just click on his name and click on more about him and read not only his posts but why you should read his post answer, and I quote," because I know more about the restaurant business than you do" JOKE. Don't let the the self absorbed biased reviews of one fool change your mind about your dining preference unlike him you have a brain try chef panda and decide for yourself you won't be sorry.
