zbFtY82_ummK4amkT-M04Q We came here for dinner tonight.  They have completely renovated the place and the restaurant looks nice.  

We passed on the set meals and ordered a la carte, instead.  We got black bean snails, garlic pork ribs, chicken livers with cauliflower, chive flower with mixed meats and halibut head in broth.  The dishes are really small and not really good.  The black bean sauce was too gloopy and the dishes were a tad too sweet.  You are paying a lot for each dish and sometimes you want quality over quantity.  But here you don't get quality or quantity.  You're basically paying a premium for the renovations.  
The menu is a mish mash of Cantonese, Sichuan and Fujinese cuisines.  Maybe one style might be decent but what we ordered wasn't that great.  

They have a lot of seafood set dinners, maybe they are better.  The washrooms are in the basement and there's also a karaoke/vip room downstairs too.  Not somewhere that I would frequent again, my kids said that they'd prefer to go north a bit  and queue up at Dong Kee instead.
