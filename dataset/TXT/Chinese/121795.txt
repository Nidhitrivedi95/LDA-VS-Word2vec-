oAngC9V69vyzBVYwKEJQaw 6/29/2017  Stopped in for lunch.  I ordered a small cup of Hot & Sour Soup ($3.00) and the Lunch Special Kung Pao ($6.95).  The soup was really good and I was surprised at the large portion of Kung Pao, which was good as well.  I had a fountain diet Coke ($1.50) which was refilled 3 times and my bill was $12.20.  The place was clean, I was waited on immediately and was impressed with the food and saw many orders to go that impressed me with the large portions they served.  I highly recommend this place and would have given it 5 stars if the people serving me had smiles on their faces.  The service was good but the lack of "enthusiasm" and smiles gave me the sense that people were not happy.  This place should do well if people give them a try.
