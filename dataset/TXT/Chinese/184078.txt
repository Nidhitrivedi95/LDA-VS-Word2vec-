XUIr1V4H5NUesEgeHGrQVw I couldn't be happier with Ilumina Healing. Dana and her team are fantastic. I am now 4 1/2 months pregnant (with her help!) and continue to see her regularly. Every time I come in, we address whatever issue I am dealing with that day. From a simple headache to swelling feet to congestion. She adapts each treatment to suit my specific need on that specific day. In addition to me being completely ZEN! Every time I leave there I am completely restored! 

I would recommend anyone and everyone to Ilumina Healing!
