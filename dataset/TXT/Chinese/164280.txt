UUtWoDyREiy9MPdtTRFUYQ Great, freshly made dishes, excellent service (almost too much attention, if that's possible!), and right by the AMC theater in Deer Valley. Come by 5:30pm and you won't have to wait for a table. No patio, unfortunately, but clean, casual dining room. They seem to have a very busy takeout business too!
