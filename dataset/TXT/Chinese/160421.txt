When your hungover as F*#K and in caesars palace this is the place to go to get some hot soup to cure that hangover! been here many times cause im way to hung over to go anywhere and room service doesn't have what you need. soup, noodles everywhere, if your looking for it they probably have it, chinese noodles and soup and chinese food only though (THEY NEED TO SERVE PHO) but anyways i always start with the chinese breadsticks or donut?! than won ton soup with egg noodles cant go wrong, they def use out of the packet egg noodle but its still good, i haven't had any problems with food here but the service is pretty bad; you order, get your food and thats it you will not see your server till your ready to pay? weird or coincidence? Anyways i only go here when im hungover so i cant really give the best rating but so far ive had a decent experience so nothing bad to say here
