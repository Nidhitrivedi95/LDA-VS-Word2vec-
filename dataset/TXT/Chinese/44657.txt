There is some lack of English on the menu and service part but just try to point things out from the pictures if you can't read Chinese. For the Chongqing style noodle, you can add more toppings for 1 to 2 dollars each, and the best part is you can top up the noodles for free! AND UNLIMTED as long as you can eat it! The soup base is simple but superb! And if you can eat SUPER spicy just add some serious spice as well.  Noodles had a good texture, and the rest of the toppings like cilantro, meat, egg, peanuts all came together.

If the Chinatown or Scarborough location is too far I heard they just opened a new one in North York.
