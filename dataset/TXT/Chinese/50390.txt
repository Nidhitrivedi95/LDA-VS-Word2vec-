cEU4IbCouZ1IFwURJKRJRQ Went back for lunch, had the Panag Curry combo (shrimp, chicken, beef) spice level 1, absolutely delicious!
Also had the Roti bread, well worth the extra cost, DELICIOUS with the curry, I could eat it all day.
The curry has a great depth of flavor. The shrimp marinated in the curry is SOOOO good.
I love this place.
