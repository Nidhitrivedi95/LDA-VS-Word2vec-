iiVeHbqOWMuKeUQz7ks71A To all my yelp friends and Las Vegas friends and family. Do not eat at Golden China off of E Flamingo.  My coworkers and I want to eat at Golden China. Which was fried rice,chow mein noodle, 3 Tara Boba. Once we received our food we began to drink our boba.  Which taste like artificial flavors and tasted like they added some kind of powder.  We tasted it again just to see if it was playing treats on us and HELL TO THE NO.. it was so nasty... I have wasted 5.00 on each boba.  We called to see we are able to get a refund of our money back.  That would be a HELL NO per Vicky. Then she transfered me to a male who wouldn't provide his name. He told me No to returning the boba and that is it not like food to receive a refund.  I said excuse me we all paid cash and we should get our money back for poor service and nasty BOBA. He then hung up on me.  I called back and asked for the Manager and got hung up on again.  I called back and got Vicky and she gave me the managers name which is Peter and wouldn't provide me the males name. Telling me I dont know his name or nor sure.  I said you are working with him and you dont know his name. What ever I'll call back later date and time.  If you food,drink and etc is not applying to the customer you should refund then their money back with no excuses.
