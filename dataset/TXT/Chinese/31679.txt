9sbXPpRC_wDhCsp7qG2PDw Live Coackroach on top of my plate of food, absolutely discussing.   When i told the waitress about it, she laughs and said she will bring another plate.   Service is terrible.  everything smells poor hygiene and sloppy.  Everything is sticky...menu, table, chair, dishes, soup spoon, etc.  The floor looks like it hasn't been mopped in years.
