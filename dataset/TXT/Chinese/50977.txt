Being from Vancouver, I could be clouded by the chinese food there. Prices were average with the classic woks at $10.99 to $13.99 with entrees being around $18. Portion size for the lunches were pretty good and the service was decent. Too bad it wasn't better in overall quality.

Go for: quick seating

Don't go for: good food
