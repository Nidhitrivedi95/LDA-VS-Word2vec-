ijY4C4ut4M9xg3QvK2R2pg Very solid dim sum experience.  Not as good as Hong Kong, New York or California, but I was impressed by the variety for Cleveland.  I went at 10:30am on a Sunday, and the majority of the items weren't out yet.  They came around with the roast duck and pig after we were almost done.

The service is quick and attentive.  The flavors are good.  My favorites were the pork filled taro croquette, the turnip cake, and the shu mai.  My usual favorite--the char siu bao weren't as filled as I'm used to.  I didn't get a chance to have the chicken feet, but they looked the way they're supposed to.

Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll make it a point to go back.
