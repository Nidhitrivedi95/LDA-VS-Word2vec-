I_a74zmgR-X03LsKISWPcg Loved this place. I ordered the Taro with condensed milk and fresh strawberries. It was too die for. Definitely want to come back to try everything at least once on their menu. The decoration inside was nice. Lots of artwork, big screen TV's featuring some sort of Asian movie, local business cards. I met the owner as he was taking orders & he was kind and friendly. The atmosphere is more hipsterish than I what I like, but the shaved ice here is so delicious that it definitely doesn't even matter. Highly recommend this place to everyone.
