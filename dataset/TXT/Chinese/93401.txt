J_btDyZbIv0hZNjrw56zlA Really dissapointed today. Came here with family and it was packed as usual. Wait wasn't too long but was cramped near high traffic hallway where they serve food and little seats without back supports. 

The free soup was very bland... supposedly boiled with corn and meat. There were corn cobs present but a weird super small piece of shred pork. We ordered fried oyster and it was $18 for 8 small, non crispy on the verge of soft, battered oysters. Flavorless or over killed saltiness when you use some of the salt that it comes with. The varied spice fried pork chop was very salty as well and on the verge of burnt as one can tell from the colour. The "ong" choy had a pretty decent cook but they missed that we ordered it with beef and not plain. We had a fresh fish that was braised in a thick sauce with mushrooms and veggies. Not bad...broth was savory and rich, but fish seemed small for almost $40. Didn't try their dessert soup since it had PEANUTS in it. :'(

Used to be better before in my memory or maybe because today was too busy.
