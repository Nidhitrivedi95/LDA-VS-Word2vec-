6sATfFam9_q9uod0I2aCsg I came here for dinner... i will keep it short.

It is expensive yes.  they spent a lot on renovation... its definately on the higher end side of Chinese dining.

I have been to a few vegetarian restaurants and usually portions are small.
I was shocked to see that the portions were large here.  Presentation is nice and most of all service was very attentive and proper.  

it felt very unusual because i am use to asian places with crappy service.  

with typical vegetarian places serving "mock meats"  the waitress told us that they do not do this.. and that there are no simulated meats here.. instead, they use vegetarian options and create whole new unique dishes.

i did find it a bit oily.  taste was a tad bland for my liking...  overall.. 3/5 due to the high prices..
