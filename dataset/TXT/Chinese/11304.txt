I've had their steak hibachi and shrimp hibachi and they are both pretty decent for not being cooked right in front of you!  The veggies seem fresh and not over cooked and they give you a good helping of shrimp sauce to pour over everything (well, I like to pour it over everything)!  

We've also had their Chinese dishes and they are pretty decent too!  Crab Rangoon is excellent and I prefer the form they use (or order because I'm sure it's not made from scratch at the restaurant) which is the triangle shaped pods.  Other places use the "purse form" and those aren't as easy to eat than the pods!  Cashew chicken is good and sweet and sour chicken is good too!

The food is always steaming hot when I get home and I live about 10 minutes away!

Asian One has turned into our go-to Chinese take out place so I hope it's here to stay!
