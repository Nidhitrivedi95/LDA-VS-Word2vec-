YkAIlxYZ1guSqbbowU9X4g The quality and taste of the food is average in comparison to those served in the greater Toronto or downtown Toronto.  While the decor and service is better than average Chinese restaurants, it is hard to justify for the prices that this restaurant charges. 

Of note, the Luckee duck (peking duck) was a smallish dish that had duck pieces cut poorly (ie. instead of having mostly sliced crispy skin, its skin + fat + meat cut perpendicularly like at meat shops).  The sesame donut was not cooked properly and had areas that were rock hard solid.  

Not impressed....  There are so many better choices at half the price.
