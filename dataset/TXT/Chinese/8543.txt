1HplwLVbBid-Bgw1sEPGFg ordered some food off of justeat.ca, after ordering a decent amount of food, i found myself not liking any of it. the flavor combinations were weird at best, or just plain. the wraps promoted pancakes in them? had it, no pancakes in mine, as well the wrap came delivered in four pieces and soggy. the chicken fried rice was extremely plain, as if they just took plain white rice, some chicken, some corn and peas, and threw it into the same bowl. every time that ive ordered on justeat.ca this place pops up and offers a 20% off over 35$, i would gladly pay the extra 20% for some flavor. highly disappointed. wont order again.
