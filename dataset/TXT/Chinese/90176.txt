IDW4QFw-fN_wk81G9OV-Mg For some time now since i been living in the area i have been seeing this place and was always tempted to go but i knew  i had no intrest of nothing but noodles because i needed some kind of meat. Low and behold to my suprise you can add any meats and vegetables to the different types of noodles they serve. I had the pomodoro pasta and added chicken to mines.Nothing spactacular or to rave about but i would go back to try out other dishes.I myself was probly more in love with the breadstick than the actual dish. I also had the salted carmel cookie which i am a fan of the cookie maybe next time ill try one of the others they offer.
