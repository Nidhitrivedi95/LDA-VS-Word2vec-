pH0BLkL4cbxKzu471VZnuA upon dining, I was a bit skeptical to see how this would turn out. I've never had Brazilian/Japanese/Peruvian fusion food before. 

when I arrived the hostesses Jade and Heather gave me an option to do either a table or happy hour at the bar. happy hour at 12am? why not. 

I seated myself at the bar and was helped by Mimi and eric. I was pleased to see how fast they accommodated me and my girlfriend even though the bar was full. I ordered with my eyes (maybe the whole entire happy hour menu) and to my surprise each dish I ordered, with ingredients I've never tried before, were beyond what I expected. 

The manager Yaz sent out complimentary dishes because I was a local. love an establishment that recognizes their locals! the bartenders, runners, hostesses, and the manager treated me exceptionally even though I was a first timer here. anyway, long review short. sushi samba exceeded my expectations, blew me away, and impressed. 

items ordered:
chili mint rock shrimp
pork belly sliders 
yellowtail tiradito
salt & pepper squid
samba fries
yellowtail taquitos
Kobe beef taquitos
and as for liquor, the "caipirinha" 
complimentary dish from Yas, the "crispy Hokkaido scallop" 

thank you sushi samba for opening for my taste buds to Brazilian & Japanese fusion! sushi samba will not disappoint.
