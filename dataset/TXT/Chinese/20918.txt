The skin kinda creeps me out, but I think that is my own issue. I'm not deducting any stars because the food is too good and I think this is just a personal preference. The chicken was good and flavorful and I easily ate the whole dish. I really like the various sauces they give you to mix and match. Definitely some very interesting flavors. 

The absolute standout was the grilled chicken tender Bao. The chicken was amazing. So good! I'm not much for those little sticky buns, but I do see why people love them. I really liked the extras that go along with it. Next time I going to try the grilled chicken tender Hainan rice. That might be my sweet spot! 

I also tried a very good oolong ice tea. Customer service is great. Staff seems very friendly and like she personally cares if you enjoy your food. I'll definitely be back to try some other items.
