jfmyj519pg2flxGEQ2xdPg Good Chinese food is hard to find in Vegas so consider this your notice!  Joyful house is delicious flavor is 8/10 customer service 7/10 and the fact that they don't close til 3am in a 24 hr city gives them bonus points. For the most part I only go here for Chinese food. I recommend the salt and pepper shrimp (shells on) and the roasted duck, never dry! Can't say I'm surprised they have so many awards bestowed upon the restaurant. I appreciate consistency.
