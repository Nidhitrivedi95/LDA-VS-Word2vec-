I come to this restaurant for tea time at least once a week that is until last month. I got the instant noodle with beef and a cold lemon tea. I believe she is the owner of the place had the usual poor customer service and the food quality started to go downhill. Their food menu has been the same since they have opened. This is a restaurant that does not follow the trend.
