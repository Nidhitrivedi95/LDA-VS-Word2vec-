QlAPX3c0Vm2dU_w3puIAIw Amazing place with friendly helpful staff! I've never had a hot pot before but as a lover of Pho I had to try this place! The veggies are fresh and the broth was on point! I'll definitely be back!!! Happy I found this place to eat at while working in Madison! If you're even thinking about this place as an option just try it you'll thank me!
