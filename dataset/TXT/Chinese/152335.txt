T30RkAqYAtljfapSghHA1Q Food from my past (continued)

This is one of those small mom and pop places that has been around for many years yet most people do not know that it even exist. I used to live in the area  when I was a kid and after a trip here recently I find that somethings do not change. The family that owns this place has been cranking out affordable yet great tasting food for three generations now. That is over 30 years experience in a building the size of a bedroom. 

With that tradition comes pride in the service, and food they serve. No this is not P.F. Chang's (over rated and not really that good in my opinion) or one of those nasty buffets that make you wish you had just decided to eat at home. No, this is great food the way it is supposed to be. Calling this stuff good would be an understatement. It is more like additive! Not sure of what they put in it but one bite and you will be hooked LOL. Seriously try the shrimp or pork fried rice and you will be going from a pint (their smallest size) to a quart (their largest) of the stuff. 

They also serve sweet and sour chicken, egg foo young, three types of soup, egg rolls and Pepsi to drink (sorry no coke products here). Also since this is a small mom and pop place I do not remember them excepting credit or debit cards so bring cash. They are not expensive a $20 should buy more than enough for a family to eat and leave you will a few dollars in your pocket. The thing that makes this place great is that they are family owned meaning that dad is in the back cooking up your order while the oldest son watches and chops the veggies. The mom is still in the front taking orders from customers then yelling them to the back while the younger son does his homework or is told to go and sweep out in front of the store.

With all the chain places popping up these rare gems are becoming harder to find. They represent hard work, dedication, and in my case the past. Support them.
