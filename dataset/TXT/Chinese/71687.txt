fcWkZgmzRsm3H4egzSrV_A We decided to come here for Dim Sum because my friend was informed by Rio that there would be a 25% total rewards discount for all restaurants in their hotel. After we received the bill she was told that the 25% does not apply, although the hotel still continues to tell people that it does. Instead of making the effort to check with the hotel about correcting the information that they are giving guests they continued to argue with my friend and refused to give her any kind of discount. Although the food was pretty good and the carts came around continuously, the meal ended on a sour note because of the argument..
