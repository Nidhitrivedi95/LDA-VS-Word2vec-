First time having my favorite Glass noodle salad here but it was overly salty and had barely any noodles, mostly cilantro, onions and romaine. This dish is bigger AND better at Panna down the street. Our waitress was rushing us to order even though there was only one other table. Then our main dishes came out separately so two of us were eating while the others were still sitting 20 mins without food. We asked to cancel the orders because it was taking too long and we had to get back. The waitress kept telling us the food was almost ready but we'd lost our appetite and our time at this point. She was quick to take our payment however. Smh.
