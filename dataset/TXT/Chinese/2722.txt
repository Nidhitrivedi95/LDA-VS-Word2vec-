_gMR_YdsMwwKy63-UwjdnA I'm glad that there is a Ohana that opened up near my house. They opened up right next to Taste. Ohana and Taste are actually owned by the same people, which is why there's a door connecting the two inside the establishments. 

I don't usually go to Ohana because I'm not a fan of Hawaiian styled food. I actually only come here if I want some wonton noodle soup. But when you order it, be sure to use the wording they have on their menu. Apparently the cashier can get easily confused. 

They give you a good amount of wontons with the dish ... I think like 8 of them. Each wonton is filled with shrimp goodness. I would actually prefer if there was more pork in there but that is fine. I usually take it to go because I like the chili oil I have at home :D I use a generous spoonful of chili oil and it tastes amazing! Their noodles are cooked perfectly with the right amount of firmness and chew! 

Perfect place for some wonton noodle soup. I don't have to trek over to Chinatown for the dishes.
