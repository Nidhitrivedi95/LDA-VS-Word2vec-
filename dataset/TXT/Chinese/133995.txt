Q-HDnjHCywb65thAB-f0nw I don't hold my chinese food to a high standard, but I tend to  judge it exclusively on the quality of the crab rangoon. I had high hopes that this might be my Las Vegas chinese take out restaurant, sadly, I was extremely disappointed. There was barely any filling in the crab rangoon, and what I had left was deep fried crunchy puffs. No cream cheese. No crab. It ruined my dinner. 

I might be forgiving if the General Tso's chicken was yummy, saucy, guilty pleasure goodness, but it kind of reminded me of the the frozen General Tso's chicken you can buy at the grocery store and bake in your oven. 

As a final bonus disappointment, they do not have brown rice as an option. 

I will continue to search for my local chinese go to spot.
