QDJBn7I1EdtP9w4nYT24Pw Great little mom and pop place with friendly staff, great prices, fast delivery and pretty tasty traditional Chinese food. I mean, this isn't fine dining, it's a local neighborhood joint. It's solid, fast and inexpensive.

And it's 1000x better than a couple other places that Phoenicians rave about (see prior reviews)
