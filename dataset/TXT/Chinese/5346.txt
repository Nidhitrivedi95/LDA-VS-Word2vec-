I live in the area and have frequented The Prime Chinese Restaurant many times. The place is great for lunch and dinner. The serving sized are very large. And the meals are delicious. I recommend the vegetable egg foo young. The service here is very good. You will most likely be greeted by an older Asian woman. She owns the place and is so friendly. I work in marketing and SEO so I offered to help them with getting some more exposure but she seemed doubtful that they would be in business come the new year. 

Please check this local business out! They treat their customers with the utmost appreciation and respect. It would be sad to see a business that has been there for 21 YEARS go out of business. 

Pros: 
- great food
- large servings
- awesome service
- decent wait times
- quiet atmosphere

Cons
- not exactly cheap
- needs better decorating touch
