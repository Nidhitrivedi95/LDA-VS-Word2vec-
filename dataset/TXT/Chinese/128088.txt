PEulzjDwcSL_ujv5mRbc4w So we waited until the Re-Birth of New York Wok under New Management 

Restaurant layout. .. Has more seating and they stream lined the counter. Moved the soda fridge by kitchen. 

So we had the order and waited, and waited

Food was hot....... And then the wheels fall off!
I love the food here and I have Lost that Loving Feelings 

My order of Kung Pao Two. ... About the strangest,  light on sauce, heavy on fishy Shrimp! Uncoated Chicken. TOO DAMN MANY VEGETABLES! !

My sons order General Tso Chicken NOTHOT. ..
WAS HOT. ... GREASY, STRANG  CONSISTENCY. .

THEY HAVE COMBINATION. ..hot to fet them is a Ancient Chinese Secret. 

My wife asked if the Sweet and Sour Shrimp was heavily coated... They  brought out a very nice Butterflied Shrimp with a perfect amount of a tasty Tempora coating. 

I have to say today was a sad, sad, sad day.

I thought long and hard and decided. .Its time for ua to Cook Chinese. I have several recipes and only need a few things. Thanks to a strong Asian Restaurant Supply selection of places to buy.  I am sure we will find our Happy Asian Place.

Thanks for the poor food and inspiration to cook it My Damn Self.
