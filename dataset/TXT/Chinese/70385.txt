F3xksTtZUfanOcLQqJn0eQ Ordered the kung pao pork and a couple dim sum dumplings. Freaking loved the kung pao, some of the best I've had in a long time. To be fair, we were eating lunch at 4pm, so I was crazed with hunger. But I feel that even if we had been eating lunch at a normal time the meal still would have been great. The service was really fast, the food was tasty and plentiful - can't really ask for more. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Edinburgh.
