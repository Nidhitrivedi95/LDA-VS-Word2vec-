tz30FR-yQi-jNHPb7B-gBw P F stands for Pretty Fine.  I have been a fan since their inception in the 90's @ Scottsdale Fashion Square.  I love their Lunch Specials and Happy Hour options!  My fave go to is usually Kung Pao Shrimp-crunchy, succulent with a bit of spice.  Since I am a protein lover-I appreciate their generous portions of protein.  Happiness Hour always elevates my mood as well.  You can't beat the array of food and beverage deals-and they pour a generous glass of wine.  Service is always spot on-whether you are in a hurry or just want to chill-your meal is perfectly paced.  The patio is the perfect spot to people watch and take in fresh air when the weather cools.
