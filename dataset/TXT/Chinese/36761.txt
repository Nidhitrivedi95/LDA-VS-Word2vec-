AMkZ0TvxfVZfTOHuWTUaTw Alright.... If you love a good dive bar, and a dive bar with AMAZING chinese food, then this is your place! The jukebox is a huge hit here with people literally qeueing the song list for over 2 hours. It's a fun place with live music on occasion and a very friendly staff. They serve food until 2 am, something not found very often. Overall, this place is unique and is a great experience.
