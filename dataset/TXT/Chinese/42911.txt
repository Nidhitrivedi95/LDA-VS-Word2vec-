beuVp5CZxCdNvQIIPBS2rw Mongolian hot pot! It's pretty good compared to little fat sheep. It doesn't beat it but it holds its own. Meat quality is good and they have a station for sauces. There is a rolling conveyer belt that has different side dishes you can choose to your liking. 

First pick your soup base. There were five different types and you can choose up to two simultaneously. Then pick your choice of meat. Beef, lamb, and seafood. There's the typical vegetable sides as well. What I liked was if each person pays $1 more you can get different types of noodles. Green tea, tomato, and purple yam (I liked this the most).

Our server was James. He was attentive but not overbearing. Perfect amount for a waiter. He took his time to explain to us how it works and gave us good suggestions. 

You should check with them for half off prices or by one get one free and for student discounts. 

All in all, would I come back? Yes.
