y_3Csg19MnwCX8M_aMgMHA They were once good. I am not talking about the service of their wait staff. If you can tolerate waiters ignoring you or having to repeatedly request for things, then I congratulate you as I cannot - would not - allow my stress to take over my enjoyment of anything.

Their food was good (bordering the realm of 4-stars), but I would have to decline any invitation to return, as they have changed. Furthermore, the amount of MSG that I feel they use for their noodle soup broth is through the roof.
