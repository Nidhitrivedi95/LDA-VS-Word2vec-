x8O-Mll5ksDpeIgtA0XY-w A friend bought lunch for me here so I wasn't going to complain....I never pass up a free meal.

Typical asian buffet food experience, not too impressed.

The place is a bit janky, but I've seen worse.

Some one blew up the restroom....

I saw a BIG (emphasis on big) bald guy with his wife's purse around his neck pile up his plate with noodles for stir-fry...almost spoiled my appetite.

It's an okay hit-and-run place if you want to eat alot for lunch on the cheap, but that's about it.
