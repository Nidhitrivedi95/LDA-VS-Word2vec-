vYzcDDVv4MqPOt46rl2kYg Exceeded expectations!  Although atmosphere is very generic, the food was really good...  Big fan of Kung Pao Chicken and usually do not finish at other places because of excessive veggies and very little chicken.  Joe's had the perfect amount of chicken and veggies!  Delish!  I also like the fact that they cook to order right up front.  Will definitely be back!
