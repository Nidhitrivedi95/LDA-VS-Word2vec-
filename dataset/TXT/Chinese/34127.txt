AbQMlXCfWvMnNXADMaiMIw This was a very strange experience. The outside look of the restaurant is very sketchy but the decor isn't too bad. The two stars are mostly for the food and service - the sushi is really mushy, almost all of the food came to us cold and it took thirty minutes for each round of ordering. Their tea is also this cloudy mix of water and god knows what. All in all, will not be revisiting.
